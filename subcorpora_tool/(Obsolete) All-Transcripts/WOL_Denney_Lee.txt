Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Today is October 12, 2007. My name is Tanya Finchum, and we   re here  in the Angie Debo Room  in the library  on the OSU  Oklahoma State  University  campus to talk with Lee Denney, who is in the House of  Representatives, elected in 2004     Yes, ma   am.     and re-elected in 2006.  Yes.  She   s also an OSU alum and this is part of the oral history project  entitled    Women of the Oklahoma Legislature.    So thank you for joining  us.  It   s my pleasure. Glad to be here.  Okay, let   s start by having you tell us a little bit about your childhood,  where you were born.  Okay. I was born in Cushing, Oklahoma in 1953. I had an older sister  and a younger brother, and I kind of had a typical 1950   s childhood.  (Laughs) I had a stay-at-home mom and a dad in the insurance business,  and I walked to school   not uphill both ways (Laughs) but about just a  block and a half to a neighborhood school. I graduated from Cushing  High School in 1971 and then came to OSU in the fall of 1971, pursued  a bachelor   s degree in agricultural economics. Graduated with that in  1976 and then received my DVM  Doctor of Veterinary Medicine   degree from Oklahoma State University in 1978.  And you   ve been here ever since.  5  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Been here ever since.  When did you develop an interest in politics?  About 15 years ago. I had a good friend decide to run for this office  when it became an open seat on a special election, and she needed  someone to help run her campaign. I had no experience whatsoever, but  I told her I would sure help any way I could, and kind of got caught up  in the fever of it all and enjoyed helping her. We were not successful.  She was a republican candidate. We were not successful in getting her  elected to the House, but really developed an interest in possibly  sometime pursuing this on my own, after my children were raised. So  that was my first taste, and then once you mention that you   re interested  in politics, they don   t let you forget it. So about every two years, I   d  receive a call.    You ready to run?       You ready to run?       You ready to  run?    And finally when it became an open seat in 2004, I decided to  throw my hat in the ring.  And who was your campaign manager?  My campaign manager was Steve Crowder from Cushing   family  friend.  Did you have a particular strategy?  You know, I   d heard so many people say,    Well, if I get elected, I  promise to do this and promise to do that,    and after awhile I looked  around and I thought,    If I do get elected, I   ll be serving with a hundred  other people, and it   s kind of hard to make promises based on the votes  of a hundred other people.    So my strategy was just to say I wanted to  serve the people. I wanted to do the best job I could, and I would listen  to the people of the district. I would be accessible to the people of the  district. And so that was my strategy, initially. I didn   t really know what  to run on. That being said, I would have an open mind and a willingness  to serve.  And did you knock on every door?  I knocked on a whole bunch of doors. (Laughs) You know, it would be  facetious to say I certainly knocked on all of them, but we did a very  widespread campaign of door knocking in every precinct, and we tried  to hit every door that we possibly could. We tried to target republicans  in the primary and then we tried to target republicans and democrats in  the general.  Did you have a slogan?  6  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  I did. It was kind of funny. It was,    Lee Denney. She   s just like us.    And  of course I had children in college at the time, and OSU was in my area,  so when my kids    friends would get my fliers in the mail they would call  and say,    Well, your mom says she   s just like us.    And so the kids  thought it was pretty humorous that here this 40-some-odd woman     actually 50-year-old woman was trying to be just like them. So that was  my slogan. I wanted people to think I was just an ordinary person  wanting to serve in the government. No pretentions   nothing, just  wanting to serve in the government. So that was kind of my tact to the  thing.  Did your kids help campaign?  My kids did help campaign, very much so. They were willing to don  shirts, and they would go with me to different events such as football  games and fairs and help pass out fliers. And, of course, they were  willing to be on my campaign literature, too, so it was a whole family     and my husband really helped. I could not find a better person in the  entire state to support me in this effort. He is an amazing man, and he  was a tireless worker, and no one had a better sign    putter-upper    than I  did. (Laughs) He canvassed the entire district putting up my signs. Yes, I  had a lot of support.  And did he go back and take them down after you won?  And he took them down. It was very important to him to have them  down within 48 hours, over the entire district, after the race. So he  worked very hard. It was a challenge, and he worked very hard   got up  early in the morning and started taking down those signs.  What was election day and night like?  It was very nerve-racking. In some sense you had a calm because you   ve  done all you can and now it   s up to the voters, and so you kind of sit  back. But then the hours tick by so slowly, and then that last hour from  6:00 to 7:00, goes by very slow because you   re ready to go to different  precincts and start picking up your tabulations. Then even though you  start, you have a lead in some   because we started in Cushing picking  up precinct numbers and, of course, I   m from Cushing   my opponents  were not   you feel like you   ll do well in your hometown. It   s still very  nerve-racking as the numbers start being called in because we sent  people out to all precincts to pick up our numbers. Then you   re just  relieved that it   s over and elated that you were successful in winning.  Could you tell if you had more women voters?  7  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Can   t tell that   don   t know that. Don   t know any way to do that because  you vote anonymously. I guess you could, with computers now, you  probably could go back and see in the election, the people who voted,  you certainly can find that out because they have to sign when they vote.  So you probably could go back, but I haven   t done that but that would be  interesting. I need to do that   curious to do that. That   s a good point.  Well, what about the day you were sworn in?  We   re sworn in approximately ten days after we   re elected. November  15th is the day we   re sworn in each year. I was like a school girl. I know  I was just,    Oh, my gosh, what have I gotten myself into?    But you   re  able to invite your family and your campaign workers. The place is  literally filled, the gallery is filled, and there are no seats. And you   re  down on the floor, and you   re put in your predecessor   s seat at that  point, where the person you replaced sat. I replaced Dale West so I was  on the democrat side, which was fine.  I   d like to think of myself like a good moderate that leans to the right. So  I didn   t have any problem that day with where I was seated. I got to  meet some of the incoming democrats at that time. I think that makes  you a better legislator if you can work across the aisle because I think it  takes both sides to govern. So we were sworn in, and the Speaker of the  House is sworn in, and then you have an opportunity for the first time to  use the microphone on the desk and introduce your family and anyone  else you brought. It was really exciting because that first time I did have  all my family   my mom and my husband and my two children with  me   and it was very exciting.  Goosebumps?  Very exciting and very humbling that the people would give you that  opportunity to serve.  Well, do you ever walk up the big steps into the building?  You know, we   re not allowed to do that anymore. That exit was totally  closed off after 9/11. So, no, I   ve never done that to be quite honest. We  go in the side entrances. They   re handicap-accessible for the people of  Oklahoma. I think they felt like they had to secure the Capitol a little  more. It probably actually started back on April 19, 1995 with the  Oklahoma City bombing, but that entrance is totally closed off so I   ve  never gotten to do that. But I   ve stood at the top of them several times. It  would have been exciting to be at the Capitol at a time when those were  open, but they   re closed at this time.  8  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  And thoughts going through your head that first day?     I hope I   m up to this job,    (Laughs) because it is an awesome  responsibility, and I take it very seriously. From any constituent in the  35,000 people that I represent, I want to be their voice at the Capitol and  I want to do what they want at the Capitol. And at the same time I want  to help make all the government agencies in the state of Oklahoma  accessible to them. So that   s how I see my position and I did, I had a  lump in my throat and wide-eyed.  How about the first day you presented a bill on the floor?  I was very nervous. (Laughs) You get all these pointers from seasoned  legislators. And we were the first really big class to come in from term  limits. There were, I think, a total of 34 new legislators the year I came  in, on both sides, and so they were very nervous about what to do. That   s  a third of the legislature so they were very nervous about what to do  with us. They did a very good job of doing a lot of different orientations  for us and trying to make us feel as comfortable as we could. They  assigned mentors to us. Older members became our mentors to help us  through the process.  My very first bill had on it, at the bottom, a    repealer      and I had  someone say,    Be sure and look up your repealer because a seasoned  member might try to trick you up on that.    So my very first bill I had  highlighted and I   d looked up the repealer to make sure, and so I was  prepared, which was good. It   s very good to go in there being prepared  because there is no telling what you   ll get asked and it   s open market. So  it went really well, and I was asked about the repealer so I was very glad  that I was schooled on the repealer, and it passed.  And the same for a debate   the first time you debated one?  My first year I don   t really think I had a debate and I think I went  through and went,    Whew, no debates.    But since that time, I find that I  don   t have trouble with debates. I thought I would. I thought I would be  very scared in case somebody got into attack mode. I thought I   d be very  nervous. But really, it   s very friendly. You know, it is very friendly no  matter who   s debating you. I   ve been debating with people from my  own party and people from the other party, and both times, if you   re  studied when you go in there, you   ll do just fine in debates because  you   re more schooled on your topic than they are. So they can ask you  questions. I find I   m getting very comfortable at doing that. I   ve had  teenagers. (Laughs) That helps.  Describe a typical day then. How early do you get up and how late do  9  Denney  Finchum  Denney  you stay up and     Well, during session, a typical day   I   m a pretty early riser. I always  have been. I used to always get up at 6:00 and now I find myself getting  up at 5:30. I like to just break into a day pretty easily, so I like to get up  early and be ready. I like to arrive at the Capitol between 7:30 and 8:00,  and that   s before our assistants get there. I just like to get there first  because I like some alone time to kind of get my desk situated the way I  want and the papers I   ll need, the bills that we   re going to hear, and just  kind of get organized. I   ve found once 8:30 hits, there   s not much time  for that. So I like to get there early, and my assistant arrives about 8:30  and then people start arriving about 8:30 or 8:45. I think they think that   s  the best time to get in to see legislators.  We don   t go on to the floor until Monday at 1:00, so Monday morning  anyone that wants to see you about your bills   constituents, businesses,  agencies   will make those appointments at that time. And pretty much  you can put a revolving door on the front of your office because you   re  pretty busy that Monday morning with people getting in to see you  because they know you   ll go on to the floor in the afternoon. And then  we have our separate caucus meetings at noon. Both the democrats and  the republicans meet separately for about an hour to discuss what the  agenda of the week is going to be, and then we go into session about  1:00 or 1:30 on Monday. We always start with a prayer, and we have a  minister of the week   every week, who prays with us every day, and  then Monday we start with a flag salute, and then we recognize a veteran  of the week, and then we start into our work.  The first couple of weeks of session are pretty slow because all the bills  are in committee. They have to go through the committee process before  they can come out onto the floor so the first couple of weeks on the floor  activity is very minimal. And then Tuesday we are on the floor all day  and Wednesday we are on the floor all day. And then late Tuesday and  Wednesday afternoon we have committee meetings, and they   re  scheduled so if you   re on more than one committee you may attend all  your committee meetings. And then Thursday we have session in the  morning until noon and then Thursday afternoon we have committee  meetings. And Fridays we   re supposed to come back into our district  and work in our district, and that   s when we meet with people that are  unable to come to the Capitol or larger groups of people or people who  have jobs. That   s when we work in our district and meet with people to  hear the concerns of what   s going on in the district.  Do you live there during session or do you     I do stay down there. My first year, I did not. I drove back and forth and  10  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  it   s just so tiring all those miles   an hour down, an hour back   and then  gas prices now are so high. I just think it   s more responsible to stay  down there. I have a friend that has a pool house behind her home, and I  stay in her pool house. Everybody has a wide variety of living  accommodations down there. You   ll see everything. Some people have  bought condos and stay down there. The Denneys did not do that.  (Laughs) I live in a pool house but it   s very comfortable. I have a bed, a  bathroom and a place to work and read my bills and such as that, so it   s  very comfortable.  And you probably don   t need to worry about cooking facilities and that  sort of thing?  No, you really don   t worry about that too much. If I have a microwave  I   m good to go. There   s so much food around the Capitol. I was one  person that did not need an eating job. There   s a lot of food around the  Capitol so at night you   re really not all that hungry. A little bit of  popcorn or cereal is all you need.  So you   re usually done with work by 8:00, 9:00 at night during session?  It varies   6:00 to 8:00 I would say. Early in the session before we get  going heavy on bills, you   re usually out by 6:00 or 6:30. But we do have  a couple weeks in there where we   ve been in the chamber as late as  11:30 or 12:00. There is a ruling that we have to leave the chamber by  midnight, so we can   t stay in all night. They used to. I think in the 40   s  and 50   s, they would have those all-night sessions. I think they realized  when you   re so tired you   re not making good decisions for the people of  Oklahoma. So they put a cap on it that we have to adjourn by midnight.  Do you have a bill that you   re most proud of to this point?  Yes, I have two I   d say I   m most proud of. My first year a more  seasoned legislator handed me a bill on nursing homes and quality in  nursing homes. Again, I was fairly green and just didn   t realize what a  problem we had in this state with quality nursing home care for our  elderly. I ran that bill, and it just gives people a way to have their  complaints, when they have a loved one in a nursing home, heard in a  timely manner. These complaints would go on for two or three years,  and usually the loved one had already passed away. We   re talking about  elderly here. They would drag these complaints out and nothing was  being done and we sped up the process and made it more timely. So  people, if they felt like their loved ones were being abused in nursing  homes, they could get some relief. I   m very proud of that because I think  it was a big need.  11  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  And then this past year we did the legislation to start a Rise School here  at Oklahoma State University, and I   m very excited about that. It   s a  developmental preschool for developmentally-delayed children,  basically Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida, and it allows them to be as  caught up as they can when they become ready for school. I just think  it   s phenomenal that we will do something for this segment of the  population and make them the most productive citizens they can be  instead of just sticking them away somewhere in some sort of institution.  It gets underway this fall   well, actually Monday I believe. October 15th  is our first day and I   m very excited about that. An OSU coach, Coach  Gonzales, and his wife, Mary, and their little daughter, Mya, brought  that to my attention, and I was very excited to work with them on that  project.  Any you   re disappointed in that didn   t get quite through?  You know, yes, of course. I am a big fan of the Oklahoma School of  Science and Mathematics  OSSM  sites at the regional centers. I   ve  worked a couple of times on trying to get a second year added for our  rural kids so they can stay at home and yet get the beefed-up curriculum  at these regional centers, and we haven   t gotten that done yet but I   m not  going to give up. I   m going to continue to work to try to improve those  OSSM sites at the regional centers, at our CareerTech centers. I just  think it   s a great, great program. I think it   s great for rural kids that want  to stay active in their local FFA  Future Farmers of America  or local  athletics or anything they want to stay active in their home high schools,  and yet get the beefed-up curriculum where the small schools don   t have  to hire the higher level science and math teachers. I think it   s a win/win,  and I   ll continue to work to beef up those programs.  You   ve got about eight more years to do that?  I hope so. Are the people of District 33 willing to send me back? That   s  sure my hope.  Do you have a particular political philosophy?  Well, again, I come down on the more conservative side, but I certainly  can look at myself as what   s called a centrist-right. So I do believe in  lower taxes for hard working people, less government programs   make  the government more responsible to the people and do the best we can  with their dollar. So I fall down on the conservative side there and  always protecting life.  Do you have a mentor, besides the one that you had, once you got in?  12  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  I certainly have. I couldn   t do this without several mentors. Susan  Winchester in the House. She   s one of the ones that talked me into  running, and she   s mentored me all the way. I knew her before I got in  the House so it was a real easy cohesive bond. And then once I got there,  Odilia Dank, who was in her last term my first term, but she certainly  mentored me in every possible way. We were a small caucus. We only  had 12 women in our caucus. We did have a women   s caucus, and now  we only have nine, so we lost some women along the way. And then  Lisa Billy from Purcell came in when I did but certainly someone that  we bounced ideas, and such as that, off each other as we   ve gone down  the way. My desk mate, Thad Balkman, mentored me a lot. Greg Piatt  from Ardmore mentored me. Speaker Todd Hiett, he was only there my  first term but he was a fantastic mentor along the way. So I   ve had some  good mentors.  And where is your office?  My office now is on the fourth floor, 436.  Where was it before?  335 on the third floor. I didn   t mind the third floor office. I was right by  a back staircase so I could shoot up to the chamber. But it is nice being  on the same floor as the chamber, to pop in and out to see constituents.  We are able to be pulled off the floor if someone needs to see us, but we  do need to shoot back in when it   s time to vote. So I have a pretty good  location right now.  I understand they change with every     We change every two years. We do, and boy that is a mess. They   re  actually re-doing some of the offices now. They haven   t done them for  oh, I think probably about 50 years. We did have a hodgepodge of  furnishings and stained carpet. My first carpet sounded like it had bubble  wrap underneath it when you walked across the floor. So they   re trying  to update the offices. My assistant has packed up my office three times,  this new office, for carpet and furniture and painting and now they   re  going to put new ceiling tile in, so he feels like he   s a master packer.  So it   s a    he?     I do have a male assistant this year.  Are there very many male assistants?  You know, there   s really starting to be. I think there   s five or six.  13  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Out of?  Well, probably out of   close to 100, not quite. There   s a couple who  share assistants. There are offices that share assistants, so close to 100.  There   s five or six. He is a college student. My daughter asked me to  interview him. He was graduating with a public relations degree and he  was unsure of what he wanted to do and initially about a five-month job  seemed to suit him pretty well. He   s done a good job, and he   s been with  me now right at a year and he   ll stay with me through this next session.  He   s thinking about law school now so I   ll probably lose him next  summer, but he   s been very good.  So you may be a mentor yourself?  May be, hope so. I hope I   m rubbing off on him. We   re good for each  other. He   s young and young people are so good with technology. I   ve  actually had three fairly young assistants, and it   s been amazing what  they can do on that computer, so I have learned from them. I definitely  have.  Once you were in, did you notice any differences in gender treatment?  You know, you do. It   s probably one of the old bastions. It   s changing,  but it   s probably one of the old bastions   male bastions   and probably  white male bastions. To me, it   s like going to vet school back in the  70   s, it kind of is. So I   m kind of used to that environment because that   s  the way I was schooled. But they   re very open to women, and I don   t  want to say they   re not. Just like I said, there   s only nine women on the  republican side and only three on the democrat side. So we just have 12  total women   so, of course, it   s going to be a male bastion.  Minorities, I think there are 13 Native Americans. There are only three  African Americans in the House of Representatives right now. I don   t  really know the demographics of the Senate as well. So it is a male white  bastion, but they are open to our ideas and we   re given leadership roles.  I do look forward to the first woman Speaker. Now we have had a  Speaker Pro Tempore woman. In 2004, Susan Winchester was the  Speaker Pro Tempore. And then, at the same time, on the democrat side,  the Minority Leader was a woman   our Jari Askins, who is now our  Lieutenant Governor. And had the democrats been in the majority, we  would have had our first female speaker. So it   s coming, but it   s slow in  coming, and I look forward to it. I hope I   m still there when we have a  female Speaker of the House.  Could be you.  14  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  It could be   don   t know about that, but it could be.  What advice would you give women that are considering going into  politics?  I say, go for it. You know, now with term limits   and I tell this to high  school kids and college students when they come through on tours. I  would like to see the House of Representatives be representative of  Oklahoma and its population, and we   re not near that. I know we   re  more than three percent African American in this state, and we   re  definitely more than 12 or 13 percent African American and 12 or 13  percent women   and so the House of Representatives needs to reflect  that. So now with term limits, I think that you can carve out a period of  time in your life and serve the State of Oklahoma.  So I try to encourage women   and you come from all walks of life. I  think people think you have to be a political science major to serve in  the House, but that   s simply not true. In fact, very few political science  majors are in the House. We have all walks of life. I myself am a  veterinarian. We have teachers, real estate agents. We have a doctor. We  have a dentist. We have a toy manager from Wal-Mart. We have an  artist. We have a man who drives the    Giddy-up bus    at the airport in his  off-time and, of course, we have our share of lawyers. It   s a cross-section  of the population, so I would like to encourage women to serve  in the House of Representatives. I think it   s very friendly. We just  haven   t gotten there yet.  So do you know if you   re the only veterinarian ever?  I   m not the only veterinarian ever. I am one of the first veterinarians. I  came in with Dr. Phil Richardson, who is also a veterinarian, so we were  the two first veterinarians to ever serve and then this past year we had a  third veterinarian. So actually there   s three veterinarians right now in the  House of Representatives.  And you graduated from here  OSU ? Were you one of the few women  in     I graduated with a class of 60, and there were ten women in my class.  Now we were really the first big class of women. Before us, there had  been like five or six per year. There were ten in my year.  Can you talk a little bit about your library job here while we   re talking  about OSU?  Okay. My sophomore year of vet school   professional school is hard  15  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  and costly, and I needed a little job and I thought,    If I work in the  library, maybe I   ll study.    So the Vet Med Library was a branch of the  Edmon Low Library here at Oklahoma State, and I was the night  manager. I would go in at   oh about 6:00 at night, and keep it open until  9:00. We kept it open later during finals week. It was just in a couple of  classrooms, and it was very overcrowded. The shelves were just full to  capacity with different items.  We   d have study carrels for students, and we had a couple of rooms  where students could view slides for pathology and histopathology and  prepare for tests, such as that. Then there would be some limited books  that were out of print that professors wanted us to look at. So they would  have one or two copies on the shelves that students could look at in the  library but not check out. And, of course, a lot of periodicals. What was  current in veterinary medicine   literature at the time was available, such  as that.  And did your theory work? Did you study more?  I did study more. Actually my husband was two years ahead of me in vet  school, and I kind of met him through the library job. He was a     studier,    so he was at the library about every night and so that   s how I  met him. Since he had that library habit, I kept my ingrained library  habit of studying at the library.  Were there any other buildings on campus that you were fond of during  that time period?  Well, of course, Willard Hall. When I came to OSU in the fall of 1971  that was my dorm. It was un-air-conditioned, but it was close on  campus. I did not have a car so I thought Willard Hall was perfectly  suited. We had lavatories in our rooms, but the bathrooms were down  the hall, as in all the dorms, but the new dorms didn   t have the sinks in  the rooms. I liked Willard Hall. I have lots of fond memories of Willard  Hall. We had hours at the time   curfews   we had to be in at 10:00.  In 1971?  In 1971 we had to be in at 10:00 on weeknights and midnight on Friday  and Saturday night.  Just the women, or the guys too?  I don   t know about the guys but the women did. We had to be in. But  without a car, I was close to the Student Union and close to the library.  That first semester I was so scared I was going to flunk out of college,  16  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  back in 1971. This is the truth. I would come to this library  Edmon Low  Library  at 7:30 on Saturday mornings and, of course, I had the place  pretty much to myself. I have fond memories of this library, too, because  I studied here so much, living at Willard Hall.  Did you have a favorite spot in the library?  I liked the reading room on second floor. That   s why I thought it was so  funny when he goes,    There   s a second floor long hallway,    because I  would come up to this reading room. There were fascinating reading  materials, when you   d take a break from your studies, to look at and  gaze over. So I did love the library. I   m appalled that they serve food in  the library now. (Laughs) That amazes me that there   s a snack bar in the  library, but I do think it probably encourages students to stay here and  study. Let   s see, today is a Friday morning, and when I walked in,  there   s lots of students here studying so I think it   s probably been a good  move. And it   s always good to change with the times and be flexible so I  applaud you all for having your little caf   downstairs.  It   s not been an easy change     I   m sure. For a librarian that   s an ingrained librarian, I   m sure it   s very  hard.  Do you have any favorite campaign stories?  Well, I do. I have some funny ones. Two of my favorites are really  funny. I was making some phone calls one night and calling another  city, and a child answered the phone and I said,    Well, this is Lee  Denney. Is your mom there?    And he put the phone down. You could  hear him. He goes,    Mom, it   s Lee Denney      and you go    All right.  This is great. This is going to be a good call.    And I   m getting all ready  to talk to the mom, and then you hear,    Well, hang up on her.    So click.  (Laughs) That   s one of my favorites because it keeps you humble that  you   re sitting here thinking everybody wants to hear your message and  then there   s some people that don   t.  And then another one   these are all disparaging on me, but they   re the  funniest ones. That   s the ones I find humor in. I   d knocked on a door  and a gentleman came to the door and I told him who I was, and he goes,     Well, are you a republican or a democrat?    And I always hate to  answer that question because you just never know the response you   re  going to get. I said,    Well sir, I   m a republican,    and he goes,    Well,  then get off my porch.    I go,    Okay.    (Laughs)    I   ll step back.     But you know, it   s so fun to campaign and the door knocking is the most  17  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  fun. It   s more fun than phone calls. I think you   re interrupting people  when you call them on the phone. I myself, I   m usually doing something  and the phone is more interrupting than a knock on the door. But people  are anxious to hear the message. They like to meet you face to face.  Most of them have pets, which I love dogs and so it   s fun to see the  attack dog come to the door and then do a couple of things, hold your  hand down and then pretty soon the dog is wagging the tail. I   ve found if  you can get the dog, you get the people, so that   s been fun to do.  We   ve got some of the best people in District 33. Lots of people are  excited about the message. They   re willing to help. Been turned down  very few times for putting signs in people   s yards. These are great  people. I think I have the best district in the state. It   s a mix of small  town and small city   with Stillwater and I go to Yale, Cushing, Perkins,  Ripley, Langston and Coyle. I have two universities in my district,  Langston and Oklahoma State University. I think you have a vibrancy of  very knowledgeable people when you have higher-education institutions  nearby. I actually think I have the best district in the state.  Sounds like you have a good one.  Yes.  Was your incumbent     No, I ran in an open seat.  Was your opponent male, female?  My opponent in my primary was a male that first time and then my  opponent was a female in the general. And then this last time I had two  males. So, had a female the first time, actually a friend of mine. She was  from Cushing and we just decided we weren   t going to do any negative  campaigning and we didn   t. We kept it clean and we   re still friends  today. So I   m really glad that worked out as well as it did.  It   s just been a recent term   I mean from 2004 to 2006   was there that  much difference in cost?  You know, it wasn   t. The first race, by far, is the most costly because  nobody knows you. So you just have a race of time to get out there and  get your name out. Last year I spent more in the primary because I had  the same opponent I had the first year, actually. We were both known so  we were trying to get the most information out. Actually my general  opponent didn   t really do much so I didn   t really spend as much last year  as I did the first year. He was an OSU student and   I don   t know why     18  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  I actually never even met him. He didn   t really show up for anything,  and so it wasn   t much of a race after that. I just kept trying to keep going  to all the functions and keep my name out and do some ads, and such as  that, to keep my name out there so people knew I was running. And he, I  don   t think, spent a dime.  That   s     I know. I would have liked to have met him, I really would have. And I  found out I have an opponent this next time, so I hope to meet him.  It   s not too early, I guess.  It is and it isn   t   it   s not really too early. We   ll sign up to run in June  and then we   ll get hot and heavy all next summer and into the Fall.  The hottest time of the year.  In the hottest time of the year. I do think the first year it was one of those  mild summers   the summer of 2004 was fairly mild. I sure was glad.  But    06 was fairly hot,    06 made up for it.    06 was that year we had all  that drought and it was pretty rough.  What committees have you served on?  Well, initially I was vice-chairman of the Banking Committee and then I  served on Education A and B, and then I served on CareerTech  Education and Higher Education my first year. And then this year I   m  the chairman of the Arts and Culture Committee. I was still on the  Education A and B Committee, and I   m on the Energy Committee.  What are some of the roles of the chair, just to keep the meeting running  or what?  Yes. Well, actually right after all the bills are turned in in December,  then the Speaker of the House and his staff decide what committees  those bills are assigned to. So as the chair, you receive the list of the bills  that will be heard in your committee. It   s your responsibility to set up  the hearings and let the members of the committee know when those  committee meetings will be and what bills are being heard so they can  come, and be prepared. Then, of course, run the meeting. And the  chairman also can decide not to hear bills. Now my committee is kind of  one of the smaller committees, and so we heard all of our bills. But the  Judicial Committee, they   re hit with sometimes a thousand bills. They  have to decide what will be heard and what will not be heard. The bigger  committees have more responsibility and I hope as I go on, of course,  19  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  I   ll get larger committee assignments.  And the chair decides that?  The chair of the committee can decide that. He can do it on his or her  own   absolutely   or he can have the vice-chairman help him, or maybe  even the committee, but it   s up to that chair as to what gets heard.  They can delegate then.  You can delegate.  That   s interesting, too. You   ve also been the mayor and vice-mayor of  Cushing?  I have been the Mayor of Cushing. I served on the City Council and was  the Mayor and the Vice-Mayor. That was very good training.  Great help too.  Yes, it does. It   s amazing. You have your little household budget and  then you move up to a small town, or a town   s budget, and those  numbers seem huge. Then you move to the city and now you talk about  millions and you go,    Well, it   s just a million,    so you kind of  sometimes get complacent about those dollars, but just every time you  deal with larger and larger amounts of money.  Would you aspire to move to the Senate?  Not at this time. I really like my district. The Senate seat is open this  time, and I looked at it briefly, but Guthrie and Stillwater then become, I  think, the major focal points of that district. I really like the rural-ness of  my district. Plus, in the House I think we   re closer to the people and  that   s real important to me, to stay close to the people. The senators end  up being more remote. They have twice as many constituents and they  don   t seem to be as accessible as we are. I like being close to the people,  so I think I   m going to stay with the House.  Can you tell if any of your habits have changed?  I go to the grocery store earlier. Oh man, have my habits changed? I  don   t think so. I   ve tried to be the same person I was.  Are you able to still do some of your veterinarian practice?  I do a little bit of it. Since my husband and I have the clinic together, I  20  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  can do a little bit on the side when he   s gone, work a couple of days here  and there. What I mainly do for him is   a lot of times he   ll just get  home and we   ll have an emergency and he   s been there all day so I   ll go  out to the clinic and see some of the emergencies. I saw a couple of  emergencies this week. So I   m able to keep in it. If we didn   t have the  practice together, I don   t think I would be able to. This is a pretty full-time  job. Your constituents have needs and wants. They want to meet  with you and so it keeps you pretty busy.  Year-round, not just during session?  Year-round, not just during session. After I   m out of office, I hope to  educate the public about how busy this job is because I think we take a  lot of heat that it   s just a part-time job and actually session, clearly, is a  part-time job, but if you do this job right, you   re busy year-round.  Well, session is just not a 40-hour week either.  Session is not a 40-hour week. It   s not. You   re hitting it hard and when  you start into May, they   ll tell you session is half over. That   s how much  work is left to do in May. So April and May it picks up speed rapidly  and   long hours, long hours.  During the summer months, if you   re not campaigning, what are some of  the things you might be doing, work-related?  A lot of times we start interim studies. There will be a piece of  legislation that you think is a good idea, but you don   t have all the kinks  worked out of it. So you pull in people from the industries and agencies  and then private citizens to try to get a handle on what needs to be done  to fix a problem. So we   re in the midst of having interim studies right  now to decide what legislation we might want to run in the fall, and  those typically take place in non-election years.  Do you write some of your bills then?  You actually do. It   s a great time to start your bill writing because the  staff downstairs has more time to help you and work with you. Once  everything gets going, they get just busy, busy, busy, too. So it   s a great  time to start some of your bill ideas down the road of getting crafted into  language that you   ll like and want to move on through the system.  Do you do some of your own research for bills?  You do. It   s a combination. You do a little bit of your own research and  then you rely on staff. We have a legal staff that helps us because we   re  21  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  not attorneys and so it can stand the muster of the test, which is our court  system. We do have attorneys that actually craft most of the language.  We give our ideas and our research to them, and then they will craft it  into language that   s appropriate.  If you do have free time during session, what do you do?  Don   t have a lot of free time. You really don   t have a lot of free time.  You read. Sometimes we   ll get together as legislators. Speaker Hiett  loved to have gospel sings and so you   d sit around a piano and just sing.  You get to know people on a different level. I think you get to build a  trust level when you interact with your colleagues that way. So  sometimes we   ll go out to dinner together. I spend a lot of time in  Barnes and Noble, because you can (Laughs) and it   s open late.  People try to get to know you better. Lobbyists, they get a bad rap, but  they   re just people employed by businesses and agencies to educate us,  and so they spend a lot of time educating us, getting us materials to read.  They   re real good about giving us the positive sides of what they want  done, but if you press them they   ll give you the negative sides. They   ll  present both sides. So you spend a lot of time getting educated, and then  you also try to carve out some time for your family.  There is some time for socializing and networking?  There is   there is. There absolutely is.  And your family comes to you sometimes?  Sometimes they do. I   m embarrassed to say this on tape, but both my  kids went to the University of Oklahoma.  The other school     The other school   so I   ve been very fortunate then, that time of year,  I   m actually closer to my children. So a lot of times they   ll come up and  we   ll meet for a meal or I   ll go down to Norman and take them out to  dinner or something, so definitely some of that. And then my husband  will come down some.  Any bills on the horizon that you   re getting ready to push out there that  you want to share?  Of course. Being a veterinarian, actually I was approached last year to  carry a bill on pet quality assurance. Now what this is is that we have  breeders in this state that don   t like to do the best job of breeding these  22  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  animals. We didn   t run the legislation last year because it wasn   t ready.  So this fall we have an interim study and we   re going to bring breeders  in and veterinarians in and try to regulate this industry of pet breeding in  the state. Oklahoma has no regulations and so we   ve kind of become  known as a puppy mill state and now with the Internet and puppies being  sold across the United States, we   re getting the reputation of not always  having healthy puppies.  Now this is different from a lemon law. We cannot help that some  puppies are born with birth defects, that can   t always be helped, some of  that is going to happen. But we can assure that people are given a puppy  that   s been properly fed, properly cleaned, as healthy as can be expected  for a six- to eight-week-old puppy. The parents are parasite-free and  healthy, and that   s what we   re going to work to, that the quality of the  health is improved in Oklahoma for our pets.  Any others?  Looking at running my OSSM bill again. I haven   t put that totally out of  my mind. And then I have some bills that people have come to me, some  ideas, little tweaks in the law. For instance, now we pull over when an  ambulance or a highway patrolman is on the side of the road. Tow truck  owners have come to me and said they would like that same   because  they   re out there working on these disabled vehicles and they would like  for people to pull over for them. But they don   t want to be classed as an  emergency vehicle, so they would be a different class. So we   re going to  look into working on that. I had a constituent tell me that you can   t get a  CDL  Commercial Driver   s License  license   a renewal   at any of our  Oklahoma Tax Commission areas. So I   ll look into why we can   t let  them renew their licenses where you get your driver   s license renewed     ideas like that. My ideas come from the people.  That   s a wide spectrum.  It   s a wide spectrum. It will be.  And then of course you get to co-author some from others.  Yes, and co-authors. Every once in awhile you   ll have an idea that  somebody else will have and when it comes down to it, you all decide to  join forces instead of having two competitive bills. So there will be some  of that, too.  Well, let   s say you finish your 12 years, then what?  Well, at that time, I hope I have grand-babies to go home and rock   23  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  (Laughs) But, you know, I don   t know. I   m not going to close any doors.  I really do enjoy this, and I don   t know what the future will hold and I   m  open to what the future may hold. I think we need more women in  government. I really do. I think we have a definite place. I think we  bring a different aspect than men bring. I think we bring a softer  approach, and I don   t think that   s always bad.  And bring anything else?  I think we bring a lot of wisdom. I   m amazed at women. I think we are  such good multi-taskers. I think we bring a different view, a lot of  wisdom. The women I know, from my hometown all the way up   I  think my mother   s one of the smartest women I   ve ever met, and she  doesn   t even have a college degree. But I think we bring an openness  and honest-ness and yet a softness and kindness to our offices that is  much needed.  Do you see that women are placed on particular committees for those  type of reasons?  You know, not necessarily. I think some women may have a bent for  that, women and family issues, and so they   re put on those committees.  Pam Peterson, a representative from Tulsa, has a big heart for children  so she   s put on a lot of family and children   s committees for that reason.  But then Marian Cooksey from Edmond is head of the Energy  Committee, so you   ll see all sorts, I think.  That   s an improvement then.  Yes, it is. And I think we should be valued for what we bring to the table  from our intelligence side as well as our role as nurturers.  Anything else you want to add?  Oh, I   ve enjoyed this. You   re very easy to visit with. I appreciate this.  Being a woman in veterinary medicine is interesting.  That   s not so rare anymore. (Laughs) Women are kind of taking over  veterinary medicine. In fact, there are two schools   I believe it   s Tufts  in Boston and then Michigan, this fall their classes are 100 percent  women.  100 percent?  100 percent.  24  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  We   ll end up having quotas?  Yes, we might have to have quotas for men.  Do most of them then go into small animal?  You know, that   s definitely the trend. Some of them will go into large  animal. The trend we   re seeing is   we   re really suffering for large  animal veterinarians, definitely in Oklahoma and across America. It   s  kind of scary because your large animal veterinarians are protecting our  food population. Plus I think a lot of times the food animals are going to  be the sentinels for any bio-terrorisms that may come over. So I think  our large animal veterinarians are very important, so we   re going to have  to look at that.  I think veterinary medicine tends to be a lower paying career on the  medicine circuit. I mean, it   s a fantastic career and it   s certainly been  good to my family, but as far as the medicine circuit. And I think when  men start to look at what they need to do to provide for a family and put  kids through college, they   re tending to go more to the human side than  the veterinary side. And I don   t have the answer for that.  Pets   it   s certainly an economic profession. You just can   t spend the  world on your dog, although you want to take as best care as you can.  There are economic constraints there. So I think that   s one reason. I  think certainly women are empathetic, and so the small animal medicine  draws them. Back in the 70   s you almost had to be a farm kid, male or  female, to go into veterinary medicine. It was very farm-oriented, but  that   s trending totally different in city kids as well as rural kids going  into veterinary medicine equally. I think that   s one reason you see more  women.  Thirty years later, that   s     Yes.  Do you envision either one of your children going into politics?  I thought you were going to say veterinary medicine   I was going to say  no. (Laughs) I do not see my daughter ever doing it, but it wouldn   t  surprise me if my son did it. It wouldn   t surprise me a bit. It   ll be down  the road awhile, but neither one of them are going into veterinary  medicine. They were the recipients of the middle of the night calls and  sometimes even having to get up and go help. When you have to do the  C-section on a dog, that   s a two person job any way you slice it, and if I  have been gone or something, one of the kids would have to get up with  25  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  my husband and go out there. Once the puppies are born, you have to  massage them and make sure they   re breathing and get them dried off,  while my husband   s tending to the mama and finishing the C-section. So  my kids have been out to the clinic in the middle of the night rubbing  down puppies to jump start them.  They might be regular MDs then.  Actually our daughter is a first-year student in pharmacy school, so she   s  going to be a pharmacist. She loves chemistry, and I think she   s found  her niche. And then our son, he never really liked the blood and guts line  of work so he decided he wanted far away from that. He was a letters  major at the University of Oklahoma and now he   s teaching English as a  foreign language over in Germany, so he   s living over there for about a  year.  Have either one of them been in the chamber and watched you in  action?  My daughter has. My son was there when I was sworn in, and he   s been  back to visit a couple of times, but my daughter, the younger of the two,  definitely has come up to the chamber when I   ve passed some bills. And  she threatens me. She   s kind of shy, so she threatens me if I introduce  her, she   ll leave. Now everybody knows her, so I don   t have to introduce  her anymore.  When you leave your pool house, do you come down Lincoln?  I do. The house I stay in is across the street from Frontier City so I hop  on I-35, go around to Lincoln and then drive down Lincoln Boulevard.  And you see the Capitol all looming?  It is and     What thoughts go through your head?  I cannot believe I have the opportunity to work there. I   m just  overwhelmed that I have an office there and it overwhelms me that the  people have given me this responsibility, and I really take it seriously  and I appreciate the opportunity.  Do you think about that every time you     I do, about. That building is amazing   that white marble and concrete     it   s just amazing. And the Indian at the top entitled    The Guardian,    I  26  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  think that says it all. We are the guardian of the people, the taxpayers, of  Oklahoma and we need to think about that every time we go in there.  That the taxpayers of Oklahoma are entrusting us to make the best  decisions possible when we   re there.  It gets pretty noisy with the school kids.  It does. The first year I was there, of course we have committee  meetings before session ever opens in January. I can remember the week  before that first session opened, walking down the hall I thought,    This  is going to be the most tranquil, peaceful place in the world.    The  marble   in the end of January it   s kind of cool and quiet, and I thought,     This will just be wonderful.    And then I almost equate it to the stock  market when that opening bell hits, school kids and groups and veterans  and just everyone, and it   s very noisy. That   s one reason I like to get  there early, like I said earlier, and stay till about 6:00. So you can come  when it   s quiet and leave when it   s quiet. But I encourage everyone to  come because it is their Capitol building and that   s exactly what should  be going on. People should come down and see us working. I think that  holds us accountable, and it makes them better citizens of the state if  they know what   s going on at their Capitol.  It   s probably been even busier this year with the centennial.  It has been busy. Even in the fall, I noticed lots of groups down there     school kids coming in the fall dressed in period dress, having different  school classes down there, for the centennial. It   s been exciting.  Do you get to go out and speak to groups of students?  I do. I do. I   ve been in lots of classrooms. I   ve been to 4-H meetings,  FFA, such as that, and I really enjoy speaking to kids.  You   re not just between the walls then from 8:30 to whatever     No. No. I get out. Any kids that come to our Capitol from our district,  we try to get them into the chamber in between sessions so they can  walk on the floor and have a piece of ownership in it.  So those young girls will     I hope so. I try to speak to the pages on Wednesday morning. Any  representative that wants to can speak to the pages about 7:30 in the  morning. So I try to get there and encourage the women to run   to take  that little 12-year niche out of their lives and spend it at the Capitol.  27  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  Finchum  Denney  So in high school, were you even remotely interested in government?  No. No. Not at all   not at all. My favorite subjects, of course, were  math and science and at that time I actually wanted to go to pharmacy  school. So I had no use for English or history or those boring subjects.  My father loves history, and he would drag us to every museum in the  state, so I thought,    Yuck. Don   t want any history. Don   t care about  government.    So I was a science and math girl, but as I   ve gotten older, I  love history   love to read it now. I think you mature with age and  realize the importance of the history and how it relates to our  government and how it relates to our future.  That   s a good lead-in for my last question.  Okay.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  I hope it   s nice to me. I hope it remembers me as someone that was a  servant to the people, someone that was open-minded, willing to listen to  any ideas and not necessarily act on all of them but be open-minded  enough to know that I don   t have all the answers and that the people in  the district can sure be a help. So I hope it judges me as someone that  was compassionate, conservative and for the people.  And then besides work-related, anything else you would like to be  remembered as?  I always go back to Ralph Waldo Emerson   s,    If I can make the  difference in the life of my children, that   s what I want to be  remembered for.     Anything else you want to add?  I can   t think of anything. This has really been enjoyable, and I  appreciate you doing this. Initially I thought,    I don   t know that I am  worthy of a place in the library.    Certainly, if we don   t record women,  there will be no knowledge that we   ve been there. And I think that   s  why having children is so important. There   s some knowledge that you  ever did walk upon this earth is through the memories of my children  and then their children and on down, so I appreciate you doing this.  It   s been a pleasure. We may have to do a follow-up one later.  We can. I   m just over in Cushing, so if you need something else I   d be  more than happy to come back down.  28  Finchum Well, thank you very much for taking the time to come. It   s been a  pleasure.  --- ---
