Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns. Ma'am, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes, my name is Renee Ferguson, R-E-N-E-E, F-E-R-G-U-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: All right, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, August 22, 1949.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm an investigative reporter for NBC 5 News here in Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 156017
Speaker 1: What is today's date?
Speaker 2: I haven't the slightest idea.  No, it's March 3rd, isn't it?  March 3rd, 2005.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And where are we at the present time, and you don't have to give your exact address.
Speaker 2: We're in my home in Hyde Park.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Now, is this Kenwood [Chicago, Illinois] or Hyde Park?  What would you call it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, it's really Kenwood but who knows what Kenwood is.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: It is Kenwood technically up to Drexel [Boulevard] on the west, Lake Park [Avenue] on the east, Hyde Park Boulevard on the south and 47th [Street] north, that's Kenwood.  Those are the borders of Kenwood.
Story_ID: 156018
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, before we go into depth, I'm compelled to ask you these five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: They only take a--they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is: do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  Chitterlings, I love them.  I don't care what anybody says.  I make them.  I'm the only person in my house who eats them, and chitterlings.  Gourmet.
Speaker 1: Do you fry them?
Speaker 2: No, I clean them, I boil them and with celery and salt, red pepper, onion, a little bit of garlic and I cook them extremely slowly all night and when I wake up in the morning at about five AM, the house is aromatic and I eat them until they're all gone.  That's the only thing I can't control. I love them. I only fix them twice a year; otherwise, I'd be very fat.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, red.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: In Chicago [Illinois], my favorite time of the year is the fall.  It's really the spring though, but we don't have spring here, and I so miss it, but when I lived in the South, the spring, and when I grew in Oklahoma, spring was definitely my favorite time of the year.
Speaker 1: That's true, that's true.  I've observed that too that sometimes we don't really have a spring.
Speaker 2: No, no, it's cold here.  We have a cold spring, but it isn't a blooming, blossoming, promising spring.  It's cold.
Story_ID: 156019
Speaker 1: I was asking you all the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --My season.
Speaker 1: --yes, and you were talking about it being spring elsewhere and fall here in Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, my favorite is spring.  Right.
Speaker 1: The next question is, do you have favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  We travel the world and we always want to go somewhere different, so there are not many places that I want to return to.  I liked Paris [France], but I don't like the French, so I wouldn't call it a favorite.  I'd go in August when they're all gone and then I have the city to myself but, no, I don't think so.  I enjoy Africa a lot.  I do.  I enjoy Africa.
Story_ID: 156020
Speaker 1: --Seems like I shouldn't ask this question, but what is it about the French?  I mean what, what is it?  I know Mark Twain has a big critique of them, but I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well, I think that we don't understand them.  Once we understand them, they're fine, but they are really nationalistic, and like anyone appears superior that is usually born out of inferiority, so anybody that you see looking down their nose at you usually is really scared of you or thinks that you're better than them.  At any rate, the French are complex.  We all are, but they're not exactly welcoming you in.  They're okay.  They're like, "Okay, you're fine here," but they're not embracing.
Speaker 1: So sort of a nationalism?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I think so, yes.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --ethnocentrism?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I think, you know, it was born of being a very old culture and they look at Americans and they see us just not being refined. And I think we see them as having better taste, and having wonderful clothing, and I love to shop there, and French perfume, and French food, and having an aesthetic, and we've bought into that, so that's my best analysis of it.  That's enough to say, I don't have friends in France, but, in general, unless you are speaking French and really kind of knowing your way around there, it's not like people who stop me, I stop, I give them directions, I help them and I'll take them somewhere even, that's just not going to happen to you.
Story_ID: 156021
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have--the last question in this little series is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, I love this saying that my aunt used to say to me all the time.  She would say, "Renee, wear the world as a loose garment," and I use that a lot, and I really believe in that, you know, you just don't let it touch you, wear it, but let it fall around you, but don't let it get to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, wear the world as a loose garment.
Story_ID: 156022
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm going to ask you about your family history now.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  We'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her full name was Mary M-A-R-C-E-N-I-A Anderson Ferguson.
Speaker 1: Okay, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in a little town called Goodnight, Oklahoma, and she was born on October 6, 1913.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?  Who were they and how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, her family, the Griffin family, came from Griffin, Georgia.  The Griffins, the white Griffins, in Georgia were the founders of the Southern Pacific Railroad [sic, Monroe Railroad and Banking Company, later Macon and Western Railroad] and my great-great-grandfather came out of slavery as a slave child from that of the Griffins of Griffin, Georgia.  So the story goes, and I still have this chest in the house, that they brought a chest full of gold with them, which was given to them by their white father, and after they were emancipated.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, was their white father a Griffin?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was the Griffin of the Griffin--of the Southern Pacific Railroad.
Speaker 1: And then brought it to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --brought to Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they guarded it all the time.  They guarded the chest.  They never left the house without one person being there to keep track of the gold that was in there.  My mother said that she assumed that that gold was given.  I asked her if she thought it might have been stolen.  She said she assumed it was given.  So, at any rate, they came with this big trunk, which I have, full of gold.  I don't have the gold anymore, but they bought land.
Speaker 1: But they said that the trunk was actually full of gold, and people say it was full of gold?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --full of gold, yes.  And she has written that out.
Speaker 1: Now, when did they come?  Did they leave Georgia before the Civil War or after?
Speaker 2: No, it was quite a while after the Civil War.  And they went to Oklahoma, which was Indian territory in 1889.  They were part of the land run there when Oklahoma--when Indian territory was opened and it became a state, and they staked out land, which became Goodnight, Oklahoma, and Langston, Oklahoma, Guthrie, Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Now, these are black towns, right?
Speaker 2: Well, Goodnight certainly was.  Langston, after--there is a university [Langston University, Langston Oklahoma] there named after Langston Hughes and--I think, I'm not sure about that, better check that fact.
Speaker 1: Probably John Mercer Langston.
Speaker 2: John Mercer Langston, that's right.  And so, Langston University is there, and their farm is right there, and now I own it.  We've kept it in the family, and I inherited it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Goodnight, they were like one of the founders of the town.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they were.  They named it.  They named it Goodnight.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind that?  That sounds like a story too?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I think they was just sleepy myself, but what she wrote was that after the land run, they had acquired the land which they wanted, which was right on the Cimarron River and it was in a place where farm land was not that good.  It was drained pretty well, so at the end of it, they thought that they had had a good night, and a good day and good night, so that is what she wrote in her diary.
Speaker 1: A place on the river, that sounds like a good place--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, in Oklahoma where there is not much water, and there were oil wells ultimately found there.  I mean there is oil--there is a big concentration of oil and we still get the oil checks.  I have one over there.  I think it's for seventy bucks, but you know what I'm saying, after the family gets through dividing them, but some of them have been for much more, so there was oil under there, and that enabled my mother to go to college, and my aunts, and all of them were well-educated women and men, and because of that, they had a good life and because they had a good life, I had a good life, so, middle--middle-class, they were very strivers, you know, striving very hard, working very hard.  My mother always worked.  My dad [Eugene Ferguson] worked.
Story_ID: 156023
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother's [Mary Ferguson] family, did they have a chance to go to college and all that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother's mother was a music teacher at Langston [University, Langston, Oklahoma].  Her name was Martha Anderson, and her sisters-in-law were all teachers.  The last one, Hattie, my great-aunt, Hattie Brown, died when she was 100 and she left her farm land to me, and so all of it got passed down to her, and she didn't have any children, so I took care of her after my mother died.  My mother took care of her before that, and then I took care of her, and then I inherited everything that she had left my mother.  My mother died before she did, so it became my responsibility to take care of my aunt Hattie, who--by the time I was taking care of her, she didn't know who I was.  She had dementia and she didn't know me from Adam, but right before she died, she did get to a place of clarity about who I was, and I would go every day to the nursing home there and read the Bible there, so she came to know--she knew I was there, and when I finally said to her, you know, "I belong to you," and I sang some songs that were familiar to her and I named names of people she knew when I was doing this music with her, it registered, and she looked at me and she recognized that I belonged to her.
Story_ID: 156024
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Mary Ferguson] talk about--have, have any stories about growing up in Goodnight [Oklahoma] and what it was like?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, she, I mean, her dad died--her dad owned a grocery store and he died very young, so her mother then raised the three children from their union, and she didn't remarry, so by her teaching and because there was oil on the land, they were able to farm and to go to college.  Her memories that she writes about in her diary are about her aunts, really, these other women who were around her, and who surrounded her and who taught her how to be a women, which it was very interesting the influences that each one of them had upon her.  So she went to Langston University [Langston, Oklahoma] and while she got her teaching certificate and everything, she ended up working as a maid.  And while she worked as a maid, she learned how to entertain and give parties and that kind of thing.  I think that's the thing you were talking about, the influence of food and everything.  I have some of her cookbooks, the white women that she worked for gave her 'The James Beard cookbook' [James Beard], 'New York Times Cookbook' [Craig Claiborne], and gave her cooking lessons, so she became an extraordinary cook, and taught me too but it's one of those things where she made fluffy rolls but also chitterlings, so there you are, you had the whole range.
Speaker 1: So did she spend most of her time in Goodnight or in Langston [Oklahoma] or were they close by?
Speaker 2: Well, she moved to Oklahoma City [Oklahoma], which was only thirty-five miles away.  She moved to Oklahoma City and she ultimately--she and my dad [Eugene Ferguson] got a divorced after forty-nine years, and she came to New York [City] with me and [HM] Ken [Smikle] when we lived in New York after our son [Jason Smikle] was born, and we just talked her into staying with us.  So then when we moved to Chicago [Illinois] in 1987, then she came here with us, and she didn't like the cold weather, so we bought a condo in Florida together, and she wintered in Florida, and came up here in the summer, but she ultimately died in Oklahoma.  She was visiting her aunt in her hometown in Goodnight, right out there in the country, and she died very suddenly there.  So it was almost as though she went home even though she seemed very hale and hearty.  She died very suddenly--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in her, in her home.
Story_ID: 156025
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Okay, yes, his name is Eugene Kirk Ferguson, F-E-R-G-U-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth.
Speaker 2: He was born in Bristow, Oklahoma and his birthday--he just told me the other day that he changed his birthday, so I'm not sure what it is, but April 17th is what we celebrate, 1914.  Now, he tells me that he changed his birthdate to, when he was a kid, to coincide with a friend, so they would have the same birthday.   So that's all I know.  It was shocking.  I don't know, so I said, "What's your real birthday."  He said, "I just want you to know that I changed it, that's all."
Speaker 1: So you still don't know what it is.
Speaker 2: I still don't know what it is.
Speaker 1: So you say, he's about ninety-two?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he is.  He is living in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] still.  He was living independently up until he had a stroke last year.
Story_ID: 156026
Speaker 1: --Now, what do you know about his [father, Eugene Ferguson] side of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: Well, pretty far back.  His, his grandfather was a man named Cuffie Ferguson.  If you know the South African for "nigger" or "kaffir" I'm pretty sure that came from Dutch, and that that is a derivative.
Speaker 1: How do you spell it?
Speaker 2: C-U-F-F-I-E.
Speaker 1: There's another possibility too.  The black ship builder in the 18th century, Paul Cuffee, his last name was from his ancestor, whose name was "Kofi" he was from Ghana, so.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But I don't know, why do you think it was from the Dutch?
Speaker 2: Well, because he was the child of--his mother was the slave master's daughter and his father, Cuffie's father, was the slave master's son, so they were half brother and sister and because he looked so white and would have been able to pass for white, I think that they gave him that name, so that everybody know, that white people would know, that he was black, that he had black blood.  Now, he then married my grandmother--my great-grandmother and he had several wives.  He had three wives.  Each one, when they died, he married younger women, and one of his wives, his last wife, is Mexican, and so we have sort of a Mexican mix in the family--I can show you the pictures, very beautiful women, and Cuffie and then my grandfather, Frank [Ferguson], and then my dad and his brothers, Frank, he had some brothers who passed for white and they went over to the other side and stayed, but we know them.  Actually, we've talked to the white Fergusons to get this story of Cuffie.  You know we could only get so far.  We could get to Cuffie, and we needed the white Ferguson to tell us the rest of the story.  So in doing our genealogy, we found them.  It was hard.  We went on the internet and they stepped forward.
Speaker 1: Okay, so these are the white Fergusons that owned Cuffie in the beginning?
Speaker 2: Yeah, their relatives, yeah, from Mississippi.
Speaker 1: So what part of Mississippi are they from?
Speaker 2: Um, Corinth [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Corinth.
Speaker 2: Corinth, Mississippi.  And, Frank,my grandfather, whose picture in hanging in the wall in the kitchen and Cuffie is in there too, he had a daughter, another daughter outside of my father's family and her name is Levola Smith [Tillman] and she and her husband [Charles Smith] made history by opening up a hoist manufacturing company in Cassopolis, Michigan and he invented the hoist and patented it.  He is in a museum in Michigan--University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and so forth, so she is my aunt, and she is still alive.   I have--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Yeah, Cassopolis has a lot of black history in it.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --in western Michigan, just above Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes, that whole area there, so I have family in Cassopolis.
Speaker 1: It's an underground railroad town.
Speaker 2: And they owned the hoist company there, Smith Hoist [Manufacturing Co.] for a long time.  In fact, they just sold it a few years ago.  She sold it a few years ago, and so my Aunt Levola is ninety-one.  My dad's ninety-two.  His brother is ninety-three and they have another brother in California who is in his late nineties.  The men--most of the men lived a long time.  The women did not (laughter).
Story_ID: 156027
Speaker 1: Your father [Eugene Ferguson] was born in Oklahoma, but was it his father [Frank Ferguson] that went to California first and then came back or was it?
Speaker 2: His father was in California, but his father, first, was in Mississippi and then he went to Oklahoma, and then he went to Mexico and married the Mexican woman.  He was trying to get away from the discrimination in Oklahoma and when he moved to Mexico, he married a Mexican woman, which the Mexicans didn't like and so he moved to the Imperial Valley of California.  And there are river and streams in that area now that are named after his children and after the Fergusons.  They were forcefully--forcibly removed from that land by the United States government, which said that they were going to use that as a [U.S.] Navy base.  It never became a Navy base; and the family is angry to this day about that because it was, of course, beautiful, prime acreage.
Speaker 1: Is that land in private hands now?
Speaker 2: No, it still belongs to the United States government.  I don't see why we can't get it back.  We just have to file a claim, kind of like the Native Americans have done.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The Japanese also had land confiscated during the war that they've never gotten back.
Speaker 2: Well, it would take--you would have to really want to do it.  And the young family members really want to do it; the older ones don't have the energy for it, and are really quite fearful of the government.
Story_ID: 156028
Speaker 1: All right, now do you--is there a story about how your parents [Mary Ferguson and Eugene Ferguson] met that you know?
Speaker 2: I know they met in college.  That's about all I know.  My dad was a football player.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Were they at Langston [University, Langston, Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: He was so cute. Yeah, at Langston.  My mother said he was so cute.  She was dating someone else, but he just swept her off her feet; that's what she said.  He was a pretty handsome guy.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Beyond that, I don't really know the circumstances.  Oh, yes, I do.  Well, I know they were introduced by his sister.  His sister and my mother were good friends.  His sister, Sula, and my mother were good friends.
Speaker 1: Sula.
Speaker 2: That's my favorite Tony Morrison novel, one of them, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  S-u-l-a?
Speaker 2: I have a picture of her there.
Speaker 1: Where did such a name come from?  I've never--you've seen it in a novel, I don't think she explains where it comes from in novel.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Is there an explanation for Sula?
Speaker 2: I would think it's partly Native American maybe, but I don't know, maybe part French, 'Sula.'
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, anyway, they meet in college, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --they got married.  My brother is ten years older than me and--
Speaker 1: Is it just the two of you?
Speaker 2: The two of us, yeah.  His name is Eugene, too, Eugene Arthur Ferguson.
Story_ID: 156029
Speaker 1: Okay, now te- what are your parents' [Mary Ferguson and Eugene Ferguson] personalities like and, and who do you take after?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was more of an intellectual person.  She read Norman Vincent Peale all the time and believed very much in the power of positive thinking.  And her mother [Martha Anderson] I think was probably a bit abusive and was a hard woman, having to raise those children during the [Great] Depression and so forth.  She was a tough woman, and my mother chose to be the opposite way, and so she read books all the time.  In my home, I saw my mother reading constantly and I read too, but I do remember loving the concept taught by Norman Vincent Peale.  And my father was very much a person who liked to do hands-on things, so he gardened and he fixed things around the house, and he maintained things beautifully, and he painted, and he had side jobs like that, carpentry and electrical and that kind of thing on the side, so I think I'm a mixture of both of them, although there were lessons I learned that I think are strictly learned from my father and a stubbornness I learned that is strictly from him.  And I think I learned about being a woman from my mother, and from my aunts, and from all the women who surrounded me in my life, and I had a great number of remarkable women around me.
Story_ID: 156030
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell us about growing up.  What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I grew up in Oklahoma [City, Oklahoma] with aunts and uncles, and relatives, next door to me, and all up and down the street.  I lived on North East 7th Street.  The northeast side of town was segregated in Oklahoma [City] and whether you were a doctor or worked as a plumber, you know, you would live next door to each other.  There were really no great class distinctions because everybody had to live in the same neighborhood and you saw each other in the grocery store and everyone was really striving.  I know that there were circles inside--class circles in the black community, but that community had borders, and I lived within that, and so my first realization of the fact that I lived--my parents were very protective of me.  I went to all-black schools.  I didn't know any better.  They were not rich.  I would say, they were poor to today's standards, but middle-class or working class--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --to that community.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --to the community, yes.  I never knew that I wasn't rich because my entire family, up and down the street, helped to raise me, so anything I needed, all the way through college; there was an aunt, a cousin, somebody sending it to me.
Speaker 1: Now, your, your brother's [Eugene A. Ferguson] ten years older than you, so you were really the baby girl.
Speaker 2: I was the baby girl, and I was about the last kid on the block, so, yeah, I was spoiled.
Story_ID: 156031
Speaker 1: I went to a school that was outside of the district that was--that my godmother was teaching at, and I ended up having fights all the time with the girl gang from that school district because I was an outsider, and I do mean fights every day.  It's like I had to fight my way through that gang from about the time I was about in the fourth grade through the sixth grade.
Speaker 2: This is a black school?
Speaker 1: This is a black school, uh, huh.
Speaker 2: It was on the other side of town?
Speaker 1: Yes, well, it was on the same side of town but outside of my neighborhood, so I had fights at recess--I mean they picked on me, long braids, outside of the neighborhood, teacher's pet, good grades, whatever the reasons, I would not give them my lunch money, and they picked me, so I was pretty miserable.  If I had been smart, I would have just beaten up the leader of the gang and that would have been the end of it, but I sort of fought my way up through that, and when I think about it now, I realize that it taught me how to fight.  That's a skill that women don't usually have.  It taught me how to fight.  Now, I don't get into fist fights anymore, but I learned some things about that.  I learned that no fight is fair, that you're in it to win, and I learned to not back down.  I learned to be fearless, to fear no person, and to be resolute in my beliefs from childhood.  I think that hardened me in a way, just those four years or so having to fight my way through that gang.  Now, kids today trying to do that, there's guns and there are knives and everything.  When I ended up fighting the biggest girl in the gang, I beat her up.  She was beating me up.  She had me down and she was much bigger than me.  I was really scared of her, but I grabbed her blouse and pulled it off, and she had a bra.  It was in the sixth grade, and everybody was like, "She has a bra."  She was trying to close her, and then I got her, so, again, the point there that I learned was you are in a fight, it's--if you're gonna fight, it's not a clean thing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Do what you got to do to win.
Speaker 2: Now--
Story_ID: 156032
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  What were some of the sights, sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: In Oklahoma [City, Oklahoma], on the East Side, there was the sewage treatment plant, located in our town, in that neighborhood, no doubt as a form of environmental racism, no doubt in my mind, so I grew up smelling that for one thing, and then three doors down from me was an oil well, a large one, and it pumped, and there were fumes from it.  So I had the sewage treatment plant, I had the fumes from the oil well.  So the neighborhood, outside, environmentally, was not pleasant and yet I remember well my mother's [Mary Ferguson] rose garden, and I remember everyone planting the most beautiful flowers, fragrant flowers among that, and so--and there were peach trees in the backyard and a pecan tree, and a cherry tree, so as a child--I mean that sewage treatment plant and the pumping oil well, and the fumes from that were a constant, but if I were to try to escape to climb a tree or go to that garden, the rose garden, and encounter an alternative.  Well, I had flowers and sewage, and when I think about the beautiful gardens everyone planted, I'm sure that it had something to do subconsciously with trying to fight off the smell of the sewage treatment plant that when the wind blew a certain direction, it just wafted into your neighborhood.  It no doubt wafted into my baby crib because it was always there; and when I go back now, it's there.  Of course, now, they have microbiotic things that eat sewage, you know, so they don't smell as bad, but it's still there, it's still there.  And I'm sure that it's there because that was the black neighborhood.
Story_ID: 156033
Speaker 1: In terms of the sights, the street was beautiful.  The homes were well kept.  It didn't look--unlike Kenwood [Chicago, Illinois] in a way--frame houses, but I lived in a four bedroom and two bathroom house and we had fire place and beautiful French doors and everything, so it was a nice house.  My parents [Mary Ferguson and Eugene Ferguson] paid cash for it.  I still have the--they worked to pay cash for it, and the white people who sold it to them wouldn't sell it to them, so my aunt and uncle, who were more prominent couple, bought it and then sold it to my mom and dad.  Then that's also how they bought the house and sold to our relatives next door, and then the relatives.  So that's how we all ended up on the same street, on the same side of the street.
Speaker 2: Okay, is there a reason why they were able to buy it and your parents weren't?
Speaker 1: The owners of the house knew my aunt and uncle and liked them.  They were older, more settled.  My uncle was Pullman porter and my aunt was a teacher, and my mom and dad were a young couple and didn't have that professional standing, so they didn't want to sell to them.  They were trying to sell to the best people they could see to.
Speaker 2: It didn't have anything to do with race?
Speaker 1: No, but they were selling more to class than race.  And in an effort to try, I guess, protect the neighborhood, but, at any rate, my, my aunt and uncle bought the house and then my parents paid them for it.  And I still own that house.

Speaker 1: What, what were you like as a young girl?  Now, you lived between two worlds, this one world that supports you and you are the baby girl of the family, and they can focus a lot of attention on you.  Then you go to this school world, where you are the odd ball, and people are jumping on you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what would your friends say you were like, and what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: I think that after elementary school when academics became more important to all of us that things settled down, but academics were important to me all the time, and I loved to read.  And I was a total bookworm, and because I was an only child, I was very much into the world of books, and I would go in my room, and read, and escape or do my homework, and then do extra, you know, I would go beyond whatever the lesson was, and there was resentment because I had done that, and I guess I was the teacher's pet sometimes.  So I think there were issues of skin coloring, issues of long hair, issues of all of those things; and there were jealousies that happened as a result of that.  When I look back on it now, that's what I think, but I also really always knew I wanted to leave Oklahoma [City, Oklahoma].  At that time I was growing up, it was a time of great transition.  I remember the Spring Lake Amusement Park, and I remember wanting to go there; and I remember my parents [Mary Ferguson and Eugene Ferguson] never wanting to tell me that I couldn't go there because I was black; and on the day that they finally did tell me that, I remember telling them that I wanted to be white.  And I remember that they, then, became radicalized by that idea, and pretty soon I looked up and they were involved in demonstrations out in front of Spring Lake [Amusement] Park.  And I think you saw my prom picture, and I was in this pretty white dress, but actually after the prom when everybody was going to after parties, my date and I went to Spring Lake and we rode the roller coaster.  It was called the Big Dipper, and we rode that roller coaster over and over and over again because Spring Lake Park had just opened up [i.e. desegregated], and we could ride the roller coaster.  My hair was just so pretty and I had on little flowers.  When I was through riding that roller coaster, my hair was all over my head, and I got home and my mother swore I had been doing something else besides the roller coaster, but that was the great thrill for me, and on our prom night, that's what I wanted to do; and my date wanted to do it too, so we would ride that roller coaster over, and over, and over again from every seat, from the back, from the middle, and no hands, and it was really--I knew I couldn't go there, and then I could.
Speaker 1: What a story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 156035
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My aunt was a founder of a, of a Methodist Church in Goodnight [Oklahoma] or in Coil [Oklahoma]--Langston [Oklahoma] was the bigger town, but she founded a Methodist church there, and I'm still--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Was it an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] or C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal] or just Methodist?
Speaker 2: It was Methodist, just Methodist, straight up Methodist church and I'm still a member.  I'm a member of St. Mark's United Methodist [Chicago, Illinois] here, and I was baptized, christened at Quayle United Methodist [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]--Quayle Methodist, at the time, Methodist United during the '60s [1960], and it became United Methodist.  So I'm Methodist; and I have gone to AME churches in New York [City], but I always choose a church that feels right to me.  I choose a church when I go in there, I can feel the collective energy in worship and in praise, and in thanksgiving, and the power of everyone coming together single-mindedly in a positive way as very, very powerful.  So that's what church is for me.  Growing up, it was singing in the choir, and going to Methodist Youth Fellowship, and it was very much social for me; and we did hay rides.  I went through camp with church, Camp Aldersgate in Arkansas and so church was very important.  Interestingly, my mother [Mary Ferguson] and father [Eugene Ferguson] didn't go.  My aunt and uncle next door always took me.  They made me go, but they didn't go.  It was interesting because later on my mother told me that she had had a bad experience with a minister and that she didn't really care for organized religion.  She read her Bible herself and she was very spiritual, but she didn't really care for the way in which the church was organized in our community and she didn't like it because of class reasons.  She didn't like--I don't think she liked the male domination--male dominance is the better way to say that--at the time.  I don't think she like the fact that women didn't have stronger roles, and so I would go to Sunday school and church--I would go to Sunday school and church with my aunt and uncle, and then come home on Sunday and mom would have cooked an amazing dinner.  And we all ate, aunt and uncle too, everybody at our house.  So that was the arrangement.
Story_ID: 156036
Speaker 1: Now, was, was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Popular music or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.  My aunt--my uncle on the other side of me--on the other, in the other household, was a classical musician, who sang, and he was quite famous.  Clarence Griffin was his name, and he performed.  He had a big, big bass voice, and my brother has an amazing tenor voice.  My brother [Eugene A. Ferguson] just retired as a music teacher from the Seattle [Washington] Public School system and music is very much a part of his life.  He is in choirs now.  He arranges music; he writes music.  I enjoy it, but there were so many excellent musicians around me that I didn't compete.  I went to writing instead. So if I were to choose an art form, it would definitely be writing.  It's words.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had a lot of musicians around.
Speaker 2: Oh, I did.  Everyone played an instrument.  I took music lessons.  I was the worse.  I sang.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can read music, I appreciate music.  But I am married to a man who really appreciates music.  My husband [HM Ken Smikle], oh, he understands music in a way that I didn't until he came and started to teach me about jazz, and blues, and gospel, and what was really going on in those genres.  And what musicians were really doing!  You know, I didn't know.  It sounded good. I liked it. I still don't know as much as he does, but it's been really wonderful having someone to explain that to me.
Speaker 1: Now, you grew during the time television was coming into its own.  Radio was still popular, but television was coming.  Did that have a big influence on you?
Speaker 2: Television was born when I was born, 1949 [television broadcasts began in the early 1930s, and popularity of the medium exploded in the late 1940s].  So I didn't watch a lot, but we had a television.  I don't remember ever not having one.  I listened--you know what, I joined the Columbia Record Club and I remember that, so I listened to--my entertainment was reading, listening to those Columbia musicians, Miles Davis, [Dave] Brubeck.
Speaker 1: So you listened to jazz when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did!  They sent them to me and I just listened--you know, whatever I got every month from the jazz series, yeah.  I went to sleep every night listening to Take Five, but I didn't--I liked it from in here, but I didn't know what those musicians were doing until much later when my husband explained to me.  Ken [Smikle] has a picture of him and Miles Davis, and it may be the only picture ever of Miles Davis ever smiling.  You got to get him to show it to you, but--so he made me understand what was going on or helped me to understand what was going on.  So, now, when we go to concerts, he'll whisper in my ear, and say, listen to bla, bla, bla, or listen to this, or listen to this coming up, and that is how I have really learned.
Story_ID: 156037
Speaker 1: Now, you said you were interested in writing and as we get into school more, we'll show this, but did you imagine yourself at all participating in television when you were--?
Speaker 2: No, not as a child.  I didn't--I really, really wanted to be a writer and the only way that I knew to make a living as a writer was a journalist.  I think if I had to do it again, I would be a creative writer, write novels and so forth, but back then, that didn't seem available to me.  I knew nothing of it, and the Harlem Renaissance was happening, but it wasn't happening in Oklahoma [City, Oklahoma], so I didn't really understand that creative writing can be such a powerful tool for our people.  So I went into journalism, and, of course, it has boundaries and constraints.  You are constrained by the truth.  You are constrained by the facts that you can prove.  So when I think of people like Janet Cooke, who made up a story for the Washington Post, I understand even though it was a terrible breach and insult to our community and a violation to all black journalists, and on, and on, but what I understand about that she should have been writing fiction all along.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's creative and that journalism--when I meet children now who say that they love to write, and they love to write poetry, and they like to make things up from whole cloth, I do not steer them towards journalism because making stuff up is the easiest way to get into big trouble as a journalist.
Speaker 1: It's probably more enjoyable to create your own, perhaps?
Speaker 2: For me, it's much more enjoyable to create my own, but what journalism has given me is enough amazing experiences so that now when I sit down to write creatively, I really have something to say, and something that I can show people.  My whole philosophy about journalism, though, is that I really want to show people something they haven't seen, take people somewhere they haven't been, tell them something they haven't heard, and you can also do that with fiction successfully.
Story_ID: 156038
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you about school, well one thing I didn't touch on, before we go through a chronology of school, is--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I had to ask you about newspapers and magazines coming into the house, you know, did you pay a lot of attention to those?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I did.  I read them all from cover to cover.  I was very much into news, very much into current events.  Well, the black newspaper was called, The Black Dispatch.
Speaker 1: The Oklahoma The Black Dispatch.  Okay, I know the beginnings of it, I guess, with Roscoe Dunjee.
Speaker 2: Dunjee. The Black Dispatch and then the Daily Oklahoman, which was very much right-winged, very conservative, you know, read it too.  Now, I still get the Oklahoma Black Chronicle.   And I read at least three or four newspapers at least a day, at least, so including the two Chicago papers [Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times] and the the New York Times every day and sometimes whatever else I want to read for popular culture, and I love the new hip hop magazines, Vibe and all those magazines.  I got those for my son [Jason Smikle]; he's nineteen.  I love those magazines.  I really enjoy reading them just to understand the cul- you know, the young culture.
Speaker 1: Well, you're going to have to explain some of that to me after this interview.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I understand what you're saying.
Story_ID: 156039
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your grade school and when did you first start going to school?
Speaker 2: Okay, I went to Edwards Elementary School [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] at the age of five.  And it was located in Edwards Addition [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma].  It was the newer part of town and that was why my mom wanted me to go there because it was the better school than the school near me.
Speaker 1: So Edwards Addition was a part of town?
Speaker 2: Well, it was an addition onto the northeast side addition--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --so they called it to the Edwards Addition.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it was named after the developer and it was black and it's still there and the school is still there.
Speaker 1: So you were there I guess from about five until--you said about the fourth grade?
Speaker 2: No, until the fifth grade, the fifth grade.
Speaker 1: Then where did you go?
Speaker 2: Then I went to Moon Junior High School [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], which was really seventh grade through ninth grade, and then I went--I know I've skipped a year because there was a year that I went another elementary school that was near me but I can't remember the name of it, and then I went to Douglass High School [Frederick A. Douglass Mid-High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma].
Speaker 1: This is like Frederick Douglass?
Speaker 2: Douglass, yes, it's still there, but, again, it was the all-black school.  All my teachers were black except for one.
Speaker 1: That's all the way through school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I grew up quite differently. [HM] Ken [Smikle] grew up in New York [City], you know, and his whole life was completely diverse and integrated.  Mine was not.  I didn't know any white people until I was in college.  I went to Indiana [University] in Bloomington [Indiana], and my roommate was about the first white person I knew.  I knew one white girl from Y[MCA, Young Men's Christian Association] teen camp that she and I knew each other, and but that was it.
Speaker 1: So Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] was highly segregated I would have to say, but the black people that lived there, from what I know, about Oklahoma City, they have a lot of capacity and have strong communities.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very strong community and very--I would say there was every expectation that I would succeed.  There was no expectation that I would fail.  There was no expectation that I would do anything but be excellent.  There was no acceptance of the possibility that I would be anything but excellent and I still feel that way, period.
Speaker 1: So you couldn't--you weren't allowed to slip?  Did you ever?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't an option.  It wasn't an option.  I don't think that it wasn't even an option for me.
Speaker 1: So you never thought, "Well, I just don't feel like doing this today?"
Speaker 2: Not to this day, not to this day.  I didn't feel like doing this interview today.  I mean we had a judge killed; I mean we had a judge whose family was killed.  There was a tremendous amount of pressure on me at work to help with that story.  I wanted to help with that story but I had made this commitment; and I told them, "Hey, I made this commitment.  Commitment is a commitment."   So that's that, I'm here doing this, and I think that is also something that my parents [Mary Ferguson and Eugene Ferguson] were very strong on--when you say you're going to do something, you must do it.
Story_ID: 156040
Speaker 1: Now, when you look at school--now, I know you had all black teachers and a strong community behind you.  Are there, there any single, individual teachers or adults in the community that were especially concerned with your development and who helped you?
Speaker 2: My favorite teacher was my journalism teacher and his name was Willard Pitts.  And he teaches journalism at Langston University [Langston, Oklahoma] now.  And he was the first person honestly and in a very straightforward way that I absolutely could do this, that I absolutely had the skills; had the writing ability; the curiosity; had the personality to do this.  And that I had chosen right and that I could do it.  He helped me get a job at the Daily Oklahoman on the teen page; and they gave me a college scholarship.  The Daily Oklahoman as right-winged as it is and was, the E.K. Gaylord, the family still owns it.  They gave me a college scholarship.  So that was my high school mentor, and Willard Pitts is someone that I am thankful to to this day for the way he encouraged my journalism career because I didn't really have any role models in the white establishment press.  I certainly have excellent role models among black journalists.
Speaker 1: Did you know any of them coming up?
Speaker 2: Not really, no.  No, not really, I didn't!  I didn't know them.  I knew other leaders in our community but I didn't really know them.
Speaker 1: Were the Dunjees still running the the Black Dispatch?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were, and my aunt and uncle next door were really good friends with them, but I didn't know them to go to their paper, and look at it, and get a job there.  I got a job at the white paper go figure, but that was where Willard [Pitts] thought I ought to go, and that was the opportunity he saw for me.  And that was where he wanted me to have an experience for some reason.  The experience was, you know, a positive enough experience.  Basically, I wrote stories about my high school [Douglass High School, later Frederick A. Douglass Mid-High School] and they printed them.  So it wasn't--there wasn't anything really.  It's not like I had a desk in the newsroom (laughter).
Speaker 1: So this is the mid '60s [1960] from '63 [1963] to '67 [1967] basically?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) around and--
Story_ID: 156041
Speaker 1: --Had things--had social conditions started to change in Oklahoma [City, Oklahoma] at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had, they had but there were sit-in demonstrations every weekend to go, you know--sit-in demonstrations to eat in the lunch counters, and sit-in demonstrations to even be able to try on clothes at the department stores; and there were demonstrations, people going to jail all the time, on the weekends especially; and that was going on.  My brother [Eugene A. Ferguson], who is older than me, was a part of that.  My parents [Mary Ferguson and Eugene Ferguson] wouldn't let me go.  My parents and my neighbors, and my relatives did go.  And I think I became very radicalized by that; and it defined me in terms of the way I look at life and my determination to look at conditions of our people, and to understand what it is what we go through and to listen very carefully to what people say, and to hear it, really hear it.
Speaker 1: So it sounds like you came from a household where there were a lot of politics of the day were being discussed--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --We were activists.
Speaker 1: And you could see change taking place?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was discussed, acted upon, debated hotly.  My uncle, next door, was a Republican, and would come over, and go with my parents and argue with him every day.  I guess--I think he liked [Dwight D.] Eisenhower and even [Richard] Nixon, so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Those are days I remember that the black community--the last thing I remember there being a discussion in a black community about who the president should be is when [John F.] Kennedy ran against Nixon in 1960.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The kids were taken to school--the school seemed to be split and we were in school about the same time.
Speaker 2: That's right.  I don't think the kids in my school were that split, but among the relatives--remember I'm living next door to relatives, and they were all in and out of each other's houses all the time--were always debating about those things.  They were split.  Some were Republicans and some of them were Democrats.  My parents were Democrats and they wanted Kennedy; and my relatives in my house--in our own household were split up that--over Nixon.  And I think they had all voted for Eisenhower.
Speaker 1: Now what organization was prominent in the demonstrations in Oklahoma City?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was the Oklahoma [City] chapter of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Clara Luper, if you go to any NAACP National Convention now, you'll still find her there.  And I think she has written a great history of the struggle for desegregation in Oklahoma City ['Behold the Walls,'1979].
Speaker 1: How do you spell her last name?
Speaker 2: L-U-P-E-R. Clara Luper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She's still active?
Speaker 2: She is still alive.  And that is a good book.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you think--I suppose you were watching activities of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] in the paper and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], I guess?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I, by the time I was in college [at Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], felt that [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was just not radical enough.  My parents were appalled at my thinking, but I really did feel that Stokely Carmichael and H. Rap Brown--I really felt that they were right that we had to be much more radical, and that turning the other cheek would not work, and that nonviolent, civil disobedience would not work.  Now, of course, I understand it, but, at the time, I did not think that that was nearly enough and I'd think it was going to get us where we needed to go.  It certainly didn't seem like it was going to get me where I wanted to go--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay. So well--
Speaker 2: --the fighter that I was (laughter).  Remember, I grew up fighting in the streets.
Story_ID: 156042
Speaker 1: Well, when you're in--I know in junior high school [Moon Junior High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], you're the editor of the, the school newspaper, and you are, you are designated as someone who was going to become a journalist right by other--?
Speaker 2: I was even in the seventh grade, they said that I was the person--they predicted that I was the person most likely to become a journalist!  Really, I said out loud for the first time when I was eleven years old.  I remember the moment when I said out loud.  You know how when you say something out loud, you can really hear it.  It resonates within you, and then you just do it.
Speaker 1: It's the word, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's the word.  It's saying it.
Speaker 1: The muntu [ph.] the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --exactly.  So it was muntu, and it was exactly that; and I said it, and then set out to do it.
Story_ID: 156043
Speaker 1: One day I was working at the Indianapolis News, newspaper and I was getting ready to go to work, and I turned on the television, and I saw Michele Clark.  Do you remember Michele Clark?  Michele Clark worked for CBS News.  She was killed at Midway [Airport, Chicago, Illinois] when the plane crashed there, but, at the time, she was this beautiful black woman who was working for CBS National News.  I saw her, and I watched her.  I watched her.  She was reading a story.  She was anchoring the morning news, and I looked at her; and I said, "I want to do that. I can do that."  I saw that powerful, visual element that comes with television--that powerful, visual element that no newspaper can replicate.  I saw it used for journalistic reasons and I took a hard, long look at it for the very first time.  I remember that day too, that moment; and I said, "I want to do that," so I talked to the only black person that I knew who was in television.  It was a young man at the time in Indianapolis [Indiana], and he was getting ready to leave and go to Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Now, this is when you're already--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I'm out of college [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana].
Speaker 2: You're already out of college.  We got to go back to when you're college at some point, but it's okay.
Speaker 1: All right, he was out of--he was going to Detroit, and he said he would recommend me for his job at channel thirteen, which was the ABC [sic, NBC] station at the time in Indianapolis at the time, WLWI [later WTHR] was what it was called back then.  I didn't have a tape.  I had no TV experience; and I just gave them my resume, gave them my writing samples from journalism.  They videotaped me and I did an audition in their studio; and they hired me.  That would never happen today because that is the sixteenth largest market, but, at the time, there were no black people on the air, and they wanted someone.  There were no women on the air, so they hired me.  I was their first black woman that they hired there, and it, it was quite an experience.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I needed all those fighting, street fighting skills--
Story_ID: 156044
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm going to take you back to college [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] (unclear).  High school [Douglass High School, later Frederick A. Douglass Mid-High School] grad- you graduated from high school in '67 [1967]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Alright. And then you--
Speaker 2: I went to Indiana University.
Speaker 1: How did you choose Indiana University from Ok- all the way from Oklahoma [City, Oklahoma]?  I had a few choices, but Indiana had a good journalism program; and my brother [Eugene A. Ferguson], who is a musician, influenced me because they had great music school.  And my parents influenced me because they felt that rather than going to Columbia [University] in New York [New York]--they didn't think--from Oklahoma,  they didn't think I could handle New York; they thought from Oklahoma, I could handle Indiana on my own, so it was a consensus but also they gave me a scholarship, and they wrote me, and they had a black counselor call me, and come to see and recruit me, so I went because they gave me money; they showed a tremendous interest, and it was an environment that I thought I could handle.
Speaker 2: Your brother knew something about the music department.
Speaker 1: Yes, my brother thought--they all thought it was a good, and the journalism department was excellent.
Speaker 2: Was David Baker there when you were there?
Speaker 1: David Baker was there!  Yes, he was, which was tremendous!
Speaker 2: That was in the music department.
Speaker 1: That was the music department, but I mean--you know, in all of my studies, he was one of my teachers.  And--what is her name?  Fleming [ph.], she was an actress, black woman.  You know I took a lot of courses with black professors--any course I could find with black professors, black studies, everything--it was multidisciplinary at that time, they didn't have Afro-American or African American studies program at that time, but they had history; they had politics; they had music; they had jazz.  I just took all the courses.  It was so wonderful--so important to me to do that.
Speaker 2: So you had a good experience at Indiana [University].
Speaker 1: Oh, I did. It was a pretty wild place.  You know, my first week there, the ROTC [Reserve Officers Training Corps] building was burned down by the anti-war demonstrations.  It was a radical school actually at that point.  You wouldn't think that Indiana being--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you tend to think of [Robert Montgomery] Bobby Knight, basketball team and then--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Klu Klux Klan [KKK], home of the Klan.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Indiana is like very southern kind of northern state--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: This is southern Indiana in Bloomington, right down by Kentucky, but it was radical, and the Black Panthers were on campus.  There was a lock-out--or a lock-in.  It was a lock-in of the board of trustees when they were going increase the tuition and cut some programs that black people wanted--black students wanted.  We locked them all in.  We stormed the board of trustees meeting, locked them in, wouldn't let them out until they promised to--it was kidnapping--some people were indicted.  I got away with it because I was writing--I was covering it.  (Laughter)  and I was, I was, I was covering it.  I did cover it.  I wrote stories about it, and they, they went out every day.
Story_ID: 156045
Speaker 1: And I also worked for the Daily Herald-Telephone, [now the Herald-Times] which was the Bloomington, Indiana newspaper, and the editor and publisher of the Daily Herald-Telephone had an airplane and he was a pilot, and he would fly me to the hot spots, where news was going on to write for the newspaper, and I foolishly went with him in this small airplane that he was flying.  He took me to Jackson State [University, Jackson, Mississippi] when those shootings occurred in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --in the 1970, spring of '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: --took me to Jackson State.  He took me to Kent State [University, Kent, Ohio, 1970].  I covered that.  He took me to wherever anything was going on, but we would in his airplane.  My roommate would go with me, Christine Harris [ph.].  She was my roommate.  She was journalism major, a television major, and we would go, and, you know, he drank and flew.  I didn't know about that--I mean I didn't understand.  He was--and we're making these visual landings and half the time, he couldn't find the run way--he's like "look at the window for the airport."  We were kids.  We did it.  It was such an adventure, but I wrote good stories.  I wrote good stories; and I would go and do anything and go anywhere, and write good stories.  I was very dedicated to that.  And then I wrote for the [Indiana] Daily Student, the Indiana Daily Student, that was the student newspaper; and I worked for the--I also worked at this school's--I did news releases for the university [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] public relations department.  I wrote news releases, so I was very steep in doing all this news writing.  Plus, I had three jobs.  I worked three jobs and went to school, and made A's.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we have seen the grades firsthand; and they are A's.  So you had three jobs at the same time? I mean, at the same time?
Speaker 1: At the same time.  That's energy and youth for you.
Speaker 2: What were you doing?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --But you know what they kind of overlapped.  They were all writing, and the stories I did for the Herald-Telephone I could a version of it for the Daily Student, and the stories I did for the  the Daily Student, I could change into the one for the the Herald Telephone, you know, so I was doing the student newspaper but I was also was working for a real newspaper, and then the public relations job for the university let me know everything that was going on in the university, which then I would go and look at all those news releases and see find interesting sources and find people to write interesting stories.  So it all--it was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But all these jobs had to do with journalism and writing?
Speaker 1: They all had to do with writing and journalism, and they all worked together just fine.

Speaker 1: Was Mari Evans around campus [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] in those days?  I know she is an Indiana poet (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Now--yeah, she wasn't unfortunately.  I think she came right after me.  I was in a sorority.  I was in AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha].  I pledged there, tau chapter, and there was a good social life among students, and my white roommate taught me golf.  She was a physical ed [physical education] major.  They called it "Hyper."  She was a health and physical ed [education] major, but she would never take me home with her.  She was from a small little town, and I always wondered why.  I was so naive.
Speaker 1: In Indiana, a small town in Indiana?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I always wondered why she wouldn't take me home with her and one time I just asked her, "Why you won't take me home with you?"  She said, "Oh, the people in my hometown have never seen a black person."  So, there it was.
Speaker 1: It might actually be true in Indiana.
Speaker 2: She was honest.  She was honest about it.  She said, "Oh, no, I can't take you home with me. It would cause an uproar."
Speaker 1: So did you have a black student organization?  I guess you did.
Speaker 2: Yes, we did.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Black Students Union, and we had space in the student union and I don't know.  There had to be about three, four thousands of us on campus at the time, so between the Black Students Union and the AKA, the Ques [Omega Psi Phi], the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi], the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta], I think the Sigmas [Phi Beta Sigma] were on campus, I'm not sure about that, I don't know, we had a very full and interesting life, campus life.
Story_ID: 156047
Speaker 1: So I got to tell you about my college [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] adventure.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: I interned at The Washington Post, which was really fun; and Indiana University, being located in Bloomington, Indiana did not get the--our journalism school did not receive the leaflets or any invitation for interns to go to The Washington Post.  The Washington Post sent its intern program applications to the seven sister colleges and to the Ivy leagues.  I didn't know anything about that.  I just knew that it was the paper where [Robert] Bob Maynard wrote.  Bob Maynard, as you know, was a great black journalist.  He is dead now, but he was an amazing writer, and he wrote with such passion, and he saw things in such a way; and I would just hang on to every word that he wrote in The Washington Post, so I knew I wanted to go there as an intern.  And I kept waiting for the internship application to come and it never came; and by the time it did arrive--well, it didn't arrive, I called them.  And they sent me one, but by the time they sent it, they had already chosen all their--you know, the deadline had passed, so I said, so "You didn't send one to Indiana [University]," and they said, "We're sorry, we'll send it," and then I sent it in, and I got a call from a man named Philip [L.] Geyelin and Phil Geyelin was the editorial page editor at the [Washington] Post at the time, very famous man, Pulitzer Prize winning writer, he called me and said, "Well, I'm going to be in Chicago [Illinois] to interview our applicants.  I'll be at the Newsweek office.  Will you come for an interview?"  I said, "Of course, I will."  And I had no money, and no way to get there, and no bus fare, and no car fare, and nothing to get to Chicago on very short notice, so I took my rent money, and I got a bus, and found my way to the Newsweek building, and I interviewed with Mr. Geyelin and he said at the time, "Well, we really don't have anymore openings."  And I said, "Well, why did you have me come here if you weren't going to really consider me?"  He said, "Well, that's a good question, isn't it."  I said, "Yeah." I said, "I don't think that's fair."  I said, "You can have as many openings as you want," and he said, "We can, can't we?"  I said, "Absolutely."  He said, "Well, I'm going to interview other people."  He said, "I'll call you and let you know."  And I said, "Well, I hope the phone is on because I spent all my money for my rent and the telephone to come up here." He looked at me and started laughing.  He said, "Well, okay."  And he goes in his wallet--I've never seen that much money in my life.  He pulls out a $100.00 bill and hands it to me.  He says, "How are you going to get back?"  I said, "Well, I was going to hitch hike."  He said, "No." He said, "Here's the money.  Take the bus, pay your rent, pay your phone bill.  I have kids in college and I understand."  He said, "I don't want you out there on the road hitchhiking."  He was so nice, and a few days later, I got the call and I got the job, so that summer, I worked on--they created that position 'cause they didn't (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, this is what summer?
Speaker 1: It must have been 1970--it must have been 1970, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is just after the Kent State [shootings, at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio in May 1970] and all that.
Story_ID: 156048
Speaker 1: And he had my clippings and everything too, and so he--they [The Washington Post] hired me for the summer.  It was a paid internship and I got a relative in Washington [D.C.] who was going to be gone the whole summer, so I got to babysit her house, so I had an apartment; and I worked on the editorial page.  So every day, I was in meetings with Phil [Philip L.] Geyelin, Meg Greenfield, Mrs. [Katharine Meyer] Graham, her son, Donald [Graham].  I was in meetings with them every day in which they decided the position that the newspaper was going to take on any given subject.  And I sat there in their meetings every day.  I was a teenager.  And they invited me--they asked me what would I like to write about.  And so, I said, "Well, I would like to write about things the young people are involved in, the radical movement, the black movement, the women's movement."  And I voiced my interest, "education;" and they said, "Okay, you're our specialist in all of those things, research them and write for us.  Write our opinion."  They let me do that.  I couldn't believe it.  I was what, nineteen?  Now, some of the things that I have written that I wrote back then have come to haunt me.  I don't believe anything like that now, but they got reproduced because they were in the Washington Post.  So it was very good--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: What things--can you share things that?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, the worst one, the very worst one that I wrote was an opinion piece on black women and the women's movement and how we're not a part of it, didn't want to be a part of it, such an embarrassment.
Speaker 2: I understand that the thinking in those days though--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --it was.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --considered the women's movement at some level--as interloping into the black struggle.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --as interloping into the black struggle and white, and not dealing with the issues that black women had to face, and trivial when they burned their bras because the issues were much more serious for black women as in control of your body and so forth.  Now, I don't think that way.  I am a feminist actually and the women's movement is a very important part of my life, and I do find that black women and white women have very much in common, although not everything, but, at the time, I wrote an article from a very narrow field of experience, and because it was in the Washington Post, it kept getting reprinted in sociology books and all kinds of places, where it was point to as an example of how black women did not feel that the women's movement has invited them.  To an extent, that is true on that whole side, but it's much more complex than that.
Speaker 2: Do you think that because the women's movement was opposed primarily by men, that your comments were reproduced and distributed so liberally?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  Yeah, I was used, and black men too as far as that went.  So, yeah, I have lived to see that more times than I want to, but that's an example of how open they were at that time to me.  I met [President Richard] Nixon in the Oval Office and asked him questions about the war in Vietnam, and I mean they let me do anything and everything.  It was very good.  I was totally in over my head.  I was a kid.
Story_ID: 156049
Speaker 1: But [Robert] Bob Maynard was the person who I connected with, more than Phil [Philip L.] Geyelin, more than Mrs. [Katharine Meyer] Graham and more than Meg Greenfield, although I connected with them all.  Bob Maynard really became my role model.  He told me that as an idol he had feet of clay and for me to stop idolizing him, but it wasn't so much him as it was his writing, and the way in which he saw the world, the way in which he looked.  He explained to me that when he went to a story, that whatever was going on that was obvious to everyone else was not what he was looking for.  He was always looking beyond what was obvious, so the street where all the reporters were on, he went the other way.  You know, that's just the way I am.  I'm exactly like that today.  I mean by the time this ever gets published, we may have an answer.  Right now, everyone thinks that Matthew Hale and the white supremacists are the people who had the judge's husband and mother killed.  I immediately have looked into her husband's life, and found that he had quite a few enemies and people who were angry at him, so I've reported that.  People are not happy that I've reported that because the man is dead.  It's a much sexier story that it's the white supremacist.
Speaker 2: He is an innocent victim of the wife--he's innocent anyway, I guess, of that kind of crime.
Speaker 1: Everyone is looking at her cases and this being retaliation for--and they did try to kill her, I mean they plotted to kill her, so that's the obvious; and I'm not so sure that's not true.  We may learn that that's true, but the way I look at journalism is a much broader way, and that's because of Bob Maynard, so on the day that everyone is going down that one road, I said to my news director, "We haven't looked at his cases, and we haven't looked at his life," and when we looked, we found that he had sued a bunch of people for fees, and most attorneys do not sue their client for fees, and that he had entered into quite some nasty lawsuits, himself, not that he represented people.  He wasn't lawyer, but that he sued people on his own; and there were some really rancorous lawsuits.  So that's there too.  And I know the police are looking at that.  So I look at things in a much broader.  I look at the obvious.  I see it, but looking beyond the obvious is what I learned from Bob Maynard and that was the most important lesson in journalism I will ever--that I ever learned, and I got it from him, a black man, who worked at The Washington Post at the time.
Story_ID: 156050
Speaker 1: It would seem, you know, to me, being black in this world, I mean you would see things a little differently anyway, but that's not always manifest in people that make into the big time, you know, they tend to become more conservation to try to into the mainstream.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they feel that that's required.  I don't.  In fact, I feel that it's important to not be.  I feel that it's important to be oppositional.  I feel that it's important to look at everything that everybody else is not looking at; and more often than not, that's where the answers are found.  That's how I built my career.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's not looking at the obvious stuff.
Story_ID: 156051
Speaker 1: Now, what were you the most proud of that you wrote for The Washington Post.  You mentioned some of the problematic stuff.  Is there anything, is there anything that you really nailed something and you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, I was an intern, so I don't know.  I did features for education.  I did--you know, the things that I did won awards for college students.  I don't really remember them.   You know, I don't really remember them.  What I remember was not so much what I wrote but who I met and how they taught me to look at the world.  Phil [Philip L.] Geyelin, very, very methodical man, you know, who looked at the world with great compassion.  He was wealthy.  He didn't need to get a paycheck, and he had great feeling and compassion.  I mean he went in his wallet and gave me money.  When I wasn't sure where I was going to live, he and his wife invited me to stay with them.  Of course, I was a college student.  I didn't want to be with parents.  I had my own apartment even if it was in a rough neighborhood.  And then Meg Greenfield, again, another oppositional person, so while everybody else is going down one road, Meg is looking at it in an entirely different way; and that was what she said to me, you know, "Do not follow the pack because they're all going to get to the same place at the same time, and you won't have told people anything."  And it gets to that whole thing, I want to take you somewhere you haven't been or show something you haven't seen or tell you something that you don't know.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Geyelin?
Speaker 2: G-E-Y-L-A-N [sic].
Speaker 1: And Meg Greenfield, what capacity was she?
Speaker 2: These were all Pulitzer prize-winning famous editorial page writers.  She died a few years ago, and Mr. Geyelin died recently, and, you know, Mrs. [Katharine Meyer] Graham died too, and Bob Maynard is gone.  One for print journalism, you worked hard and you played hard, and a lot of print journalists smoked, didn't take care of their bodies.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was [HM] Dorothy [B.] Gilliam there when you were there?
Speaker 2: Dorothy Gilliam was not there, no, but I got to know her through the National Association of Black Journalists.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 156052
Speaker 1: I worked at the Indianapolis News [later, Indianapolis Star, Indianapolis, Indiana] on the obituary desk, hated it, but it was good experience, and then, I did--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Now, that's after you graduated?
Speaker 1: Yeah, after I graduated from Indiana [University, Bloomington, Indiana].
Speaker 2: So when you graduated, you graduated with honors I assume after seeing these--got these ostentatious grades?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did, but you want to hear something?  It was radical time.  I didn't go to graduation.  We all boycotted the graduation.  My parents [Mary Ferguson and Eugene Ferguson] were so upset that they didn't see me walk across the stage, but I was like "please, I want out into the world."
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you went to Indianapolis [Indiana] rather than coming back home or going back to Oklahoma City [Oklahoma]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, my parents told me I was too radical for Oklahoma and that I would probably not survive.  They thought I would be put in jail for my ideas, and thoughts, and how I was, and they told me absolutely not to come back.
Speaker 2: Really, they were that?
Speaker 1: They were emphatic about it--to not come back to Oklahoma.  "You do not fit in here.  You're way too radical in your ideas, in your thinking.  This place is too conservative for you."
Speaker 2: Okay, so, Indianapolis does not seem to be one of the most liberal places either.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't, but it was a start.
Speaker 2: So why did you choose, was it because it was close by?
Speaker 1: It was where I could get a job.  Yeah, the Indianapolis News recruited me and I worked there for a year before I went to TV, and then I went to TV at WLWI [later WTHR], and, you know, the newspaper business, especially, was completely male-dominated.  The only woman at the Indianapolis News at the time, and I took her place, had spent her entire career on the obituary desk; and they thought I was going to do that, and I wasn't about to do that.  I hated it, although I found it to be an interesting challenge to write people's lives after I used some of the techniques from 'The Power of Positive Thinking' [by Norman Vincent Peale] to psyche myself up to going to work at five a.m. and to write about dead people.  Nonetheless, I, later came to understand that that was--everybody wrote obits at first, that was just a part of it, but I didn't see myself doing that, especially having interned at The Washington Post, and they probably would have hired me. I just thought I would be in over my head.  I knew I was, and so I didn't want to ruin that, so I was just thought I would work at a smaller paper and then go there.  That was my plan and then I got waylaid by television.
Story_ID: 156053
Speaker 1: Alright, you explained earlier how your friend left the station and you know, recommended you and you got in so you were kind of surprised at the ease in which you were able to--
Speaker 2: Actually, I thought I would get the job.  I never thought that I wasn't going to do anything that I wanted.  You know, failure just doesn't even cross my mind.  I don't even consider it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was the example of Michele Clark that kind of excited you about television?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at five a.m. instead of going in and doing obituaries, I thought I could do that.  It looked better.
Speaker 1: So how were you used at the WLWI [later WTHR]?  That's part of the WLWI family stations, including Dayton [Ohio], Cincinnati [Ohio], Columbus [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Right, you are familiar with them.  I was a general assignment reporter; and a man named [William H.] Bill Dean [Jr.] was the news director, and he taught me television.  He taught me the technical.  He didn't have to teach me journalism, but Bill Dean taught me television, and he taught me film, and he taught me how to use it and how to visualize my stories, and, you know, the angles that you shoot your interviews with, and how you ask questions.  And back then, everything was on film, so we had to get back, and deadlines, and writing, editing, you know, with twenty-eight frames per second and all of that.  He taught me those technical things about television.  He taught me some of the performing skills that I needed.  Eventually, I anchored and David Letterman was the weatherman when I was there on the weekends.
Speaker 1: That's right you said that.  That's true he is a famous Indiana personality.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He uses the Indiana sweatshirt on television from time to time, but this aspect of performing--now, he is, you know, one of the biggest stars on television, you know.
Speaker 2: He got fired from that station and left.  He got fired for a stunt that we did--and I didn't get fired because he didn't give me up, but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: We had a guy on the Fourth of July weekend who came in with a bunch of illegal fireworks, and he left some of them there.  And Dave [David Letterman] and I after the broadcast was over, went to the top of the station and set off those fireworks.  You know he's like that, he likes that.
Speaker 1: He likes to throw stuff off buildings.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --off buildings, now.  And so we did that; and one of the rockets landed on a roof of a nursing home.  Somebody had to call the fire department, and he called, to his great integrity, the fire department; and the evidence was there then that he had done it, and he didn't deny it, but he didn't give me up, and so he got fired.  I was so sad.  He was so happy.  He was off to Hollywood.  He was going to do stand-up comedy and the rest is history for him.  So, yeah, I got to stay in Indianapolis [Indiana] and he got to go make his way, and I made my way, but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: In terms of your own skill on air, did you take any theater in school or any speech?
Speaker 2: Only in high school [Douglass High School, later Frederick A. Douglass Mid-High School], I was involving in acting and performing in high school, but there is definitely a performance part of what we do in television.  I mean it's about communicating and coming through the camera.  And you need to do that.  You need to do that.  Of course, the real way to do that is to be not an actor, but to be just honest, and to be from the heart, and to be confident in what you're doing, but to just, you know, talk to the camera like you talk to a person.  And either you can do that or you can't.
Story_ID: 156054
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any role model in mind that you, you know, from, from watching television, you know, as to how you wanted to project yourself or connect?  You know, you have so many different styles, you got like [Chet] Huntley and [David] Brinkley, two very different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) they're all guys.
Speaker 1: And Walter, Walter Cronkite, you know, speaking like that.  Yeah, they're all guys.
Speaker 2: They were all guys.  There were no women, Barbara Walters and she spoke with an East Coast accent.
Speaker 1: And she was constantly ridiculed too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she as ridiculed too, but I think Jane Pauley took her as a role model and began to speak with that eastern accent.  Jane and I went to college [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] together and she didn't sound like that back then.
Speaker 1: Jane Pauley went to Indiana [University]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And yeah, no, she was a Hoosier--
Speaker 1: I thought she was a New Yorker.
Speaker 2: By the way she talks, right.  And she took Barbara Walters's affect.  You know, I'm black, I couldn't do that, well, no way was I doing that, so there really wasn't anybody, which then just allowed me to myself.  It just allowed me to be me.  And the funny story about being me in that TV station in Indianapolis [Indiana] was that my news director, shortly after he hired said that I had to cut my afro, I had a big afro, a big [HM] Angela Davis-kind of afro.  And he said, "You've got to cut your afro because you're scaring white people, you're scaring our audience."  Now, the day he told me to cut my afro, I was gonna cut it; I was going to straighten my hair.  I mean if you look the history of my videotape, you will see a thousand different hairstyles because, you know, I change my hair, and tomorrow it may be curly, or it may be short, or whatever, and when he told me I had to cut my afro, that meant to me that I had to keep it another year or two.  I refused.  I said, "They have to get used to this."
Speaker 1: So what happened?  Were there repercussions?
Speaker 2: He just didn't say anything else about it.  People called and complained bitterly, but they got over it.  You know, I was doing stories.  They got used to seeing me on the air.  I was doing stories.
Speaker 1: Now, this is 1972, right?
Speaker 2: 1971, '72 [1972].  Well '72 [1972], '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: During this period of time in Indiana--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And I stayed there until 1977.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had all kinds of hairstyles in between (laughter).
Story_ID: 156055
Speaker 1: Tell us about the National Black Political Assembly [sic, the National Black Political Convention] in Gary, Indiana in 1972.  Now, you covered that, right?
Speaker 2: I did.  I covered it.  I wrote about it.  It was a profound and moving situation because it was truly about black empowerment, Mayor [HM Richard] Hatcher had been elected, the first black mayor I believe it was or the second, I'm not sure.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --The second of a major city, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he was there.  [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson was there.  The entire civil rights leadership was there from the North, and I just remember writing about it, and being very fired about our political possibilities, and about our economic possibilities, but, at the time, our political possibilities is what we were looking because we saw at that time that politics and political power would allow us entree to the economic power that we would need to have and to possess any real power, so the first step was to try to get political power.  I mean they laid it out in which they talked about.  You know, running for office, how to do that, what our political agenda was.  And what, you know, this was a very nationalistic thing to do and it was very pragmatic to do it; and it was very democratic in the way it was done, have a convention; let everyone talk about it; have everyone discuss it; have it be open to the media; set a national agenda and then try to follow it.  And I must say that I honestly believe that the decision that Jesse Jackson made to run for president was born on that day.  When I think back on it and I think back on what he said, and the things he said in his speeches and everything, it was born on that day if not before but, I mean, he sort of--he said it on that day.  He said the things--you could see it formulating in his mind.  Okay, you're telling everybody to run, and you're telling people to run from grassroots, and, of course, he's starting at the top, which I understand that.  I understand that perfectly.
Speaker 1: Okay.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Very powerful, and empowering for me too.
Speaker 1: Are there any other personalities that you remember from that convention that you thought were really going to, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, no, it's been a long time.  Mayor Hatcher, of course, who's a celebrity then, but I do remember coming back and writing about it; and I have the articles that I wrote about it.  And I do remember feeling very empowered by it and very excited about the possibilities.
Story_ID: 156056
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have any local politicians in Indianapolis [Indiana] that, that appeared to be on the rise, black politicians?
Speaker 2: I'm sure there were, but don't ask me who they were.  Well, Julia--what is her name--because she is member of Congress now. Julia [Carson]--I can't remember her name, I can see her face.  But there was a delegation from Indianapolis--from Indiana, they were there.  And I'm sure, if we were to look at that delegation, all of them went into politics and became very prominent and worked very hard for the people.  I mean that's the real thing is to work for our people, whatever we're doing, whatever you do, it needs to be for our people.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, oh we were talking about the development of the [Indiana] Black Expo in Indianapolis too.  Now, that happened in the early '70s [1970], and you were there when that happened?
Speaker 2: It did.  I was a kid.  It seemed like fun, but the economic development of it was huge.  It was obviously huge, and I know I covered that too, but Indianapolis was--you know, it was a very interesting kind of place.  It was sort of a bastion of liberalism or progressiveness in an otherwise very conservative state.
Story_ID: 156057
Speaker 1: And when I think about how I was hired and I think about what they--you know, they sent me to the border back then to do stories on illegals coming up; and we've followed a coyote who brought illegals up from Mexico and we shot pictures of them crossing over the Rio Grande river in the morning.  And we shot pictures of a border patrol officer shooting at them.  We hid in the bushes, me and my cameraman, and shot amazing stuff.  I did really, really good stories there.
Speaker 2: The border patrol?  The United States Border Patrol--
Speaker 1: The United States--
Speaker 2: --would actually shoot illegal aliens coming across?
Speaker 1: Yeah, "Halte, hombre, halte," [sic] and a shot in the air.  We got it all.  We were hiding. Nobody knew we were there, certainly not the border patrol and not those people who were coming across.  We found out the place where people were going to cross or cross mostly that day.  It was a place where the river was quite low, and we were there in four in the morning and they were coming across and then a border patrol comes out, and people take off running, and he is chasing after them.  If I had--now, did they know we were there and did they stage the whole thing, but, no, not really, not shooting at innocent people like that, although it was up in the air.  That story got me my job in Chicago [Illinois].  It was a big deal.
Speaker 2: Okay now what year was this story?
Speaker 1: It was 1977.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, I shot it probably 1976 and, you know, there were the efforts to organize the migrant labor in this country.  Cesar Chavez led that from California, but those efforts were going on everywhere.  And they were going on in Indiana; and I would go to--I did stories on migrant labor camps and the horrible conditions that people were required to live in there.  And I remember one time a farmer coming with a big shotgun and demanding that me and my cameramen get off his property; and I stand there with my hands in my hips, telling him that we were invited in by the people who lived in the migrant labor camps and the Supreme Court had just ruled that those people who lived there lived there, and that they could invite whoever they wanted in and that included us, and we were invited, and we weren't leaving.  At which time he proceeded to beat the crap out of my cameraman.  Not me, I was a woman.
Speaker 2: You did all the talking.
Speaker 1: I did all of that mouthing off, and he got the blows, so, yeah.  And my cameraman had just come back from Vietnam.  He said, "You know, I am back from the war.  I don't need this, Renee, where did you take me," but he and I talk all the time.  His name is Pat Thatcher [ph.] and we talk all the time.  We still talk and we talk about all the things and situations that we seemed to have gotten into.  People would always take their frustrations out about me on him, which actually has happened more than once.  They will see me and they will beat up the cameraman.
Story_ID: 156058
Speaker 1: Tell me now, the WLW [WLWI, later WTHR] stations, you know, form sort of a little network of sorts, I mean for instance all the Cincinnati Reds games were shared by all the stations.
Speaker 2: Okay, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: 'Phil Donahue Show' was shared by all the stations because that's where he got his start, this little network.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He was in Dayton [Ohio] doing the 'Phil Donahue Show' when you started there.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, and Darlene Hayes, his producer, is my very good friend.
Speaker 1: Okay, were your reports similarly circulated among the WLW stations when you were on the air?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't think so.  They were so local to Indianapolis [Indiana], I don't know.
Speaker 1: Well, something like the trip to Mexico.
Speaker 2: That might have been.  I don't really know.  I was headed to Chicago [Illinois]--
Story_ID: 156059
Speaker 1: --I already knew where I--my my next step was, and a friend called me and said, "Hey, there are a couple of openings up here [in Chicago, Illinois].  Why don't you apply?"  And I did.  I applied to Channel 7 [ABC], and I applied to Channel 2 [CBS]; and another young woman named Sheila Stainback, she applied to Channel 2 and Channel 7.  And I wanted to go to [Channel] 7.  She wanted to go to [Channel] 2.  She got hired at 7.  I got hired at 2.  That's life, but then that worked out very nicely.  [HM] Jonathan Rogers hired me.  He was their first black assistant news director, and [HM] Renee Poussaint had just gone to the national news to the network, so I took her job.  And I stayed there through '81 [1981], maybe.
Speaker 2: Now, during the time that you were there, if I'm not mistaken, correct me if I'm wrong, but Channel 2 News with Bill Kurtis and Walter Jacobson was the number one news broadcasting in Chicago.
Speaker 1: It was.  It was the number one news broadcast.  [HM] Harry Porterfield was there, Bill and Walter who else, Peter Nolan, I don't know if you know all these people--Mary Laney.  We had a very interesting group of people.  Emery King, who is now anchoring in Detroit [Michigan] was there, Bob Faw who is now anchoring-- or who now works for NBC Nightly News in Washington [D.C.] was there.  Paul Lauzon [ph.] was [HM] Harry Porterfield's intern there at that time.  Oh, I don't know a lot of people came through there.  In fact, a lot of people used to call WBBM, the CBS school because people came in, did a little time there and then moved up.
Speaker 2: So were you hired to do investigative reporting?
Speaker 1: No, I was just hired as a reporter, but I had done investigative because it's how I am.  It's what I wanted to do.  It's always what I wanted to do, and so I did a lot of it in Indianapolis [Indiana], and so they just gave-- let me do investigative pieces and the challenge from our news director back then was whatever we have on ten o'clock at night, we want to make sure that we are not beat by the newspapers the next day.  We want to have everything they have or more than then newspapers.  We--they did not consider the other TV stations to be their competition.  They considered the newspapers to be their competition.  And I-- that was right up my alley since I had a newspaper background, so my very, very first story--I went undercover to what was then [Robert A.] Waller High School [later Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, Illinois] and pretended to be a student there, and I went to school for several weeks, and I lived in Cabrini-Green [Homes] with this wonderful family, so that I would have residency or live in the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: So did you actually have to live there?
Speaker 1: Yes, I lived there.  I didn't have a place to live anyway.  I just moved here, so Cabrini was fine, and that family was wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  Their daughter is now a police officer.  The mother--I mean I've kept in touch with them.  They were a wonderful family, and they took me in, so I stayed at the Cabrini.  Before [Chicago Mayor] Jane Byrne did it, I did it, and that was part of the story, and I went to Waller High School--I think I pretended to be a junior, and we snuck photographers in.
Speaker 2: And you passed as a junior?
Speaker 1: I passed as a junior--don't ask me how, but I did--obviously, couldn't do that these days, but, yeah, how old was I at that point?
Speaker 2: Twenty-seven or twenty-six.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Twenty-six or twenty-seven.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, ten years--what's ten years on a black woman?  Anyway, I went there, and, you know, I saw the complete breakdown of discipline in the school.  Kids cut class and the whole school was just totally unorganized.  It was kind of the beginning of who we see things now in some schools--you know, there just isn't any discipline, and people come if they want to, and they don't come if they want to.  So, English was my first period class.  Nobody was ever there.  I was the only student in that English class (we showed that) even though they had a lot of kids enrolled.  Now, of course, with my investigative head, I would wonder if those were ghost kids in the first place so that the school could get more money, but, back then, I just reported.  I said, "Here's my class, my English class.  Nobody is here but me and the teacher."
Story_ID: 156060
Speaker 1: What do you suppose a real student would do if he showed up in class--if he or she showed up in class [at Waller High School, Chicago, Illinois] and nobody was there?
Speaker 2: They would leave.  See, I wasn't real student so I sat there and she gave me an assignment and I wrote it out.  But I was there--I was a new student.  They knew I was a new student.  Then my chemistry teacher made no bones about the fact that he had alcohol in the back with the other chemicals that he was drinking.  We got that.  We captured drug sales around the school grounds and just the general breakdown of things.  And the school board [Chicago Board of Education] was very upset at me, but that's the kind of thing that you can only do once if you're on television.  You can't really go undercover, you know, now when I need to go undercover, I send producers because I can't do it.
Story_ID: 156061
Speaker 1: I remember, I think that one of the--I don't know if this is before you did your undercover work, but Walter Jacobson's famous undercover--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: As a homeless man--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --as a homeless man.
Speaker 2: He did that much later.  Yeah, he did that much later, but he put on a costume.  I'm not sure I would do that.  In fact, I'm sure I wouldn't do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's toward the theatrical too much for me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I kind of--I don't know.  I didn't really believe his undercover stunt as much--I mean I knew he did it but I'm not sure--
Speaker 2: I thought it was a good attempt.  The whole point though is how can you be undercover as a homeless person when you know you can go home?  No matter how long you're out there and how miserable it is, you know that there's an end to it, so what do you really know then?  You can show that same story through the eyes, and through talking to and reporting on homeless people.  You can tell and show that same story in a better way than being a fake homeless person, because why fake that?  Now, going undercover as a student had a bit of fakery, but, you know, I didn't use a costume.  Now, when we go undercover, I mean we do it.  We still do it and the purpose is to show something that is wrong to the public so that they can make sure that it gets fixed.  It's all in the public interest whether we go to the grocery store and you're showing bad meat, or it's a nursing home, and you're showing abuse and bad conditions, or it's the metropolitan sanitation district [Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago] and you're showing how women are treated and discriminated against or whether it's anything we do undercover--whether we're showing contractors that are ripping off the city or policeman sleeping on the job, that has justification.  I think as a reporter, I mostly believe in being separate and being an observer, and not putting myself in the middle and making myself the story, but being an observer of the story.  And I'm not saying that undercover isn't important because it is.  You get things undercover that you can't get any other way; and we're working on some things now where I will send a producer in to work undercover and we will see what we find, but it needs to be done in the public interest and I don't think that reporters should put themselves, especially TV reporters who are well known, put themselves into the position of performing like that, and to be something as sensitive as a homeless person, you'll never know.  You can only pretend to walk in those shoes, and pretending isn't good enough.  Why not shoot the shoes if they have them and if they have paper in them?
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever--so you did this one high school undercover piece.  Did you do any others where you actually had to?
Speaker 2: No, I never did it again because my face was known after that.  TV reporters have a hard time going undercover.  That's why Walter, you know, had to use all that make-up, you know.  No, but we send producers to do it.  It's not that--I stake people out, you know.  I wait for someone to come out of their house and I--or I go knock on their door. We do confrontations.  I do confrontations.  I've had plenty of threats on my life too.
Story_ID: 156062
Speaker 1: I don't know if I want to recall the most dangerous, or the most--well, what are the most interesting scenarios during this period at Channel 2 [CBS]? Did--
Speaker 2: Well, I would, I would say at Channel 2--I did a lot of interesting work there, but it was a watershed period for me because I was a young journalist, and I think the biggest disappointment for me coming out of the black movement was to understand that black people would do each other in, could do each other in, could harm one each other.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Give us an example.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and would con each other and would mistreat each other.  Now, that may sound so naive, but coming from the place that I came from, I did not expect it; and it was the greatest and biggest disappointments for me; and I remember when I did an investigation on [HM] Marva Collins, who '60 Minutes', heralded as the teacher who could teach those people who couldn't learn "teacher of the unteachable," I think is what Morley Safer called her.  And I found that the Marva Collins method--well, what happened was a group of parents and teachers from her school, parents mostly, came to me and said, "You gotta do something.  This is not true.  Our children are being harmed.  And they're not learning anything, and we're paying all this money.  And '60 Minutes' wasn't right.  They were wrong."  And I took a look at it.  Of course, I didn't want to do it.  And I certainly didn't want to believe it.  I took a look at it and said, "Oh, no, she's a wonderful teacher.  She must be.  '60 Minutes' did the story," but then I found out just by looking that her documents, for example--they gave me boxes and boxes of things--I went through every sheet of paper.  She had math lessons that were mimeographed.  Remember those?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the blue ink.
Speaker 2: Blue ink--and at the bottom, she had copyright M. Collins.  So I took all of those.  I gathered those things up and I went to Washington [D.C.] and looked for her copyright, and it turns out that she didn't have a copyright.  Well, okay, so she put a M. C. copyright on there; and when I put it on air, the wife of the dead principal of the school that Collins, she, had worked at, called me, and she said, "She's using my husband's material."  I go to her house and she has boxes and boxes of this same material in his hand-writing.  Mrs. Collins didn't even bother to change the hand-writing.  She just put C. M. Collins at the bottom of his work, his math things that he had developed, his math lessons that he had developed, his Social Studies that he had developed, his English exercises that he had developed, she called them "Marva Collins's Method," and they belonged to a dead guy who had been the principal of the school that she had worked at; and we found the proof that he had copyrighted his material.
Speaker 1: What school was this?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  Of course, I can find all of that for you if you'd like, but the wife, when she saw it on television, was outraged that her husband's work had been taken.  Mrs. Collins said that he had given it to her.   The wife says, "Oh, no, no way."  That was one of many, many complaints.  You know, she said she graduated from Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] and she didn't.  And there were many complaints.  So I felt I had, as a journalist, an obligation to tell that story; and I did.  And the African American community, the black community was outraged with me.
Speaker 1: Well, by this time, she was a hero (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: She was an icon.  She was a big hero.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: And they were like, "You're trying to drag her down."  And I said, "I'm just trying to tell you."  One, you I said, you know there are no white kids in this school, only black kids--there are no white parents who are getting ripped off, only black hard-working people; and I said, so--that was, that was the hardest time for me because I did not expect black people to turn on me.
Story_ID: 156063
Speaker 1: Now, did you really discover that she [HM Marva Collins] really was not ab- not teaching the- these children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: At that time, at that time, they couldn't pass any kind of standardized test.
Speaker 1: So that's the really--the core of this problem?
Speaker 2: That was the core of the problem and that there was such promises had been made, and, you know, she was a graduate of business school, not Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois], so honesty was a problem too.
Speaker 1: So she had been a school teacher before?
Speaker 2: Yes--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Chicago [Illinois], yes, but she couldn't pass the teacher's exam, so she had to start her own school.  She failed the teacher's exam.
Speaker 2: So she was a substitute.
Speaker 1: She was temporary--at the time, they had temporary teachers, but you had a certain number of years to pass the teacher's exam and she could never pass.  She took it several times.  She couldn't pass it.  So we reported that too, so she started her own school.  And that was the beginning of her own school, and so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: What form did the outrage take?
Speaker 1: Oh my God, people called me, they'd curse me out.  They sent nasty letters.  It was really, really bad, talked about me on the radio, and, you know, I was new here--fairly new, so I didn't have a base of support or people who knew me, and knew--like I do know, people--after all these years, they know if I do it, it is well-researched and all my facts are laid out.
Speaker 2: Did you find out as well, those who come from outside of Chicago have often commented that Chicago is a very kind-of insularly kind of place, if you're not an insider, you're really suspected of all kinds of alliance of evil--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --that you don't even know about--that you don't even know exist.  Yeah, that was all part of it, you know, that it was some kind of conspiracy that CBS made me do it, but CBS didn't make me do it.  CBS didn't want me to do it really because '60 Minutes' had done it, so I'm going against my own network.  I'm going against my own network; I'm going against my people too, but I thought I was going for my own people.
Story_ID: 156064
Speaker 1: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) how did I survive it?
Speaker 1: --here we are, you're in this situation.  How did you survive this?  Now, CBS doesn't want you to do this--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: No, CBS--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The black community doesn't want you to do this. They, they're suspicious (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --the black community are up in arms--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --I mean did you--did black community leaders come up against you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did PUSH [People United to Save Humanity] or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, [HM] Reverend [Jesse] Jackson didn't, some people were very interestingly silent because they knew--they were silent, though they didn't defend me.  You know, [HM] Vernon Jarrett defended me. Black journalists defended because they knew I had the evidence.  It was right there.  The fraud had occurred, but the black community didn't want to hear it and politicians didn't want to hear it, and CBS National didn't like it, but, you know what, I'm not in business to be anybody's friend, and I tell people that all the time. If you're going to be a journalist and you're going to be a really good one, you've gotta just be okay with people not liking you, or people not liking what you do.  You want them to respect what you do, but you can't expect to be everybody's friend and that comes with it.  It comes with it.  So Vernon Jarrett, I think, was the best for me at that point.  He said that to me.  He said, "You're a journalist.  You don't want people to be your friend, you know, this is a lonely profession."
Speaker 1: How did the [Chicago] Defender react?
Speaker 2: Silence, they didn't say anything one way or the other.
Speaker 1: [HM] Lu Palmer, he was an outspoken person.
Speaker 2: He didn't say anything one way or the other.  See, they didn't defend me.  They didn't run to my defense, but they didn't say anything against me.  The leadership in this town [Chicago, Illinois] knew.  Black leaders knew.
Speaker 1: School board people at the time I think [HM] Manford Byrd was the highest as the school.  I mean [HM] Ruth Love was the superintendent.
Speaker 2: Ruth Love.  They all knew.  They knew that what I said was true.
Speaker 1: So did you have any public officials or leaders that actually jumped out there against you without knowing what they were talking and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Not anyone of any consequence.  It was just that it was an uproar of angry citizens, and the TV station wasn't really ready for it; after all, they have ratings.  They wanted people to watch, but people watched.  They were just mad.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --So it didn't affect--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Then it went on Donahue ['Phil Donahue Show'].  So then it got national play, and Donahue was taped out of our studios back there.  It got national play, and that embarrassed CBS even more.  If it had stayed in Chicago [Illinois] and been a Chicago thing, I think it would have been okay.
Speaker 1: CBS is part of their story, right?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, because they told an erroneous story.  Yeah, they were part of it.  They were a big part of it.
Speaker 1: Did you ever get called by the CBS brass about this?
Speaker 2: No.  I think my boss, a man named Ed Joyce at the time, protected me totally.  He would become the president of CBS National News eventually.  So he protected me.  I'm sure he got some heat.  I'm sure he got plenty of heat for it, but I never knew.  It was like church and state.  He said, "Renee, as long as your facts are right, I'm with you."  Now--so, I think that was a real disappointing time because as I was so idealistic, and I certainly wanted people to like me.  That was when Vernon Jarrett stepped in and stepped in and said, "Renee, if you going to be a really good journalist, you gotta be prepared for people to not like you, not like what you do every day," and in fact he was such a mentor and such an inspiration because Vernon, you know--Vernon wrote some of the toughest articles about Jesse Jackson I've ever seen, and yet Reverend Jackson did an eulogy and held a big funeral for him, and that's out of respect.  I think that as we have become more sophisticated as a people, we understand that we do do each other in, that we all have roles, and that my role is as a watchdog of government and whatever else is to bark loudly when I see wrong being done, and race doesn't matter whether it's black, or white, or yellow, or whoever the wrongdoer is--if you're hurting people, if you're ripping off people, if you're you know, you are misusing our tax dollars, then I'm going to tell it if I know about it.  If you're hurting our civil rights, if you're violating our civil liberties, I'm going to tell it.
Story_ID: 156065
Speaker 1: As I recall during the late '70s [1970s], especially there is plenty to tell because Chicago [Illinois] had a lot.
Speaker 2: There is always plenty to tell in Chicago, are you kidding?  It's very corrupt.  It's always great stuff for reporters.  There's always great material.
Speaker 1: You can't go wrong, going back to 'The Jungle,' you know, Upton Sinclair.
Speaker 2: Yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and beyond.
Speaker 2: I mean, yeah, judges and payoffs, and rip-offs, and unfairness with contracts are still a part of life.  They are a part of the political landscape and we must report on that, we must.  And, you know, black people right now, some of them have become very wealthy being fronts for white contractors.  Why not just do the work?  Why just be a front?  Why not demand that you get your part and get your legitimate share, and do the legitimate work?  That's all I'm saying.  I mean, you could be honest.  Why not, you know, hold everybody to a standard?  Instead of just accepting crumbs to be a front.
Story_ID: 156066
Speaker 1: Okay, now, your tenure here at WBBM lasted until when?
Speaker 2: Nineteen--let's see, 1981 I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, at that time you, you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I went to CBS National News, so I got promoted.
Speaker 1: Did you kind of follow your news director?  Did he go first?
Speaker 2: The general manager--he went.  He did.  Yes, he did.  He became the president of CBS News and I went to Atlanta [Georgia] Bureau, which was the next logical step to go from local news to the network, so I went to the Atlanta Bureau for CBS.  And there, I covered this whole southeastern United States, and [HM] Reverend [Jesse] Jackson's campaign, and they sent me to Central America to Nicaragua to cover the war there.  I got, you know, great experience.  Then I got transferred to the New York [New York] Bureau, that was the next logical thing to do, and there, I met my husband [HM Ken Smikle], and got married, and had my son, Jason [Smikle].
Speaker 1: Okay, you want to tell us how you met him?
Speaker 2: Well, actually when I did the story of [HM] Marva Collins, he was writing for--I think he was writing for Black Enterprise.  Anyway, he called me about it over the night from New York, and he and I ended having an amazing conversation that lasted several hours, and when I got off the phone, I thought, wow, what I a nice man, how come I never meet anybody like that, and then some years later, I met him in person, and I still adored him, and I adore him to this day!  So, in fact, I met him in New York.  I was there--it was around the holidays.  I had just been transferred there.  I knew nobody, and a friend of mine from out-of-town came in and said to me, "Hey, come with me to this party."  I said, "I'm not going to a party with strangers.  I won't bother, but I'll go to dinner with you."  So he and I went to dinner and then he insisted that I go to the party and he introduced me to Ken and Ken said, "Oh, yeah, we talked years ago."  I'm like, "That nice man,"--there he was standing in front of me.  He was the DJ [disk jockey] at the party.  It was his friend or his editor--it was her party.  It was a party full of journalists, so there we were and so we started to date, and he showed me how to ride the subway, showed me how to get around New York, very important, and we became very good friends and after that, got married.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright, well that's a good story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 156067
Speaker 1: When was it that you went to New York [New York]?   It was right--see you went to Atlanta [Georgia] in '81 [1981] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1983], '81 [1981], '82 [1982] about '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: About 1984, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right and you got married?
Speaker 2: In '85 [1985].
Speaker 1: Now, CBS--you were part of CBS National News?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How were you--were the people still sore at you for what happened with [HM] Marva Collins?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think the people over at '60 Minutes' probably were.  (Unclear) probably still is.  I hope not--one should not hold a grudge that long, but they may have been.  Again, I don't really worry about what other people worry about, or think, or do.
Speaker 1: I'm just wondering if, you know, were things pretty smooth at CBS?
Speaker 2: Well, they were.  I mean there was discrimination because look at the time I was there, there were very few women correspondence and no blacks, very few blacks, no black women.  I was the only black woman there at the time.  And I was either having to deal with issues that women dealt with or having to deal with issues of race.  It was double.  And it was quite hard.  On the hand, because I fought off a girl gang every day as a kid, I just focused, did the work I wanted to do, loved the work, and you know let everybody else have their problems.  That's them, not me.
Speaker 1: So did you get a chance to do investigative reporting in New York?
Speaker 2: No, at the time, television didn't do much investigating reporting, especially the national news, and '60 Minutes' was the only place to do that in television, and they only did it sometimes, and they only let the men do it, Mike Wallace.  You know, everybody just covered regular news and covered features, and that's what I did there, and it wasn't until I came back to Chicago [Illinois] to local news that I got to do investigating reporting again.
Speaker 1: Is there a highlight of your tenure in New York before we bring you back to Chicago?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, don't--okay, so you come back to Chicago in '86 [1986]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the highlight--I went to New York to marry [HM] Ken [Smikle] if you believe in destiny and fate--you know, I worked for CBS Sunday Morning.  I did really good stories.
Speaker 1: CBS Sunday Morning, now, I don't know about you, but people--it is so many people--a lot of people in the black community watch that on Sunday.  It's part of their Sunday.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --their ritual, yeah.  And back then, AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome] was becoming known and I did a lot of stories on that, the people living underneath the, the subway, and you know, I did stories like that.  I did, I--once again, I went against the grain and did stories on the people that nobody wanted to really hear from, and I had to fight to get those stories on, but that's okay because I had fights every day when I was a kid.
Story_ID: 156068
Speaker 1: What you missed in Chicago [Illinois] while you were absent was the Harold Washington era (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know, I know.  I got here--when I got here, he was the mayor and he ran for re-election and then he died, but not before he and I had an extremely important conversation about journalists, about what I did--and I had interviewed him before when he was a member of Congress.  And he and I talked, and he said something to me that is always--he said many thing to me that stuck with me, but the most important thing that he said to me is "Renee," he said, "Politics and government must remain separate.  Politics is the act of getting elected, so you have a political organization, but that political organization is separate from your government and the administration and from running the city, and so politics and government must stay separate.  They must not mix."  He said, "You will have an inefficiently run city if you're rewarding political loyalty with a job in government to people who are not qualified.  The best way to do it," he said, "is to keep them separate.  If a person is in my government, they can't be in my political organization.  If they're in my political organization, I don't want them in my government."  Now, that's not to say that his political people didn't have a place in his office to watch his back and to do the political things that had to be done all the time, he said, "but being CEO [chief executive officer] the city and governing is different than politics."  He said, "that's the problem with Chicago that politics and government have gotten mixed up.  They've become one in the same that the mayors have not kept them separate," he said.  "I want to keep them separate."  That was such a profound and important lesson, and had he lived, there was no doubt in my mind that he was on well on his way to do try to do that, but that was not the culture of this city and it isn't today.
Speaker 1: You remember the day he died.  You're in the news here in the city, a black woman in a major station.  What was it like on the day that Harold Washington died?
Speaker 2: It was so sad.  It was close to Thanksgiving.  You know, I told you I like chitterlings--Thanksgiving is a chitterlings day, and if you want to know where I was, I was at the store on 47th Street [Chicago, Illinois], doing a story on already cleaned chitterlings, okay, not exactly investigative, but to the point for black people around Thanksgiving, and this guy had a business, where he was selling them already cleaned.  Hey, that was huge!!  And it was just fun and around the holidays you do things--again, I was taking you somewhere you hadn't been, something you hadn't seen, and I get a call that the mayor had had a heart attack and we run to Northwestern [Memorial Hospital] and by the time we get there, other reporters are there and they're all saying, "Oh, he's dead.  We saw him.  The City Hall people saw him, saw his hand, saw him lifeless and that he was dead."  And I'm like, "You all are lying.  He's not dead."  And they were like, "No, he's dead."
Story_ID: 156069
Speaker 1: And it was very hard because then I had to put on the reporter's hat and hold my composure and do live shots and do stories and cover the funeral [of Harold Washington], and walk through it in a fog, and not feel anything.  One problem that reporters have is that we see so much, plane crashes, you get there, you see body parts.  I went to Bhopal, India when Dow Jones [sic Union Carbide Corporation, owned by Dow Chemical Company since 2001] released all the poison [1984] and there were dead bodies all over the streets, you don't have a way--you just go to the next story.  There is really until recently no recognition that reporters need to decompress.  So I must say that I went through that whole time in a fog and every Thanksgiving now I think of Harold [Washington] and I think of his death, and I think--increasingly think about what he did that was so positive for this city and his effort to bring us together and I love his memory and his wit, and his saying, "Hey, you guys this is politics, and politics ain't bean bag."  And I would love the way he would stop, and talk, and explain, and he was so articulate and funny and witty, and I personally think fast food killed him.  I watched him eating at McDonald's and ordering out at Wendy's and we followed him, we all had fast food all the time, so I do think that contributed to his demise.
Speaker 2: What were the reactions on the inside of the news, I mean, to Harold's death?  Did any reaction surprise you because he had a sort of combative relationship with a lot of the people in the press?
Speaker 1: He did have a combative relationship with a lot of people in the press, but our newsroom pretty much like him.  Paul Hogan liked him, Carol Marin like him.  We liked him.  He was good news.  See whether you agreed with what he was doing or not, he was good news and he would stop and talk with you, and he was articulate, and he would say things that made headlines every day.  And even in being combative, he was good news.  He was such a good news maker.  So, you know, people might have asked the question of the day to make him go off on you, as he would, but then he was so good.  Remember when he went off on Ed Bradley at the Democratic National Convention?  Ed Bradley tried to get him and (unclear) to go at each other and he said, "And you call yourself a newsman," he said that to Ed Bradley, you know, he kind of jumped him.  Well, you could make Harold do that and if you didn't have thin skin, it made great TV, better TV than newspaper, than print, so our newsroom was full of very sad people and some angry people too, who then said to reporters who had had adversarial relationships with him, "What are you crying about, you don't like him?  You know you didn't like him."  He was liked.  He was.  He was appreciated.  And I wasn't here [in Chicago, Illinois] for council wars but I understood what that was all about power, if you got it, you're not giving it up.  I don't care who the mayor is or who you think you are, we're not giving it up easily.  We're not going to just hand it to you.  Everybody understood what that was.  Everybody understood what that was about.  It happens in corporate America all the time.
Story_ID: 156070
Speaker 1: Did you hear as a news reporter--I know that, have you--did you hear alternative versions of the demise of Harold Washington?
Speaker 2: Yes, I heard that he was poisoned--yeah, that he was poisoned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think he was poisoned by fast food and junk, and by having a bad diet, and because he sat up all night and read, and didn't sleep, and he sat, and sent his guards to get hamburgers in the middle of the night, and because he didn't watch his weight.
Speaker 1: He did get bigger and bigger.  He seemed double the size.
Speaker 2: You see now we know more, and we know that certain fast food is really bad for it and you shouldn't eat it, and a steady diet of it will kill you.  We know that now, and we know that obesity is a problem in America because of fast food and preservatives and that kind of thing.  We know that, and we know there's too much fat in that stuff, and that that stuff is just not good for you; and our children are growing up and conditioned to eat it.
Speaker 1: --to prefer it.
Speaker 2: --To prefer it, yeah, and so we have some real educating to do on that score, but, increasingly, we know.  So, in my opinion, it's the most unfortunate thing of all is that Harold Washington ate junk food, gained all that weight, and died because of it.  His heart, according to the medical examiner, was very, very large.  Well, we knew he had a big heart.
Speaker 1: Now, did the aftermath of his death, the political scrabble there at the end, you know, did any of that surprise you at all?
Speaker 2: It was awful, but again it was all about the power.  It was about the power.  I was out in the middle of all of that, outside; I was inside when Alderman [Richard F.] Mell stood up on the City Hall Chambers.
Speaker 1: He said, "We got us a mayor."
Speaker 2: "We got us a mayor."  And [HM] Eugene Sawyer, to his credit, tried very hard and did as good a job as he could do for not having elected by the people; because Harold's election was really a movement, and so knowing that you have the support of the people empowers you.  Knowing that you don't have the support of the people disempowers you, and Sawyer was in that position, and I think he did an excellent job considering what he had to go through and the position he was in.  I wouldn't have taken it.  I think it took a particular kind of courage to take that.  Other people don't see it that way, but I do.  I think it took a particularly kind of courage.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A lot of people felt that he and the six black aldermen jumped the coalition betrayed the movement basically.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but Harold betrayed us by eating fast food.  That's not a popular point of view.  I would have wanted him to take better care of himself.  I would have want--I want black men to take better care of themselves, so that they can be here on this side to do the magnificent work that they do.  There was a lot of stress and a lot of strain.  He needed to be working out and eating right, and having a doctor--a good doctor, not somebody who just told him what he wanted to hear.

Speaker 2: I'm Renee Ferguson.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Who are you asking?  I think it's July 19th.  Is that right?  Oh, it's the 20th already?  Happy birthday, happy birthday!  It's July 20th [2005].
Speaker 1: You should've whispered that.  Now everybody knows--all right--that sees this anyway.
Speaker 2: (Clapping) which birthday is it?
Speaker 1: It's fifty-six.
Speaker 2: (Singing) happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Larry, happy birthday to you.
Speaker 1: You're too kind.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm not going to ask you how old you are.
Speaker 1: Well, fifty-six. I'm the same--we're the same--
Speaker 2: That's good.  We're the same age.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 156072
Speaker 1: So we were--where we left off last time. This is a continuation of an interview we started some months ago and we're trying to--we have you now around 1990, I think, at the end of the [HM Eugene] Sawyer administration, as Richard M. Daley becomes the mayor of the city of Chicago [Illinois], and you're at Channel 5 [NBC] here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You're in investigative reporter.  What were the issues then?  What did you cover?
Speaker 2: In, say 1990?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I'm still doing general assignment reporting.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh so when you came back, you weren't doing investigative reporting?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, it was a real fight for me to get to do investigating reporting.  I had to force them to let me do it.  And they didn't want to because they didn't have any other black women in the air, and so I was the only one, so they wanted my face on the air every night.  And the only way to make that happen was for me to do general assignment reporting.  You see, I'm not on the air every night now because my work takes a lot of time, and the pieces are longer and it takes more time for me to do them, and investigative requires time, so that means you have less face time on the air, but the first thing they had to do was have more black women.  And every year, on the anniversary of my job, I would write a memo and ask whoever the general manager was at that time to please hire some more black women to be on the air so that I would be able to move on to more challenging and rewarding things.  General assignment reporting was interesting, but you couldn't do it in depth.  And real reporting, the kind that I wanted to do, and the kind that I do now, has context.
Speaker 1: The kind that you were trained in.
Speaker 2: And it's the kind that I always was trained to do, and it was what I went into the business for.  So to, you know, cover breaking news all the time while interesting, an adrenaline rush, challenging is fun when you're young. As you get older, I think most reporters want to do things that have a lot more context and content.
Speaker 1: Today, I think things have changed, but, even in the early '70s [1970], well Max Robinson is a similar story about someone who became a TV reporter or an anchor and didn't really have a journalism background, and there are other people, not just him, but lots of people in early days came into TV and just kind of caught it in the flow and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)--well, they needed somebody, and they needed a good face, and they needed a good voice.  There is this performing aspect of our business.  So if they were a good performer, or they had good charisma, or they came through the camera lens, then they could succeed but I wanted to be a journalist.  I wanted to be a reporter.  And I wanted to be able to be a reporter in the public interest and make things happen, and change law, and make life better for people, and even advocate for those who were weak and vulnerable, and who didn't have a voice, so that was my mission from the time I was young.  And it was frustrating to not be able to do that.  There were just no blacks doing it, and there were no women doing it, and here I was both.  So today, it's pretty much like that, although I broke through, and that didn't really until about 1997.  Since I broke through, more black women and more blacks--more African Americans have become investigative journalists, but if you look at newspaper staffs, and you look at television staffs, you really don't find very many doing that work--not many people of color and certainly not many women.  It's considered dangerous and it's always been considered the purview of men.
Story_ID: 156073
Speaker 1: Alright, so it took until 1997 until--so it took seven years or longer (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, longer than that.
Speaker 1: From '87 [1987] to?
Speaker 2: Well, at Channel 5 [NBC], I was here in '87 [1987].  Before that--you know I'd started work as a journalist in 1971, so it took all that time to get me to where I wanted to be and to get to do what I wanted to do, and it was a battle.  It was like the fights I had as a child, and, in a way, that prepared to be fearless in pursuit of what I thought was right and what I thought I wanted.
Speaker 1: Now, you did investigative reporting in Indianapolis [Indiana], Channel 2 [CBS], when you first came on?
Speaker 2: I did, yes.
Speaker 1: but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --but I didn't have the title, and having the title, and having the support to do it is very important.  It's not the kind of thing that you can really do by yourself.  You really need a staff of people helping you.
Speaker 1: How did you convince Channel 5 [NBC] to let you have that kind of title and for them to give you that kind of support?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a crisis actually and it came as a result of a crisis.  And Channel 5 hired its first black general manager, and that young man, Lyle Banks, I was hoping would promote me, but instead he wanted to cut my salary, and so it got to be a very tough fight between him and me, and eventually I realized he had cut the salaries of women of all colors in the station.  He had fired women over forty who basically were not obedient, and I put everybody's name together, hired an attorney.  She went with it to [NBC in] New York [New York], and she had just had a very successful lawsuit against a major trader--a major brokerage firm.  She just had had a very, very successful lawsuit against a brokerage firm.  She was quite famous and when she landed in New York with this list of women who had been fired, or dismissed over forty, or their salaries cut, they immediately understood that there was a pattern of discrimination--to make a very long story short, she got a commitment to either let me leave with a great deal of money or to let me stay and do the things that I wanted to do and be treated well.  And so when they asked me what I wanted, I said I wanted to do investigative reporting, and there was really no choice at that point but to say, "yes," so I had to force them into it, and the community was involved in this very quietly.  My pastor, when I talked with him at St. Mark United Methodist Church, he said, "Well, what should I do?  Do you want me to organize people?  Do you want me to call up the station and picket?  What do you want me to do?"  Because I told him I was in the middle of this real battle for my future.  I talked to [HM] Reverend Jessie Jackson because I was very discouraged, and he told me, "Don't you dare quit," so anyway my pastor asked me what to do, and I said, "Nothing. I just want you to listen to me at this point."  He said, "Okay, well, I'll pray for you."  I said, "No, you should pray for them. You should pray for the managers.  You should pray for the people who are trying to hurt me.  Pray for them. I'll be fine.  Pray for them."  So he did something that I thought was very unique.  What he did was he started a prayer chain of all of the ministers that he knew all over the city.  He called them and he quietly had them to call the station, and call the general manager and leave prayers on his voicemail (laughter), and so I found out that the station was deluged with all kinds of religious leaders from the city praying that this situation would be resolved in a positive way.
Story_ID: 156074
Speaker 1: That is unique.  I've never heard of a situation like that before.
Speaker 2: Well, it was a different kind of pressure I have to say, and it didn't just stop there because, of course, [HM] Reverend Jesse Jackson then called chairman of the board of General Electric, and these were not things that I asked anyone to do.  They just took it upon themselves to do this.  [HM] Carol Moseley Braun, who is a good friend and who was in the Senate at the time, also called people that she knew on the board of directors and pretty soon things started to fall in place.  None of it was ever in the newspaper, none of it was ever really widely known, not even within the station, but the pressure came from the community, and from the religious community, from the political community, and that was very, very, very helpful.  I've never had to ask for that sense, and I didn't really ask for it then, but it began with my minister decided that he needed to organize--when I said, "Don't pray for me but pray for Lyle Banks" that he would come to his senses, that's exactly what he did.  So that was an interesting strategy and you had to have those.
Speaker 1: I suppose the investigation of Lyle Banks' pattern of--or history of past discrimination must have convinced the station that you know how to do, you know, conduct an investigation.
Speaker 2: Well, as a matter of fact, it did.  It did convince, it did convince, not the station so much as it did convince NBC in New York [New York].
Story_ID: 156075
Speaker 1: And right after that, I won--I did a story that won the DuPont [Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards], which is like the Pulitzer Prize, so they immediately saw that they had made a good decision, and have been supportive of my efforts ever since.
Speaker 2: Now what was the story that won the duPont prize?
Speaker 1: I did a story on African American women who were strip searched at O'Hare [International Airport, Chicago, Illinois].  I got a call one day from a woman at six in the morning, I happened to be at work, and I got a call from her saying that she had just cleared customs at O'Hare and had been taken into a small room and forced to take her clothes down, and even take her tampon out and show it to the guards, women guards, customs officer, to proof that she was not carrying drugs internally, and when I met her, she was a very tall woman with her hair in dreadlocks and she a woman who traveled quite a bit to work with children of war.  She was very extraordinary and she came back to this greeting and to this profiling, is what it really was.  It was really racial and gender profiling because the thinking was that if you were a woman and black, or of color, traveling alone, you must have been working as a mule for some drug dealers and have heroin packets inside your body.
Speaker 2: There was also, I guess, a cultural aspect of it too, the dreadlocks maybe stereotyped her (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Dreadlocks stereotyped her--what was interesting is when she told me this, I said, "Well, you must have some kind of criminal history.  You must have something--they must have probable cause to search you."  Well later, I found out they have to have probable cause to search your house or to search your garage.  They do not have to have probable cause to search your body at the border.  The standard is much lower, and it's a standard called reasonable suspicion.  So they only have to have reasonable suspicion.  Later, as I investigated, I found out that reasonable suspicion can be anything essentially, and in her case, they said  [U.S.] Customs [and Border Protection] that day after I interviewed her--her name is Denise Pullian--after I interviewed Denise, Customs said to me, "Oh, yes, we did that.  We can do that, and we did that because she was wearing loose clothing; and we thought because she was wearing loose-fitting clothing that that gave us reasonable suspicion that she might have drugs under there."  So then we put that story on the air that night, and the next day, I got a deluge of calls from people who said, crying over the phone, that this had happened to them.  So I got them all together in an hotel room, and that's what we learned that they were all African American women.
Speaker 2: Not a single person from another--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Not a single white woman.  A room with fifty women in it who had been strip-searched and  humiliated.  They were all innocent.  None of them were carrying drugs, none of them had any criminal history--most of them didn't even have a traffic ticket.  We checked them out--were pulled over and were subjected to this tremendous humiliation.  Now, these days, of course, you might as well as go--after September 11 [2001], you might as well go to the airport naked.  You know, everyone gets patted down or subjected to a secondary search of some type at some point, take your shoes off and all of that, but this was very intrusive.  What we were talking about here and what these women described were actually body cavity searches.  Some of them were taken to hospitals and put in stirrups, or given laxatives to see if, and held for seventy-two hours to see if they would pass drugs.  One woman was even pregnant, one woman was a Fulbright scholar coming back from Africa.  One woman was an actress who had come from Germany, where she had a very brilliant commercial career.  There were teachers, there were politicians, there were some women who called me.  There was a judge.  There were people who were high up in political administrations here.  Many people called me who did not want to go public, but the women who were courageous enough to go public did so, and we just kept doing their stories.
Story_ID: 156076
Speaker 1: How long a period of time did, did this strip search policy last?  I mean how far back did it go?
Speaker 2: What we found out was that the year before at O'Hare [International Airport, Chicago, Illinois], they had found three African American women coming from Jamaica who were carrying marijuana.
Speaker 1: This was what year?
Speaker 2: This was in 1996 when that happened.  So from that--and the officers who discovered that got promotions, got commendations, and were heralded.  So after that, they kind of just went on a rampage looking and profiling all black women as possible drug couriers.  We later found out because Senator [Richard] Durbin and [HM] Senator [Carol] Moseley Braun asked the GAO [Government Accountability Office] to do a study, and the GAO found that women of color across this nation were being profiled and stripped searched, singled out for this great humiliation by our government.  So it all started with this young woman, Denise Pulliam [ph.] who called me at six in the morning, and when I spoke with other women who had gone through this, they had called other reporters, men, and those men didn't believe them, so the difference in my presence was immediately felt, and we learned that in California, Asian and Asian American women were singled out.  We found in Florida, women from the Caribbean were singled out, and dark-skinned white women who had dark suntans were singled out.  In Texas, it was Mexican-American women who were singled out for this.  The statistics show that all women of color were more likely to be stripped searched, more likely to be found innocent.  So they were singling the most innocent group of people for the most intrusive search and rules, as a result, were put into place.  Legislation was passed so that [U.S.] Customs [and Border Protection] has to report to the Congress all strip searches now, even after September 11 [2001], and the commissioner of Custom at the time, was fired.  The [Bill] Clinton administration reacted and acted on behalf of African American women and women of color in this nation.  So it started with me and one person.  It spread throughout the nation.  The stories were picked up by everyone and that's the difference that my being there made because a black woman called, and actually the person who picked up the phone in the newsroom was a news woman named, Gladys Lindsay, she was a black woman, she transferred the call to me.  She said, "You've got to take this call."  I was busy doing something else.  I took the call.  I heard something in that woman's voice that I believed.  I asked her if she would be willing to take a lie detector test.  She said, "Yes."  Well, she didn't have to because Customs didn't deny it.  So that, from that point on--actually before that, I had been doing other stories, but from that point on, I think that I was finally getting the acknowledgment that I wanted from the time that I was eleven years old, and the chance, and the opportunity to do the real stories that I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I remember--you know, everybody in Chicago [Illinois] remembers that series--
Story_ID: 156077
Speaker 1: What, what have been the highlights I guess of being an investigative reporter in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, it's just been such an opportunity to help people.  One Christmas, I got a call from a woman who said that she was a welfare-to-work mom and they had taken her off food stamps, and they had taken her off welfare, and she had a job at a childcare center.  She said that she had a job at a Head Start center, but that she had not been paid in months.  So it was Christmas, and she couldn't get toys for her children, and I went to her house.  She had no food.  She had no toys.  She was not lying to me.  I went to her house.  And from that point, we began to investigate the Head Start Program in Chicago.  I mean it turned into a huge investigation, one of the first of the [Richard M.] Daley administration, the person who was in charge of Head Start and the Department of Human [sic, Department of Family and Support Services]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Resources?
Speaker 2: What was it called?  I've forgotten, anyway, the department head who was over resigned and we got some reform there, but we were looking at the Head Start centers where the owners were making millions and their out on cruises and their staff were not being paid.  And we were looking at Head Start Centers where they had ghost children.  They put kids on there that didn't even exist, and they were getting money for that.  Meanwhile, there were other children out there who really needed it; and they had nowhere to go.  And there were mothers who were working and off welfare who needed their paychecks and weren't getting paid.  What was going on?  So that was a very important story that we did and got change and reform.
Speaker 1: Yeah, one aspect of that the selling of the meals by some people--it's well known to me that some people in the food program they stock piled the food and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Well, that was a part of it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and sell them for a dollar a piece.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: When they weren't supposed to, that's right.  I mean there was so much abuse of taxpayer's money.  Now, I did real estate fraud, a guy who was just ripping off people, selling them houses, promising that he would fix them up.  They would over-appraise them.  They had appraisers that were working for them so that they were appraised at a higher price than they really were, and then the people would be stuck with the houses, stuck with the mortgages, didn't get any money.  They couldn't rent the houses because they were in too bad of condition and it was tragic for a lot of people, ruined their credit, ruined them financially.  It took the government six years to finally prosecute those people, but this year, they did prosecute them, and they were found guilty, and sentencing is coming up pretty soon.  Right now, I have just exposed the story who is in her twenties who has been in a vegetative state and had been in a nursing home since she was three months old, and she cannot walk, she cannot talk, she is fed with a feeding tube, she has a severe seizure disorder and her mother called to tell me that the girl was seven months pregnant.  I went to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Wait a minute--wait a minute--she has been in a coma since she was three months old?
Speaker 2: Three months old.
Speaker 1: And she's pregnant.
Speaker 2: She is now having a baby.  We will be there for that and she is in a facility, that I looked up, that has had massive problems of neglect, and abuse, and children drinking detergent and one boy whose genitals were found cut and sliced, and the place seems to be a real hellhole for the most vulnerable, our children, and yet they get paid ten million a year from the government.  Why is nothing happening to improve conditions there or close them down?  That's my question--how can someone be seven months pregnant when the records show that the doctor was there every month to examine her?  Where were the nurses to check on her menstrual period?  And who impregnated her?  All a big mystery at this point, but I did the story, and then it was picked up by The Washington Post and nationwide because this is a story of the most vulnerable of us, and again she cannot speak, but I can.
Story_ID: 156078
Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking about the highlight of investigations here, and that, that serves as an unusual story (unclear).
Speaker 2: It is, but I think it is not as unusual in occurrence as we might think.  I just think that it's usually covered up or an abortion occurs, or something like that.
Speaker 1: You did a positive thing.  You uncovered it and possibly saved other people from this anguish and problems.
Speaker 2: Well, look at the mother--the girl's mother who now has to think of raising a child, a baby, a child of rape.  I mean there are just so many issues, and these issues are in our society, but this is a person who is very, very vulnerable and who was taken advantage of, who was raped.  Legally, the investigators, the police are looking and hoping that through DNA, after the baby is born, they will find the person who sexually assaulted this girl.  She can't speak.
Speaker 1: So what else?  What are some of the others?
Speaker 2: There are a lot.  Um--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Is there any one story that you think is the most important written that we haven't discussed already?
Speaker 2: I really like all the stories I do.  I don't usually take them on if I don't like them.  I think that there is a pattern in which I look at issues that affect vulnerable people.  The women at the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District [of Greater Chicago], for example, talked about being sexually harassed, there were bomb threats.  There were all kinds of issues with them when they spoke out with me, but change occurred somewhat.  And there was education that occurred, and women tell me that their working conditions are there are better.  We went undercover there to prove that this was going on, and that there was a hostile work environment.  We went undercover at Ford Motor Company [in Chicago, Illinois] when the women there came to me to complain that they were being treated in a hostile way, and we found evidence of quite a hostile work environment.  Lawsuits were filed.  The women recovered money.  You know, so again working conditions hopefully are better as a result of the work that we did.  And I get thirty calls a day from people who have real, serious problems or from whistle-blowers who want to tell about issues that are going on, and want to tell about how government isn't doing what it is supposed to do, or how they are being defrauded by the private sector.
Story_ID: 156079
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a story of a, of a lead that looked promising, that you got excited about it.  You thought it was going to change people's lives only to find out it was a dead end?
Speaker 2: I find that out very soon.  I know how.
Speaker 1: How do you know it?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, basically when someone calls me, I check them out and there's not very much that I haven't heard of or seen and so I just know how to track things down very quickly, and I sometimes do not have any evidence.  For example, the story that I just told you about happened at a place called the Alden Village Nursing Home in Bloomingdale, Illinois.  Actually, three years ago, someone called me with a similar complaint of sexual abuse, but I couldn't prove it.  It never was proven, so I put it in my files, and when I got this call this time, I went straight to that file and I said, "Now, this is call is pregnant.  That's real evidence."  So the story I wasn't able to do back then, now I can go and pick that up, and do it.  In addition, I know how to gather the records from the Department of Public Aid, the Department of Public Health, and to find out what investigations have occurred from Medicare and Medicaid.  All of these are public records that you can obtain from the Freedom of Information Act.  Any citizen can do it, but I do know how to do that, and I fight with government almost every day to obtain records.
Story_ID: 156080
Speaker 1: Now that raises an interesting issue in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  Chicago I know has--sometimes it's difficult to get information from city government and in particular, as we were discussing before we started this interview from the Chicago Police Department, you know, about officers who have been charged in the past with police brutality or violating policies or something--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Occasionally, I have been able to obtain records from the Office of Professional Standards that will show that an officer has a repeated pattern of abuse to citizens, but those records are kept secret.  I am trying very hard to get that changed.  I'm trying very hard, especially in light of what happened with Reverend [James] Meeks, him being stopped, a gun being brandished--that kind of thing.  So the officer who did that to him, none of us have a way of knowing if this was a one-time thing or if there is a larger pattern.  And the Fraternal Order of Police is very powerful, the policemen's union, in protecting the officers and I understand that, but the people have a right to know.  It's not that reporters have a right to know.  I represent the people and I represent their right to know.
Speaker 1: Now, theoretically, anybody can go and get these records.
Speaker 2: You should be able to, but you cannot here.  In other cities you can, but not in Chicago.  The records on police officers, investigations on them, and complaints of misconduct are all secret, and proceedings and investigations, all secret and the results kept secret.  I think that has to change.
Speaker 1: There is another issue I know with the police department here around brutality issues, a lot of cases are settled out of court, and then you're not able to look at that record, you know, the person was not convicted of a crime. They were accused, but not--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They settled without any comment.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Right.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --but--or without taking any responsibilities; however, settlements are recorded, so we can find out how much money, which is millions, tax money, that the city spends on police brutality cases.  A few years ago, I know it was up to eleven or twelve million.  I know it's much higher than that now.  That's our money that could be going to schools, that could be going to housing for the poor, that could be going to any number of other things and instead it's paying off people for police brutality cases.
Speaker 1: And the officers stay on the street.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh, by the way, they're still out there.  Now, that--truly we depend on our police officers to protect us, and to serve and to protect, but, you know, there are some real issues with profiling, and I think that the most important thing for anyone to understand that there is this much crime in other places as there is in big cities, but if you put all of your police officers in big cities, that's where they're going to find it.  Where you look is where you're going to find.  The Justice Department statistics that drug use is the same among whites and blacks, and whites and Latinos.  In the suburbs and in the city for drug use is the same, but the numbers of people who are picked up and sent to prison for drugs is much higher in inner-cities and that's because where you look, that's where you find.  Where you put your police officers to patrol and look, that's where you find the problem.  So if you want to use drugs, go to the suburbs and you won't get caught because there is nobody looking at you, and that's, that's essentially it.
Story_ID: 156081
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you want to smuggle drugs, be, be a white male, and you don't get strip searched.
Speaker 2: If you want to smuggle drugs, be a white male.  No, that was before, that was before September 11th [2001].
Speaker 1: Now, everybody gets--not strip searched, but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Now, they've just figured out different ways to do it.  [U.S.] Customs [and Border Protection] doesn't search all of the trains and all of the large containers that supposedly bring in food.  There are drugs coming in every day that way, and on airplanes.  There isn't a whole lot of body smuggling anymore.  There doesn't have to because they're looking at cargo, and big--those gigantic containers that go on ships, and trucks that drive up and down the highways.
Story_ID: 156082
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now what are your--now, as you are today, I guess you're looking at---and this is the latter part of your career in journalism, I guess.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: What are your goals now?  What do you see in your immediate future and what would like to do before you retire?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't expect to retire.  That doesn't mean that I stay at Channel 5 [NBC], but retirement, I think, is not--unless I don't have good health--retirement just isn't something that a person who can read, write, has intellect should do.  I would like to teach.  I want to write and share what I've learned, the techniques that I've learned with people.  I think that a good investigative reporting book is needed, especially from the prospective of a woman and a person of color.  So that's my next goal.  That's the next thing that I will do is write and publish, a good book that will be full of all my adventures but also have in it techniques that you use, so that it is also a teaching tool.
Story_ID: 156083
Speaker 1: I might enjoy writing fiction.  I love reading it.  I'm not sure that I know how, but I, I might take a stab at it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: What are your favorite books?
Speaker 1: Oh, well let's see.  Well, I really, really like Toni Morrison a lot.  I like 'The Bluest Eye.'  I think 'Sula' might be one of the books that I find to be inspiring to me, and the way it was written, even though Morrison says she doesn't like it because she gave away too much at the beginning and she didn't know what she was doing in terms of those techniques or dragging people through the story.  I read it over and over again.  I love it.  'Their Eyes Were Watching God' [Zora Neale Hurston], I like. I like [HM] Bebe Moore Campbell as a contemporary black author.  I just finished reading a book by a-I just finished reading a book by a new author  called, 'The Kite Runner' [Khaled Hosseini].  He is an Afghan author who deals with the issues of class and, you know, it's a very beautifully written book.  I like literary books.  I'm not much of a mystery fan, and I'm not much of urban literature or urban fiction yet.  I don't like it that much.  I like beautifully written stories.  I like John Edgar Wideman a lot and I'm sure I read pretty variety of things.  I like elegantly written books that tell a story that I haven't really, really heard before and that's very difficult for me.  I think that's really difficult for everybody because really there are only three or four stories; they're all in [William] Shakespeare and the Bible anyway, so then it's just how do you tell that story.
Speaker 2: As a reporter, you've seen a lot of faces in society, a lot of twists and turns and ups and downs--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --I have--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --extremes.
Speaker 1: So it's very difficult to surprise me and to make me want to keep going.  I'm now reading a wonderful book if I can remember the title of it.  It's called 'The Last Report on [the] Miracles at Little No Horse' [Louise Erdrich] and it's the story of a nun who under some very interesting circumstances becomes a priest on an Indian reservation, and begins to document miracles that occur, and sends this documentation to the pope, really interesting, beautifully-written book.  I like a lot of first author's books because usually their first novel is free and unencumbered, and just about all they have to say comes out in that book.  Then after, they may or may not be really good.  So I'm sure I can think of some others but about ten years ago, I started to pursue literary fiction really.
Speaker 2: Okay, so have you been writing?
Speaker 1: I have been, I have been--I have been trying to write fiction, but I admit I don't know what I'm doing and it's so far been just for me.  I've never stopped writing.  I've always been writing.  I've kept diaries.  I've been writing since I was a child.  I really have a lot to say and how much--why does anyone write a diary?  What is that for?  Is it to be shared by the world?  Now, Ida B. Wells is my idol and Ida B. Wells' diaries are at the University Of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] in the library there; and when I read them, they're very personal.  I wonder if--who was she writing for?  Did she think someone like me would be privy to her most personal thoughts some day?  Or was she just writing to herself but writing nonetheless because she was a writer and needed to write with no thought of who might be looking at those writings someday?  So, I'm very free (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: But you feel the same compulsion to write?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes that's when I'm most happy and when I'm most free.
Story_ID: 156084
Speaker 1: Now, do, do you have a certain philosophy as a reporter?  I mean is there such a thing as a journalistic philosophy?
Speaker 2: Oh, I do.  I'm very, very, very driven by the facts, very driven by fairness, very driven by curiosity, and I understand that there is no black or white; there are always shades of gray.
Story_ID: 156085
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this--we always ask this question.  What are your some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I am very, very worried about the violence that occurs.  I am very, very worried about the numbers of our brilliant young men and women who are in prison.  I am very, very worried about the level of education and miseducation that is occurring.  I am very concerned about our ability to really enjoy the American dream.  I'm concerned that our society when there are economic problems, tends to blame people of color.  I'm quite concerned that we haven't gotten as far as we need to get--that the Civil Rights Movement was a beautiful thing, but that those doors that were open, opened only a crack and that I worry that my nineteen-year-old son [Jason Smikle], who is very bright, would not be able to get through those doors now.  I worry that we haven't told our children our family histories.  I worry that they don't understand really what's involved, and that there is a fight as we speak, and that it may always be there.  I worry that in our society people are still looking at skin color instead of seeing each other from the inside out, that we're still a society that deals with so much that is external, and, therefore, we are fooled by it.  So my hopes are that one day we will have a society where people will be seen--not--well, like [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] said, people will be considered not because of the color their skin but because of the content of their character.  I mean that's profound.  And what his real wish was is mine, and that is people will start to see each other and consider each other from the inside out and not from outside in.  That's not even popular among black people.  It isn't, and when I say to my friends something, "You know, race doesn't matter to me," they look at me like I'm nuts, but the truth is that is how I feel.  That is what I have learned, that inside--the race is biology, it's culture, but that it is not who we are.  It's not everything and that if you cut a person open, we all look the same and that genetically, there are only a few genes that separate us, and that race in this society has been used as a political construct, and an economic construct, and as a way to divide us.  So, for me, I have to--in order for me to be strong, I have to be able to cultivate the ability to see beyond that and to see people from the inside out, so I've really worked on that, and I would like--if I had my way, I would like more work of that kind to be done because when that happens, you know, you cut through so much garbage.  Now, is that going to happen in America?  Well, probably not--not in my lifetime, but we have to start; and there is a cycle that I think needs to be broken, and there is--there is an important thing that I think we, as the human race need to work on and that is seeing people from the inside out.  I want to know your heart.  I want to consider your eyes before I consider the color of your skin.  I want to see what's in your mind, and I'm really looking for it when I encounter you first.
Story_ID: 156086
Speaker 1: From some other things you've said in this interview, I think that you do have--though, I don't think that anybody wants the negative aspects of race to spill over into their life or that to be their operational philosophy necessarily, but it seems to me that you do have--that there is an allegiance to black people in the sense that we are distinct, and have a common history, and condition in this country so to speak, so can you address--discuss that for a second?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that's important, and we do.  The allegiance is to our amazing strength that we've come through so much, and in coming through so much, have emerged whole, that we have survived, and not only survived but thrived and that we've done well, and that we've contributed so much to the society, and we have made it a better country, a better world.  There is no doubt about that, so a lot of my stories, most of them, have black people in them or are about black people and that's because black people call me and I hear them.  I listen to them.  But all people call me and I hear them, and I listen to them.  And that's an important thing for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it's like when I went to South Africa when Nelson Mandela was freed, he was talking.  He used some words.  He said, "We want a non-racialist society," and I said, "Ha, that'll never happen.  What are you talking about?"  But as I spoke with him, and as I became more mature over the years, I came to a place of understanding that great hope, and it is a great hope.  It may not be practical in the minds of people.  I'm not asking anyone to give up their culture.  I'm not asking anyone to give up their pride; I'm just asking that we see each other for what we are from the inside out, so that we're not fooled.
Story_ID: 156087
Speaker 1: So as we were saying last time, when you look back on your life to this point, is there anything that you would do differently, any, any major thing?
Speaker 2: I can't think of anything that I would do differently.  I love my life.  And I've had a very, very good life, very blessed life.  From the time I was eleven, I wanted to be a journalist, and I've done that.  So I think the things that I would do differently are going to be the things that I will do in the future.  I do think I need to do more writing.  If I had had the opportunity, I might have just written fiction instead of gotten into journalism if I had the opportunity, if I knew that was available, but I didn't know about it, and so since I didn't know about it, I didn't do it.  I'm not sure I would have had much to say anyway back then.  Now, I have a lot to say.  And journalism has enabled me to see so much, and to be so many places, and to do so many things, and to have studied so many characters, and to seek a depth of understanding about so many topics.
Story_ID: 156088
Speaker 1: And so even in my health challenges, which did--I don't know, did we talk about that earlier (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh no, I don't think we did--now, when, now when did you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I, I had a serious a couple--three years ago, a very serious health challenge and even that required my investigative skills.  In fact, I think the story of it is perhaps the reason I have those investigative skills because they ultimately saved my life.  I have a genetic disease and it's rare.  It's called chondrocalcinosis, and it's where you have calcium deposits all over your body, and the calcium that my body makes deposits itself, or was depositing itself, into the soft tissue of my body.  So my ligaments and my tendons were getting hard, and my muscles were getting hard and stiff, and I couldn't walk.  It was very painful.  My back hurt.  My knees hurt.  Everything hurt everywhere, excruciating pain.
Speaker 2: Now, when did it start?
Speaker 1: It was gradual, happening probably throughout my life.  And then I--when I got the diagnosis, I looked it up on the Center for Disease Control website and I found that it was fatal, that it gets in your lungs and they harden up, and they can't contract, or that it gets into your heart, and it can't squeeze, and people die from it, about 100 a year.  So I found this out about four years ago that I had a disease for which there was no known cause, and no known cure; and I began to investigate how I could have gotten it.  and I found that most of the people who have it are in Scotland or Ireland, and I had Scottish relatives and I found the white Fergusons and they told me, "Yes, we have this disease in our family, and because your great grandmother and great grandfather were actually a slave sister and the owner's son, they were really half brother and sister, and they got together, then that gene that would have been a recessive gene, became a dominate gene, which then caused my calcium to not function correctly."  So when I found that out, the next question was what do I do about it. And I began an investigation to find some kind of calcium metabolic procedure or something to slow it down.  Well, there wasn't really anything out there.  People either got this at a very old age, or if they got it at a young age, like me, they died from it.  And through prayer and a lot of investigating, I came up with a calcium malabsorption procedure that I found.  My doctor took my idea to doctors all around, and those doctors said to her, "You know, your patient is probably on to something, and why not try it," and then we had to find the right people to do it, endocrinologists in San Francisco [California].  I found them.  I checked them out.  I talked them into doing it along with my doctor here, and a couple of years ago, we had this procedure which saved my life.  Eleven days later, my pain was gone.  My suffering was gone, and my body began to use all the excess up out of my muscles, and I'm doing very well.  It didn't cure the disease.  It just changed my absorption rate of calcium.
Story_ID: 156089
Speaker 1: So you take something that, that, that helps you absorb calcium and now you don't have it?
Speaker 2: I'm not taking anything.  It was a surgical procedure.  It was done laparoscopically and basically they moved my duodenum over twenty degrees so that I absorbed 20 percent less calcium.  Now, these doctors had done this for people who had too much iron.  They had never done it for people who had too much calcium, but I was willing to be a human guinea pig.  We don't know if it's a cure.  We don't know what it is, but eleven days after the surgery, I felt better.  The pain was gone and we have now found that versions of this surgery cure a lot of things, and my doctor has sent maybe thirty of her patients who have brain tumors--benign brain tumors to these guys because they will just sort of change the way--they figure out the protein or whatever is feeding that tumor and then they just modify your body a bit to keep you from absorbing as much of that, and keep it from being fed, and it goes away.  So it's very cutting edge stuff, but it was my investigative abilities that helped me find out (a) what I had because the diagnosis was very difficult to get, (b) which treatment there was, which there wasn't any, (c) to come up with one on my own, and (d) and to then go and find someone who would be daring enough to implement it, and (e) to help others by sharing.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's quite a story, to know that you played a role in your own cure, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not sure that it's a cure, but I've had two years that are pain-free, and I am grateful for every day of that.  And the lesson of that is supreme gratitude, and all, you know, all of my doctors were white.  Catholic, Jews, they were all a different race, and race didn't play a part in their humanity.  It did not.  They wanted to try to help save my life because they my life was worth saving, and I asked those doctors who are so brilliant if they would share this with black doctors and doctors who help poor people and they agreed.  They did it immediately.  They put people on their staff, and they started training other people and they are now going to offer this training who are going to work in county hospitals and who are going to help poor people, and who are committed to that, and we've set up an institute, and so there is a reason for my suffering, and it was so that I would be able to really see the suffering of others and not just observe it from a distance but to actually understand it and so that I could do something about it.
Story_ID: 156090
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I hope my legacy is one of being a person who helped other people in all kinds of ways, that I educated the public, that I helped them make decisions about their government through my reporting, that I helped them to make decisions about what they wanted, who they were going to support, how they were going act in our democratic republic and that I helped people with some of their health issues to live, and I would hope that I would be remembered as someone who really, really loves to help others.
Story_ID: 156091
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you mentioned your family, but you have a husband [HM Ken Smikle], a nineteen-year-old son [Jason Smikle].  Are, are your parents still alive?
Speaker 2: My dad [Eugene Ferguson], is in his nineties.  He is ninety-four and my mom [Mary Ferguson] died when she was eighty-three, and my grandmother died when she was 100, and have a great aunt who died when she was 100.  I have an aunt on my dad's side who is now ninety-five, and an uncle who is well over 100.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I have long livers genetically, in some cases.  I do believe that a couple of my aunts had what I have and died young from it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your father--he's had a chance to see your whole career.
Speaker 2: He has and is very proud.  He has had a stroke recently and he is in a nursing home.  And my brother [Eugene A. Ferguson] moved from Seattle, Washington, where he was a retired teacher, had a very good life there and moved to Oklahoma to take care of my dad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that is one of the most amazing and loving things that anyone could do.
Story_ID: 156092
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything--before we ask our last question, is there anything we have not asked that you, you think you need to address before we ask the last question?
Speaker 2: No, because I think I looked at part of the tape and that refreshed me.  I would urge young people--I guess I would like to say this, I would urge young people to consider careers in journalism but not to major in make-up, and not to just want to be on TV, but to try to understand that the work is in the public interest and do try to do public interest journalism, to try to do work that makes our society better, that reveals problems that need to be solved, and that helps people to have better lives and that helps us all to be better citizens.  So I worry a little bit that people see television as glamourous and everyone wants to anchor the news and nobody wants to really go out and investigate.  I worry about that.  I worry that when I leave, there won't be someone to take my place who is like me.
Speaker 1: I mean you don't see young people coming along now that really want to do investigative reporting?
Speaker 2: I've been cultivating a few.  I have interns that I believe I have inspired.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm working very hard, so they can--You know, all journalism should be investigative journalism, all journalism should be investigative.  We should be confirming everything, not taking any word for anything and being natural cynic.  So all journalism--whether you're covering a fire--what was the origin of the fire and what really happened there, and what time did the fire department really arrive, and what is the data that reports that, and how many fires have been in this area, and how many of them have been arson, and what is going on with the structures of the housing here?  And what's really going on in this neighborhood that there are so many fires, and, bla, bla, like that, and instead of look at those flames.
Story_ID: 156093
Speaker 1: Okay--oh, just one quick question here I thought of as we were talking about this, next--in another couple of weeks, there is the National Association of Black Journalists Conference, how has that organization helped you and are there any other organizations that you would recommend for a young person coming today in journalism?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, the National Association of Black Journalists is very, very important.  NABJ, I'm a lifetime member, and I have a life membership which means--well, NABJ is so significant because it allows for networking.  All of the major media outlets come there to recruit, so you can find a job there, but we are also in support of each other.  When NABJ started, you could get all the black journalists in this nation into one hotel suite.  Now, there are thousands of us at that convention, and so many beautiful, and bright, and energetic, young people who want to do news, and so there are seminars and there--that's essential and then connecting with your local chapter is essential.  And also I like Investigative Reporters and Editors, IRE.  It's a mostly white organization.  This convention is not quite nearly the fun that we have at NABJ, but they teach journalism.  They have seminars on how I did this story, so you don't reinvent the wheel, and they have a website that has stories on it.  So I get calls all the time from young people saying, "I see from the IRE website that you did this story.  How did you do it?  How did you get the records?  How did you get this; how did you go about doing that?"  "This isn't a record I can get in my state.  How can I get around that?  How do I get this information from elsewhere?  So I love IRE and I love NABJ, and all of my interns get IRE membership from me.  I pay it and NABJ memberships from me.  And we take them to the conventions.  This year, my husband [HM Ken Smikle] and I are taking my son [Jason Smikle] and two of our interns from here to the NABJ convention and we're paying all of their expenses.  We want them to get it, and this is the place where, if no other place else, they'll get it, that they are part of a very powerful institution and that they have power, and that they can do this work in the interest of our people and in the public interest.  And every day, Ida B. Wells is right here on my shoulder, whispering in my ear when I get discouraged.
Story_ID: 156094
Speaker 1: Okay, the last question is similar to legacy but a little different and you probably haven't thought about this a lot, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I would like to be remembered as a good person.  I would like to be remembered as a person who was willing to share.  I'd like to be remembered as a person who was willing to give deeply of herself.  I'd like to be remembered as a person who believed in the Ten Commandments and obeyed them.  I'd like to be known as a spiritual person and as a person who is guided by God; and I would like to be known as a person who is funny and who has a sense of humor too, and who was first and foremost a wife and mother, and who also had a career that benefitted society.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's been wonderful.  Thank you for thinking of me and asking me to be a part of The HistoryMakers.
