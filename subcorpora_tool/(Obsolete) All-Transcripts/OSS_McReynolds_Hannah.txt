Milligan This is Sarah Milligan with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program.  I   m interviewing Hannah McReynolds today at the OSU Library. We   re  going to talk a little bit about Hannah   s experience coming to OSU and  working through the university system, as well as her experience as an  exchange student, as an agricultural-econ student at OSU doing one of the  first, well, doing the first exchange with the China Agriculture University.  Today   s date is October 26, 2015. That   s the date, right?  McReynolds Yeah. (Laughter)  Milligan Okay. All right. Just to get started, Hannah, let   s talk a little bit about where  you   re from, and give me a rundown of your family, who they are, and just a  little bit about yourself.  McReynolds I   m from southeastern Oklahoma. I say that Honobia, Oklahoma, is my  hometown, but it   s not a town. There   s maybe 200 people. There   s not a  school. There   s one store.  Milligan How do you spell that?  McReynolds H-O-N-O-B-I-A. It   s where Bigfoot is. That   s fun. (Laughs) My  grandparents have a cattle ranch there, a cow-calf operation, and as a child  growing up, we moved around a lot. I   ve lived in lots of places in  southeastern Oklahoma, and then I   ve also lived in Oklahoma City. I lived  in Stillwater when I was younger. We always went back and forth between  my mom and my grandparents, but we would always end up back with my  grandparents. That   s generally what I call home.  Milligan You traveled, but you   ve lived in Oklahoma your whole life. Is that correct?  McReynolds Yes, ma   am, eighteen years because last year I lived in China.  5  Milligan Look at you. (Laughter)  McReynolds I can say that now. (Laughter)  Milligan You can say that. Siblings?  McReynolds I have a brother that is twenty-two. He lives in Mississippi and has a baby,  and then I have a sister that   s twenty-one who lives in Moore  Oklahoma   and has a baby. I grew up with those two. We went through everything  together, and then later we had a baby sister, a half-sister, who is seven.  Milligan She   s seven right now?  McReynolds Yeah, a pretty big age gap.  Milligan Yeah. Twelve years?  McReynolds Yeah.  Milligan What made you move around so much?  McReynolds My mom, she was going to various colleges. She would start college and  then drop out and then start and drop out, and also we had, Mom had issues  with an abusive husband who is my dad. When things would arise there, my  grandparents would come and get us or my mom would take us to our  grandparents, and then also we were taken away by DHS  Department of  Human Services  three times. Fortunately, we always ended up back with  our grandparents and not somewhere else or split up. Just my mom   s  instability, I guess. We moved a lot.  Milligan Got it. Let   s talk a little bit about what got you interested in OSU, and we   ll,  think some of the other parts of your life will come out with that, too. Why  OSU?  McReynolds When I was little, I really, really liked OSU because there were cowboy hats  and boots. (Laughter) That will forever be my story, and then as I got older,  I realized how important agriculture was to me. The animals on my  grandparents    ranch helped me through a lot. They taught me responsibility.  I had a horse that was my childhood favorite thing, and when I was really  upset, when my mom wouldn   t show up or when something would happen,  my horse was always something that I went to. Animals have always meant  a lot to me. Agriculture is a really, really important thing in my life, and  OSU has a great agriculture foundation. As I got older, that was more of my  reason as to why I chose here.  Milligan Did you have any family that had come to OSU?  6  McReynolds Yes. My grandpa graduated from here. I don   t know when, but he graduated  out of ag ed. He was an ag teacher for a long time, and then my mom went  here for a time. I don   t know if she actually graduated from here. I just know  that she went here.  Milligan Is that why you were living here when you were little?  McReynolds Yeah, when we were little, we lived here. I remember some of that. I  remember the house and the three girls that babysitted us, and that   s about it.  Milligan How old were you?  McReynolds Probably four, four to six, and it was back and forth, too.  Milligan Did you know about OSU from your grandpa then, primarily?  McReynolds My grandpa and my mom. I mean, I knew my mom went here and then my  grandpa also, and as I was in high school and stuff, my stepbrother went to  OU. I really didn   t like my stepbrother. It was like,    Let   s go as far away  from that as possible,    and then as a senior, I toured. This was actually the  only college that I toured, and it just reinforced how much I liked it here.  Milligan Good. Where did you go to high school?  McReynolds I have been to three different high schools. I started at Broken Bow   Oklahoma  High School, and I was there freshman and sophomore year.  Then half of junior year, I was at the Oklahoma School of Science and  Math, and then the other half, I was at Haworth  Oklahoma . Then I  graduated my junior year. I was only in high school for three years.  Milligan You graduated from Hayward?  McReynolds Haworth, H-A-W-O-R-T-H.  Milligan Thank you.  McReynolds (Laughs) We have weird names in the south.  Milligan Just harder to spell sometimes in Oklahoma. Haworth isn   t that hard. Did a  lot of your classmates come to OSU?  McReynolds No. I think one from Haworth did. I think maybe two from Broken Bow.  OSU isn   t advertised at all that I ever saw in the southeast, which, I guess  OU really isn   t, either. Most students are encouraged to go to Durant   Southeastern Oklahoma State University  or Wilburton  Eastern Oklahoma  State College  or Ada  East Central University . I don   t really know the  7  names of those colleges, but you   re not really encouraged to go to these  schools.  Milligan Who does the encouraging?  McReynolds The student counselor, the career counselors or whatever they   re called, they  really, really promote the schools that are more in the southeast, and yeah, I  don   t think I ever saw a recruiter other than for the Army in high school.  Milligan Was it easy for you to figure out how to get enrolled and do all the things to  become a student at OSU?  McReynolds Absolutely not. I actually, when I ended my time at OSSM, the Oklahoma  School of Science and Math, my mom put me in a shelter, and that meant  that I wasn   t   I didn   t have access to computers. I didn   t have access to  phones. I had nothing, basically. I mean, I had clothes and food. The high  school counselor at Haworth was actually the only high school counselor  that had ever promoted OSU, and she went here. Between her and the  librarian that I was really, really close with, they helped me figure out how  to apply and enroll. Basically, I started the process without my mother   s  knowledge, and I was seventeen. They helped me a lot, figuring it out, but it  was really tough because, I mean, I couldn   t talk to people at OSU to figure  out what the majors were or anything because I was in a shelter. I didn   t  have access to that stuff.  Milligan When you worked with the librarian and the other people that you said  were, helped you steer your way, do you feel like they had a sense of how to  help you get what you needed?  McReynolds I think that the high school counselor there, I think she knew how to work  the system. I don   t think she knew scholarships at all, but she knew how to  apply. The librarian was more there to help me get on the computer and  keep me going even when it was super frustrating, and neither of them knew  how to apply for housing. (Laughs) That was an interesting   trying to figure  out how to do that, and actually, when I applied for housing, you have to pay  a down payment. My mom still didn   t know at that point. I don   t think she  knew at that point that I was applying. I asked her for the money, and she  said,    No.    Of course all freshman have to live on campus. I called my  grandpa, and he paid for it. That   s basically how I had somewhere to live  when I came up here.  Milligan For your first year.  McReynolds Right, yeah. He just paid the deposit, and I had no clue how I   d pay him  back. I   ve never borrowed money from anyone. I hate borrowing money  8  from people, but I knew that that was the only way to get me out of the  situation that I was in.  Milligan This is what   s interesting to me is that you had the drive. You had the drive  to know that you wanted to get here and that this is where you wanted to  come, and there were a few people that could help point you in the direction.  Did you talk to specific people here on campus once   you didn   t have  contacts here on campus to walk you through the process?  McReynolds No. I had no contacts at all on campus. Looking back on it, it would   ve  made it so much easier, but I didn   t know anyone. I didn   t know how to get  in touch with them. It was just the librarian and the counselor that helped  me.  Milligan You got enrolled, and you, walk me through that. You moved up here into  your residence hall?  McReynolds Yeah. I graduated on the eleventh of May, and then I moved up here, I think,  on the twelfth. I borrowed my grandma   s car and drove up here with  everything I owned, and then a cousin came through and picked my  grandma   s car up. I just came up here by myself, and I moved in one of the  houses. I had a  100 of graduation money from an attorney that I had  worked for, and that   s it. I didn   t have a job. I didn   t know anyone. My mom  wouldn   t let me have my truck.  Milligan Did your mom know you were at school by this point then?  McReynolds Yeah, yeah.  Milligan At what point does, and you can not answer as much as   at what point did  she find out you were coming to school, and how did she feel about that?  McReynolds I don   t really remember exactly at what point. It was somewhere between  getting accepted and applying for housing because the acceptance letter  came to her office, and my baby sister opened it. It   s a card that plays music,  and I never got to see it. Maybe that   s when she found out. I   m not really  sure. It was a very conflicted thing because she, I mean, she wasn   t going to  help me go to college, but she also said,    If you don   t go to college, you   re  staying in the shelter.    It was,    Do it on your own or stay in the situation  you   re in.    By the time I left, she knew that I was leaving because I got all  of my stuff out of her house and took my grandma   s car.  Milligan You got here. You had a  100 in your pocket and a place to live, at least for  a little while, a down payment on a place to live. Did you have any idea of  what finances you would need to be able to come to school? Did anyone in  the bursar   s office or anything walk you through     9  McReynolds No. I had no clue. I mean, I knew how much my housing would be, but I  didn   t have any idea how much school would cost until I got the first charge  on my bursar. Then I was just like,    How am I going to do this?    because on  the website they have the tuition estimator, but it   s so complicated. I never  understood it. When that bill hit, I was just, because by the point that the bill  hit the bursar and I could see it, I knew that I was making minimum wage,  working three jobs, and I was eating ramen every meal. There was almost no  way I could pay for it. I knew that I would still try but that it probably  wouldn   t happen, and I was seventeen. I couldn   t do loans without my  mom   s signature, and also without my mom   s signature, I couldn   t fill out  the FAFSA without her taxes. She refused to give them. Even with  the   well, no, that wasn   t yet, but she refused to give the taxes, which  hindered all financial aid, most scholarships because most scholarships, you  can   t apply for if you don   t fill out the FAFSA. I literally had nothing, but  within a week of being here, I had three jobs. I worked at Panera  Bread  Company , and then from Panera, my trainer there got me a job at the  farmers    market. Then the woman at the farmers    market got me a job in her  kitchen. I was working three jobs.  Milligan How was that, balancing three jobs with your course load?  McReynolds It was really hard, which I   ve never been a lazy person ever. I mean,  growing up on a ranch, you really can   t be. It was hard for me, but I knew  that it was something that I wanted to do. Grades and studying have always  been my thing. The school wasn   t the hard part. I loved that I was learning  and that college was so different than high school. I absolutely loved my  classes but working and doing that and figuring out how to get to work was  one of the hardest things because my mom wouldn   t let me have my truck. I  was walking everywhere, essentially, and trying to find rides.  Milligan Was the bus helpful at all?  McReynolds I didn   t know that there was a bus. I guess I saw it, but I couldn   t figure out  how to use it. Being from southeastern Oklahoma, we don   t really have  those, and I still, to this day, I couldn   t tell you how to use it. (Laughs)  Milligan What orientation did you have whenever you came to campus?  McReynolds None. I came in the summer. I started classes the day I moved in. I didn   t  know what D2L was. I didn   t know how to   I knew how to find my bursar  bill, and that was almost it. I also, I didn   t know that I could use, because all  freshman have to have meal plans, I didn   t know that I could use that in  Twenty Something  convenience store . I didn   t know that I could buy  toothpaste and stuff with that. I didn   t have any orientation.  Milligan What about your   did you have an academic advisor yet?  10  McReynolds Yes. All of my advisors in the ag college except for this one have been  absolutely amazing, but at that point, I didn   t want, I didn   t know how  helpful they were, which I do now. Two, he wasn   t helpful. I mean, even if I  would try to talk to him, he didn   t have time or he wasn   t there. Then later  on in the summer, he told me to go to a community college that I would not  make it at OSU.  Milligan Why did he think that?  McReynolds He said that I couldn   t work as much as I did and make my grades. He  didn   t word it like that, but to me, he was basically saying,    You   re not  smart enough, and you can   t pay for this,    which has been one of the things  that keeps me   when I get really tired at two in the morning studying for  finance, I remember they said I couldn   t do this but I can. All of my other  advisors, I have a great advisor now, and I   ve never met or dealt with  another advisor that would ever say that to any student.  Milligan When you came in and you had three jobs and you were working, I think  part of this is you got your first bursar bill and realized that three jobs at  minimum wage was not going to be able to cover your bill for room, board,  and classes.  McReynolds Right.  Milligan What did you think your options were? What happened?  McReynolds When I got the bursar bill, I, well, all summer, even before I got out, I was  in and out of financial aid bugging the crud out of them, always there.  Anytime I had free time, I was in the financial aid office trying to figure out  how I was going to pay for this and who could help me, and basically, they  were like,    You don   t have your mom   s tax information. We can   t help  you.    It was just the front line people, and I could never talk to anyone  higher than the front line people. At the point that I had done the math (I  love math), I had done the math and figured out that financial aid was not  going to help me and there was no way that I could pay for, I could not pay  my bursar bill with working three jobs. It just wasn   t going to happen, and  they had put the hold on my account. I couldn   t enroll for the fall, which  coincidently also means that I would have no housing. I didn   t have a  vehicle. I mean, I had absolutely nowhere to go. I mean, at that point, I  didn   t have a phone, either. I couldn   t even tell my grandparents, and they  don   t have the resources to help me anyway. It   s not like they could just  drive up here and pick me up.  The day that they put the hold on it and I was in the office and they said,     No, we can   t help you,    that day is when I met Lou and Wes Watkins in  Panera. There   s not really waitressing at Panera, but I was cleaning tables  11  and bringing food out. I love to talk. I was talking to everyone. I was  speaking with them. I had no clue who they were. Actually, I don   t think I  found out until two hours later. (Laughs) We were talking a really long time,  and I checked with my manager, made sure it was okay because they were  really nice. I was just speaking with them, and Wes is from southeastern  Oklahoma. He says that he recognized my accent and kept talking to me  about where I was from. I   m fuzzy on the details (I don   t think I did this),  either I told them that I couldn   t pay for my bursar or they found out, which,  I don   t think I would ever tell anyone that just because that   s the person I  am. Somehow they found out why I was working so much because they   d  seen me at the farmers    market and stuff, too. They found out about my  situation, and we continued talking. I was going to help them move and just  stuff that I could do. One day Mr. Watkins went with me to financial aid,  and as soon as the people recognized him in the front line, they took me in  the backdoor where all the people that can actually do stuff are.  He didn   t even have to really say anything or explain it or anything. He just  had to tell them who he was, and they immediately wanted to help, which is  great because he   s a great guy. I met them. They   re like family now, but I  was fortunate to meet them. A lot of people aren   t. After he went with me,  the financial aid officer, Chad Blew, he helped me find a foundation  scholarship that paid off the rest of my bursar for that semester so that I  could enroll for the next one. He ended up helping me again the next, that  fall semester because I didn   t have time to apply for scholarships. He also,  in the beginning when I said,    Well, wait, that didn   t happen yet with the  taxes,    the front line had told me that Mom didn   t do the taxes so I couldn   t  work, but Chad Blew said,    Well, there are other ways around it. Let me call  and try to get the taxes    because my mom thought that I wanted her taxes  for a different reason, that the school didn   t really need them. He called, and  several other people in the financial aid office called her and asked. She just  refused and wouldn   t answer the phone and hung up on them. When they  realized that this wasn   t really a normal case, they were very helpful, but  getting past, getting into that helpfulness was very difficult.  Milligan What were some of the things they did differently once you had their  attention?  McReynolds They were actually offering solutions instead of just telling me,    No, you  can   t do that.    They explained,    Well, you can file for independent status,  and these are the ways you can do it,    and then they obviously were trying  to get ahold of my mother and explain that they needed it, which they never  would have done if I hadn   t got past the front line. When they realized that  she was actually not doing it and was not supporting me, and then they  helped figure out a way for me to get my independent status based on other  people   s documentation and history and stuff.  12  Milligan You needed that primarily because you were a minor?  McReynolds Yes and no. I   m still independent status right now, and I   m nineteen. I  needed that in order to get a Pell Grant. I needed it to get loans if that was  the route I was going to go, but I did not want to do that. I mean, I probably  would have, but I didn   t have that option at seventeen. With independent  status, that says that you   re supporting yourself, and you go off of your own  taxes. That helped me get a Pell Grant and helped me get financial  scholarships that are needs-based, which are most scholarships. That   s why I  needed it, and I still have it. I reapply for it every year. I have to go through  the process again, but they   re still really helpful.  Milligan Did you have good grades in high school?  McReynolds I would have been the valedictorian at Broken Bow. I had straight As there.  Took all honors classes. I took ag as an elective, but everything else, I just  took honors classes. At Broken Bow, I did, but when I went to OSSM, it  was so hard. (Laughs) I am not a naturally smart person. I   m a study   there  are people that are just crazy intelligent without studying ever, and I   m not  that person. When I went to OSSM, it was harder than anything I   ve ever  had to do. I   d never made a B in my life up to that point ever. When I went  there, I made a C in physics, but the physics teacher, on the second day, he  was like,    You need to drop this class. You   re not going to pass. I   m going  to fail you. You cannot pass this class    because I didn   t have the math  background that everyone else did. I was from the country, and all the kids  were from the city. I mean, there was definitely a separation there, and when  people tell me I can   t do something, that just sets me off. I made a C, which  means I passed. I   ve never been more proud of a grade than that one. When  I went to OSSM, it messed up my GPA. I made three As and two Bs and a  C, and then at Haworth I made all As, everywhere but that school. (Laughs)  Milligan Well, that says a lot, honestly, for the science and math place to, yeah, the  professor should be transparent.  McReynolds It was really difficult.  Milligan I guess the reason why I was asking that is this reflection of a   there   s an  indication that you would be a successful student here if given the resources  and the framework to be involved. There   s nothing there saying that you  didn   t work hard or weren   t able to succeed or wouldn   t graduate. Did you  have to keep working three jobs?  McReynolds Yeah. All through freshman year, I worked three jobs. Even when Chad  Blew told me,    Hey, we will make this happen. We will help you. You need  to stay here,    this and the Watkinses and Bob Norris, several people in  Stillwater, by the fall semester, were behind me, but even at that point that I  13  knew that it would be paid for in some way, shape, or form, I still had that  thought in the back of my mind that I still have right now that I don   t think  I   ll ever get rid of, that it   s not   well, they can say that, but it   ll fall through.  What if this happens and I have to live in my car again, or what if, what if,  what if? I worked three jobs all through freshman year. I ate ramen noodles  all through freshman year, and it was, all through freshman year, it was  constantly,    How am I going to pay for my next meal? How am I going to  pay for next year?    I don   t know what I   m going to do because I didn   t have  the security that a lot of students have that,    Hey, my parents will at least  give me food if I don   t have it.     I didn   t have that. I worked three jobs all through freshman year, and now I  work two. I cut out one, which is nice. (Laughs) In that, a lot of people  don   t   my grandparents didn   t understand it at all because they said,    Well,  Grandpa baled hay on the weekends to pay for his school, and you   re  working three jobs. Why?    A lot of older people don   t understand that at all,  and you don   t know if you get a Pell Grant until into the semester. If, for  some reason, it was rejected or one of those scholarships didn   t come  through, I would be up a creek. I never knew until   last April was the first  time that I ever knew that my school would be paid for or that I could pay  for it because when you piece together scholarships like that, you never  know until September of the fall semester that you   re going to have it  actually there, which is super stressful. (Laughs)  Milligan When are you scheduled to graduate?  McReynolds I am going to graduate December of 2016, a semester early. Super excited.  (Laughs)  Milligan That   s good. I bet you make it. How did you find out that the   you  mentioned that you didn   t find out the Watkinses, who they were, until about  two hours later. How   d you find out?  McReynolds Actually, well, I found out their   I guess they told me their names, but  thirty minutes into the conversation, I went and checked with my manager  and was like,    Is this okay? There   s nobody really in here, but I don   t want  to get in trouble because I   m talking to them.    He said,    No, no, it   s fine.  They   re great people,    and he didn   t really say anything else. Then later they  had spoken so much about southeast Oklahoma. They never told me what  their significance was. Later I called my grandparents, and I was talking to  my grandpa about it. I was like,    Hey, I met this guy, and they were really  nice. They talked about southeast Oklahoma. Do you know who this is?     because they   re in the same range, age range as my grandpa, and he was  like,    You did what?    (Laughs) I was like,    Yeah, they were really nice,     and then he explained to me who they were and how much of a significant  impact Mr. Watkins has had on southeast Oklahoma. He told me that when  14  he taught ag in Smithville  Oklahoma  that he convinced Mr. Watkins to  actually come down there. The next time I was in and I was speaking in  church, all the old people (that   s rude), all the older people, my grandparents  had told them that I   d met Mr. and Mrs. Watkins. They were so excited  because they remembered the day that Mr. and Mrs. Watkins were in  Smithville, Oklahoma, of all places.  Milligan Is that when Wes was in congress then?  McReynolds Yeah, I think so. That night, I guess, after I got off work, he explained to me  all of that. Actually, I don   t really know that they told me their names  because it looks like I would   ve recognized the building that has his name  on it or something. I   m not really sure. (Laughs)  Milligan You and I talked a little bit about this, and I think it   s an important part, that  sometimes people open doors in our lives. That helps us succeed, but we  shouldn   t be required to rely on serendipity for success.  McReynolds Absolutely.  Milligan I want to get to some other stuff, but I want to think about this for a second.  If, after having been through that entire process just to be able to stay here,  just to be able for the opportunity to go to school and complete it from the  situation you came from, are there things that, if there was somebody else in  your situation, how would you get the information that you have to them?  What do you wish that you would   ve had that would   ve helped you get the  knowledge you needed to make this work?  McReynolds I mean, I think even if I had had loads of knowledge and I hadn   t have had  Mr. and Mrs. Watkins, I still probably wouldn   t be here, but a lot of  information would   ve been helpful. Knowing that there is a way, if your  parents don   t comply with the rules, to get around that, knowing that there  are people on campus that will support you if your advisor or your parents or  your grandparents don   t, knowing that   I don   t know that not giving up is  worth it, which I   ve always been that person that doesn   t give up (super  determined and stubborn), but there are a lot of students that aren   t and that  can easily be deterred simply by one person saying,    Hey, you should go to  a community college. You can   t make it here.    I think other people knowing  that it   s worth it to go through all of that to stay here and get an education  and be a part of this family would have been very useful and other things  like knowing how to work D2L, which they do in orientation, which, when I  got to orientation, it was completely boring because by that time, I   d figured  it all out. For people that start summer classes, knowing D2L, knowing that  there are cheaper housing options and cheaper meal plans options would  have been helpful and how to use the buses. That would have been great.  (Laughs)  15  Milligan How do you think you would have been able to find that information in the  situation you were in?  McReynolds Probably if I would   ve waited until the fall semester when they have  orientation, a lot of that would have been covered, the technical stuff, D2L  and the buses and stuff.  Milligan Being where you were and not having access to the phone, having no school  access to the internet     McReynolds Right. There   s no way.  Milligan    and then the librarian and high school counselor. At some point, even  from that perspective, how would you have found any information to just,  the cheaper housing, the     McReynolds I would have had to have a connection on campus. I mean, there   s no way a  high school counselor could know that about every college, but a high  school counselor putting you in touch with someone at OSU would   ve been  super useful, which, I guess maybe your advisors are supposed to be that  person. Mine wasn   t. Having a connection on campus, I think, would have  helped with a lot of that information, but even if I had the connection, I  didn   t have a phone or internet. It was virtually impossible.  Milligan You had internet, it sounds like, at school.  McReynolds Yeah, at school, but you couldn   t do Facebook. They had the restrictions on  it, but yeah, I had the internet at school.  Milligan You had email and things like that if you needed to.  McReynolds Right, yeah. Yeah, I never knew how important email was until I came here.  I never really, the only reason I had an email address was to make a  Facebook. When I came here, that   s now all I use.  Milligan All right. Now that you   re here, what are some of the things that you   ve  done while at OSU, and what are some of the things you liked? What are  some of the other things that were challenging than just being a student?  McReynolds I think my favorite thing about OSU is that it   s not just a college. I   ve met  students that go to other colleges, that they go there to go to class and then  they go home, but OSU isn   t like that for me, at least. Everyone here, most  people here that I   ve ever met love OSU, and there   s a certain family feel to  the students and the teachers and the staff and the faculty. Most people  aren   t just showing up here to come to a job and then go home or to come to  class and then go home. It   s definitely my favorite thing about it. I love the  16  ag college, absolutely. I think that that college in itself embodies that maybe  more than others that I have taken classes with. Those are my favorite  things. (Laughs) I think textbooks are the hardest thing. Knowing when to  buy them and not buy them is pretty hard. Balancing work and school is  hard as a student that doesn   t have support, which, once again, I   ve never  been a lazy person. It   s not as hard for me because I   m that super   I have to  do this at this time and this at this time and this at this time. I have a really  good schedule.  Milligan You   re organized.  McReynolds Very, to the point that it   s obnoxious. It   s still really hard to balance that,  and I think when you   re in orientation, some of the students said that you  can have good grades and money. There   s a triangle. You can have good  grades, money, or friends, and I think that   s very true. You choose two of  them, and then the other one   s just not there. (Laughs) That   s been true for  me. Working and going to school leaves no room for social life, and I mean,  that   s the sacrifice I have to make. I value my education over social life.  That   s okay with me, but some people choose the other way. I guess, as for  things that I   ve done here, going to China   s my favorite thing to talk about  that I   ve done. (Laughs)  Milligan Then let   s talk about it.  McReynolds Freshman year, the Watkinses    son, Wade, works at NOC  Northern  Oklahoma College . He   s the dean of international studies or something like  that.  Milligan At OC?  McReynolds NOC.  Milligan Oh, NOC, yeah.  McReynolds He had a study abroad that the Watkinses really, really encouraged me to do,  and they said,    Look, we can help you find scholarships. You can do this     because I   ve always loved traveling, always. I always have loved learning  and exploring new things. That was something I really, really, really wanted  to do, but I thought that that was only for rich kids and that I could never do  that because I   d been in Oklahoma my whole life, eighteen years. The  Watkinses encouraged me to do that. They helped me get a passport, which,  I   m the only person in my family that has a passport. That was a super scary  process for me, and they helped me enroll for this program. I think I did that  in March. Well, I got my passport the day I turned eighteen. That was in  March, and then in April, Dr. David Henneberry in international studies, he  Facebook messaged me and said,    Hey, I heard about you through the  17  Watkinses. Do you want to set up an appointment with me?    He didn   t tell  me what it was about or anything, and I was just like,    Okay. Sounds fun.    I  went to his office between school and work, between one job, and I only had  twenty minutes. I was talking to him, and he just told me that they were  starting a program. They needed an American student to go to either China  or Mexico and be the recruiter and give orientation to these students about  Stillwater and about OSU and why they should come there and how they  would benefit from coming there and just facilitate that program and help  the (well, it   s through the ag college) ag college where the program actually  is and knowing what they can do to make these students comfortable here to  make the program successful.  Milligan What   s the program?  McReynolds It is   I don   t know if there   s actually a name, but it   s an exchange program  between Oklahoma State University, ag-econ, and China Agriculture  University. Within the program, the Chinese students can do two years there  and then two years here and get two degrees. They   re still shaky on what the  Americans can do. I don   t really know. I know that they can exchange really  easily because all the classes are OSU-accredited, I guess.  Milligan In China?  McReynolds Right. I didn   t have to fill out any of my transfer paperwork or anything  because it was the same classes. Dr. Schatzer approves the syllabus and stuff  that they use in China, and they were in English, which made me happy.  (Laughs) He told me all of this, and in my head, I was thinking,    One, I   ll  never have that much money, and two, I really need to go to work    because  I had to change clothes. I wouldn   t get to eat, and I was like,    What am I  going to do? I really, really, really need to leave    because I just didn   t think  it was a possibility. I mean, I obviously, I was really thankful that he  considered me, but I just was like,    That   s not a possibility, and I mean,  living in a foreign country for a year, who does that?    At that point, I was  like,    Yeah, thanks. I   ll get back with you    and wasn   t really, didn   t think  that I could do it. I went on, and I told the Watkinses about it. I told Wade  about it, and they really, really encouraged it a lot. I also talked to my  grandparents about it, and they were like,    No    because people here, what  they know about China is that they   re communist and the one-child policy,  if that. My grandparents were like,    Absolutely not. No,    but the Watkinses  were very supportive. I kept it in the back of my mind and was talking about  scholarship opportunities for it and stuff, and then I went on Wade   s trip and  found out that I absolutely love traveling. That is something that I want to  do for the rest of my life.  Milligan What was Wade   s trip?  18  McReynolds NOC at Sea. We went to six countries in three weeks. We got six credit  hours, and I had scholarships that paid for, well, I pieced together  scholarships that paid for all of it. We went to six countries in Europe, and I  loved it. That was one of my favorite things that I   ve ever done, and I  realized it   s   I flew by myself. We all met in Sweden. I went through four  airports to just get there.  Milligan Have you ever flown before?  McReynolds No. Well, yes. I   d flown to North Carolina to do summer classes at Duke  when I was thirteen, but I   d never flown internationally. I   d never been  through any of the   I never had to use a passport. I   d never done any of  that, and then I was in airports. The German airport scared me to death  because they   d look so mean. I know that   s stereotypical, but they looked so  mean. They didn   t speak English with me, and I was like,    I need help. I  need to know where to go.    They were like   and they just wouldn   t say  anything. (Laughs) That was super scary, but at, when I finally got there and  I was walking through the streets in Stockholm, I was like,    I can do this.  This is what I want to do. This is what makes me happy.    When I came back  from that, I was like,    Yes. I   m going to do this. We need to figure out a  way to pay for it. I   m going to go to China for a year.    Well, no. I said,    I   m  going to go to China.    I still had the option of going a semester or a year,  and it was crazy trying to piece together the money, once again, to do that  because I would be leaving my three jobs. At this point, I had gotten a job at  a bank, a wonderful bank. I love my job. Best job, probably, I   ve ever had.  Milligan What bank are you at?  McReynolds Well, I   m not there anymore. First National Bank and Trust Company of  Weatherford  Oklahoma . I love that bank. I still go in there every week  because it   s so small and people are so nice. It   s like a family, and I get paid  sick leave and paid holidays, something that I   ve never had. I was leaving  all of the stability that I   d built. That was really tough for me to decide to do.  With that, I told several people but the people that were helping me that I  couldn   t do this unless they helped me pay for it, that I just couldn   t. I don   t  think I knew until two weeks before I got on the plane that the money would  be there and had my acceptance letter and everything. That was crazy. That  was really, really stressful, but it was totally worth it.  Milligan How did you all piece all that together?  McReynolds The Watkinses were very instrumental in it, again, because they knew the  politics of it, I guess. It was crazy because there were three different  departments helping me, but one didn   t want to say how much they would  help me until the other one said how much they would help me. None of  them wanted to say it until the last minute possible. It was just freshman  19  year when I didn   t know if I could pay for school. I didn   t know if I could  pay for this until the last minute possible, until the Watkinses were like,     You have to tell her by this day, or she   s not going,    and at that point, I  wasn   t that person. I would never say that to anyone because   I don   t know.  I wouldn   t ever do that, but that   s what had to be done. I got scholarships  from the Ag College for my plane ticket, and then I got a separate  scholarship for just study abroad. I wrote so many essays, so many essays,  and then I got a Humphreys     Travel  Grant. I think that was it. Yeah, those  three, and then my Pell Grant would apply because it   s an exchange, a  reciprocal exchange. All of my OSU scholarships that I had, like my Pell  Grant, would apply anyway. The Humphreys    Grant and the paying for my  plane ticket was the big thing. Those were the big, big things, and also since  I didn   t know that I was going until two weeks before, I didn   t get to go  through study abroad orientation or all that. I went this year to help with it  and encourage people to go to China. I was like,    This is awesome,    and the  kids were like,    I   m so bored.    I was like,    No, you need to pay attention     because I was so sad that I didn   t get that. I didn   t even know it was a thing  until I was helping with it, but it   s really cool. I wish I would   ve had it.  Milligan What was helpful about it?  McReynolds They tell you, which, I guess the woman in the study abroad went through a  binder of information really quickly, but once again, I was between a job  and class. It had to be very compact, but they actually have a whole day  where they help outgoing exchange students and they talk about getting  bank cards and what not to bring, what to bring, safety things like how to be  more cautious, I guess. Then they break off into groups, and you talk to  people like me. I talked to them about China specifically. The people going  to China came and talked to me, and then they had that for all the countries,  which is awesome. I mean, you can   t get a better perspective than someone  that   s actually done that as a student. I thought that was really, really  helpful, and they even, they have a segment for your parents, which I  thought was really cool because, I mean, typical parents would be freaking  out if their kid was doing that. Not really sure what   s in that session, but I   m  sure it   s calming fears. (Laughs) Then I was also on a panel of people that  answered questions, and they were really, really good questions that  would   ve been super helpful for me. Yeah, I wish I would   ve done it.  (Laughs)  Milligan When did your grandparents find out that you were going to China for sure?  McReynolds A week before I went. (Laughs) I didn   t even tell my grandma that I was  thinking about it. I learned about it in April. I didn   t tell my grandma until  August because she hates flying. She will not board an airplane or a boat.  She wants her feet on the ground, and she was having a lot of health issues  with blood clots and high blood pressure. I didn   t want to freak her out. I  20  didn   t tell her. I talked to my grandpa about it because he   s one of the  logical people in my life. (Laughs) I talked to him about it, and I actually  talked to an ag teacher from Haworth about it just because he was one of the  ones that I didn   t mention that encouraged me to come to OSU. He has a  daughter here. He was one of the ones. I talked to him about it, but I didn   t  tell my grandma until August that I was even thinking about it. When they  found out, I mean, they were supportive, but they didn   t want me to go.  Basically, I had to say,    You don   t pay my bills. I respect you, but I don   t  really have to listen to you.    I mean, I didn   t say it like that, but that   s how I  had to think about it in my mind. I quit all my jobs a week before, and I  went and stayed with them for a week, which was the most time I   d spent  with them since I started school. When they brought me back   that   s the  only time I   ve ever seen my grandpa cry was when the last time that I saw  them, and it was so sad. I came back that evening, and my plane left at five  in the morning. When they dropped me off at eight o   clock, I cried from  eight o   clock until I arrived in China, and I never cry. I   m not that person. I  was scared, and I was stressed. I saw my grandpa cry. I stayed the night with  the Watkinses, and they had a cat. I was sick. (Laughs) They were really  nice. They never said anything about it, but yeah, I cried the whole plane  ride, which was twelve hours or something. It was interesting. (Laughs)  Milligan When you got there, I mean, that...the emotional toll, I mean, I   m hearing  that the emotional toll to just make the decision was huge and not having  any real concept of where you were going. That   s a huge leap to take.  Where do you think you found the courage to go through with it? I mean,  that   s a lot of things that are stopping   you had the momentum, but you  could have probably pulled the brakes at that point.  McReynolds I don   t know. I mean, I   ve always loved doing new stuff. I   ve always loved  learning. I   ve always loved traveling. I knew if I could ever get there that I  could do it, and also it was one of those things that in my mind, I was like,     You can   t do that.    (Laughs) I feel like that   s bad to say, but that   s  definitely what drives me is that when someone or even myself tells me that  I can   t do something, I   m just like,    No, I have to do that.    Well, actually, I  thought,    If I can move to Stillwater by myself and figure out how to pay for  college, I can move to China. It   ll be fine.    (Laughs) I don   t know why that  was rational in my head, but that   s what I thought. I mean, I knew if I ever  got there that I could do it and I would love it, but getting there was the  hardest part. If my grandparents weren   t here, I probably would have left in  a heartbeat. I don   t even think there would have been that huge emotional  toll if my grandparents weren   t here, and even maybe if my grandma wasn   t  so sick because they really didn   t know if she was going to make it. I  thought,    Well, what am I going to do if my grandma dies and I   m in China?  I can   t come back.    I had talked to her about it, and she was like,    Well, I  21  mean, what are you going to do if you   re here? There   s literally nothing you  can do.    She   s a super blunt person.  It was probably worded like that. I had to let go. I mean, even if I   m in  Stillwater, there   s nothing I could do for them in southeast Oklahoma. I   m  really glad that I chose to go. I can   t tell you the exact moment I said,    No,  I   m doing this.    Well, even when I was getting on the plane, I was like,     Nope. I want to go home. I   m done with this.    (Laughs) I think I was still  wavering in my decision, and when I landed and I saw that huge city, there  were no trees. There were trees, but they looked fake. There were just  people everywhere, and there were the biggest buildings I   ve ever seen in  my life. Then I got in my room, and there   s mosquitos everywhere. My  roommate had left the window open and the air conditioner on in the middle  of the summer and opened the screen to the window. There were mosquitoes  everywhere, and she was gone for four days. She knew she was going on a  trip. I was like,    My roommate   s spoilt. There   s mosquitos everywhere. I  can   t see anywhere that there   s not people. I want to go home.    (Laughs)  The first two weeks, I was super not okay. Well, that first day, I had emailed  Wade and was like,    I need a plane ticket out of here now,    and he was like,     Just calm down, calm down.    (Laughs)  After that two weeks when I stopped comparing China to America, I loved  it, but I had to first of all learn how to do things on my own, learn how to  use the subway system, learn how to order food by myself, figure out places  that I could have my peaceful time, which was parks, coincidentally, and  then stop comparing China to the US. After I did those things, I loved it. I  never loved the food, but I loved the place. (Laughs) I   m absolutely really  glad I went, and then I had to decide if I was going to do a semester or a  year. That was another super stressful decision. I couldn   t decide, couldn   t  decide, and then I booked a plane ticket to Cambodia. That was like,    You  can   t leave now. You have to stay a year.    That was my commitment, and  I   m super glad I did that, too. Every student that I   ve talked to that   s  considering study abroad, I absolutely encourage a year because you don   t, I  mean, you   re just getting used to the culture in three months, and you   re just  getting comfortable. Then you leave, and you don   t get to enjoy the  awesome part where you   re comfortable and you know what you   re doing.  I   m really glad I stayed a year. I absolutely loved it, and I got to travel in  Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. I backpacked by myself, and I  absolutely, one of my favorite things I   ve ever done.  Milligan You backpacked by yourself through those countries.  McReynolds Yes.  Milligan Did you have any problems with that?  22  McReynolds No, that was another one of those super emotional things that it was like,    I  don   t know if I can do this. What if I get kidnapped or something?    I didn   t  tell my grandparents until I came back. I mean, moving to Stillwater,  moving to China, and doing that first backpacking trip were probably the  three most difficult decisions I   ve ever made, but I had Wade, who   s been  everywhere, reassuring me. It was really scary the first night, and I stayed in  hostels. I stayed in a room with ten other people that I didn   t know. The first  night, I slept with a pocketknife under my pillow, and then ever after that, I  was like,    No, this is awesome. All these people are doing the exact same  thing I am.    I   ve never, ever gotten along with people my age ever. I   ve  never had friends.  It   s never been a thing, but the people that were traveling were so much like  me. We had so many similarities that I made more friends in that month than  I ever have in Oklahoma. I just absolutely loved it, and I was so scared. I  flew from Beijing to Cambodia, and I was super scared. I didn   t know what  to think, and I only had a backpack of stuff. When I got off the plane and I  saw palm trees, I was like,    Nope, I   m good. I can do this.    (Laughs) It was  so pretty. I probably will never forget that view. It was super stereotypical.  The sun was setting, and there were palm trees everywhere. The lady was  really nice. There was no one around, compared to polluted, tall buildings,  lots of people in Beijing. I absolutely loved it.  Milligan Did someone pick you up from the airport in Beijing?  McReynolds When I first arrived there, the school sent a taxi that didn   t speak English,  and he had    Elizabeth    on the sign. That   s my first name, but I go by  Hannah. I missed him the first time, and he smoked in the car. It was a black  car with tinted windows, a super fancy, black car with tinted windows, and I  was like,    I   m getting kidnapped. It   s like Taken.    Yeah, someone picked  me up. Now that I look back at it, I   m super grateful for that, but it really  scared me when I got off the plane. When I was backpacking and stuff,  when I would come back to Beijing, I would just ride the subway.  Milligan It   s about twelve forty-five, and you have to go, you have to be back at one  thirty.  McReynolds I have class at one thirty.  Milligan You also need to eat today. I   m listening to all these things, paying  attention     McReynolds I   m sorry. I talk so much. (Laughs)  Milligan    that you don   t build in time for food.  23  ------- End of October 26, 2015 interview -------  Milligan This is Sarah Milligan with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program.  I   m talking today with Hannah McReynolds. This is part two of our  interview. Our first interview was a week ago. Today   s date is November 2,  2015. In today   s interview, we will focus primarily on Hannah   s time in  China as an exchange student for OSU to the China Agricultural University.  There   s our context. Quickly, one of the things that I wanted to ask you  about because we talked a lot last week about the obstacles you faced  coming to OSU, the paths and navigations you found to get around them, the  people that helped you along the way, some of the things that you found  useful, and some of the things that would have helped you more. One of the  things we talked about leading up to you deciding that you were going to go  to China and the difficult decision in that and the last minute back and forth  on whether you were actually going to make it or not and the fact that you  got on the plane (yay), one of the things you mentioned, at that time, we also  talked about you going to high school in a couple different high schools but  also the school for (I   m going to get the name of it wrong) science, math?  McReynolds Oklahoma School of Science and Math. (Laughs) OSSM.  Milligan Yes, Oklahoma School of Science and Math. I had a few questions about  that because I know that you asked, you mentioned that that was the only  place that you, that was what helped, dragged your valedictorian status  down because you spent two years at the Oklahoma School for Science and  Math and that it was challenging. I had a couple of questions about that, as  far as your time while you were there. Do you feel like you have, do you  want to talk at all about your memories or your experience while you were  there and how you got there and how long you stayed and all that good  stuff?  McReynolds I was actually only there a semester.  Milligan Oh, a semester. I just remembered wrong. That   s right.  McReynolds Yeah, I was at Broken Bow for two years and then OSSM for a semester and  a month of the next semester. At first, it was something that I wanted to do. I  guess OSSM sends out invitations to select students throughout Oklahoma,  and then you have to go through an intensive application process. At first, it  was something that I wanted to do, but after I viewed the campus and was  told what it was like, I was not wanting to do that.  Milligan What made you not want to do it?  McReynolds I, obviously, am a really independent person, and this school tells you what  to eat, when to study, when to go to class, what you can do with your after-  24  class hours, basically everything that you do in your life. Up to that point, I  started working when I was fourteen, and I was sixteen when I started that  process. I   d had jobs for two years. I   d bought my own food, my own  clothes, my own truck, everything for two years, but when you go to that  school, you can   t have a job. They will not let you have a job, and you have  to have your mom   s permission to leave. You have to have someone  physically come and get you to go off campus. I   m just a really independent  person, and it wasn   t very appealing to me. I wanted to be challenged for  sure. That was the appealing part to me because I   d never been challenged in  high school at all. I knew that I would be there, but I knew that if I didn   t  have a job, how was I going to pay for things? If you get into the school,  everything   s free. They pay for your food.  They pay for your housing and stuff because you live on campus, but my  mom, at that point, was like,    Yes, you need to go.    When I think back on it,  I think of it as she really, really, I was going to go. Her point of view is so  obviously different. She says that I wanted to go. I don   t really know, but  the application process was extremely hard. They select eighty out of  everyone in Oklahoma to go. You had to do an interview. You had to do a  written application and then a written application and an interview and then  another interview. Then you have to take some tests and stuff, but I got in. I  was there a semester, and it was pretty much like I thought it would be.  They told you when to do everything. I couldn   t have a job. You couldn   t  have a cell phone. You weren   t really doing anything on your own, but I was  challenged. I learned a lot coursework-wise, but I think that it doesn   t  develop you any at all for real life. At that point, I was in there, and I was  going to stay because, I mean, I started it.  I was going to finish it. I started in August. I don   t know what year, 2012  maybe, and then January, my mom took me out and put me in a shelter. I  went home for Thanksgiving break, and we had issues. She decided that she  didn   t have enough control over me, basically, because the school was in  Oklahoma City and she was at home. I had to drive back and forth. It   s a  five-hour difference, and she couldn   t really control me from that distance.  She didn   t like that. We had it out, and she told me she could do with me  what she wanted. Then by January, it had just bubbled over. She put me in a  shelter, and that   s how I ended up at Haworth. She actually wasn   t going to  let me go back to school at all, and then the people in the shelter were like,     No, this girl needs to be in school.    I don   t think I started at Haworth until  really late February. I was out of school for a month and a half or  something.  Milligan It wasn   t your choice to   .  25  McReynolds Right. No, it wasn   t my choice to leave at all, but, I mean, it put me here. I  probably maybe wouldn   t be at OSU right now if things had went  differently.  Milligan Yeah, well, we never know.  McReynolds Right, right. (Laughs)  Milligan Another thing that you mentioned, you mentioned the first time you   d been  on a plane was when you were thirteen, and you went for a class in Duke.  Do I remember that     McReynolds Yeah.  Milligan What was that all about?  McReynolds Duke has a program called Duke TIP (that   s Talent Identification Program),  and you, everyone takes their ACT in seventh grade as a practice round or  something. If you reach a high enough score, then you get into this program,  and within that program, you can take classes at Duke University your  eighth and ninth grade year in the summer. You just apply. Then you have to  fill out a bunch of essays, but you have to meet the ACT requirement to get  into that program in the first place. I met the requirement, and I don   t  remember what it was. Then I did the applications. I got accepted, but they  don   t offer scholarships for it. I really couldn   t pay for it, but I knew, I just  started asking for donations and explained to people what the program was  and why I was doing it. I ended up paying for the whole thing through  people contributing. My mom never paid for anything.  Milligan Where were you living at the time? What community were you in?  McReynolds Broken Bow.  Milligan That was when you were in Broken Bow.  McReynolds Yeah.  Milligan Did you get anything out of it?  McReynolds I really enjoyed it. I got scabies out of it. That was fun. (Laughs) It was my  first time flying, and that was really scary. I did it two summers. The first  time, I flew by myself. It was scary, but it was also fun because I like  traveling. I like doing stuff by myself, and I met so many people because  there were so many people my age that were of my intelligence. It was a  really different environment than what I was used to, and I made really good  friends that I still have today. I don   t even remember the class, honestly, but  26  I think it made me realize what I could be a part of, that there were people  that I had more in common with than I had ever had before.  Milligan Before you went to that program, were you already set in your mind that you  were going to go to college?  McReynolds Yes. College has never been   that   s one great thing about my mom. College  has never been a choice for any of us. I mean, since we were little, she was  like,    You are going to college,    which, I   m the only one that did, and I  never really considered any other alternative ever.  Milligan Was she supportive of you going to the Duke program?  McReynolds Yes. I mean, she didn   t want to pay for it, but she wasn   t going to stop me.  She was having   there   s three of us. She was having issues with my sister.  It was    I won   t have to deal with her    kind of thing, I think. (Laughs)  Milligan All right. Duke, did you ever think about going to school there?  McReynolds Not after I got scabies there. (Laughs) As a thirteen-year-old, it was like,     Yeah, I don   t really want to come back here,    and we didn   t have air-conditioners.  Milligan Was that just something from the dorms?  McReynolds Yeah, yeah. I guess there had been an international camp or something  before that is what they told me. I didn   t know what was going on. It was  terrible. (Laughs) I mean, it was a really pretty campus, but I just, I didn   t  really think I wanted to be there. (Laughs)  Milligan Got it. All right. Those were the holes in the timeline that you told us on last  Monday or some of the spaces I wasn   t sure how they reconciled themselves.  Let   s talk about China. The last week we talked, you outlined your choice to  go to China, some of the support that you had to be able to get there as well  as flying over and your first week and deciding you want to travel. Maybe  let   s start with your class experience and meeting your classmates and  getting sorted out in the program itself.  McReynolds Okay. I was there for about a week before I started classes. We talked about  that week. When I started classes, I was the only non-Chinese person in the  class in all of my classes. That was really fun. (Laughs) The teachers, all of  them but one were American or Canadian or some English-speaking  country, and the majority of them were American. That was odd for me to  be the minority. The teachers, I guess not really the first week, but  throughout the semester, they would always reference me always. If they  wanted to relate something to life or something, it would always, it seemed  27  like it was always pointed at me because they were using American  references. The Chinese kids didn   t really understand them.  Milligan What would be an example? Do you remember?  McReynolds If they would bring   ah, I can   t   if they would talk about an American pop  star or in my speech class talk about political campaigns or something, it   s  all stuff that the Chinese kids aren   t really, they   re not going to understand it  if you talk about Toby Keith. I mean, I guess that they wanted to give them  more knowledge about America, too, but it felt like I was always looked at  to answer those questions. Also being in, our school system   s a lot different  than the Chinese school system. In American college and even high school  sometimes, the professors really encouraged discussion and opinions and  answering questions or asking questions, and that   s not the case in Chinese  school system from what I observed and what I   ve been told.  Anytime there was a discussion, I was always the first one to say something,  which happens in America, too, but more there than it did here. I was always  the one that would ask questions, and the kids would even come to me and  say,    Hey, I don   t understand this. Can you ask him?    (Laughs) I would be  the one that would ask the questions because one, they don   t think it   s right  to question a professor because they think that professors are of a higher  class. They see having a different opinion or questioning that teacher   s  opinion as disrespectful, and I don   t, I mean, if you   re doing it in a well-mannered  way, obviously not rude. That was always interesting. I just talked  a lot, which I do anyway, but they really weren   t used to that. They   re still  not.  Milligan You mean now that they   re here?  McReynolds Yeah, now that they   re here, I   ve actually had teachers comment to me that  they just get massive amounts of emails from the Chinese students directly  after class is over. I guess they write all their questions down and then just  email them instead of asking in class.  Milligan Do you think it   s a language comfort barrier?  McReynolds That might be it, too, and I would have, I think it   s more so here rather than  in China because everyone else in the class was Chinese. I don   t know, and  they were really scared of giving presentations, too, which a lot of  Americans are, too. We had a speech class, and they all hated it. I loved it. It  was one of my favorite classes I   ve ever taken. He was an awesome teacher,  and none of them liked him.  Milligan Do you remember who it was?  28  McReynolds Dr. Zuckerman. He   s David Zuckerman. He   s from California. I don   t  know. I thought he was a great teacher. He really didn   t like Oklahoma, but  I thought he was a great teacher. (Laughs) They really didn   t like it because  every class, he had a discussion, and they came up to me after the semester.  They said that,    Well, I worked really hard in this class, and I got a B,    and I  said,    Well, you didn   t say anything the entire class, and that   s 20 percent of  your grade.    They didn   t understand that participation was part of a grade,  even though it was in the syllabus. They also didn   t understand syllabuses,  syllabi, because they also don   t have those, either. They didn   t understand if  it   s in the syllabus you have to do it even if the teacher doesn   t remind you  or there will be a test on that day even if the teacher doesn   t say anything  about it until Monday and it   s on Wednesday.  Milligan What sort of system were they used to? How did they     McReynolds I guess the teacher tells them, reminds them all the time. They didn   t  understand the syllabi at all. That was interesting to me, which, I guess when  I came to college, I didn   t understand how useful it was, either, because we  don   t really use those in high school.  Milligan It   s true. You were in class with all Chinese students. There weren   t any  other ethnicities represented besides Chinese and you     McReynolds No.  Milligan     as the white Caucasian?  McReynolds Yeah. Within the OSU program, there were just me and the Chinese  students. Within the entire ICB, International College of Beijing, there was a  Denver program that had Americans and Chinese people, and then another  program within ICB was some European program that had two Spanish kids  and all Chinese.  Milligan Is ICB International College of Beijing? Is that right?  McReynolds Yeah, yeah.  Milligan Did it ever come up, the fact that you   re actually Choctaw?  McReynolds It did, and that was really fun. They never learned about Native Americans  really. I guess one of their history teachers mentioned it, but their history  teacher was from England or something. He was teaching American history.  I don   t understand that one, but they didn   t understand it. I was really white.  (Laughs) There was actually a history fair thing. I had a map of Oklahoma  and rose rocks from here, and I showed them where the Choctaws walked  from Mississippi and into Oklahoma and explained what happened and why  29  it happened or my opinion of why it happened. I think that they thought that  that was really interesting. Some of them obviously didn   t care, but, I mean,  to them, all white people are just white. They never considered that I had  any other background than just being white, and Chinese people actually  have a lot of minorities that they don   t really talk about. The students in our  class, there   s two that were of those minorities. They were more, way more  interested in it just to see that,    Hey, Americans treated those people bad  also    because the minorities in China are severely persecuted. That was  interesting, and that, within those conversations is when I found out that  those students were not Han, that they were other ethnicities.  Milligan China obviously has a, is widely known for issues with censorship within  their nationality or their nation. Did you have issues with that? Did you  have any encounters with that sort of thing?  McReynolds I had a VPN  Virtual Private Network . Don   t know what that stands for, but  it   s a thing that makes it look like you   re in America or England or  something when you   re on the internet. I actually don   t know that it   s legal,  either, but you just pay for a program. Then you download it, which   .  Milligan How did you find out about the program?  McReynolds Wade Watkins had two former students that were teaching in China, and  they gave me lots of advice. That was their biggest advice was to get that  before I went to China, and they explained to me how to use it and stuff, so  more connections. (Laughs) It worked really well. You just download it on  your computer and run it. I could use Facebook. I could use Google and all  that. My OKState mail was terrible because it   s Gmail. There were a lot of  times that people would send me stuff and I wouldn   t get it for days, and  that   s the internet-wise. I was never in trouble for it. I went to church. I  never got in trouble for going to church. One of the students is Christian.  There are a lot of stuff that the students won   t talk about. That   s more where  I saw the censorship. I never encountered somebody telling me to stop,  while the students were like,    We don   t talk about that,    but I never was in  trouble, I guess. The students won   t talk about Tiananmen Square. They  won   t talk about anything political.  They would never say anything bad about their president. They would never  say anything bad about our president or any leader figure. They just don   t  talk about it. That was actually one of my more memorable experiences. No  one ever told me not to talk about the three T   s: Tiananmen, Taiwan, and  Tibet. The first rattle out of the box, some of the students took me to  Tiananmen Square, and there were so many people there. I don   t know if it  was a holiday or if it   s a   well, I guess it   s always like that. We waited in  line, and we finally got in there. We were in the square, and they were  telling me all this great stuff about Mao Zedong and all this, how he was an  30  awesome person. I was like,    Yeah, what about the people that died here?     and they were like,    Nobody died here.    I was like,    No, yeah, people died  here. I was reading about it last night,    and I was obviously being loud  because I   m a loud person. They were like,    No. No,    and then one girl was  like,    We don   t talk about that.    (Laughs) It was like,    Okay.    (Laughs)  That was interesting.  Milligan That is interesting. Do you think that your experience with that would have  been different if you would have been in a more international school?  McReynolds Probably. I mean, I would have, obviously I would have known more about  China if I would have been in a more international school. Even if I had the  opportunity to go through the study abroad orientation, I would have known  that because they go in depth and stuff like that, but since it was so rushed  and fast, I didn   t get that opportunity. I mean, it   s something that I   ll never  forget, and no one was harmed. (Laughs)  Milligan Did that translate into the class in obvious ways?  McReynolds What they would talk about-wise? Yes, which most of my classes with them  were money and banking and accounting and stuff, but with the speech  class, it was for, the speech teacher actually said,    Well, I   ve given  presentations in blah, blah, blah, Taiwan and China.    A student went off on  him and was like,    That is part of China. You have only given presentations  in China    and was really, really upset, and that was interesting. They won   t  talk to Japanese people ever. Kids my age will not talk to Japanese kids our  age, and there were some on campus. They were just excluded from the  Chinese students, and if you ever mentioned anything with Japan, some of  the students would get really upset.  Milligan Was it explained to you what was going on?  McReynolds Because of World War II. Two? (Laughs) Okay. My history   s a little shaky.  They think that all Japanese people are terrible because of what happened in  World War II, and even here, one of the students here, we went to a hot pot  restaurant. The waiter was making a joke about    Chinese and Japanese will  be friendly in America    or something, and the girl got so upset and left. She  was like,    That was not okay.    I was like,    He was just making a joke.     Milligan She was upset at the inference that she might be friendly with a Japanese  person?  McReynolds Yeah, yeah. That was interesting.  Milligan Did you ever have any interaction with some of the Japanese students?  31  McReynolds Not really. They stuck with their selves. I talked to one about food, and that  was it. (Laughs) All the other international students, besides the ones that  were in the European program and the Denver program, were all graduate  students. We never crossed paths really, and they lived in separate housing.  Milligan You mentioned this a little bit last time, but I don   t think I really got a good  sense of it. You lived in the dorm, and I remember you mentioning you had a  roommate. How did your relationship with your roommate go, and was she  Chinese?  McReynolds (Laughs) Terrible. Yeah, she was Chinese-American or American, whatever.  She was American. No, she wasn   t. Okay. She was born in China, but she  was adopted when she was six months old and raised in a very wealthy  family in Denver. When the Americans go to China, they live in a dorm, but  they only live with other Americans or Europeans. They have international  housing, but they won   t let the Americans or the Europeans live there. We  had to live by our self, and there was only twelve of us.  Milligan All the American students in any programs were all in one compound thing?  McReynolds Yes. Yeah, yeah. We lived on the first floor, and the teachers lived above us.  The American teachers lived above us. It was really weird. At first, I was so  upset. Why did I move to China to live with other Americans? My  roommate was from Denver. She was really wealthy. Well, I guess I said in  the last, but the first day, when I came in, the window was open. The screen  was open. The air-conditioner was on full blast. Automatically, I was like,     I   m not going to get along with this girl,    and she was just, she would stay  up all night. She never went to class. She was there to party. She wasn   t  there to learn, and we   re just really different people. (Laughs)  Milligan You said at first you were upset because you were segregated. At some  point, did it become okay, or did it make more sense why you were in an  American compound?  McReynolds I don   t think it ever made sense. I think if I wouldn   t have known what my  option, I had the option to have a better room, then I would have really  appreciated being in a Chinese dorm, but they live six in a room in a  traditional-size dorm here, six people in one of those rooms.  Milligan Just bunkbeds?  McReynolds Yeah, bunkbeds. They don   t have closets. They have one drawer apiece, and  it   s just bunkbeds with a desk underneath it. There   s three beds on one wall,  three beds on one wall, and that was it. They had to walk to take showers,  walk from here to the road in the dark and in the cold in the winter. The girls  did. The boys didn   t. The girls did. That upset me. (Laughs) They lived in a  32  twenty-story building, and the elevator was broken all the time. At first, I  was like, well, I   d be getting the real experience, but then I was in my room.  I had a terrible roommate, but I was two people in a room of the same size  and had my own bathroom, had my own shower, had access to a kitchen.  They didn   t.  Milligan Why do you think that there was such a disparity even between the Chinese  students, male and female students, and the Chinese students and the  international students?  McReynolds Between the male and the female, I don   t know. I asked that question a lot,  and the more honest people, I guess, said that it   s always that way, that boys  are on an upper level. Then other people, there were rumors and stories and  stuff about how in the dorm that the boys lived in used to be the girls, but  then someone killed their self in it. They moved the girls to the other dorm,  which, none of that seems real to me. (Laughs) It seemed more likely that it  was just because they were boys, and with the Americans versus the  international students. Even the international dorms were better than the  Chinese dorms. They were basically that same setup as the American dorms,  just with more people. Not in the dorm, but more people in a building. I  don   t know.  I was really close to some people from Cameroon and Ghana and different  countries in Africa, and they had been really, really upset about why we  were separated, which, in all honesty, is reasonable. I mean, why are the  Americans separated? It doesn   t make sense to me at all still, but they said  that they found out that it was safety reasons. That   s what they said. I never  really knew, but it made sense a little. Then they were all guys that I was  friends with. They said that America has basically made a lot of people mad,  but then I was like,    I am an eighteen-year-old from nowhere, Oklahoma.  No one would care if I got kidnapped. No one   s going to give you any  money.    (Laughs) They said, well, they don   t think about it like that. I  mean, we had our own security guard and stuff. I don   t know.  Milligan Maybe security?  McReynolds Yeah.  Milligan Did you spend a lot of time with Chinese students or a mixture of that? You  just mentioned having friends in Ghana.  McReynolds The first semester, I spent more time with the Chinese students. I went to  several students    homes. Yeah, I went to several peoples    homes, went to  different places in Beijing with several of the students, and they were really  nice. I think at, by the end of the semester, though, they were tired of having  to play tour guide to this American girl, and traveling with them was hard  33  because they just assumed that I would know stuff. I wouldn   t. I asked lots  of questions, and I think sometimes they got tired of that. By the second  semester, when I came back from my trip, I didn   t, I mean, I still went to  class with them and ate dinner with them and stuff, but I didn   t travel with  them at all. In the second semester, I traveled with the American kids, and  both semesters, I went to dinner and did stuff with international kids, mainly  people from Africa. I had one friend from Indonesia and one friend from  Pakistan. Those were really interesting to me. When I told my grandma I  was going to eat with a girl from Pakistan, she was like,    No,    and I was  like,    Grandma, please. This girl is twenty years old. She has nothing to do  with anything you   re thinking about.    The girl from Pakistan, actually, she  was the only female that I have yet to meet today from Pakistan. I   ve met  lots of males from Pakistan, but not females. I asked her about it, and she  said that they, females are 75 percent less likely to leave the country than  males. She is really the exception, and her family wasn   t really happy about  it. It was interesting.  Milligan How did she choose to go to China then? Do you know?  McReynolds I don   t know. She never really got into it. She said that her mom didn   t want  her to go, her grandparents didn   t, but her dad did. I assume she came from a  wealthy family and her dad helped her, but she was really sweet. She had the  very different outlook on a lot of things.  Milligan How did you meet other international students?  McReynolds I met her on a trip to the Great Wall that ICB had for all the international  students, and then the African, the students that were from different  countries in Africa, they would just come up and talk to me on campus.  They   re what I wish Americans were like and what I wish I, myself, was  like. They would just see me walking by myself then just come and talk to  me. They never thought,    She   s going to ignore me, or she   s going to be  upset.    I mean, it wasn   t just because I was a female and they were male  because they did it with the other American boys, too. I wish more people  were like that.  Milligan What did they ask you about? Do you remember?  McReynolds They asked me where I was from. Obviously that   s the first question  everywhere. They would ask me about my family, brothers and sisters, and  then they would ask me why I was in China and not at home. Most of them  were of the opinion that I should be at home. They would   ve gotten along  great with my grandparents. (Laughs) They wanted to compare the cultures.  They would ask me,    Well, when you   re dating someone, what do you do  here versus what we do here?    When you have kids, do you have to be  married because I would always talk about my niece and nephew, and my  34  sister   s not married. That would just start a whole conversation. (Laughs)  What kind of food do you eat, what   s your favorite food   s a lot of the  questions, how does China compare to where you   re from, stuff like that.  Milligan Why did they think that you needed to be home?  McReynolds (Laughs) Two of them I was closer to, they thought that that was a woman   s  place. That was their thought. They said that no one from their home, no  woman from their home would do what I was doing, and they were almost  upset that I wasn   t married or dating someone. Not that they wanted to date  me, but just because I should be doing that by now.  Milligan Yet they were, you still considered them your friends?  McReynolds Yeah. I mean, they didn   t say it in an offensive way. I just thought it was  really interesting to see the different cultures or even to see how much that  aligned with my grandparents    cultures. It was really interesting, some of the  conversations we had, just to see how different everything was.  Milligan Were there other things that surprised you, coming from Oklahoma to  China? You talked a little bit about when you got off the plane and realizing  you were being in a city, but did you acclimate okay, for example, to being  in a really huge city for that period of time?  McReynolds I think that I did, but I also think that I didn   t. I mean, I was okay. I was fine.  I was happy most days, but just like anything else, you have your down  days. It was really hard for me to find stuff to do in a city for me because I  was so used to being in the country. I would find myself thinking,    Wow,  I   m bored,    and then I would think,    I   m in China.    This is second semester,  not first semester, and then I would think,    I   m the luckiest person alive, and  I   m saying I   m bored.    I could hear my grandma   s voice in my head saying,     Intelligent people are never bored.    (Laughs) Then I would just go and start  walking, and I did that a lot through both semesters. I just walked and saw  everything. I think I did okay getting used to being in a city. I don   t think  that I would ever want to live in a city like that for ten years just because  there were so many people all the time, all the time. You could never get  away from people, and it was really dirty, really dirty. That stereotype about  China is true. Well, there   s some truth to it.  Milligan You mentioned that you went to church while you were in China. How did  you find a church community, and what was it like?  McReynolds Well, one of the students took me to church, to a government-sanctioned  Chinese church. There are international churches for international people,  and then there are government-sanctioned Chinese churches. Those two  35  different types of churches were completely opposite. When I went to the  Chinese church   .  Milligan A Christian church?  McReynolds Yeah, it was Christian. We waited outside for two hours to get in. There was  a huge line. You had to wait in line because the seats would fill up, and then  there would be another service later. You would just wait in line until you  finally got in.  Milligan Was it a big building?  McReynolds It was a big building. (Laughs) I would say that there were 200 to 300  people in there, and even when we left, there was still a line of mainly  Chinese people. They would check their passports and stuff. They didn   t  check mine because I was white, I guess.  Milligan Why would they check their passports?  McReynolds It   s their ID card thing because   I don   t know. I don   t know. (Laughs) I just  saw them do it and thought it was weird. I have no idea why.  Milligan There were so many people that they had to check your ID before you could  go in?  McReynolds Yeah, yeah, yeah. I only went to that one once.  Milligan What was this one? What was the service like? Was it in Chinese?  McReynolds It was in English. The preacher was Chinese. It was hard to understand,  which is one of the reasons I didn   t go back, and then the second reason is  that it was all out of the Old Testament. It was all law. It was all before  Jesus. It was like,    Don   t do this. Don   t do that. Don   t do that.    There was  nothing about love or grace or anything like that. I didn   t feel like it was  what I wanted to be learning. (Laughs)  Milligan What type of church did you or do you go to here at home? Is it an  affiliation? Is it a New Testament denomination?  McReynolds I was raised in a non-denominational. My grandpa was a preacher, but I was  raised in a church where it was more of a discussion. It wasn   t someone  standing up there shoving the Bible down your throat, I guess. I don   t really  go to church here because I haven   t found one like that yet, but, I mean, any  of the churches that I   ve ever gone to have been, I mean, if they teach out of  the Old Testament, they relate it to the New. I was raised with the main part  36  of my beliefs being based on Jesus died on the cross for me, and that church  didn   t ever say Jesus in any of the     Milligan Sermons.  McReynolds    sermons, yeah.  Milligan You went to the government-sanctioned Christian church, one of them, and  that was really heavy Old Testament.  McReynolds It came out in the Chinese people that I talked to that were Christian and  were open about it. The girl that   s here, she would say things like,  something like,    I kissed a boy. I   m not a real Christian    or    I said a cuss  word. I   m not a real Christian    or    You said a cuss word. You   re not a real  Christian,    and I was just like, that   s not, I mean, that   s not what I was  taught. That   s not what I believe. It was very evident that that   s what she  was raised with, and all the other Chinese Christians that I talked to, that   s  what they were raised with. There are people here raised like that, too, but it  was very overwhelmingly that way there.  Milligan What was the difference between the government-sanctioned and the  services that were international?  McReynolds The international church was awesome. It was great. It was predominantly  people from countries in Africa, and they have amazing music. I love their  music. I   ve always been a fan of worship, but they just blew it out of the  water. They were, and it was taught, some New Testament, some Old. They  cycled their preachers. They would have, because I guess people leave and  come and go. It was different all the time, but I never felt like, that they  were just teaching law like I did with the other church. The people in that  church, I felt more welcome there because most of the people were from  countries in Africa. They just had a completely different perspective, and  they were so welcoming and loving. They would talk to you just out of  nowhere. I went by myself a couple of times, and there would always be  someone that would come and sit with me. It was predominantly people  from countries in Africa, but there were also people from the UK, Ireland,  different places.  Milligan Were Chinese nationals allowed to go to that church?  McReynolds No. I saw a few, but I don   t know. On the bottom of the bulletins, it says,     Passport is checked at the door    or something, but I was never checked.  They checked it at Christmas. Then the people that had gone to the church  regularly said that they check it on all the major holidays.  Milligan To make sure that you   re not Chinese?  37  McReynolds Yeah, yeah.  Milligan How did that make you feel?  McReynolds I just saw it as another way that they   re censoring what people in China  learn or know or have access to without censoring international people.  Without offending international people, they   re still having their grip on  censoring Chinese people.  Milligan Did you ever talk with your friends, your Chinese friends that you knew  were Christian? Did you ever talk with them about the difference in services  or the services that you went to?  McReynolds I did. One girl that   s here now, I talked more intensively with her about it. I  tried to explain to her about Jesus and this is why he died on the cross and  grace and love, and she just said,    Well, that   s not what a Christian is. A  Christian is you do this and you don   t do this and you do this.    She was very  set in that. We never crossed, never came to a meeting of the minds, but  she   s going to a church here. I haven   t talked to her about it since then, how  she compares the two.  Milligan That will be an interesting conversation. What else did you do while you  were over there? I know that you talked a little bit about traveling on your  own, which is really impressive, through Vietnam, and do I remember  Cambodia?  McReynolds Cambodia and Thailand and Malaysia.  Milligan Right, and Thailand and Malaysia. We talked a little bit about you doing  that. Is there anything else that you wanted to add from that trip? I think you  talked more about staying in the hostels and backpacking and the  independence and the comradery, as well as the fear going into that. Did  you have a favorite place?  McReynolds Cambodia or Malaysia. Cambodia, when I first went into the country, I went  to see Angkor Wat. That   s why I chose that place is because I wanted to see  that, and when I got there, I met the girl from Scotland in a hostel. She said,     Well, you have to go to Phnom Penh and go through the Killing Fields.  You have to do this,    and I was like,    I don   t know what that is.    I started  googling stuff. I went, and I went through, you put a headset on. You walk  through this field, and it makes you stop at key points or whatever. It tells  you about   I just thought Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge and what the  people of Cambodia have been through, and after   I had been in Cambodia  for a week before I did that or more than a week, for a little bit, and before I  did that, all I could think about that entire time was how nice these people  were, how giving and caring and how helpful they were. Then I went  38  through that. I learned about that and saw the pictures and saw the bones,  and it just put a whole new perspective on that, that these people could go  through that. People that I was talking to that were my mom   s age had lived  through that or my grandparents    age had lived through that and so much  more, and realizing that they had gone through all of that and they were still  that content and that happy and that helpful, that was really, because there  are people in America that drive a car that is worth more than those people  will ever have in their entire life.  They   re not happy, and they   re super not-nice. To see that, to see those  people be able to make the most of their life when they have nothing, that  was, I really loved Cambodia, and it was beautiful. It was beautiful, too, but  it was more about the people. Malaysia was the same way. When I went  there, I didn   t actually mean to go there, but I ended up there. I had never  really been around Muslim people ever, and I was brought up to think that  Muslim people were terrorists. When I went there and I got off the bus out  in the middle of nowhere, this Muslim lady came up to me, and she said,     I   ll help you.    I was like,    This woman   s going to kidnap me.    Now,  looking back at it, I   m like,    I have a 100 pounds on her. I   ll be fine,    but  she took me to five different places to try to find me somewhere to sleep.  She let me use her adapter. She introduced me to her children, and within  the time that I was there, we became really good friends. That woman and  herself changed the way I look at Muslim people. In my mind, I had never  thought that I had thought that all Muslims were terrorists because, I mean,  that was never okay to me, but when I landed in this country and that  woman said that to me right getting off the bus and my automatic reaction  was,    She   s going to hurt me,    then I thought,    Wow. This was in my  subconscious.     Milligan When you got off the bus, she identified herself as Muslim?  McReynolds No, she had the (I don   t know what you call it) head stuff on.  Milligan Oh, a hijab.  McReynolds Yeah, hijab. We talked about religion and the similarities and differences  that we believed in. She was really open about it. It was really interesting.  Milligan Why do you think that she approached you?  McReynolds I don   t know. I was by myself. I was the only girl in the van. I didn   t have  anywhere to stay. I was just winging it. (Laughs) I think that was it, and we  just started talking. We were the only two women. There were Malaysian  men everywhere trying to sell people stuff that were getting off this bus or  minivan thing. She was like,    Don   t buy anything. Don   t buy anything.     (Laughs) It was like,    Okay.    She just took my arm and took me away from  39  all those people and said,    We can go look here and here and here to try to  find you somewhere to stay.    She lived right outside the oldest rainforest in  the world. I went through the rainforest and stuff, and that was one of my  most memorable things. Then Angkor Wat and the Killing Fields in  Cambodia, Vietnam, going through the C    Chi Tunnels where the Vietcong  soldiers hid and learning, just walking through there and thinking of all the  people that I know that were in that war and how they must have felt coming  from southeast Oklahoma into this jungle and coming from being raised  with you don   t shoot people in the back and then this tour guide telling us  that they set booby traps and showing us the traps, sharpened bamboo with  snake venom on the points and showing us where they dug holes and  covered it up where the people would fall in. Then the soldiers would just  pop out of the tunnel and shoot the Americans. Didn   t tell anyone I was  American. (Laughs) That was really interesting. I was the only American in  the tour, unless someone else was hiding it.  Milligan Do you think they assumed you were or that you were either British,  Canadian     McReynolds I don   t know. I said I was from Canada. (Laughs) I don   t know. I stayed in  the middle of all the people because you could, the tour guide, you could tell  that there was resentment there. In Cambodia, I saw it, too, because I didn   t  know this, but part of the reason that Pol Pot had so much control over the  Cambodians is that Cambodia was being bombed, I assume, on accident. I  don   t know, but Cambodia was being bombed by America. The people were  fleeing the countryside and going into the city, and that   s how Pol Pot had  more control is because he said,    We   ll keep you safe and move you here.     There was that, and then I went, I don   t know what you call it. I walked  down a giant waterfall backwards hanging onto a rope.  Milligan Rappel?  McReynolds Yeah. I did an eighty-foot waterfall, and then we did four waterfalls. We  jumped off cliffs and stuff, and it was so much fun. That is one of my  favorite things I   ve ever done. I was scared to death when I was doing it, but  it   s absolutely one of my favorite things. I   m really glad to get out alive.  (Laughs) Then scuba diving in Thailand. You have a main point in all your  trips, and those were my main points in those, I guess.  Milligan Then you started your second semester in the university after that trip?  McReynolds Yeah, yeah.  Milligan As you   re nearing the end of your time in China, what were your feelings?  40  McReynolds It was really difficult for me to figure out what I felt because I really wanted  to go home. I don   t know. Well, I do know I was so tired of the city. I was  so, so, so tired of people constantly being around me, having everything that  I did have to be explained six times, not having the food I wanted. That was  the main thing was not having the food I wanted. (Laughs) I missed my  grandparents like crazy. I was ready to come home.  Milligan Did you talk with your grandparents on the phone?  McReynolds I did. I Skyped my grandparents every Saturday. (Laughs) If I didn   t Skype  them, they were super upset. They thought I was dead. I talked to them  every Saturday, but it was always, I think it just made me miss them more,  being able to talk to them. That was really, really hard for me. When I was  younger, my mom would go through periods where she wouldn   t let us talk  to them at all, and after I turned eighteen, I thought that I would never have  to go that long without seeing my grandparents again. I did. (Laughs) That  was really hard. The food and my grandparents were the hardest things. I  think I was ready to come home, but I also, I wasn   t ready to be back in  America. A week after I came back and I saw my grandparents, I was ready  to leave again. (Laughs) That was interesting.  Milligan Explain that a little bit. You weren   t ready yet to be back in America.  McReynolds I don   t know. I knew that when I came back I would have to deal with  family drama, and I would have to continue figuring out how to pay for  school. I would have to be back in the real world or my real world that   s just  full of trouble. I mean, that   s what America is to me. Not as a whole, but in  my life, it   s pretty much been just struggling.  Milligan Is that home, you mean?  McReynolds Yeah.  Milligan Have you gone anywhere else since you   ve been back?  McReynolds No.  Milligan When did you come back?  McReynolds I came back in July.  Milligan July 2015?  McReynolds Yeah, and I   m going to Costa Rica in December. I   m super excited.  (Laughs) It   s hard for me. I   m so tired of being here because I just   .  41  Milligan It   s been four months?  McReynolds Yeah, yeah. (Laughs) I was done after a week because I just, I go to school,  I go to work, and I go back to my room. Everyone understands what I say,  which, I mean, it   s something that I wanted to be back to, and now I hate it.  There   s no challenge in doing anything. I mean, my finance stuff was hard,  but I didn   t have to struggle to order dinner. There   s nothing new, I guess.  Milligan Speaking of struggling to order dinner, how did you, how proficient was  your Chinese by the time you left?  McReynolds Chinese is super difficult. (Laughs) I can still carry on conversations with  the Chinese students. They always answer me in English. I could get by. I  could not write. I can write ten characters. I can write in pinyin, which is  English alphabet letters but not characters. I couldn   t write, but I could  speak enough to order dinner and find food and carry on conversations. The  Chinese students say that my Chinese has improved more since I   ve been  back than since I was there, but they didn   t really talk to me that much the  last month that I was there because they were getting ready to come here.  They had so much to do that we never, other than in class, we never really  saw each other.  Milligan Your classmates in China are now the same classmates that are here?  McReynolds Right. Yes, ma   am.  Milligan I guess, logically, I knew that, but when I heard you talking about them tour  guiding you around your first semester there, are those the students that  you   re tour guiding around now?  McReynolds Yes, yes, yeah, and I can definitely see where they got tired of it. (Laughs) I  love helping them and I really enjoy showing them America and the way we  do things, but some days you just don   t want to have to explain yourself four  times. You just have to have your moments of peace and then go back to  helping. It   s really fun. I think they really like it here. They hate the food,  which, when I was in China, they made fun of me all the time because they  would ask me,    What do you miss?    and I would always say food every  time. They would laugh at me. Not in a    feel sorry for me    way, but they  always called me fat. When I would say that I missed food, they literally  said,    It   s just because you   re fat,    and now they all miss the food so bad.  They complain about it all the time, and I   m just like,    I told you so.    I told  every one of them to put food in their suitcases instead of six pairs of high  heels, and none of them listened to me. (Laughs)  Milligan Is it weird that their answer to you was it   s because you   re fat?  42  McReynolds When I first moved there, it was really offensive. N   h  n pang was the first  phrase that I learned, and that means,    You are fat    because I just heard it so  much. As a younger child, I struggled with my weight my entire life, and I  was bulimic for three years. Moving to a country where everyone   s size zero  and they   re so intense about losing weight was hard until I decided that even  if I was super skinny they would still find something to make me different  because I am different. I   m American, and they   re Chinese. I   m in China.  Once I accepted that I was going to be different, it was so much fun because  I would just be like,    Yeah, well, you   re skinny.    (Laughs) It was  interesting.  Milligan How are they enjoying all the chicken-fried steaks here in Oklahoma?  McReynolds They do not like the food at all. They don   t like it. Most of them cook every  night, and they just pretty much, they don   t even try the food anymore,  which upsets me until I look back on my Timehop where it shows what I  was doing last year and I see that I was cooking food in my kitchen.  (Laughs)  Milligan Your Timehop on Facebook?  McReynolds Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, they just don   t like the food. (Laughs) They like  steak. Yeah, most of them like steak.  Milligan Well, there   s enough of that.  McReynolds Yeah. (Laughs) It   s Oklahoma. They came to the right place. (Laughs)  Milligan You came back in July, and you talked a little bit about preparing to come  home. Are there things that you miss about China?  McReynolds I definitely miss being in a country where I was the minority. It was just  such an awesome experience. I miss that, and I miss some of the food,  which is weird because I hated the food when I was there. There   s a certain  minority food in China. One of the minorities in China, their food is  amazing, and I love that food. It   s in New York City and LA. That   s it in the  United States.  Milligan What   s the minority? What is it?  McReynolds I don   t know. It   s the western region of China. It   s the people in China that  are Muslim, and they have amazing food. It   s so good.  Milligan What   s the difference?  43  McReynolds It   s bread-based, first of all. It   s pita bread, I guess, the flat circle bread, and  yogurt and sheep and lots of meat, lots and lots and lots of meat. I love meat.  I guess traditional Chinese food is just rice and noodles and vegetables and  two pieces of meat, and Chinese food is usually soupy, whereas that   s just  meat and solid, full-formed vegetables. I really like that food. (Laughs) They  use a lot of cumin, and I   d never realized what cumin was or anything. I  absolutely love it, and I can   t find that food anywhere here. That   s upsetting.  I guess, like I said, I miss the challenge of having something new every day.  I mean, I can walk ten foot one direction and see something that I hadn   t  seen before or something that I didn   t understand, whereas here, it   s just the  same thing.  Milligan Have your goals for your life changed from the time before you left China to  coming back?  McReynolds Absolutely. Growing up, well, up until I was fifteen, I was set that I wanted  my life to help people. That   s what I wanted my life to be. When I hit fifteen  and everything went to hell in a handbasket, I said,    I just want to make  money. That   s my goal in life is to have as much money as possible and  never have to live in my car,    and I held from fifteen to when I moved, well,  fifteen to Cambodia, that was my goal. After being in those countries that,  and not even China, I mean, Cambodia, parts of Malaysia, parts of Vietnam,  places where there were children in the streets without clothes that were  super excited to get a hot dog, and that   s when I realized I would never,  ever, ever be happy just trying to make the most money possible. I have a  war in my head that says,    Well, I don   t want to end up like the rest of the  people in my family and be struggling to feed myself, but also I don   t want  to end up just trying to make the most money possible and have a  Lamborghini and all this money in the world and never help anyone.    I  don   t know how I   m going to find that balance. It definitely changed by  leaps and bounds. (Laughs)  Milligan Do you have an idea what you want to do after you graduate with your  career?  McReynolds No. (Laughs) I have that ongoing battle in my head. On one side, I want to  work for Scoular or Tyson   s or some big ag company and just try to climb  the ladder and make a bunch of money, and on the other hand, I want to  move to Cambodia and help improve rice production to feed children. I  don   t know. (Laughs)  Milligan Do you have role models?  McReynolds I guess my grandma. It   s really hard for me to answer that question because  my grandma   s the person that, she   s the one that has made me want to help  people. She   s the reason that I know that I would never be happy not helping  44  people and not having an impact, but on the other hand, she   s also the reason  that I know that I never, ever, ever want to have to depend on a man for  anything or have to ask my nineteen-year-old granddaughter to send me  money for food. She   s both ways. I mean, I really, if I could be like her, I  would know that I did something with my life, but on the other hand, I  wouldn   t be like her for a million dollars. (Laughs) I guess her? I don   t  know. (Laughs)  Milligan No, that   s a loaded question. I was just curious if you thought about it, but  that   s a fair answer. You know you   re going to Costa Rica, and you   re set to  graduate, remind me again? You told me last time.  McReynolds December 2016.  Milligan A year from, basically a year from now.  McReynolds Yeah, yeah. I   ve looked at grad schools because any international work  basically requires a master   s degree at the least, and I know I want to be  international, whatever I end up doing. There   s a grad school in Germany  that has a sustainable agriculture program that I   ve looked at, and then OSU  has the master   s of international ag. Those are the two that I   m looking at  right now, but I have no idea. I really want to graduate in December and  then backpack from two hours after graduation to two hours before classes  start in August for whatever master   s program I start.  Milligan I hope you   re able to do that. Where would you go?  McReynolds I really have to go to countries in Africa. After meeting all the people from  Africa that I met, I just absolutely need to go there. Everyone thinks that I   m  crazy, but I would absolutely love to do that. I   m thinking that I would  backpack through there, whatever countries I can, which Wade is my yes-no  person. If he says it   s not safe, it   s not safe. I want to do that, and given the  time, just start at the bottom and go up. I definitely have to go to Israel  within the next two years.  Milligan Why the next two years?  McReynolds (Laughs) My grandma has always wanted to go to Israel, but she is scared of  planes. She   s scared of ships. I even told her that I would use all the money I  have saved, well, not all of it, but some of the money that I have saved and  take her to Israel. When she had a blood clot and they didn   t think she was  going to live, I was like,    We   re going to Israel right now    because that   s  just something she   s always wanted to do. She was like,    No.    (Laughs) She  said,    You can go and take pictures and bring it back and tell me about it.    I  need to do that quickly. I   ve heard from people around campus that have  traveled that if you go to Israel, then you can   t get into Jordan or different  45  countries in the Middle East if that stamp is on your passport. I think I   m  going to go up from the bottom and then skip Israel and then go to Greece,  Italy, different countries on that side of Europe and then go back to Israel  and then come back or go to Germany. That   s what I want to do.  Milligan That sounds like a plan to me. I hope you make it.  McReynolds Me, too.  Milligan I hope you make it. Well, is there anything else about China or your time at  OSU that you want to talk about? You feel like we covered your China  experience today?  McReynolds Yeah, yeah. Most of it.  Milligan It   s hard to know what all   s involved because obviously I didn   t live it.  McReynolds Right. Yeah.  Milligan It   s an interesting perspective. It   ll be interesting for you to talk to your  classmates, your Chinese classmates, at the end of their time here.  McReynolds Yeah, they   re here for two years, which, most of them are going back in  Christmas. That   s the difference between me and them is that they came in a  group here and also all of them are wealthy. They can go home or fly to Las  Vegas or whatever they want to do, which I couldn   t. There   s a difference  there, but I   m really interested to talk to them when they come back.  Milligan Their Las Vegas is your Cambodia.  McReynolds Yeah, yeah. Five of them are going to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving break for  two days, and I was like,    Was that expensive?    They were like,    No, it was  just  500 apiece,    and I was like,    What?    (Laughs) That   s interesting, their  version of expensive versus mine.  Milligan That   s true. All right. Well, we will call it to an end here then, and I   m  looking forward to talking to you again in ten years after you   re doing  something exciting.  McReynolds (Laughs) Hopefully after I   ve backpacked in Africa.  Milligan That   s right. Come check in. (Laughter) If you go, come check in. All right.  We   re stopped. Fascinating.  ------- End of November 2, 2015 interview -------
