Story_ID: 70932
Speaker 1: Now I'd like to begin with your telling us your parents' names, and then I'd like you to tell us about your, your maternal grandparents.  First give me both of your parents' names.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Lenora Clarke Curtis.  And my father's name was Henry Curtis.  My maternal grandmother was Melvina Clarke.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything, any stories about her?
Speaker 2: Well my parents, both of my parents came from the Bahamas.  My father came from Cat Island, which is the also home place for Sidney Poitier.  In 1910, he came to Miami [Florida] in 1910 from the Bahamas.  And my mother was from a place called Exuma in the Bahamas and she came later on, about in the '20's [1920's].  They were not married when they both came to Miami.  And then my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, Melvina Clarke was also from Exuma in the Bahamas.  So I'm a first generation American.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any stories about your grandmother, your grandfather also?  Your maternal grandparents.
Speaker 2: Yes, my, my, my grandmother was very strict.  My, my grandfather died--well I did not know my grandfather.  But he had also migrated to Miami.  And my grandmother was a very strong woman.  She, she had children that she left in the Bahamas, and then she had two children here in Miami.  And she reared them and reared us, really also with very strict rules and regulations.  She was very careful about who we associated with.  If we--if someone came to our house, she had to know their parents.  She had to know what church they went to.  She had to know where their parents worked.  She had to know a lot about our associates, and so because she was very protective.  And my mother and father lived on Miami Beach, on premises of the people that they worked for.  And, and we could not live with them because that was during segregation.  And so we could not go to school on Miami Beach.  Only persons who worked there were allowed to stay there.  So my grandmother and my aunt had to come in and move in with us so we would have adults in the house.
Speaker 1: Your aunt's name?
Speaker 2: My aunt's name was Beulah Clarke Ferguson.  And and she also helped to rear me.  She was--she and my grandmother.
Story_ID: 70933
Speaker 1: So your fa--your--anything about your paternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well I really did not know them.  I did not know my, my father's [Henry Curtis]--but I heard about him.  He was a captain on a, a ship.  And then he went from island to island on the ship.  And the thing that they tell me was that he, he would always have a different lady in every port, so they, they told me that he was quite handsome, and that he was just a man about town, or a man about the islands I should say.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His, his name was--they called him Handy, Handy Curtis, yes.
Speaker 1: Anything about your father's mother?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't know anything about her, except that he talked about her very little after he came to, to this country.
Story_ID: 70934
Speaker 1: So what type of relationship did you have with your mother [Lenora Clarke Curtis]?
Speaker 2: We were very close.  Now my mother was a model, you know she was always dressed as a model.  She was very particular about her appearance.  And she was very active in the church and she would have her hat and her gloves and her shoes and her pocketbook were alike.  In fact when she passed, I, I found a receipt.  She would, she would buy--she would go to a shoe store and she didn't have--she wanted expensive shoes.  But she didn't have enough money to buy the shoes at this one time.  So she would pay, I don't know, maybe a dollar or two or whatever, a week, until she could get these shoes out.  And, and the pocketbook that matched.  And then there was a dressmaker who she would go to, to, to make her clothes because she wanted to be unique.  And the dressmaker's name was Mrs. Winifred Thompson right here in, in Miami [Florida].  And so people always remind me of her now and, and how she was very particular about her appearance and how she wanted me to dress as she dressed.  And so I sort of rebelled against that for a period of time and then after going through that rebellion, I started trying to dress similar to my mother.
Speaker 1: Your siblings.  Could you name them in order, and the ages of the brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Okay, my oldest brother was Samuel, Samuel Curtis.  And Henry Curtis.  Samuel has passed.  Henry Curtis--Henry is still living.  My youngest brother was Israel, and he has also passed.  And I had two sisters, but they didn't live with us because they lived in the Bahamas, Anna and Sybil.
Speaker 1: So you were the only girl in the household.
Speaker 2: I was the only girl in the household, yes, yes.
Story_ID: 70935
Speaker 1: So what type of relationship did you have with your father [Henry Curtis]?
Speaker 2: I was the pet.  My--I was a daddy's girl.  And he--my daddy called me Shug.  And he, he just wanted the best for me and he wanted me exposed to whatever was going on.  I was always in plays and programs at the church.  We had to--at Christmas or Easter when there was a program at the church, I had to learn what we call my piece.  I had to learn a poem or some recitation from memory and get up and say it and speak so that they could be proud of me.  And so I, I also participated in plays in, in school, in elementary school and in high school.  And so they, they wanted me to have all--whatever experiences, whatever was going on, they wanted me to be a part of it and to have that kind of experience that gives you some self assurance about what you can achieve.  And even if I thought that I couldn't achieve it, I, I'd better try and do the best that I could, so I learned to do public speaking and they had me in the choir.  I, I wasn't that good with singing, but I was in the choir.  So whatever was going on, I was a part of it.
Story_ID: 70936
Speaker 1: So going back a step to your father [Henry Curtis], what did he do and what type of man was he?
Speaker 2: My father was a gardener.  And he was also a minister.  He, he rose to a level of Bishop in the Church of God Prophecy.  And he was a very strong man also.  He believed in, in the dignity of all people and he upheld that dignity.  He, he pastored churches here in Dade County [Florida].  He pastored a church, the Church of God of Prophecy in Ojus, Florida.  Now Aventura has taken that up, you can hardly find Ojus now.  But he also pastored a church in a place called Liberia, it, it's the black section of Hollywood, Florida.  And he also pastored the Church of God of Prophecy in Liberty City [Florida].  So he pastured churches in different places of Dade and Broward County [Florida].  And I just remember him as a, a strong, religious man having faith in God and believing that God would take care of us no matter what the situation was.  One instance I remember of coming home from church one night on State Road Nine and, and the policeman stopped us.  And my father got out of the car.  And he--the policeman told my father to take his hat off.  My father had his hat on.  And so my father had to go to school.  He went to Dunbar Elementary School to study the Constitution so he could pass a test in order to become a citizen of the United States of America.  And my mother [Lenora Clarke Curtis] did the same thing.  And he would, my father would sit us down and go over the Constitution, whatever he learned at Dunbar in the evening when he got off from work, he would come back and have us to sit down and go over the Constitution.  So when the policeman stopped him on State Road Nine and told him to take his hat off, he didn't take his hat off.  And then he asked the policeman what law in the Constitution of the United States of America did he violate by keeping his hat on.  And this incensed the policeman.  And he took his hand back and he hit my father.  I witnessed this with my eyes.  He hit my father and knocked his hat off his head.  And my father stooped down, picked his hat up and put it back on his head.  And he told the policeman that this would be the last black man you slap.  And my mother was so afraid.  She pleaded and begged my father to please don't talk to this policeman like this, you know because she felt that anything could happen to him.  So the policeman said well you're insubordinate.  So we're gonna take you to jail.  And they took my father away and left us on State Road Nine and it was very dark.  And my brother Israel had no driver's license, although he could drive.  And he said he was gonna take us--bring us home in the car.  My mother said no, you don't have any driver's license.  She said I'm having a heart attack over your father now and if you're driving and the policeman stops you, then, you know we're going to be in serious--in more serious trouble.  But you know when we came--when we looked and we saw the policeman coming back.  So my mother thought these were some other policeman who they had sent to see if we were still out there.  But it was the same policeman.
Story_ID: 70937
Speaker 1: My father [Henry Curtis] had told the policeman that he was due a telephone call and that he was gonna call his boss man Mr. Albert Pick.  Now Mr. Albert Pick owned the Congress Hotel [Congress Plaza Hotel] in Chicago [Illinois].  He was a hotel magnate and hotels all over the country.  And so he brought my father back and he asked my mother [Lenora Clarke Curtis] if she could teach him how to respect an officer.  And my father said if an officer slaps me, I'm gonna do the same thing, and don't speak to my wife because she's not in this.  And we were so scared.  We just--we were really afraid.  But what the office finally did was he put my father out of the car and told him to get out.  And my father drove home.  And that's a story that I will always remember because my father had the nerve to stand up to these two policemen who could have taken him somewhere, shot him and said he was trying to run or, or do something.  But he came back and you know he was, he was in good shape.  And I think that it's a part of his belief in God that the Lord was with him, and that he should stand up for his rights.  And so with that kind of experience as a part of my life, I feel the same way.  I feel that if my father could stand up to two white policemen on State Road Nine back in the '40's [1940's] when I was a child, then I need to do the same thing now.  I need to stand up for what is right and I need to speak out for what is right because I have an example of courage and of faith in God that, that God will be with you if you, if you stand up for what's right.
Speaker 2: Did you feel at that time that your mother and maybe also you in the family were more afraid of losing your father than he was at losing his own life?
Speaker 1: Yes we were--we thought that--we want to--all we wanted him to do was to shut up.  Do what the policeman say and you know, take the hat off, whatever he says, just do it, you know.  When, when he asked him if he would have respect if we let him go, we just wanted him to say yes, just have re--he'll have respect if he get stopped again by a policeman, but he wouldn't do it.  He refused to do it.  He refused to let those two policemen take his manhood from him in front of us.  And that was you know something that I, I will always cherish and admire in him.
Speaker 2: So how did your mother feel about that?
Speaker 1: Well she, she, she told him, she said you know, I almost had a heart attack when, when you were going through this.  But she, she admired him also.  But she just wished sometimes that he just didn't stand up as he did.  But he, he always did.  He just--what he thought was right, he would stand up for it.
Story_ID: 70938
Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory is living at 1827 Northwest Fifth Court in Overtown [Miami, Florida].  And I am have very pleasant memories of living in Overtown because it was such a, a very nice neighborhood.  Everybody was like family and even today, those of us who grew up in Overtown are, are very close.  We're still close.  I graduated from high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Miami, Florida] in 1949.  And my high school class meets once a month.  We, we, we're an organization.  We have traveled together.  They've been to Exuma, I have a house in Exuma in the Bahamas, they've been there twice.  They've been to Jamaica, they've been--we just travel around together.  We just recently went to Atlanta [Georgia].  Next year we, we're planning another trip.  So, but these are people that, that I grew up with in the neighborhood.  We went to school together.  And we are still together, and we are still like a family.  And so I have very pleasant memories.  I have very pleasant memories from my church growing up, and the neighborhood, the schools, the teachers because the teachers went beyond teaching.  There was a teacher--I had a teacher by the name of Ms. Marie Roberts.  And she helped integrate Miami [Florida] when it was illegal to do so.  I remember once when the Chain of Missions came to Miami and they were having a meeting in--at the Miami's Woman's Club, which is located right over near the Marriott Hotel.  And she wanted us to go to this meeting to see all these missionaries from all over the world.  So the people who were responsible said well I guess they could come but, but they can't eat together.  They cannot--they can't eat with us at the Miami Woman's Club.  So she said well that's all right.  If you just let them come so they can hear the, the missionaries, we will make provisions for them to eat.  So the provision that she made was she talked with the Principal of the school, Mr. Charles L. Williams, and asked him if the cafeteria could be opened on Sunday, and this meeting was on a Sunday.  And so what we did, we met at the school.  We walked from Booker T. Washington High School, which is here in Miami on 12th Street, it's still there, over to the Miami Woman's Club for the morning session.  At twelve o'clock we left and walked back to Booker T. Washington High School to eat.  We ate, and then we walked back to the Miami Woman's Club for the afternoon session.  And that was just so whites and blacks because they couldn't eat together.  Well they did permit us to come and listen to the missionaries and hear what they had, had to say.  But that form of socialization was not allowed.  In fact integration during that time was not allowed.  But they did permit us to do that.  So I just have so many experiences, so many pleasant experiences in living in Overtown and being close to people that I treasure all of them.
Speaker 1: Let me take you back to your childhood in the house, your parents, your family from the Bahamas and you are first generation.
Story_ID: 70939
Speaker 1: You're first generation.  What was your household like because you had the Bahamian traditions in your household.  Explain how your--the family there lived out the Bahamian traditions here in America, in Miami [Florida].
Speaker 2: Well what we did, we ate the Bahamian foods.  You know we ate pigeon peas and rice, we had conch salad, conch fritters, conch and okra soup, cracked conch.  We had a lot of seafood.  We also grew some of the, the fruits like papaya and sapodilla and we had tamarinds.  And so we, we--it was like an extension of the Bahamian values and traditions.  They were Christians in the Bahamas and so there were Christian, very active Christians in the United States.  And so the, the music we like.  I still like Calypso Bahamian music.  I like, I like the value of heritage and respecting your heritage and celebrating your heritage.  And so that's, that's the way that we were brought up.  Now one of the things that as a part of, of being, of, of foreign family, sometimes we were teased.  Kids mocked the way that my mother [Lenora Clarke Curtis] and father [Henry Curtis] talked, the accent, the Bahamian accent.  So, so we were, we were often teased and mocked and made fun of.  But our parents gave us such reassurance that we were able to, to stand up to that.
Story_ID: 70940
Speaker 1: And we--because they told us to get--make good grades, you know.  Don't get into--now my brother was a little different because he, sometimes he would get in a fight about it, you know.  But they told me that young ladies don't fight, so I, I never got into a fight.  But sometimes my brother just--his, his temper was a little quick and so he might sometimes get into a fight.  But we were taught that the thing that you need to do is to, to make good grades and be successful in school so that you can have, you can have a better future.  That's what they wanted for us.  They wanted us to, to get an education because my mother went to the eighth grade in the Bahamas because when she was in Exuma, there was no high school there.  None of the outer islands in the Bahamas had high schools.  If you went to high school, you had to go to Nassau and live with a relative or somebody who would take you in.  So that's as much as education as she had.  So she wanted, she wanted us to finish high school and to go to college.  And to be the best of whatever we could be.  And so that's the--she was a maid.  And she worked for a dollar and carfare a day.  And she worked on Miami Beach [Miami, Florida].  And she had a police card.  During that time you could not be on Miami Beach if you didn't live there without a police card.  And I still have her police card that she had to have with her at all times.  So--and, and even though, you know, there was segregation, we were, we were a good family, we were a happy family.  And we, we didn't suffer from a lack of anything because they would make sacrifices, buy clothes, we had enough to eat.  And, and we, we were able to do the things that we--I guess we, we were just blessed.  We were blessed.  We, we just--we had a happy family.
Story_ID: 70941
Speaker 1: Now you said before that both of your parents [Henry and Lenora Curtis] being gone a great deal, how often were they gone and because they were gone, how did the responsibility fall on you being the oldest girl now besides your--being a woman in the house.  What type of responsibilities fell on you?
Speaker 2: Well we--they would permit me to participate in some activities after school.  However, I had to keep the house clean, I had to learn how to cook and I just, I had to do whatever was necessary because even though my grandmother lived in the house, she too worked.  So when I came from, from school, that meant that I had to get the cooking started and, and I had to keep the house clean.  So these were responsibilities that I learned at an early age as being a part of the family.  And, and I accepted them.  That was just the way it was.
Story_ID: 70942
Speaker 1: I want to take you back down to Miami [Florida], and I wanna know which sights, sounds and smells remind you of 1827 Fifth Court in Overtown?  What sights, sounds and smells remind you of your childhood.
Speaker 2: The smell of fried fish.  The sight of my house, our house.  In fact I have a picture, I still have a picture of that house.  The sight of the neighborhood in Overtown.  The sight of the church, the sight of Joe's Grocery Store.  There was a, a Chinese grocery store right on the corner of 19th Street and, and Fifth Court.  And we used to credit from Joe.  We'd go in there and get whatever we want and then we'd tell him that when my father would come home, that he will pay.  So we had an account at Joe's Grocery Store.  And so all of, all of the, the neighborhood was like one big family.  And we just lived like one family.  So the sights included the, the school, the church, the different houses of the different people who lived in that neighborhood.  And we knew everybody and everybody knew us.
Speaker 1: Were there any sounds?
Speaker 2: The sounds--the music in church.  The church had a band and we would, we would on special occasions they would, they would have the band music.  And then the other thing about the music, our, our church was on--was at Fifth Court and 17th Street.  And the music was so good that the tourists from Miami Beach used to come to our church as a tourist attraction.  I remember the ushers coming and getting the children up out of their seats because when white people came to the church, they tried to accommodate them because they knew they were gonna put a lot of money.  This meant getting a big offering, you see.  So they always tried to do whatever they could to find room for them.  And that meant moving the children out and putting them in a different section so that there, there would be more space for, for white people who came to Overtown to church.
Story_ID: 71501
Speaker 1: Now Ms. Pinkney, I'd like to know about your school.  Tell me about your--the name of your elementary school.
Speaker 2: Dunbar, Dunbar Elementary School.  And I remember I was in a play.  Sun--what was the name of that play?  "Sun Bonnet Sue How I love You".  I even remember some of the words to the song that I used to sing.  And also when, when we went from--because we--Dunbar Elementary was from first through sixth grade.  And then when we went to Booker T. Washington High School [Miami, Florida], which was seventh through twelfth, we had a promotional exercise.  It was like a graduation from elementary to junior high.  But they didn't even call it junior high, we just were going to, to high school.  And so I remember the, the promotional exercise, the promotional program that we had.  And my mother [Lenora Clarke Curtis] was so proud because I was dressed up in this little dress and I had a little part to say.  And everybody knew that you had to give me a part to say.  I had to be in it somehow.  I had to say my piece because that's what my mother wanted.  So they, they got to know her.  And, and then in, in senior high school I was very active.  I ran for President of the Student Council and I became President of the Student Council.  And it gave me an opportunity to meet Joe Louis, and I took a picture with Joe Louis when he came to Booker T. Washington High School.
Story_ID: 71502
Speaker 1: The Principal, Mr. Williams, decided that after he found out that Joe Louis was coming to the school, he just what I called jumped up an assembly.  The assembly wasn't planned at all, but he called all the teachers into the auditorium to--well maybe not all of them, but a large number of them.  And then he called me aside as President of the Student Council, and he said you know the money that you were raising for the band uniforms?  Because we had--the Student Council was--had had a fundraiser and I think we raised something like a hundred dollars which was a lot of money back then.  So he said what I want you to do is to present me with a check for a hundred dollars during this assembly.  We--Joe Louis was sitting on the stage.  And so I said okay.  So he said now I don't have time to tell you how to do it and, and tell you what to say.  So you have to sit down--and I was, I was really nervous because he was fierce, you know.  I, if I made a mistake, I didn't wanna get him angry cause he had so much faith in me that I would be able to pull this off, you know.  So he said just go somewhere and figure out what you're gonna say.  But the main thing I want you to do is say to me that you're presenting a check for a hundred dollars for the band uniforms.  Because back then the schools had to raise money for the band, in order for the band to have uniforms.  So I went somewhere and when it was time--I opened the assembly, because that was the way that we did it.  And then when it was time to present the Principal with the check, I made the presentation on behalf of the Student Council for the money that we had raised for the band uniforms.  And then Mr. Williams called on Joe Louis to have remarks.  And I remember to this day what Joe Louis said.  He said, he told us that we needed to get our education; we needed to work hard and get a good education.  He said and don't be like he was because he went to school one day--he went in the front door and came out of the back.  Well that was funny, you know we, we laughed and everything.  But what he did say was that he noticed that we were trying to raise money to buy uniforms for the band.  And that he was gonna double the amount that we raised, and he was gonna give us two hundred dollars.  So that was really the setup that the Principal wanted, they wanted some money out of Joe Louis for the band.
Story_ID: 71503
Speaker 1: But the trick was after the assembly, Joe Louis went with some people and he didn't leave the check.  So we had to--Mrs. Ireta [ph.] Crosby was the Student Council Sponsor.  So Mr. Williams said well why didn't you get the check?  So he said go find him and get the check.  Well we didn't quite know where he went.  Somebody said he went to the Mary Elizabeth Hotel, he was living there.  So we went there and he wasn't there.  And then they said something about the Carver.  We went there, he wasn't there.  And we went several places and we could not find him.  So then somebody told us that he was going to Ann Lindsey's house that evening for a party.  So we went to Ann Lindsey's house in Liberty City [Miami, Florida] and Mrs. Crosby and I was with her.  She had me--I was in the car.  And she--Mrs. Crosby spoke to Mrs. Lindsey and said that she was the Student Council Sponsor at Booker T. [Booker T. Washington High School, Miami, Florida] and I was the President of the Student Council.  And that she was told that Joe Louis would be coming to her house that evening to a party and she needed to see him because he had promised two hundred dollars for the band uniform and the Principal is not gonna let her come back to school unless she gets this two hundred dollars, the two hundred dollars.  So Mrs. Lindsey was a very kind lady, very nice.  In fact she was--we finally--eventually we ended up in the same church.  But she permitted us to sit in the kitchen and we waited there until Joe Louis got there.  And after he, he got there and we--she told--Mrs. Linsey told him that we were there and that we were there for the two hundred dollars that he had promised in that assembly for the band uniforms.  And he wrote the check.  And we took a picture, and I have a picture of Joe Louis presenting the check for two hundred dollars.  So that was, that was very exciting, very exciting.
Speaker 2: So you were a student leader.
Speaker 1: I guess you could call--yes I guess so, yes.
Story_ID: 71504
Speaker 1: The question is what type of child were you when you were young?  What type of child were you?  Were you precocious, mischievous, what type of child were you?
Speaker 2: No I, I wasn't mischievous, I was scared because my parents were so strict I didn't--I'd better not get into any trouble.  But I always wanted to participate in whatever was going on.  I was, I was a member--we had the, the Girls' Senate, so I was a member of the Girls' Senate.  I was a member of the Y Teens.  I was a member of the Honor Society.  I was a member of a--just whatever was going on at school.  I would participate in, in the various activities.
Speaker 1: What motivated you to do that?  What motivated you to just be involved with every extracurricular activity you could get into?
Speaker 2: You know that is such a good question.  Someone asked me that the other day, and they asked me why am I still getting involved in so many things?  You know what, what is it with you?  And I never even thought about it as to why, why am I--you know why am I trying to save the Hampton House, you know.  Why am I trying to preserve so much of Miami [Florida]?  I don't know.  I guess there's just something within.  There's something within that, that says to me and as my grandmother and mother [Lenora Clarke Curtis] and father [Henry Curtis] said that if God blesses you with a talent or with abilities, then you should share what you have.  And you should help out where you, you can help.  And I was just brought up--that was engrained in me.  It's like if you don't do it, the Lord is gonna get you, you know.  And so that this, this should be a part of your everyday life.  That when you see an opportunity to be of service, that's why God has you here.  He has you here to, to do and to be led by the Holy Spirit; to listen to the Holy Spirit and be guided by it.  And if you're led to get involved in something even though it looks like it might become a failure.  And I've, I've, I've participated in trying to preserve The Circle [The Miami Circle, Miami, Florida].  And when I was working with that, that looked hopeless.  But now it has gathered--so many people have gathered around the preservation of, of The Circle, including the Mayor of Miami Dade County, Mayor Penelas [Mayor Alexander "Alex" Penelas], Senator Graham [Senator Daniel Robert "Bob" Graham], Carrie Meeks, Congresswoman Carrie Meek [HM], Ile--Ros-Lehtinen, [Congresswoman] Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and so many people have come to the rescue to try to preserve the Circle here in Miami.  And so I've learned that even though something might not look like it has a future, or it might look like it's not going anywhere, if I'm driven, and I call this drive the Holy Spirit, if I'm driven and led in that direction, I should follow and it usually works out even though there's some stresses as a part of reaching the goal.  I just feel that it's the thing to do.
Speaker 1: You even felt this as a child when you were--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --joining these organizations.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes that, that if I could be of service, that's what I was supposed to do.
Story_ID: 71505
Speaker 1: Now the teachers.  Did you have teachers who encouraged you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Mold you, who were your mentors--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I mentioned one of the number one was Ms. Marie Roberts who people say that I'm so much like her in the things that I do.  Another was Mrs. Mamie Williams, and she was the wife of the principal.  Now these, these ladies did not have automobiles, but they somehow or another got us all over Miami [Florida] and sometimes if Miss, Mrs. Williams would take us someplace or take me someplace, she lived about three blocks from my house.  She would walk me home and then walk home to her house.  She would see to it that I got home after we would attend some meeting.  And a lot of the meetings were integrated.  And so I experienced at an early age integrated meetings and, and, and knowing that there are white people in the community who have some of the same feelings and desires and, and want to get to know each other better.  I remember we used to go to White Temple Methodist Church to integrated meeting and even before the National Conference of Christians and Jews, we had what was called a Christian Youth Council, and that was integrated with, with black students and white students.  And then later on the, the Jewish group and the Christian group merged and we had the, the National Con--Conference of Christians and Jews.  Of course now it's called National Council for Community and Justice.  But I have seen that, that organization just evolve to where it is today.  And it provided opportunities for people to, to get to know each other.  And so Miami even though we have had riots and we sometimes have a, a bad image because of that, there's a lot of, a lot of good things that have happened here in Miami, a lot of good experiences, and a lot of people of goodwill who are trying to make Miami a, a very pleasant place in which to live.
Story_ID: 71506
Speaker 1: When you see the type of person you are right now and you look at these two mentors, Ms. [Marie] Roberts and Ms. [Mamie] Williams, what can you say that you grasped and learned from them that you carry on with you right now?
Speaker 2: Well I carry on Marie Roberts' zest for human relations because when we graduated from high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Miami, Florida], our theme was "Human Relations, the Key to Survival".  And we had to, to write themes on that topic and then those of us who could recite something in relation to that were also given an opportunity to participate in our graduation exercise talking about why we feel that human relations is the key to survival.  Another one of the teachers that really motivated me was my English teacher, Mrs. Hazel Davis.  She was very particular about my English and that I would learn how to keep subjects and verbs agreeing with each other.  And my homeroom teacher was Mrs. Marion Shannon, and Mrs. Shannon is still living today.  And she still keeps up with me.  She--I remember when I ran for Student Council President.  She was just like my campaign manager.  She told me what I could do, what I couldn't do and how--she checked my speeches before I got out to campaign and go into the classrooms and say whatever it was that I was gonna say to make sure that I made it a good presentation.  And then back to Mrs. Mamie Williams, she was a social studies teacher, and I majored in social studies.  So Mrs., Mrs. Roberts, Ms. Roberts, Ms. Marie Roberts was a social studies teacher also.  She taught civics. And Mrs. Mamie Williams taught United States history.  And I ended up going to Talladega College [Talladega, Alabama] with a major in social science.  So I think that the experience and being around them and, and observing them and seeing how they gave of themselves to help us and to give us all these different experiences.  And so I feel that I owe it to the community because it was done for me.  The teachers gave of themselves so that I would have a different path.  And so now I feel that because if I'm able to, to share whatever experience I have, that's what I need to do also.
Story_ID: 71507
Speaker 1: Now you explained how your family and how school were two really important elements of the community that kept you reassured and kept you on the right path.  Now explain how the third element church which you mentioned a few times, how did that one, the third one also enabled you to go on and do what you needed to do?  How did that--
Speaker 2: Because, because I was permitted to express myself in church, and that gave me confidence in myself.  I--in all of the various programs that they had and participating in that and I could see that, you know I could do this, I could talk, I could get up and I didn't need to be nervous.  Once I knew what I was gonna talk about, and once I learned and I had to practice and, and make sure that I knew what I was doing.  So the church in addition to, to giving me the, the spiritual food that I needed, also gave me self confidence and, and education, learning.  Because you have--you, you know learning--transferring the education that I received in school to church and learning to read and to express myself and to share with others, I think that it's been a, a great benefit to me, the church.
Speaker 1: Who was the pastor of your church?  What was the name of the church you attended?
Speaker 2: The church was The Church of God of Prophecy, and we went through several pastors.  When I was born, the pastor that christened me was Bishop Randolph Williams.  And then we had Bishop J.R. Smith.  And we had Bishop Daniel Nairn, and we, we had Bishop Dean.  And of course his son, Norwood Dean is now the pastor of The Church of God of Prophecy.  And I taught Bishop Dean, Bishop Norwood Dean, I taught him in the eighth grade and he's now the pastor of that church.  However, I'm not a member of The Church of God of Prophecy at this time, I'm, I'm one of the founding members of the Church of the Open Door, which is a United Church of Christ.  And I'm on the Executive Council of the United Church of Christ, and also on the board for the, the General Ministries Board of the United Church of Christ.
Story_ID: 71508
Speaker 1: Now at church and in school, you were given the opportunity on the stage to speak and to express yourself.  And it built up confidence each time you did well I'm sure.  At what point did you realize I can do this and it started clicking in your mind not only can I do this, I can do it well?  At what point, at what age were you able to identify that?  You realize I can do this maybe even better than some other people can?
Speaker 2: Well that's let's see, I don't know when I really just like came to that realization.  But somehow or another I realized that I could get up there and, and, and speak.  And that I didn't need to be nervous.  I could just get up and, and express myself.  So I don't know, maybe--well because I started out in elementary school.  I, I started participating in elementary school, so I guess it might have been even, even back then that I realized that I could, I could do that.
Story_ID: 71509
Speaker 1: Now you're thriving and you're being nurtured in this community by school, family and church.  But you're still aware that there's something on the outside, the outside world called Jim Crow.  How did it affect you when you were growing up in that community even though you had these elements protecting you?  How did that still affect your daily life and how did you perceive it?
Speaker 2: Well you know I remember one time I went down to Burdines on Flagler Street, and I had, I was--I, I worked for the Y part-time, so I said that I was gonna take that money and buy clothes.  And I went to--I went to--I wanted to buy some shoes at Burdines, and they told me that I would have to try on the shoes in a closet, a broom closet.  And I said but I'm not going in the broom closet to try on these shoes.  So if I can't sit out here where everybody else is sitting to try on shoes, I'm not gonna buy these shoes because I refuse to be humiliated like this and going into some broom closet to try on these shoes.  And so finally the lady said well you can sit over here.  So she let me sit down out there.  And another time I remember I went to Hartley's.  Again I had money to buy some dresses.  And they told me that I could not try on those dresses in the store.  That I could take them home, try them on and if they didn't fit, bring them back.  Well that was ridiculous because number one I had to catch the bus.  At that time I didn't have a car.  So I was gonna have to take the bus and, and take the dresses home and try them on and then come back and, and, and if they didn't fit, bring them back, and I said no, I'm not gonna do this.  So you know either you let me try these dresses on in this store, you keep them.  And then I realized you know maybe this was why my mother [Lenora Clarke Curtis] had a dressmaker, Mrs. Winifred Thompson.
Speaker 1: So now when you're standing up for yourself like that, in your mind do you see your father still stand up for himself that same day.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes.  It's--he's always there, he's always there.  That courage, that you know that dare, that taking a stand and standing up as a man.  That, that, that lives with me.
Speaker 1: So do you think at that moment when you were a child it took away the fear of the Jim Crow and things like that?  That it took away the fear that you still have for your [unclear] even though you were standing up?
Speaker 2: Well no.  You still--I still--there's a, there's a feeling there.  There's a--you, you, you know, you rebel against it.  But then you, you, you know you just wish you didn't have to experience this.  It makes you feel bad that, that you would be treated like this.  And that people would not respect you for who you are, and you know of course they don't know you.  They treat you I guess like they treat other black people.  But I just could not take it, I could not take it.  And so I had to rebel in some form or another.
Speaker 1: Did your mother know about your rebellion?
Speaker 2: Well sometimes I would tell her what happened, but then, and then other times because she would be upset, she would get upset, so I didn't want to upset her.  But I'm, you know I was a daddy's girl.  I just, I just always thought of him and how he stood up.
Story_ID: 71510
Speaker 1: So now let's get you to Talladega College [Talladega, Alabama].  What made you choose to attend Talladega?
Speaker 2: Well, I--my mother's [Lenora Clarke Curtis] dressmaker's [Winifred Thompson] niece went to Talladega.  Now the thing is that the dressmaker and her sister you know, she was a teacher.  Delores Austin Turner went to Talladega and her mother was a teacher.  Well you know my mother was a maid, but they were friends, they were neighbors and everything.  And my mother respected her and looked up to her because she had education.  And so she, she sent Delores to Palmer Memorial Institute [Sedalia, North Carolina], a private high school.  And then she sent her to Talladega.  So she told my mother that she should try to get me to go to Talladega because she thought that it would fit my personality, that it's a small, liberal arts college, and that they would--had a family atmosphere and they looked out for you and the classes were small, and you had a better opportunity of learning.  So my mother accepted what she said because she, you know she didn't know one college from another.  And--but she respected Mrs. Austin and Mrs. Thompson and so I applied and, and I was accepted and I went to Talladega and I am so happy that I did because I found the teachers to be very warm and they worked you very hard, and it wasn't--it's not just education.  The cultural atmosphere and the experiences helped to enhance, you know, what I already had.  And also the, the, the civil rights.  I remember when, when they outlawed--this was in the early 50's [1950's], segregation on interstate commerce but when we, we would get on the train at Aniston, Alabama and they always put us in the first car.  We'd buy our tickets and they, they would put us in the first car.  So they had us segregated even though it was supposed to be outlawed.  And I remember once we were talking about it.  We're saying you know nothing's changed.  We, we're still riding in the first car.  So Dr., Dr. Martha Gibson who was a white English teacher, head of the English Department, heard us talking about that.  And she--
Story_ID: 70953
Speaker 1: You were telling us about your English professor heard you speaking about the inequity on the train.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Dr. Martha Gibson who heard us saying that nothing had changed, there was still segregation.  And so what, what she did was she told us to give her--when it was time to go home for Christmas, to give her the money for our tickets and she would buy the tickets for us.  So she went to the train station and she brought the tickets.  And what happened was they put us in Car Five.  So when we got to the train station and the ticket agent looked at the ticket and wondered how we got these tickets.  So he went--he had us to just stand there and he went to speak to somebody.  He went back into the station and had us, had us just standing there.  And so they--we could see them talking, you know.  And so I guess they didn't know whether we were like a, a trial case to see if they were going to let us in a different car other than Car, Car One, the first car.  So finally whoever made the decision, decided that we could go into Car Five.  But what they did was they put us all on that last seat in Car Five.  The one that has the motor under it.  The, you know the, the, that can't recline.  The one that you can't--you know it was--
Speaker 1: The most uncomfortable one.
Speaker 2: The most uncomfortable seat on the, on the train.  That's where they had us sitting.  And--but at least we were in a different car.  So that was like progress.  But it was you know they just discussed--they did a lot of discussion about I guess how we got the tickets and talking among themselves.  But finally they did let us get in, on Car, get into Car Five and put us in the most uncomfortable seats to come from--you know to ride rather, from, from Aniston, Alabama to Miami [Florida].
Story_ID: 70954
Speaker 1: Now once you get to Talladega [Talladega College, Talladega, Alabama], are you continuing your performance and activities and extracurricular activities and things of that sort while you're there?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was a member of the Y, the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association].  And let me tell you about something that happened then.  There was a state meeting of the Y and that was to be integrated.  But where would you have it?  Now I was active in, in the Y and I was President of the--I finally got to be President of the Talladega YWCA.  And so we invited the state Y to meet at Talladega.  But they said that they did not want to meet at Talladega because Talladega was too out of the way for most of the people to get to and the transportation wasn't good.  So they wanted to meet at what they would consider a more centrally located place, excuse me.  So what they did was they decided to meet in Birmingham [Alabama].  And they met at the Birmingham YWCA.  So we talked about well you know, will blacks be able to meet there?  But before that, there was, there was a meeting in Montgomery [Alabama].  And that meeting was at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church where there was a Reverend Johns, the pastor.  That was before Martin Luther King [Jr.] went to that church as pastor.  So there was an integrated meeting at the, the Baptist Church, Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery.  But the following year, some of the white students said you know why is it that we have to come over here to a black church when we have such a very fine facility in Birmingham, the Birmingham Y?  And they said we should have--this is a Y meeting.  We should have the, the meeting at the Y in Birmingham.  So after much negotiating, the Birmingham Y said that the meeting could be there, but that they could not be eating, the blacks could not eat at the Birmingham Y and they would have to make other arrangements.  Well you know I had gone through that before in high school.  So we, we, we accepted that challenge because that was progress, just to, to, to get into a white facility for the meeting.  So we accepted that, that we would go someplace else to eat.  But what happened on the day of the meeting, even though we had agreed to that, the white students said this isn't right.  And if you don't mind, we feel that none of us should eat and that we should fast.  And so we agreed to that.  And during, during that day because it was a day's meeting, it was on a Saturday, nobody ate and nobody left to go you know, their, their separate ways.  And that's another one of the experiences that, that I remember back when I was at Talladega and attending a meeting at the YWCA in Birmingham.
Speaker 1: So all throughout your life, even though you've had, you've had a balance.  You've had the, the experiences of racism such at Burdines and other places, but you've also experienced cooperation with individuals of other races.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 70955
Speaker 1: So what type of hope is this giving you while you're in college [Talladega College, Talladega, Alabama] and looking to the future?
Speaker 2: Well--and you know while I was in college, I met some, some of the white students who were just sort of just in transit at Talladega and I saw--I said don't I know you?  Didn't we meet at--so she said well I'm from Miami [Florida].  Then we remembered that we had attended a meeting together, so it gives me hope.  And even though I have been discriminated against, but I know that there are people of goodwill out there somewhere who want to do the right thing and who want to respect people as people and not according to the race or the color of their skin or some stereotype opinion that they have of the person.  There are some people out there who, who are not racist.  There are some people who are not racist and there's some black people who are not racist.  And I think that we just have to build on what we have and try to extend it and try to give the young people more experiences of having people accept you for who you are and respect you for who you are.
Story_ID: 70956
Speaker 1: Now while you're at Talladega [Talladega College, Talladega, Alabama], you choose to major in social studies.  How did you come to that decision?
Speaker 2: Well because I thought I wanted to become a lawyer.  I had, I, I, I thought that maybe I would become a lawyer.  And so I felt that the, the Social Science Department would give me the background that I needed to become a lawyer.  But I never really pursued it and I felt that after four years of college I needed a job.  So that's when I went to Chicago [Illinois] and I got a job doing group work at a settlement house.
Speaker 1: Now what brought you to Chicago?  How did Chicago come about?  How did the option of Chicago being a place to go after graduation come about?
Speaker 2: Okay.  When I heard of the--I think it might have been the Y [WCA], but there was a group of people, they were looking for about twelve people to participate in a social work program of doing group work.  And since I--my major was social science, I said well this sounds like something that I would be interested in doing.  And I didn't--at that time I said well because I, I don't want to come back, go back to the South, I wanna go to the North and get that experience.  And I felt too because it was so difficult getting a job coming back with a college degree and not having a job would have been just devastating to me.  And since this would have been the opportunity for having a job, I applied for what they call the Community and Service Internship, and I was accepted.  There were, there were twelve people in the program and there were three blacks, we were black at that time.  And so I, I, I was accepted into that program.  And I worked at two settlement houses.  One was called Emerson House, and the other one was the Chicago Commons.  And--
Speaker 1: Now what are settlement houses?
Speaker 2: A settlement house is a place where in the community, where there are social services.  We, we worked with the young people after school, after school activities.  We worked with families that had certain needs and tried to make recommendations as to where they should go and how they could be helped.  So--but I think that even before then, I was there at a time when the neighborhood was changing.  And I think that prior to that it used to be like an Italian neighborhood and they were learning how to settle into the United States.  But by the time I got there, they were--they needed African Americans to work with the changing neighborhood, the neighborhood was changing.  And so that made an opportunity for me to, to have a job.
Story_ID: 70957
Speaker 1: However, what I noticed by getting around in Chicago [Illinois], it wasn't really what I thought because I found segregation in a different form.  Now it wasn't that I could go into a restaurant as it was in Miami, or nor did I see the signs that said color and white fountains, or the kind of segregation that I was accustomed to in Miami [Florida].  But the openness that I thought was there was not there.  Because I would, I would go--I worked a lot--most of the people I worked with were white and if they'd say let's go out to eat and I would go with them, and I, I remember one time I ordered a, a cheeseburger.  And everybody ordered whatever they ordered, and their food came in a plate.  And mine came in a basket.  And so somebody asked me didn't you want a plate?  So I said well it looked like I didn't have a choice.  They decided that I should eat out of a basket and not a plate.  Of course I want a plate.  And they were not even aware that you know, I was being discriminated against.  There, there were times also that you would go into the restaurant and sit and nobody would even come and ask you if you wanted anything.  You would just be ignored.  So I found that up north was not all that it was cracked up to be.  And when my mother became ill and I decided well I, I might as well come back to Miami because at least it's not as hypocritical.  There are signs up that says colored and white and, and you, you know that that is segregation.  I went to Chicago and there were so many subtleties, subtleties of discrimination.
Speaker 2: Were you disappointed?  Did you bel-beliefs before you got there it would be different?
Speaker 1: Yes because everybody say you know, you're going to the north and it would be better.  I really did not expect the subtle forms and discrimination that I, I was faced with.  And so I said well, it's not what it's, it's cracked up to be.  And I, I returned back to Miami.
Story_ID: 70958
Speaker 1: You said your mother's illness brought you back.
Speaker 2: Yes, she had to have an operation and she wanted me to come back home.  And I didn't mind coming back.  And I got a job as a teacher at Dorsey Junior High School where I taught English for several years.
Speaker 1: Now did you think this was your calling since many of your mentors were teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Did you feel that--what made you--let me go think about applying to be a teacher?  What brought you into that point?
Speaker 2: Well when I decided to come back to Miami [Florida], there weren't that many opportunities for, for jobs.  Like the oppor--that's where the opportunity was, in the teaching field.  And so I said well I'll try it, I'll see if, if I will make it as a teacher.  And so I, I started teaching and I taught for 36 years.  I taught--I became a counselor and then I became an Assistant Principal and I retired as an Assistant Principal after 36 years in education.
Story_ID: 70959
Speaker 1: Now your experience as an educator.  Early on throughout--being a black female teacher in the South, especially now, Jim Crow is still going on, but now we're in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement and things are starting to pick up a little bit.  How was it in the classroom?  What did you feel you had to each these children?
Speaker 2: Well when I came back, of course we, we were still in segregation.  And I felt that I had to make these students the best that they could be.  I wanted these students to stand tall wherever they went.  I did not want anybody saying that because they came form a black school, so they were not on an equal basis as any, any other student.  And so that is--that's what I worked toward.  I worked toward pulling the best out of them that was within them and giving them not only experiences in the classroom, but experiences in the community.  Getting out into the community and participating in, in whatever activities were going on, taking field trips.  I'd take them to the Commission meeting to see government at work.  And I remember once we invited Congressman Claude Pepper out to the school to speak to the students.  And so just giving them a variety of experiences that they could draw upon and to help them to find themselves.
Story_ID: 70960
Speaker 1: Now you get there and Brown v. School Board [Brown v. Board of Education, 1954] has occurred, that's passed, outlawing separation in education.  Did you see any affects of this?  Did you see--what were you--when heard this happen did you feel something's gonna change now?  Now there's going to be school integration, things of that sort?
Speaker 2: Well I was really a part of that.  I went to Edison, Edison Senior High School was an all white school here in Miami [Florida].  And I, I became a counselor at Edison.  And one of the things that, that I had to deal with was as students wanted to participate in various activities.  I remember Gayla [ph.] Brown, Munnings [ph.] now, tried out to--her father was an ophthalmologist and her mother was in business, a travel business.  And she tried out to become a cheerleader.  And she didn't make it.  And then that frustrated a lot of the students because they felt that if Gayla Brown whose parents are leaders in the community, her father was active in CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] and well educated.  You know if, if a person like Gayla can't become a cheerleader, what hope is there for us?  And so what we did was we started meeting with the students and meeting with their parents in the community to talk about the experiences that the students were having.  And then we met with the Principal and, and some of the teachers to, to let them know.
Story_ID: 70961
Speaker 1: And one of--so one of the ways that we decided that we would express ourselves was in a play.  And, and I had the students to write, and it was called "Search for the Future."  That was the name of the play.  They wrote a play--they wrote the play describing their experiences as black students in an integrated school.  And we did it--at first the Principal told me that we, we could do the play in the Chorus Room and then have some--the teachers--because what happened, we were doing it--we were really doing it in, on like a secret kind of thing.  But one of the students was studying his part in class and a teacher picked up the play.  Now the play had some misspelled words and ungrammatical expressions.  And maybe it had a couple of what they would call bad words in it.  So the Principal brought this play to me and asked me if I knew anything about it.  And I said yes.  And I said I'm working with them on that.  So he said they went through this, you know the, the typos and that kind of thing.  I said well you know the students wrote it and yes there's some typos in there and ungrammatical expressions, but this is--I'm working with them and I don't want to--I did not take time to correct the English.  I want them to express themselves and, and try to produce the play.  So he said well let's see if they can do it in the Chorus Room and have some teachers come in and decide whether this is the kind of thing that we would like to have in the auditorium.  So I said no.  I said that's censorship and I will not be a part of censorship.  So he said well what about my assigning a teacher to work with you to sort of clean it up?  I said I don't mind that.  I don't mind that.  Because that would be a good experience for the students whatever misspelled words they have in there, or whatever it's ungrammatical or whatever, you know we can--that, that, that would be welcomed.  So he assigned a white teacher to work with us to come to the rehearsals and try to you know, do what he called cleaning it, cleaning it, cleaning it up.  And I said okay, and finally we got it to a point that everybody was satisfied.  And we did the play in the auditorium.  And the play received a standing ovation.
Story_ID: 70962
Speaker 1: Now there was a newspaper man in the auditorium because it had gotten out about this play, this controversial play.
Speaker 2: What year is this?
Speaker 1: This was, I don't know '67 [1967], '68 [1968].  And Ellis Burger who wrote for the Miami News, I think he was in the auditorium.  And he wrote about it in the Miami News and, and it said how, you know to everybody's amazement the white students even stood up and applauded.  It received a standing ovation.  And then we got a call from Channel 10 wanting us to put it on Channel 10.  And that gave the students an opportunity to go down to Channel 10 across the--the teacher who worked with me was--his name was Mr. Fox.  Mr. Fox worked with me on that.  And so the students--we, we, took the students in our cars and went to Channel 10 and practiced it and it was seen all over.  Channel 10 produced it.  So that, that was a, a pleasant experience.  But it all came from the racial situation and students feeling a need to, to express themselves and to, to give vent to what they considered to be discriminatory practices by teachers in the classroom.

Speaker 1: Now how did you handle the challenges of going from being a black educator in an all black environment, receiving respect and just given to you almost automatically because you're a member of that community, to go into a situation where now you're a black, you're a black educator with Caucasian students, bosses who are Caucasian.  Explain the challenges just in that shift that you experienced.
Speaker 2: Well I experienced people who didn't think that I was you know as qualified.  And didn't have what it probably took to, to be where I was.  And I accepted that.  I wasn't out to prove that I was as good as anybody else.  I said in due time they will find out for themselves who I am.  So there were times when I just had to swallow certain statements or, or things that people, people said because I knew that it was a putdown.  But I had been through a lot even before that and so you, you know what's going on and, and what you have to do is because there were other people who, who got into arguments with people who did that.  And I was determined that I was not going to do that.  I was going to hold my own.  I was gonna do what I Thought was right.  I was gonna stand up for what I felt was right.  And let be whatever came.  And, and that's, that's how I stood up to that.  I didn't, I didn't try to straighten--there were a lot of things I just didn't try to straighten out or try to explain or whatever.  I just knew that this was something from somebody's own prejudice or somebody's own stereotype, it didn't fit me.  And so I don't need to, to get involved in it.
Story_ID: 70964
Speaker 1: How was the interaction with Caucasian students?
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, all right.  They--I can't, I can't think of any, any you know, disrespect or anything that I could, could, you know, that I could point out right now.  I can think of put down statements by teachers, but, but I, I knew, I knew how to survive that.
Speaker 1: So how was the mix between the African American teachers or educators, and the Caucasian educators?  Were--was there any cooperation or was it a volatile mix?
Speaker 2: Well I think that people learned to get along.  I think that basically we learned how to respect each other and then you learned--there was, there was certain people that you liked because of who they were, and they were friendly and they were warm and, and you know they were giving.  And so you would like that kind of person.  So I think that you know we learned to live with each other and we learned to work with each other and to share with each other.  And just to make the workplace a learning situation.
Story_ID: 71959
Speaker 1: Now Ms. Pinkney the change in I guess the focus of education later on from those challenges of integration and racial problems.  Now the social problems later on in the '70's [1970's] and '80's [1980's] and the different challenges posed by students in different situations that they were going through.  Explain that and how they were challenging to you as an educator.
Speaker 2: Well one of the things that, that, that bothers me is the lack of understanding of our history and our heritage, and from whence we've come.  And so I try to --when I was working, I, I worked with black history and, and February is not just for black history, black history is for all year long.  But during that time since it is so acceptable, I took advantage of that and used that as an opportunity to, to help students to respect their culture.  And when I was at South Miami Middle School, we--I would work with the students to have an assembly, various programs highlighting the, the black history programs.  One of the things we did in the assembly was get the students to participate, have them sing gospel and spirituals.  Something that they, they just don't--wouldn't do.  A lot of times they didn't have it in chorus and they didn't, you know, know the songs.  But they, they knew those songs in church.  And so they could take the experience that they had in church and put it into a program at school.  And it gave them respect for something that was out of school that they could bring into school and have, and share that experience with the entire school.  So I, I always enjoyed doing that.
Story_ID: 71960
Speaker 1: Also I started, and it's still going on, the Soul Food Luncheon at South Miami Middle School.  And that was a day that I would ask parents and, and other teachers to, to bring their favorite dish and we would have a lunch in the caf--in the library.  And, and we invited the, the mayor of South Miami and we invited the, the, the black community, the white community, the elected officials, to come out and have lunch with us.  And, and to have you know, sweet potatoes or potato pie and collard greens and foods, cornbread that--pigeon peas and rice.  The foods that, that we eat, barbecue ribs, barbecue chicken.  And, and celebrate our heritage.  So we, we found ways to lift ourselves up and share our history and our heritage with the entire school.  And that really made the students proud of themselves and also to get the parents working cause they, they would be happy to bring--I'd say I'd like for you to bring some greens or bring some fried chicken, or bring whatever.  And they bring some, some sweet potato pie.  And they could participate in the life of the school.  And, and their talents were respected.  And so that's, you know I, I look back on that and, and I'm so happy that it's still going on in the school.  The school is still celebrating in that manner with, with that black history program.  And I've been invited out to speak on different occasions and I, and I go every time I'm invited to go, I go and I take the time and I talk about my experiences, talk to students and I'm on the Speaker's Bureau of the Black Archives [Miami, Florida] and when I talk about how I drank from the colored fountain, I sat in the back of the bus.  And all of my experiences, but that doesn't make you any less of a person.  And you know that you should have pride and be proud of who you are and stand tall.  So I enjoy doing that.
Story_ID: 71961
Speaker 1: Now that beauty, what you just explained, contrast that and the happiness you had at that moment when you're sharing and celebrating who we are as a people with others, with 1980 and the riots that nearly destroyed your home in Overtown [Miami, Florida], and the pain you felt during that time.
Speaker 2: Well we still have some problems.  We are still seeing the police shootings and, and for instance that was what sort of caused the riots, police shootings of people who they say were trying to get away.  And so it's still a problem, I still see it as a problem.  And you almost have to tell everybody, or you do have to tell everybody if a policeman stops you, please don't run, you know.  Try to find out what's going on.  Don't do -- just don't do anything because even though you should be able to go to court to find out whether you're guilty or not, you might not get there.  And so we all have to be aware of what might happen and, and we're here in Miami, we, we're still protesting the police shootings.  And it's, it's a problem.
Speaker 1: How did that affect the image of Overtown, that riot?
Speaker 2: Well it, it had a negative, a very negative effect.  And I'm--I regret that very much.  It had a very negative effect on Overtown and it looks like you know the community just can't get over the, the negativity that has come from that.  And all of the good that has always been a part of Overtown is sort of submerged in the negativity.  And I don't like that, I don't like that.  But I guess that's just the reality of it.  And, and I'm--I hope that the government, I hope that the City of Miami would come up with a plan to improve the very appearance of Overtown.  And I, I feel that the government, excuse me, could do a better job of, of making Overtown, the appearance of Overtown should be improved.  And also working with the people, making more job opportunities, more training for people who don't have jobs and giving people, helping people to feel that they can accomplish something, and not just hanging out hopelessly.  I think that, I think that the government could do a better job of bringing more hope to the people by giving them some experiences so that they can become self sufficient.  And also help to improve the appearance of the community.
Story_ID: 71962
Speaker 1: Now you continue to say that Overtown [Miami, Florida] is your home.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you recognize the place that is Overtown today as the same place that you grew up?
Speaker 2: Well that's a good question.  I recognize it as the same place that I grew up.  Overtown is Overtown.  Now we have, we have different people there.  We have people there who don't--maybe who don't share my, my experiences.  But I think that these are people who could help to improve Overtown if given the help that is needed and if given the support.  I think that you know, when people are just left to, to find their own way, then you don't have the progress that you could have.  And so I would like to see more leadership development in Overtown in, in various aspects.  In, in, in business and improving the living conditions, and, and whatever it takes to make it the kind of place that it was when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: And you think that can happen?
Speaker 2: I think it can happen.  I think if the right people are working on it and if they get the community involved, I think it can happen with the right kind of leadership.
Story_ID: 71963
Speaker 1: We're gonna move on to your historical and activist endeavors.  Tell us how you became involved with the Dade Heritage Trust.
Speaker 2: Well I was, I was Assistant Principal at South Miami Junior High School [Miami, Florida] and this parent of this student, Don Slesnick asked me to be a member of the board, to become a member of the board.  And I was not really interested in that.  And incidentally Don Slesnick is now the Mayor of Coral Gables [Florida].  But at that time he was very active in cultural affairs in the community.  And he asked me to become a member of the Board of Trustees of Dade Heritage Trust and after continuing to tell me you don't--you won't have to do much or what--you just--we just want you to share some of your experiences with this group, and I said yes.  I, I, I got on the board and I worked.  And then one of the things that I noticed when they had Dade Heritage Days, there weren't that many activities that, that black people were involved in.  So I said you know we are a part of this community also.  And so we should have something to celebrate during Dade Heritage Days which is really going on now.  And I, I organized what we are now calling the African American Committee of Dade Heritage Days to celebrate a part of the, the black heritage that is here in Miami [Florida].  I had been in the city cemetery as a child to a funeral of Alfred Roll, and I knew that blacks were buried in the city cemetery.  So when I went on a tour with the Natives of Dade, which is a predominantly white group, a few African mem--African Americans are members.  And the, the tour guide only talked about the white leaders in Miami.  He named one black person, and that was Father Theodore Gibson who was a, an Episcopal priest and a City Commissioner and President of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And when I told him that there were other outstanding African Americans buried in the city cemetery, it didn't seem you know, to faze him.  And so I was a little upset about that, but then some of the white people said to me don't get upset about that because he's not talking about all of the whites either.  He's just talking about the outstanding whites who made contributions to the City of Miami.  So that incensed me even more.  But anyway I said--and then too people didn't even believe that blacks were buried in the city cemetery.  So I did research on that and we discovered over 3,000 African Americans that are buried there.  And so when Channel 17 heard about it, which is the education channel here in Miami, they asked me if I could find 20 people in Miami who had relatives buried in the city cemetery.  So I felt that I could do that.  And I set out to find 20 people who had relatives buried in the city cemetery, and I did, I found 20.  However, 18 showed up because one had sickness and another one had death in the family; they couldn't come.
Story_ID: 71964
Speaker 1: But we did a video right there in the city cemetery, and it's entitled "Resurrection: African Americans Buried in the City Cemetery."  And I still have that video that Channel 17 did.  It was --it came on Channel 35, Cable Tap.  And with the--these people talking about their relatives that are buried there.  And then after that I did --the research that I did was published in, in a book that was put out by the Genealogical Society.  So each year now we celebrate.  We have a commemorative service in the city cemetery.  We have a procession from St. Agnes Episcopal Church with a band, the Progressive Coronet, Coronet Band.  And people--anybody who wants to participate in the procession, we walk from St. Agnes the Episcopal Church, which is located on Third Avenue and about 17th Street, to the city cemetery, which is located on Miami Avenue and about 18th Street.  Now actually the address is 1800 Northeast Second Avenue [Miami, Florida].  But for the purpose of our commemorative service, we enter with--our procession, the band and all the people, we enter the Miami Avenue side of the cemetery because that's the colored side.  That's the side where the black people were buried.  And so we want people not to forget that this at one time was where you had to enter.  And even though we don't have to enter on that side now, we do enter from that side and then we have the commemorative service in the city cemetery.  We have discovered some of the incorporators of the City of Miami who are buried there.  And we are --we have gotten headstones for two of them.  One was Ulysses Grant Bell, we honored him last year.  The other was A.C. Lieburn [ph.], we honored him the year before.  And so we have, we have headstones now saying that these are African American incorporators of the City of Miami.  On April the 28th of this year we will honor two more incorporators of the City of Miami, Audrey Willis and M.T. Mitchell.  And we're buying a headstone.  Audrey Willis already has a headstone.  We're buying a headstone for M.T. Mitchell, which will say that he is an incorporator of the City of Miami.
Speaker 2: Now were there reasons ever given for why there was no information on these African Americans who were buried there?  Were there ever reasons given?
Speaker 1: No.  In fact people didn't believe they were buried there.  So they didn't have to give a reason.
Story_ID: 71965
Speaker 1: Now I'm sure when the Dade Heritage Trust got you on there--and they told you they just wanted you to be--you can just come to the meetings.  They didn't realize who they were getting on there, huh?  Now tell us about your ascent to the presidency.
Speaker 2: Well you know I really was a little reluctant about that.  I, I did not know.  I did not want to become president because I was afraid.  I was afraid that this organ--you know suppose the organization collapse under, under my leadership, you know.  I wouldn't, I wouldn't want that.  And it's, you know it's a predominantly white organization.  So I, I was reluctant.  But finally I said--and everybody said this is a challenge, you can do it and you know, and I accepted the presidency.  And it was a challenge, it really was a challenge because that was the time --it was during the time that I was president that they discovered The Circle [The Miami Circle].
Story_ID: 71966
Speaker 1: And The Circle--well The Circle [The Miami Circle] is located just off Brooklyn, right next to the, the Sheraton Hotel.  And it's a series of round circles in the ground which indicates some--the life of the Indians that were there in the early stages of Miami [Florida].  And it was discovered during a time when Michael Bowman had bought the property to, to put a hotel, a condo, parking lot, you know, he had plans for it.  And when we found out about the, the relics that were there, Dade Heritage Trust went on record as being against the development.  Now the City of Miami at the time Mayor Carollo [Mayor Joe Carollo] was the mayor of Miami.  And the City of Miami was in favor of going ahead with the development.  So we had to-- we had a fight with the City of Miami and we were able to get a, a lawyer to, to file suit pro bono to stop the development.  And eventually we had demonstrations, and eventually we were able to get support from the community that this should not happen to this Indian sacred ground because we are not too sure even today what, what that really means.  But the geologists found it and we want to respect it, and Senator Graham [Senator Daniel Robert "Bob" Graham] is going to propose that it becomes a part of a National Park.  So we're, we're very proud that we were able to save a part of Miami's heritage that was put here by the Indians before many of us came here.  And so --but it was not an easy fight.
Speaker 2: But it was the first of many.
Speaker 1: Yes--
Speaker 2: [Unclear]
Speaker 1: --yes--
Story_ID: 71967
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Now when you--before you became president, before you became a member, was the Dade Heritage Trust active in things of this sort?  Were they really--
Speaker 1: Yes, they were active in preservation and the--
Speaker 2: Did they have many confrontations as they did before you--
Speaker 1: Well I don't, I don't know--they, I'm sure that they had some because just getting for instance the, the, the place where their office is right now is a historic site, it's on the National Historic Registry.  And so they've had to, to, to do some battles you know to get certain designations.  The lighthouse on, on Key Biscayne [Miami, Florida] is a place that they have restored.  So they've, they've, they've had, they've had some, some battles.  But we're still in the battle right now.  We're trying to save the Hampton House.
Speaker 2: Let's talk about one battle before that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Virginia Key Beach [Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: Virginia Key Beach, the battle with that, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that kind of battle.
Speaker 1: All right during the time of The Circle [The Miami Circle], Greg Bush came to me, he's an environmentalist.  And as we were trying to keep the Circle from being destroyed, he came to me and said what are you gonna do about Virginia Key Beach because it's--there's a plan to make it an echo camp ground and development is gonna go on Virginia Beach.  And I said really, I had not heard of that.  Nobody --I had not heard anybody speak about that before he did.  And so I said but I can't take this on right now because I'm too involved with the circle.  And, but I will work with any group that is interested.  And we told Gene Tinny about it and Gene Tinny went to Mrs. Range, and Mrs. Range said we can't let this happen because this is, this is the colored beach.  This, this was the only place that we could go to swim or to have some recreation.  And so this was going to be taken away from us even though it was closed because the city stopped spending money on it.  And then people after integration when people could go to any beach, there wasn't the, the effort to preserve it.  But then when we found out that it was being taken away for a big time development that we would probably not be able to go there anymore because it would prob--be so expensive, it would be without--beyond our reach.  We felt that we had to do something to stop that.
Story_ID: 71968
Speaker 1: And so we formed the Virginia Key Task Force.  And after that, we went on to form the Virginia Key Trust.  And I'm, I'm a member of the Virginia Key Trust.  And so we're now trying to--we hope--looking forward to opening that beach to the public, blacks, whites, anybody who wants to go there.  And we have --we've done very well.  We've hired an Executive Director who's Lynette Austin and she's doing a very good job of helping to bring that beach back to the state where it can be open and, and used by the public, and not a private development.
Speaker 2: Do you think they understand why you want to--do you think the developers and the mainstream state of Florida understands the importance of that beach?  Do you think they understand it?
Speaker 1: Well they--I think that people understand it, that doesn't mean that they don't want to develop it.  I mean you know they, they, they see it as you know, something sentimental to you but then people are look--they're looking for money and, and this--the, the--as the mayor said, you know you're looking for, for tax money that's gonna bring --development that's going to bring money into the city.  So it has, it has a different meaning for certain business people than it has for us.  And we see it as a part of our heritage, as a part of our legacy.  And we feel that we have to hold onto it.
Story_ID: 71358
Speaker 1: Okay Mrs. Pinkney, you were talking about Virginia Key Beach and I also want to add in or bring into the conversation the Hampton House.  Please tell us about that and your preservation attempts with the Hampton House [currently Historic Hampton House].
Speaker 2: Well the Hampton House was the motel in Miami [Florida], in the Brownsville community where I live, which was in its heyday a very beautiful place.  It had a swimming pool, it had a bar, it had a, a restaurant.  All--anybody who was somebody stayed at the Hampton House.  Martin Luther King [Jr.] stayed there, and it's reported that he made his first "I Have a Dream" speech right there at the Hampton House.  Mr. A. B. Moore told us that that was the first place he made the "I Have a Dream" speech and it electrified them.  So Jackie Robinson, Althea Gibson, you name all the black celebrities and leaders, they stayed at the Hampton House.  Well with integration and you can go to any hotel, the Hampton House went into disrepair and it, it was closed.  And just recently when we--especially since we found out about Dr. King's making the "I Have a Dream" speech there, we thought that we would try to get the Hampton House to be designated as an historic site.  Well when we got into that, we found out that the Hampton House was listed for demolition.  That the owner--there were a lot of code violations and the owner had not responded to the county's request for repairs and so it was listed for demolition.  So that's when we formed--we decided well Cathy Hirsh came to us, to the African American Committee of Dade Heritage Trust and asked us if we could give, excuse me, some leadership to preserving the Hampton House, and we decided to do so.  So we formed the Save The Hampton House Committee.  And we had a rally in front of the Hampton House and the media was there, and the press was there and we were saying that we want to save the Hampton House, we don't want the county to demolish it.  Mayor Penelas [Mayor Alexander "Alex" Penelas] came to the rally, Commissioner Barbara Carey-Shuler was at the rally and a lot of the leaders of the community; people that used to work there, Charlie Austin who was head of the band there.  Dr. Richard Strong who also was head of the band after Charlie Austin left, Dr. Preston Marshall and a lot of leaders came to the rally of--to save, save the Hamp--Hampton House, Tryla Vallis [ph.] who is a radio announcer and used to work out of the Hampton House, he came.  And everybody's interested in saving the Hampton House.  So what we did, we--the Mayor was instrumental in having a stay of demolition.  And so we have gone as far as having the county to, to write a proposal for historic designation.  That goes before the Historic Preservation Board tomorrow.  And I'm not sure how they're going to vote.  I'm on that board, but I cannot vote on this particular issue because it's a conflict of interest.  So we, we will see on tomorrow whether it will get a local historic, historic designation.  And after that we will seek national historic designation.  We have in the meantime formed the Hampton House Community Corporation, and we are forming a 501(c)(3) organization so that we could solicit monies to buy the Hampton House from the owner and to restore it.  So we have a big job ahead of us.
Story_ID: 71359
Speaker 1: My question is what is your argument, what is your response to whites and blacks and whoever else, who would say places like Virginia Key Beach and the Hampton House represent the racist old way and that they shouldn't be preserved, but they should be destroyed for what they represented, segregation?
Speaker 2: Well you know I had someone to say that to me and it was a minister.  I was trying to get his support.  And he said I don't know whether I want to support that or not.  I don't know because, because of the conditions that now exist there and it is reported that you know, there, there are drug addicts around there and the crime--it's a place for crime and it right now, it does have some damaging leanings on it.  However, I'm not looking at that; I'm looking at, I'm looking at what it was and I'm looking at what it can become with the cooperation of as many as people as can who would donate money, give us money, help us to raise money to, to salvage a piece of history.  And I'd like for the young people who are coming along to know that we thought enough of our history and our heritage to try to save it for them so that they will know.  There's a room there, I think it was Room 51 where Martin Luther king used to stay.  Muhammad Ali used to live there.  He went there after his fight with Sonny Liston.  All of the greats who used to stay there right in their community.  And this is--this was a beautiful place.  And we should have what it takes to bring it back to that status.  We should have the will and we need to make the way to bring the Hampton House [Historic Hampton House] to its original beauty and its original status.
Story_ID: 71360
Speaker 1: All of your life it seems that you've always taken a stand, even when others may not have stood with you, you've always taken a stand from that day you seen your father [Henry Curtis], you saw your father stand up to those police officers who weren't treating him fairly.  How do you impart to others the understanding that they need to stand up so things can change and so things can take its course for our people or for anyone else?  How do you teach that to someone else?
Speaker 2: Well you know I tell people to listen to themselves.  Listen, listen to your heart, listen to the voice within, listen to--if you call it the Holy Spirit.  And if the Lord lays something on your mind that you need to be about, then don't count the cost.  Do what you can because I sincerely believe that God will make a way.  And I believe that God's gonna make a way for the Hampton House [Historic Hampton House].  And I don't even know how that's gonna come about.  I do not have the money, I don't know where the money is to buy the Hampton House.  I don't know where the money is for the restoration of the Hampton House, but I believe it's out there because I say that the God that I serve is rich in houses and land.  And He holds the wealth of the world in his hands.  And, and I, I have to turn it over to him and, and be guided.  And I think that somehow, some way it's gonna happen.
Story_ID: 71361
Speaker 1: Now you've spoken to the inner peace and the Holy Spirit that guides you from your childhood, YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], Talladega [Talladega College, Talladega, Alabama], Student Council President in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Miami, Florida], as an educator, as President of the Dade Heritage Trust, a member of the Virginia, Virginia Key Beach organization.  Your life has been about service.  And there's been a big push in our country to have more volunteerism, more individuals just simply serving.  What is your perspective, what is your philosophy on why people should serve?
Speaker 2: Well I think that we are fortunate, I think we're blessed to, to be alive and to be able to get around.  And we've been blessed with an education, you're blessed with health, you're blessed with a mind, share it.  Bless others.  That's--to me that's, that's why we're here.  We're here to give of ourselves and share what we have with others and let others see what, what they too can become because they too can become leaders.  And that's one of the things that I've worked--I work with people, I work with people to help them develop the leadership that is within them, and I enjoy doing that.
Story_ID: 71362
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?  Not only in Miami [Florida] and here, but overall.  What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: My hope is that we will respect ourselves and that we will value ourselves, and we will value ourselves to the extent that we are willing to do whatever it takes for improvement of ourselves, our young people, our community, our churches, our schools, wherever we are, whatever we're a part of.  Let's make it the best that it can be.  And let's--let it be of service to others.  And let others see the benefits of giving of themselves so that as we try to improve the community, we, we, we gather other people and they too want to become a part of the changes that are needed wherever we are.  So I, I enjoy doing that and I enjoy influencing other people to, to participate and to, to, to use themselves as, as leaders in whatever walk of life they, they're able to do so.
Story_ID: 71363
Speaker 1: One final question.  What do you want your legacy to be?  What do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Well that I gave of myself; that I shared whatever I had with others.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you very much.  It's been great talking with you.
