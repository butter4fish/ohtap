LIZ LUNDEEN:  This is Liz Lundeen with the Southern Oral History Program.  It is September 17th, 2012, and I&#8217;m here with Anne Wilson at her home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  And Anne, I&#8217;m just going to start with an open-ended question and ask you to describe a little bit what it was like to grow up in Davidson County, and maybe if you could say something about your parents or your family.  ANNE WILSON:  Okay, I grew up in a little town in southern Davidson County by the name of Denton.  Denton had a population of a thousand fifty years ago and interestingly enough the population today is still a thousand.  Not the same people mind you, but it really has stayed at about a thousand, which I think is pretty incredible.  The little town was segregated very, very segregated except for one older, childless African American couple who actually were there to work for a family.  They had a little home on the compound, the family compound.  Now African American women particularly came in from outlying areas to clean houses.  But the town, the little town itself was segregated.  I went to school with no diversity whatsoever, totally white.  In fact there were no ethnic groups at all.  Everyone in the little town was Protestant so it was really and truly a WASP [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant] community.    Both the town and the county of Davidson County consisted of a strong conservative Republican majority.  My family was in the minority because we were Democrats.  At one time my uncle was chair of the North Carolina Republicans and a personal friend of Eisenhower.  He was also an open racist.  His son, my cousin, later became head of the Christian Coalition of North Carolina, one of the first Christian fundamentalist organizations.    My father was the village physician.  He was often paid in produce with country hams, sacks of vegetables, lots of corn.  We loved it.  We loved it.  We didn&#8217;t know any differently.  He worked extremely long hours because for a long time he was the sole physician.  But eventually he did get a partner.  But our family time on Sunday afternoons was to pile in the car and to make house calls with him.  And as we rode from house to house that&#8217;s when we would have our best family time, which is a little strange in this day and time.  Also as a teenager, I was very fortunate to be able to work at his clinic.  He had a little nine-bed clinic and also an outpatient office.  So because of the age I was, I was fortunate to get to work with him as like a receptionist doing the filing.  Back then filing, no computers of course.    And also my father was one of very few Democrats who was elected to public office in Davidson County.  He was elected to the county school board.  He was a [Adlai] Stevenson Democrat, very liberal.  But my father died when I was a sophomore in college.  One massive heart attack after a very, very difficult flu season.    My mother was a traditional, played the traditional role as a homemaker.  She was very involved in the community. She was the PTA [Parent-Teacher Association] resident.    She was in the Women&#8217;s Club.  She was very supportive of my father&#8217;s role.  She   enjoyed entertaining a lot.  Being from a small town, she once a year invited the whole school faculty to come for a tea at our house.  And our kitchen table was always the hub of her friends.  It was a round cherry table, and her friends would gather and gossip around that kitchen table.    I have had three siblings, and I was the second born.  I was born thirteen months after my brother and then I had a five-year younger sister and then a seven-year younger brother.  My older brother and my sister are deceased.  My younger brother retired as a successful Methodist minister, theologically moderate.  We were not a particularly close family growing up.  And personally I was closest to my father.  I always felt I was closest to my father, but who knows the others probably thought the same thing.  But we just never, I think maybe because of the age span, I&#8217;m not really sure, we just never were as close a family as I wish we had been, but it&#8217;s what it was.  And truly we had a very traditional family of the 1950s.  And I will say that we were probably the last family in town to get a TV.  My parents always fought getting the television.  So we would beg to go to friends&#8217; houses to watch their television because we did not have one.  But eventually we got one.    LL:  Can I ask, so you mentioned your brother became a Methodist minister, yeah.  Growing up did you attend church regularly as a family?  AW:  Yes, we very definitely did.  Church was very important because again the community was very small, and a lot of the community activities revolved around the church.  We had very definite church expectations to fit into the community, which in retrospect I can see, but we weren&#8217;t terribly a spiritual family.  We just did it because that&#8217;s what you did.  LL:  Absolutely, yeah.    AW:  But I will say that the church probably determined my personal moral code, especially regarding sexuality and alcohol.  Interestingly enough I remember as a young teenager signing a pledge that I would never even darken the doors of a place that sold alcohol.    LL:  Wow.  AW:  So that was, that was pretty backwoods.  LL:  Yeah, from the get-go.  AW:  Backwoods, yeah.  From the get-go.  That&#8217;s correct.  Of course that did not last forever thank goodness.  And really other than church attendance the only other religious ritual was my father saying the blessing.  He always said the blessing around the table.  Yes, we always had dinner around the table at night.  Even though we might have to wait for him late sometimes&#8212;  LL:  To get home from work.  AW:  Yes.  Because he had very irregular hours depending on the number of sick people.    LL:  And can I ask another question about, so your dad is a holder of public office and a Democrat?  AW:  Yes.  LL:  Was there ever a reaction that you remember or did you ever feel as though, &#8220;Huh, my family is different because my parents are Democrats,&#8221; or was it not something you really thought about?  AW:  Well, I knew that we were different, and we were different in other ways.  We had two cars and most people only had one car.  And I always felt that I had to defend the reason we had two cars is because my dad had the car at work&#8212;  LL:  Really.  AW:  And there were four of us children.  And we needed a car; plus I guess we could afford a car also.  So children didn&#8217;t really talk about politics, but I was aware that we certainly were Democrats, and we certainly were different.  But it wasn&#8217;t a focal point.  LL:  Absolutely.  AW:  I know my mother always laughed and said she voted against my father because she didn&#8217;t want him gone another night for a meeting or out.  But I don&#8217;t think that was the case.  I&#8217;m pretty sure she&#8212;  LL:  You never know.  AW:  I know.  Yeah, you never know what happens at the ballot box.  But back to the church a minute.  We were Methodist.  We were a moderate Methodist family.    LL:  And how about school growing up?  What memories do you have&#8212;I know you said it was all white.  AW:  All white.  And interestingly enough we all attended public school.  Public school was very important to our family.  The school I attended was in the same location all twelve years, and that&#8217;s because it was a tiny town.  So the whole school campus was in one location.  And therefore I was in, I went through my whole school years, twelve years, and I think I did a year of kindergarten, I&#8217;m not sure.  It was so long ago.  I don&#8217;t have memories of that.  But at the same location all twelve years with the same students give or take as people may have moved.  Most people stayed there forever.  I graduated in a class of I can&#8217;t remember the specific number, but it seems like it was around fifty people.  I don&#8217;t think any more than fifty.  High school was pretty much the center of my life.  Band, I played the flute from sixth grade actually.  Then I got into cheerleading, babysitting, boyfriends, Beta club, the traditional high school happenings for a young girl.  And education was very important to my family.  We all had high expectations.  College was assumed.  We didn&#8217;t really talk much about it.  It was assumed that you went to college.  My brothers interestingly enough were expected to become physicians.  But it was not such an expectation for my sister and me interestingly enough.  Female doctors were pretty rare even fifty years ago, well, that&#8217;s over fifty years ago.  So we were pretty much a family of my era in the [19]50s.    LL:  But it was, it was certainly expected that you and your sister would go to college.    AW:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  So, shall I continue with college?  LL:  Yeah.  Tell me about your decision to go to Salem and how you ended up there.  AW:  Well, as I said college was assumed though never fully visited or explored.  There weren&#8217;t really a lot of options for me as a woman back then. But given the fact that I didn&#8217;t take much initiative&#8212;I knew I was going, but I really didn&#8217;t take the initiative to do the research, because I had always had several colleges suggested to me&#8212;Salem was at the time, well, it is now close to home but yet removed.  To be honest with you, once I visited the campus, I did fall in love with it.  And in terms of being an all girls school it was so small and I knew that guys were on the campus all the time.  And meeting guys was not a problem.  It just happened because there were, Salem was very popular with the men, with the young college students especially across town as well as Davidson, nearby.  And all of the schools I really looked at or all that I considered were interestingly enough all girls&#8217; schools, which never at the time bothered me.  I still don&#8217;t regret that I went to an all girls' school.  There was plenty of freedom; there was never a problem being an all girls' school.  And also being from a small town, a small school setting, the familiarity of Winston-Salem was comfortable. I had come to Winston-Salem to the orthodontist for a number of years.  It was just familiar turf.  So I guess I might say I chose Salem for practical purposes and not academic purposes.    LL:  Okay, can you talk, you alluded to a sort or relative sense of freedom for the time.  Can you talk to me a little bit about what the rules and regulations were for women on campus?  AW:  Oh that was a hoot.  I forget the specific times.  It was probably curfew like at ten o&#8217;clock.  It was really ridiculous.  I happened to follow the rules, and I wish I had not followed the rules so much.  If I had to do it all over again, I would do what some of my classmates did because I think they probably had a lot more fun sneaking in at night.  But I was a rule follower, a stickler for the rules.  It&#8217;s so foreign and antiquated compared to what even Salem does today.  We had to sign out, written sign out&#8217;s.  If you spent a weekend away from campus you had to have written parental permission.  No guys beyond the living rooms of each dorm.  There was no such thing as entertaining a guy in your room.  That was taboo, strictly taboo.  Of course that&#8217;s changed now.  The whole thing has changed.  But we had smoking rooms down in the study hall.  I did try my Kent cigarette from time to time.  Fortunately I did not get the habit, but it was the cool thing to do.  In terms of drinking, I did not drink in college.  I was still adhering to my Methodist pledge, I guess.  I was around drinking, but it did not appeal to me.  I did not partake in alcohol beverages until, really until I graduated.  Well, a little bit on.  A little bit during college years, but it was not a big deal.  LL:  What did you study?    AW:  Sociology was my major.  I've always been interested in studying people.  And I think a lot of that interest came from having worked in the clinic and seeing a real cross section of people and lots and lots of lower socio-economic people struggling even back then, thus the reason for being paid with country hams and vegetables.  And I could just identify with those people and thought that it was very interesting to study and to see what I could do with sociology.  Interestingly enough I never really used it in a job because I became a teacher.  And all along the way I did take some education courses although I was not certified as a teacher at the time.  But I got the certification later.  So I enjoyed the sociology and also a number of psychology courses.  At the time I was really not academically inclined because like most of my classmates, I was going through the routine of school, mostly expecting to marry and to repeat my family of origin pattern.  LL:  Did you think you that you would be a teacher after graduation?  AW:  No.  LL:  At that point you thought you would be, get married&#8212;  AW:  Well&#8212;  LL:  Be a homemaker.  AW:  Well, I happened to meet the man I married the middle of my freshman year, but also I knew that he was going to be, he was in divinity school, seminary, and I knew that I should be prepared to have a job.  But I didn&#8217;t know what that was going to be, whether it would be some type of social work or teaching job.  But as it turned out there was an opening in a first grade class in the little school where we were at the time.  And that&#8217;s what I ended up doing.  So the first year I taught was not on a certified certificate but what&#8217;s called a B certificate, in Virginia.  But then two years later we moved back to Winston-Salem, and then I went to Wake Forest and finished my certification.    LL: Can we flash back to Salem for just a second and let me ask&#8212;  AW:  Sure.    LL:  What sort of activities you were involved in when you were in college?  AW:  Well, unfortunately, I say unfortunately, I&#8217;m so happy I met the man I married my freshman year.  But in a way that kept me from doing as many activities on campus as perhaps I would&#8217;ve done otherwise, because I was very eager to be with him when I could, and I just feel like I missed a lot of opportunities.  I went to a lot of musical, a lot of cultural things activities concerts, lectures and that kind of thing because my roommate for three years was an organ major.    LL:  Oh wow.  AW:  So I was able to go with her and to enjoy and to appreciate the things.  But in terms of like progressive causes, at the time Salem did not have any progressive causes.  We were tucked in safely on that small campus, and the closest real, I would say &#8220;real,&#8221; cause was the Woolworth sit-ins uptown in Winston-Salem and in Greensboro.  But really they were non-issues on the Salem campus.  And really even frowned upon by Winston-Salem State and Wake Forest professors.  Most of the students chose not to get involved, and basically we were ignorant of what was to come.  LL:  Yeah so do you remember how you heard about what was going on?  Did teachers say, &#8220;Be careful, don&#8217;t go down there.&#8221;  Or was it in the newspapers, or just word of mouth?  AW:  It was just the word of mouth.  It was word of mouth.  I don&#8217;t think I remember, of course that&#8217;s been a long time ago, but I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t remember having been warned by any professors, by any teachers.  It was just kind of the word on campus, and there wasn&#8217;t even a lot of talk about it.  Sad to say, if that were the case now it would be a whole different situation, I can guarantee you.  And of course my husband was across town on campus at Wake and did not participate.  So it was a pretty small segment.  LL:  It was very small, yeah, a group of people.  AW:  Of people who were actually brave enough and courageous enough to do that.  And now they&#8217;re heroes.  But at the time they were not considered heroes.  It was like daring, wild students, but they were doing the right thing, definitely doing the right thing.    LL:  So was there a point when the civil rights movement and its causes sort of hit you and resonated with you in a harder way as time moved on or were there any memories you have of any particularly significant events in the civil rights movement?  AW:  Well, let me I&#8217;ll, yes.  The answer is definitely yes.  Okay.  Let me build up to that point if I might.    LL:  Sure.  AW:  We were married one month after my graduation in 1964.  And talk about culture shock.  Moved to a small town in Virginia.  I was now the wife of the Baptist minister who had been in, who was still in seminary back in North Carolina.  I was pretty much forced to teach in school because I needed a job and I had not done much job preparation.  So this job fell into my lap so to speak.  And that was probably because of being the new preacher&#8217;s wife.  It was a miserable year.    LL:  Oh no.  AW:  It was a very miserable year.  I had moved from a very comfortable economic situation to where I became the primary breadwinner with no money to spare, not even to get a good piece of meat at the Kroger store, which was beside the parsonage.  So it was quite a culture shock.  And then I also, the church people insisted that I be baptized, which I never really wanted to do&#8212;the Baptist way by dunking.  But in order to be the good little traditional minister&#8217;s wife, I played the role and went through the baptism, much to my chagrin.  This day and time I could say, &#8220;No thank you.&#8221;    LL:  Yeah, yeah.  AW:  Because I had already been christened or baptized as a child as a Methodist as an infant and then as a teenager when I joined the church.  So the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964, with the end of the Jim Crow.  That&#8217;s the summer I was married, moving immediately to that little town in Bedford, Virginia.  [cough]   My husband had two more years of seminary remaining.  So he commuted from Bedford to old Wake Forest, to Southeastern Seminary, from Tuesday until Friday then back to Bedford for the weekends.  I was very busy with my work and was pretty much into survival mode.    The winter of [19]65, my husband comes in and announces that he will be applying to the Student Interracial Ministry, a church affiliated organization, which puts blacks in white churches and whites in black churches.  During the prior couple of years Charlie had become involved in the movement at a minimal level, that of voter registration, and he wanted to do more.  He was beginning to have conflict over his stance on civil rights.  So when he was accepted into the SIM program, Student Interracial Ministry program, he was appointed to a 2,000 member African American Episcopal church in the heart of Charleston, South Carolina.  LL:  Wow.   AW:  Approximately four blocks from the slave market.  Now we were the only two white people in the black church.  We lived with an older black retired couple with a total of seven people sharing one bath.  Now that was a very interesting summer because after the first night, I [thought I] had bedbugs, as I had all these little welts on my skin, and I think it turned out to be hives.  But it was, I mean coming from a totally segregated little town to Charleston living with this African American family was quite, totally shocking, quite frankly.  And then we had rats that the neighbors, that the matriarch of the family called squirrels, but they really were rats.  They did not have bushy tails.  And they ate holes in our watermelons that we bought throughout the summer.    Now allow me to back up and comment on my family&#8217;s reaction to our being immersed into the civil rights movement as a few workers had been killed the summer before.  My mother was upset, and see my father was already deceased.  My mother was upset but her usual passive self.  My older brother was confrontational, but it all had to do with, &#8220;What will people think?  What&#8217;s everybody in the community going to think?  Here you are going off to work with Negroes?&#8221;  And my Republican leader uncle sent a racially charged letter condemning our work.  It was the work of a rabid racist, my uncle.  Uncle by marriage, I will say, which still isn&#8217;t any better.    Examples of my summer were we experienced racial discrimination in a way far beyond reading it in a book.  Utility bills had no titles for black people.  They would just have the first name and the last name, no mister, no Mrs., no reverend, no doctor.  Smaller print for obituaries for black people in newspapers.  It was cruel.  No positive news whatsoever about blacks, including [when] Sidney Poitier won the Oscar for Lilies of the Field.  No mention of him in the paper.  Very, very tragic really that they did not acknowledge black people.  From time to time we would take our friends, especially younger kids in the church, for doughnuts to the doughnut shop, and when we would order the doughnuts, they would look at us and look at them and put our doughnuts in separate bags.    Charleston refused to abide by the new laws of 1964 and 1965, and one of our jobs was to test restaurants touted as private clubs and to sign affidavits if we were allowed in without being asked for membership.  And of course we never were asked for membership because we were white.  So that was a scream.  We did a lot of voter registration.  This was during the time that a lot of the African Americans could not write, but they would just sign their name with the X.  Their signatures were X.  One night we got back to our car and there was a card attached to our windshield, and we opened it and it said, &#8220;We are watching you, the KKK.&#8221;    LL:  Wow.  AW:  True story, and we would go to rallies and to boycotts from time to time.  But my husband&#8217;s job was really to work in this African American church and we worked in Bible school that summer and just befriended the people, and it was a wonderful experience.  It really was.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.    I will tell you that at the end of the summer we decided&#8212; we had worshipped in the AME church all summer.  And it would be an interesting experience to take some of our new friends, our new African American friends over to our denomination of Baptist, which was the Citadel Square Baptist Church on the same block as our church but separated by a barbed wire fence, separating the two campuses so to speak.  To be above board we made an appointment with the Citadel Square Baptist Church minister.  We went to his office.  We sat and we told him what our plans were that we had worked next door and that we were now going to invite some of our new friends to worship in our denomination church.  And he said, &#8220;I really wish you wouldn&#8217;t do that.&#8221;  And we said, &#8220;We really do want to do that and we are going to do that and we&#8217;re letting you know that right now,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;  And we said, &#8220;Well, we do plan to be there,&#8221; in a very kind way, but firm.    So that next Sunday it seems like we maybe took three or four people, no more than that, very well dressed young people.  And so we arrived to the church, and there were police cars lined up on the block, down on the street.  So it was beginning to rain, and I ran up the steps&#8212;I guess I was a sissy and didn&#8217;t want to get wet, probably didn&#8217;t want to get my hat wet.  We wore hats back then.  And I ran up the steps, and there was a pretty good number of steps to climb.  And as soon as I made it in the church, the big huge doors went bam shut.  And I turn around, and I was in the church by myself, and the others had been slammed out.  And so I was able to open the door and get back out.  The police did not arrest us, but they just told us to not come back there again.  And we did not.  We did not cause any trouble, but it was very traumatic.  Traumatic for our friends as well as us too.  So that&#8217;s kind of what we experienced in Charleston.  LL:  Do you have any recollection of the proportion of men and women involved in the movement from you perspective?  I&#8217;m just curious.  You hear a lot about male leaders of civil rights organizations.  But as far as the church goes I would imagine that there were lots of women involved as well.  Or is it&#8212;  AW:  We were not really thrust with that many civil rights workers.  There were two other guys who lived in our house from Haverford.    LL:  Up in Pennsylvania.  AW:  Yes, up in Pennsylvania, which is a very progressive&#8212;  LL: Quaker school.  AW:  Quaker school.  That&#8217;s correct.  So yeah, so they were there for this&#8212;.  I&#8217;m not quite sure what those guys did.  One was a white guy and one was a black guy.  Super nice, nice people.  But it&#8217;s been so long ago, and I can&#8217;t remember what.  I guess it was with a Quaker organization.  LL:  American Friends Service Committee or something like that.  AW:  Probably with Friends.  Probably with Friends Service Committee.  So we all had different schedule but I think I would say I&#8217;m aware that there were many more men than women involved at that particular time, which is a shame, but of course there were women, too.  And in the church one of the things that the senior minister told my husband from the get go was, &#8220;You are not here to cause trouble.  I don&#8217;t want you here raising, causing trouble around town.&#8221;  But we did things like we helped Sears, I forget what the situation was with&#8212;.  Oh no.  It was one of the utilities companies.  In order to get them to put titles on customer&#8217;s, on black people&#8217;s bills, was our minister B.J. Glover who was very progressive man&#8212;I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s deceased now.  But he started this wonderful thing that did not have to last very long.  But he had his congregation and got other black congregations to pay their bills in pennies.  So if their bill were fifteen or twenty at the time, dollars a month, they paid in pennies, which drove the people crazy as you can imagine.  And so because of that, which was a very peaceful way to go about it, they started putting titles onto their names, on their bills, which was a really creative kind of Martin Luther King sort of non-violent way of protest.   LL:  And do you think during your time in Charleston, I know you said at the beginning, probably just shocked and maybe a bit nervous in terms of being moved into this home with an African American household.  Your family was reacting.  By the time you left, were you feeling any personal sort of transformation?  AW:  Oh my goodness.  And there was nothing to worry about.  We never had anything to worry about.  Lovely people, lovely, lovely people, absolutely.  An interesting thing though about sharing that one bathroom with seven people.  That summer, first of all, we had no money.  We were just poor as church mice.  We were proud, we felt like we couldn&#8217;t ask for money from parents.  We just couldn&#8217;t possibly do that.  So we had no money and we got paid a very, very small stipend, but I will tell you that we invested in a case of Comet cleanser because they did not have a shower.  It was only a tub.  And so before you get a tub bath you would have to scour that thing out with Comet we bought.  And of course that was the days before air conditioning.  And Charleston in the hot summertime, you can imagine.  So we invested in a ten-dollar fan, metal fan; we looked long and hard before we spent that ten dollars.  We are still using that fan in our cabin at the mountains.  That fan carries many, many memories.  LL:  So it was a good investment.  AW:  It was a very good investment.  LL:  For ten dollars.  AW:  But we survived because of that fan and because of our Comet.  We never got over, we couldn&#8217;t have gotten baths without scrubbing the tub.  But oh yeah, we remained friends for a long time . We remained friends with some of the church people for quite a number of years.  Used to get letters from them, and then that just kind of floundered and we kind of went separate ways.  It was a wonderful experience, and I am frankly so grateful to my husband for having done that because I would never have.  I just would never have had the wherewithal on my own.  So for that I&#8217;m very grateful because I think that definitely planted seeds for later activism.    LL:  So what came next after Charleston?  AW:  Well, after Charleston came after graduating from seminary, moving back to Winston-Salem where my husband was in a year&#8217;s internship with the department of pastoral care at Baptist hospital.  After that year he was asked to join the staff of pastoral care, and so for thirty-five years he was an outpatient counselor with the department.  And I was so pleased. Even though I knew I was going to marry a minister and I couldn&#8217;t do anything about that because I was in love, even though I couldn&#8217;t imagine, couldn&#8217;t fathom being a minister's wife.  Because of the career he chose, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about that.  So we really had a good life in terms of his career.  Then I taught four years at the Children&#8217;s Center for physically handicapped, which I had done some fieldwork in when I was a student at Salem.  And so when the director of the Children&#8217;s Center found out that we had moved back she called me and invited me to come to the school and teach.  So that kind of fell into place just beautifully.  And then after we had been married five years, we started our family.  So when that happened was almost six years.  The first son was born after six, nearly six years of marriage.  And I worked until John was born so that we could pay off the cars and get financially in shape to be able to be responsible, what we thought responsible parents, and we economically prepared for our children.  Then two years later Thomas arrived.    Stemming back to childhood, my childhood and traditional family and my husband&#8217;s also, children were a very high priority and in our original plans.  We thought that two would be sufficient, that was all we could afford, responsibly afford because of our careers, and that&#8217;s what we thought we, as many as we thought we could fully parent. And also we wanted to replace ourselves with two productive contributing citizens.  Of course at the time we didn&#8217;t know that that would happen, but it has.  They&#8217;re great.  They&#8217;re great guys.  So I stopped working for several years until the children got into kindergarten.  I did a little stint or two in preschool programs, but other than that I stayed home as a parent, as a mother because that&#8217;s really what I wanted to do and that was always in the plan.  And I thought that being a good mother to get children off to the really solid start was very important, a very important thing to consider.  So we agreed to that.  So and then when the boys got in school, I volunteered at their school, and the principal finally said to me one day, &#8220;You&#8217;re over here all the time; why don&#8217;t I hire you?&#8221;  And so I became what&#8217;s called a half-time primary reading teacher in second grade, and I did that for twenty years.  So yeah.  So all the time that the boys were growing up we lived in a very heterogeneous, diverse group, a neighborhood of Ardmore.  LL:  Ardmore.  I was just going to guess.  AW:  And it was just so all American.  I mean the boys still talk about their wonderful upbringing, and they could ride their bikes places.  They walked to school.  They had playmates.  They had older people.  It was just a perfect setting for children.  It really was.  They&#8217;re grateful for their upbringing.  So hopefully we did that right.  But all during that time I hadn&#8217;t even thought about being an activist.  I mean we were still good Democrats, and I know I had the children putting stamps on letters and licking them shut, the letters shut, for the Democratic party.  But in terms of being really active we did not do a whole lot.  We always voted.  We knew that was very important.  And then I became a judge in our precinct, and for years and years I was a precinct judge.  Did you have any questions?  LL:  I was just going to, so your children were born in the [19]70s, in the early [19]70s.  AW:  [19]70 and [19]72.  LL:  So when they went to school what, where was the process of integration in the local schools?    AW:  Brand new, actually brand new.  I know that&#8217;s an interesting question because the younger son, the younger son&#8217;s best friend was a little black boy, but when Thomas started talking about him I forget how, I guess I had, I forget how the conversation began.  But I think we asked him if Bryan was a black boy, and he said, &#8220;Well, no.  His skin is just a little darker than mine.&#8221;  I mean he didn&#8217;t get it because we never, we never talked black-white.  We just never did.  We talked a lot in our family, but we never brought up prejudicial topics that would give them any ideas that we should think of other people differently than from ourselves.  But it turned out to be Bryan was a little black boy, and they were good friends for a long, long time.  But Thomas never saw it.  He never saw the black, which was&#8212;  L:  So he started school in an integrated setting?  AW:  Yes, that was in his kindergarten class.  The integration in this school system had just begun about that time.  It was still brand new.  LL: After the Swann decision.  AW:  Exactly and then when they got to middle school, there was quite a bit of integration and as a matter of fact the school was over in east Winston, which is largely African American.  But it was just the natural, we never had any problem with it.  It just evolved in a very natural way.  We knew there were people who took their children out of school and sent them to private schools.  But it just never was an issue with us.  LL:  So you became a precinct judge and this would&#8217;ve been the late [19]70s or early [19]80s after they were out of school.  AW:  Probably, probably in the [19]80s.  Probably in the early [19]80s to be more specific.  And I can&#8217;t remember how many years I did that but for years, for a long, long time.  Yeah, it was a wonderful experience.  I was a judge in our neighborhood precinct, and so I knew a lot of the people and it was just a lot of fun.  It was always a long day, but it was very important, a very important civic duty to me.  And even when I was teaching for all those years, I would always take that day off because it was just important to me to be at the polls doing that job.  It&#8217;s a long day&#8212;six o&#8217;clock to seven-thirty, well beyond seven-thirty&#8212;because by the time you get things put up at the polls, it&#8217;s just a long day.  The same faces doing the job year after a year gave a lot of continuity to the polling place, and it was like a big family coming to vote.  I mean you pretty much knew a lot of the people.  I won&#8217;t say all of the people but that was surrounding Baptist hospital and of course there was a lot of flux.    LL:  Yeah.  Yeah.  AW:  With incoming students but&#8212;.  That was a very important job.  So then we moved when the boys flew away to school and establish[ed] their own homes.  We downsized from our house on Hawthorne and moved to a townhouse.  When we did that, we discovered there was no organized precinct in our new location.  I&#8217;m sure there had been, but it has just died out, which often is the case if there&#8217;s no interest in people to pick it back up and to keep it moving, going.  And so I made a call about it to see, to see about our precinct, and I was told that there was not an organized one.  So I said, &#8220;How do we organize?&#8221;  And so we did it.  And it was not difficult.  We must&#8217;ve had about, we&#8217;re in this very small townhouse, but we must&#8217;ve had about thirteen to fifteen people squeezed in this space and got the precinct organized.  And let&#8217;s see&#8212;that was, oh I think I still, I got permission to go back to my old precinct, which is kind of a no-no.  They really like you to live in the precinct at which you serve as a judge, as a poll worker.  But they allowed me to go back for a number of years to the old polling place.    So then I was asked in 2006 to be the county volunteer coordinator for the congressional campaign for the fifth district.  And so I really didn&#8217;t know how to do that, but I couldn&#8217;t say no because we had known the candidates for a long time.  And it just seemed like a good thing to do.  And that I should really do that and wanted to do that, although I knew very little about it.  So that year I was not a judge, and then I have not done it since then because from that year I've blossomed into other responsibilities. And I don&#8217;t want to be tied up at one polling place all day long.  So I&#8217;m just like a freelancer on election day, doing what needs to be done and it&#8217;s amazing.  There&#8217;s always something that needs to be done.  Plus now at our current precinct I&#8217;m now the precinct chair, and I organize poll workers to work shifts and make sure that somebody, that some good Democrat is there to disseminate information as people go into vote.  And then during the primary, I organized volunteers, and then just hung around the precinct myself because it&#8217;s nice if you&#8217;re there to great people and I do know a lot of people.  And it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s good to have friendly faces there to offer encouragement and last minute suggestions.  LL:  Right, persuasion.   AW:  Yeah, last minute suggestions as to who the candidates are, and also the fact that I don&#8217;t hold an office in our Democratic party, I really like that.  Because then I can encourage people or tell people how, I can recommend is a better word, how to vote, which believe you me you would not know the number of people who ask me to share my list.  It&#8217;s unbelievable, professional people who just, they trust me and they don&#8217;t have time to do the research online, and that&#8217;s actually a pretty smart thing to do rather than to vote blindly.  LL:  Especially with like judicial candidates.  AW:  Judicial nonpartisan&#8212;yeah.    LL:  So during this time that you got active with the Democratic party, especially as a precinct worker in the [19]80s and forward, were there issues in particular that really resonated with you or was it just what the Democratic party was standing for?  Was there an issue that really was important to you personally?  AW:  That&#8217;s a good question.  Interestingly enough probably at this point I would say no to that.  Because, and I feel very strongly about this, before the last few years, I won&#8217;t even put an exact number, but before the last few years, I don&#8217;t know if this is true but this is what I firmly believe to be true.  For the most part politicians cared about their constituents.  Politicians ran, I mean I know there have been scandals and bad candidates, bad politicians for years and years, forever.  But I think the overall politician ran because he wanted to, he or she, and hopefully more she&#8217;s now than used to be, but they really cared about the people.  They really cared what was happening.  They really cared what was happening to our country and the standards of America, and I can no longer say that.  I just can no longer say that.  That is absolutely not the case.  The greed has just overtaken any virtues that I used to consider as virtues for politicians.  It&#8217;s really become very bad.  So in terms of specifics, I guess the civil rights movement was the most pertinent issue, and then once that became law I&#8217;m not familiar with any other burning issue that bothered me because I just expected politicians to do what was the right thing and to consider the common good.  And that is just, that&#8217;s not the case anymore.  LL:  Was there a big, and this may have been a bigger issue before you started doing the precinct work with the Democratic party, but was there a big contingent in the Democratic party supporting the ERA [Equal Rights Amendment] when it was up for ratification?  AW:  You know that is a time apparently I was not very strongly connected, so I&#8217;m going to have to say no to that.  Yeah.  I have a feeling there was because there was a very active group of older women, older to me, and of course I&#8217;m the older batch now.  But I was really not, I was child rearing and did not really get so involved in that era.  So but I&#8217;m grateful to those who did.  LL:  And you mentioned earlier your button, which I really admire, &#8220;It&#8217;s a man&#8217;s world unless women vote.&#8221;  AW:  It&#8217;s so true.  LL:  I&#8217;m just curious if you can say a little bit about what the Democratic party, since you&#8217;ve been involved, what their efforts have been to get women to run as candidates.  AW:  Well, not enough.  Not enough and that&#8217;s a real bugaboo.  Fifty-four percent of registered voters are women in North Carolina.  Is that the figure you have?  LL:  That sounds about right to me.  AW:  Fifty-four percent, and we&#8217;re always talking about it and we don&#8217;t do that much about it.  Now is the time, now maybe not this particular time, at this critical time before the election on November the 6th, but now is really the time to be identifying good candidates, bringing them on board, nurturing, training.  And we do a lousy job.  We do a very lousy job.  We know we should do better and for some reason we can&#8217;t get it together and that&#8217;s critical.  That&#8217;s very critical to get good candidates.  We&#8217;re eager for women to step forward, and in fact this year in our county commissioner&#8217;s race we had no Democrat running.  We have two Democrats who are already on the board and that&#8217;s because of the redistricting, that&#8217;s because of the districting to safeguard two African American seats.  Both of those seats are controlled by, I mean are held by two African American men. This year a friend of mine, very courageous Democratic woman stepped up and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m running.  Nobody else is running, I&#8217;m running.&#8221;  And partially because she has a little granddaughter and she&#8217;s real anti-gun person, and for the sake of her granddaughter she stepped up to run this race and I wish her well.  I hope we can get her elected, but it&#8217;s extremely difficult because it&#8217;s a race that&#8217;s not districted for Democrats to win.  So we&#8217;re hoping we can get some of the independent or unaffiliated votes as well as some women from the other side, but it&#8217;s going to be a tough race, a very tough race.  So no, that&#8217;s a very weak area to recruit female candidates.  LL:  And do you think a lot of that is that women are still seen as not electable as men?  Or do you think it&#8217;s just been tough to find women to run?  AW:  No, I think it&#8217;s just been tough.  No, I don&#8217;t think so.  I think women are, I feel that among Democrats, women are very well respected.  Now on the state level that&#8217;s not the case.  They have debunked, double-bunked whatever, anything to get rid of the women in the state legislature, but that&#8217;s because the GOP [Republican Party] is the majority right now.  [With] Democrats, I do not feel that&#8217;s the case.  I feel that Democrats are much more progressive in terms of women and the acceptance of women and encouraging women, and of course then there&#8217;s the wonderful Lillian&#8217;s List, very supportive of women candidates.  So we&#8217;ve got a long way to go but&#8212;  LL:  It&#8217;s true.  AW:  But keep on keeping on but we can&#8217;t stop.  We&#8217;ve got to continue fighting for progressives because the social issues are what really counts not the, well I mean economic issues are have merit too, but I mean it&#8217;s the social issues that keep us moving from day to day and that&#8217;s just what we have to focus on.    LL:  So would you consider yourself&#8212;  I know some of the stuff you&#8217;ve done recently, with being active at the Democratic [National] Convention, and you talked about being a part of the Women are Watching group at the convention. Would you consider yourself part of a women&#8217;s movement, or does that have a particular association for you?  AW:  You know, well my whole situation has been, my activism has been evolutionary.  I don&#8217;t have&#8212;  LL:  Absolutely.  AW:  I didn&#8217;t set out to be.  I never thought I would be, and as a matter of fact when I was serving on a local board and I was introduced as a community activist, it caught me off guard because I never thought about myself as being a community activist.  That was strong for me, but the more I think about it, he was exactly right.  And I think I've only gotten more so.  A lot of friends sit around playing bridge and doing fluffy things.  I can&#8217;t do that, and maybe I wish I could.  But I've gotten a taste of what it is to be involved, and it&#8217;s extremely important to me to try to create, to help be a part of change, changing the system and hanging in there.    I&#8217;m a very behind-the-scenes person.  I don&#8217;t care for leadership roles, and for instance when I finished the stint in 2006 as the volunteer coordinator for the county, I had this wonderful listserv on my computer of volunteers that I have accrued, and they were just marvelous people.  And so when the race was over and we lost, I just could not bear to see that list dissolve.  And so I thought, &#8220;I've got to keep this group active.  I&#8217;ve got to keep them notified of what&#8217;s going on and aware of what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;  And so as I would find out about different political goings on in the community I would just keep this group aware of what was happening.  And if we needed people to go to school board meetings to kind of be watchdogs or to go to county commissioners, and I don&#8217;t say city council so much because Democrats control the majority of city council. Although we have gone to city council before, particularly before Amendment One&#8212;they finally came through at the last minute.  Through the years since 2006 I have accrued, I now have about 300 people on my listserv.  That doesn&#8217;t sound like a whole lot maybe, but it is in terms of writing letters to the editor and whatever needs to be done.  I can send out a mass email or I can comb my list and target just a few people to ask specific things.  That&#8217;s me in the background but then they come forth with whatever I've asked them to do.  It&#8217;s pretty amazing how active my little group is.  And of course people have the option of dropping out.  In fact last week I had somebody write me and say, &#8220;Would you please remove me?&#8221;  LL:  Oh no.  AW:  &#8220;I&#8217;m getting so&#8221;&#8212;oh no it&#8217;s okay.  I understand.  It doesn&#8217;t hurt my feelings one little bit because I understand because I&#8217;m getting so overwhelmed.  LL:  So much email.  AW:  Oh yeah.  So he was extremely nice and thanked me and blah blah.  So I understood, but then I have other people who are always saying, &#8220;I understand you have a listserv and I'd like to be on it and blah blah.&#8221;  So it&#8217;s just a thing, it&#8217;s a cherished list and a lot of people would like to have my list, but I don&#8217;t dare share the names of course.  But it&#8217;s become a wonderful tool that I can use to get things done or to get a group to rally to protest, and I&#8217;m not talking about a hundred people.  I&#8217;m just talking about a couple hands full or whatever I&#8217;m looking for.  And then they can bring a friend.  It just works.  It&#8217;s a good thing.    LL:  So if you had a piece of advice for sort of young people who wanted to do what you were saying&#8212;be a part of change&#8212;particularly young women, what do you think they can do?  What do you think are the issues confronting them?  I mean I know there are a lot of labels being thrown around at the moment about women who stand up for what they believe in.  So&#8212;  AW:  Well, just Saturday I went to a Women&#8217;s Agenda Assembly.  Are you familiar with those?  LL:  I&#8217;m not.  AW:  Well, my daughter-in-law was in charge of this one.  But these were different issues, legislative issues pertaining to women and like access to health care, civic participation and equality, violence against women, economic self-sufficiency.  These were a number of topics that are very pertinent for women to be involved in.  But the bottom line is until we change the majority in Raleigh in the GA, in the General Assembly, there&#8217;s very little of these that can be accomplished, very little.  So the most important thing that young women can do right now is to get on board to help us with voter registration, writing letters to the editor.  Because once you start doing that you kind of get hooked and you realize the importance of being politically involved in the community in helping influence others, and right now I&#8217;m working with a couple of girls in particular, a couple of young women from Salem.   These two particular women I&#8217;m thinking about are going to hold a very important office at some point.  I can tell it now.  And they&#8217;re very adamantly involved.  There&#8217;s a good group.  Case in point, I love these girls.  For our primary in May these two young women, one was a freshman last year and the other maybe was a sophomore or junior&#8212;I&#8217;m not sure.  They arranged with the president of the college to let the van, the Salem van make numerous trips to shuttle students from campus to the polling place for the primary.  So then when the president came to vote late that afternoon, I happened to be there, be at the polls, and so I profusely complimented her for letting that happen and how proud I was that that took place because that was very important.  They also ran the shuttle for some early voting times.  And she smiled back the president, Susan Pauly, she smiled back and she said, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re also doing it in November.&#8221;  And I just thought, that&#8217;s because of those two young students who took that on, and they accomplished their mission.  So hopefully that will happen.  So that&#8217;s a small thing, but it&#8217;s a very important thing.  And it&#8217;s the little things that begin to mount to make an impact.  So because of that I&#8217;m working to try to make that happen at the School of the Arts.  No guarantees yet but&#8212;  LL:  Hopefully.  AW:  The chancellor&#8217;s wife is working on that.   LL:  Is there anything else that you want to add?  AW:  You mean about the political&#8212;  LL:  About anything, yeah, for any part that you feel that you didn&#8217;t cover.    AW:  I do have a few things left.  Well, I guess one little part I left out was shortly after we moved to this precinct, we had a terrible city council representative who was a younger form of Jesse Helms, and I know you know the character Jesse Helms.  LL:  Yeah.  AW:  A very right wing Republican and referred to himself as another Jesse Helms interestingly enough.  And so when we formed our precinct one of the women who came was three years behind me at Salem, and she came to the precinct meeting and then she shortly thereafter filed for city council.  And so I was on the committee, the campaign committee.  We didn&#8217;t really have a lead person.  Just a group of us met together and accomplished our mission by defeating this Jesse Helms, junior, and we elected Molly Leight to the city council.  And the interesting thing about that is that the city, the whole city kind of pulled together with us and made it happen because no one could tolerate this Jesse Helms guy.  And I think it&#8217;s probably because of that and because of the active role that I played in that campaign is the reason that the congressional campaign in 2006 came looking, came after me because I was a key player in the Molly Leight campaign for city council.  So that&#8217;s probably how that came about.    But also my activism has really been political, not just zeroing in on women&#8217;s rights.  And my motivation has always been social justice.  It&#8217;s really a matter of social justice, which also includes women&#8217;s issues, i.e. reproductive rights, equal pay for equal work, the Lilly Ledbetter [Act], which our President was so smart to act to pass in February right after&#8212;  LL:  I can&#8217;t remember.  It was some time&#8212;  AW:  His election.  And then getting women elected to office, generally empowering women.  To date I've been a member of only two groups whose missions have been targeting women&#8217;s issues.  Both groups local, not state or national groups&#8212;The Women&#8217;s Fund and the Women&#8217;s Action Network.  Are you familiar with the Winston-Salem Women&#8217;s Fund?  And then the newest one is the Women&#8217;s Action Network, and actually that&#8217;s in its infancy.  We don&#8217;t know exactly what direction that&#8217;s going to take, but probably it will be concerning women&#8217;s reproductive rights and sexual health.  And then of course the volunteering with Planned Parenthood at the recent convention in Charlotte.    But then as to the question, am I a feminist?  Well, interestingly enough in my younger years when there was Gloria Steinem I really resisted becoming a feminist because I thought that motherhood was the most important profession during that time.  And Gloria Steinem was on the campus of Salem several years ago.  I attended a reception and actually met her and shook hands and chatted with her.  And at her little speech that night at Salem hearing her talk, it was like there&#8217;s nothing so profound.  In other words nothing she said was shocking to me because what that meant was I had come from way back then to, &#8220;I get it.&#8221;  I get it now.  I think we&#8217;re more at the same place than we once were.  And so I didn&#8217;t set out to do that.  It just happened as an evolutionary process.  But as my life has evolved, I've become more keenly aware of the injustice inflicted upon women, of course.  So I just fight for justice, whether it be LGBT or women or because we&#8217;re all equal and we should be treated equally.    LL:  That&#8217;s great.  AW:  Then we didn&#8217;t talk so much about church.  ACLU, oh gosh we&#8217;re members of the ACLU, Americans United for Separation of Church and State. Charlie and I carried the plaintiffs to Richmond to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal for the sectarian prayer case.    LL:  Oh wow.  AW:  Yeah, that was amazing.  And of course they ruled the same as the two lower courts, and the Supreme Court wouldn&#8217;t even touch it.  So now that&#8217;s a huge mission.  We weren&#8217;t involved all along the way.  Our two friends&#8212;the plaintiffs were of course.  But we were so proud to be able to carry them because they weren&#8217;t going to the court.  So we said, &#8220;We want to go.  Would you go with us?&#8221;  Because we really wanted to be there.  And it was amazing.  Also November, was it November of last year?  I got a couple of women, well the one who is running for county commissioner as well as my city council rep to go with me to Greensboro to sit in the courtroom for the women&#8217;s right to know court case with Catherine, Judge Eagles.  We&#8217;re still waiting to hear the final ruling on that.  But that was very exciting and what is interesting about that was of course it was Planned Parenthood and the lead attorney from New York came down and argued the case.  We had all women on our side of the courtroom.  It was a very small courtroom.  And the state side had all men, all white privileged men and a token woman who looked very out of place.  Looked very, very out of place.  But the contrast was amazing.  LL:  You want a picture almost.  AW:  Yeah, the contrast was incredibly amazing.  And then our church at Green Street, and you said you had attended Green Street before, we&#8217;re a social justice church.  And that&#8217;s what attracted us to the church.  LL:  Very diverse, too.  AW:  A very diverse church.  See I don&#8217;t even think about it.  It&#8217;s just so commonplace now but very diverse.  It&#8217;s unusual to list church as being a progressive organization, but the main thrust of this church is social justice.  We accept all people regardless of race, ethnic origins, economic status, sexual orientation, education or previous background.  Green Street is the second of two reconciling churches meaning that we accept everyone as equal members.  Women are truly treated equally in terms of the leadership.    But the truth be known, I was a late bloomer getting involved to the level of my current involvement.  So as I've gotten older this is pretty much my life is trying to help with some of the ills of our society.  LL:  It&#8217;s a wonderful story.  AW:  Well, thank you.  LL:  Anything else?  I think that&#8217;s a good way to wrap up.  AW: I think I've pretty much told the story.  LL:  Okay.  All right.    AW:  Oh and then on my little, I love, I don&#8217;t know--.  Alice Walker of course is a writer.  I don&#8217;t know the guy Gary Snyder, but on my email what&#8217;s it called?  LL:  Signature.  AW:  The signature. I have right now, it&#8217;s not always the case, but two sentences.  &#8220;Activism is my rent for living on this planet.&#8221;  That was by Alice Walker.  Then the other, the second one is &#8220;Find your place on the planet.  Dig in and take responsibility from there,&#8221; by Gary Snyder.  So that&#8217;s pretty much what I feel like I try to do.  LL:  Yeah, absolutely.  All right we&#8217;ll stop the tape.
