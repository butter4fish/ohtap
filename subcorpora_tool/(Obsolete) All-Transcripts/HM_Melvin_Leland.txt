Story_ID: 25221
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm going to ask about your family history; I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family, and then we will bring them together.  So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Gracie Pauline Hughes Melvin.  It's G-R-A-C-I-E; P-A-U-L-I-N-E; H-U-G-H-E-S; M-E-L-V-I-N.
Speaker 1: What is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Place of birth is South Boston, Virginia; date of birth, I don't know that right off hand, yeah, I don't know that right off hand.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know about how old she is?
Speaker 2: She's 79.  So, do you have that sheet Ann Marie, with all that?
Speaker 1: That's good.  Since 1930, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Since 1930.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family; how far back can you trace them, and what were they doing, or are there any stories about them?
Speaker 2: My mother's family, they were farmers in South Boston, Virginia, and my grandfather and grandmother, both lived on a farm in South Boston, and were tobacco farmers.  And my mom had seven other siblings; they all kind of worked on the farm, had horses, chickens, I think, some cows and my uncle, I know, had rabbits, and so they were always, you know, eating natural or organic food, even  before organic was in vogue.  But I remember in the summers, I would go down there and they would be in the fields with the tobacco and different things.  And so that's--that's--I remember my grandmother making these wonderful, wonderful pies and cakes and would always have me in the kitchen; I was kind of pulling at her apron, and watching her do this fantastic baking from scratch.  And they had a potbelly stove with, you know, wood stove that--go out to the garden get wood and bring into, to stoke the stove, but it was a simple but fantastic existence when you looked at what they could create from, you know, very, very minimal means.
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother's family own their own land?
Speaker 2: They did own their own land, yes.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about how they acquired land, or any stories go all the way back to, you know, slavery or reconstruction?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know those stories about back then.  Yeah, I do not know that.
Speaker 1: So, no family stories at all about where they--were they always from that same part of Virginia, South Boston?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My grandmother grew up not far from where they lived.  And her mom was Cora Hughes.
Speaker 1: That's your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother.
Speaker 1: Your great grandmother?
Speaker 2: My great grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was Cora, and, you know, they were always in that general vicinity, but I don't have that historical piece.
Speaker 1: What about your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother is Virginia Hughes, it is Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what about your grandfather on your, I mean, your mother's father.
Speaker 2: His name was John Hughes, and you know, he worked the land.  He also, you know, he worked in the--where they would sell the tobacco.  So he--later in life when they stopped doing the selling of tobacco, I mean the farming, he would actually be there and help sell tobacco through other means.  And he was an interesting character; very salt of the earth, very persistent and very opinionated.  So, he was a good guy.
Speaker 1: Now, are there any stories on that side of the family about developing a school or building a church or anything about your relatives on that side in the community and what they were doing?
Speaker 2: You know, both of my grandparents, they were part of the community, but they kind of kept to themselves there on the farm.  I know that they shared a lot of the things from the farm with, you know, their local--people local in the community.  I don't think there was--they probably had some barter systems where they would trade rabbits and eggs and different things for other services they needed.  My grandmother was a great seamstress; she made the clothing for everyone in the family.  And my mother actually made some of my clothing when I was a young child.  We would go to the fabric store and get the Simplicity or the Butterick patterns, and she would ask me, you know, do you like this pattern or this pattern, so she took that skill up from my grandmother, and it was very useful in helping us as we grew up having my mom make my own clothes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now, did your mother have any stories about growing up that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: You know, the stories that she really talked about were just how you had all of these chores to do when you, you know, got to go do all your chores in the morning and then go to school.  And they walked to school with us, you know.  You know, they always try to joke with you, talk about how we had to walk to school in the snow, five miles with no shoes on.  But I don't think it was that far; it was probably a mile to go to school, but, you know, just how much more difficult it was than it is today for kids now, you know, we have so many things like iPads and iPhones and the bus stops in front of their house and takes them to school, so those kind of things were difficult.  I think my mom started sewing at an early age; she learned those skills from my grandmother and also loved to bake and to do those types of things, so she ended up becoming a home economics teacher and used those skills in her profession.
Story_ID: 25222
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of the school she [Melvin's mother, Gracie Melvin] attended?
Speaker 2: Well, she went to Virginia State University, but her high school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think it was Bethune High School or Bethune Elementary School, I think, something like that.
Speaker 1: Often like the schools in the black community, named high school, but it's all grades.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It went all the way through high school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, it was Bethune?
Speaker 2: I think it was Bethune, Bethune, something, school in South Boston.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And she went on, as we know, to become a teacher.  She went on to Virginia State?
Speaker 2: She went to Virginia State University, and she got a degree in education and in home economics.  And she always wanted to go to the Peace Corp; she wanted to travel, but she ended up meeting my father, and they got married and had me and my sister Cathy, and then started teaching; she taught for about thirty years before she retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was your mother the first person in her family to go to college?
Speaker 2: Let me see, my mother went to Virginia State.  Yeah, she was the first to go to a four-year college.  I think my other aunts did not go to a four-year college, but they did--they did get some schooling.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, was your mother the youngest?
Speaker 2: My mother was the--let's see, out of the eight kids, she was the--she was the second oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was the second oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she taught in the schools of Virginia?
Speaker 2: In Lynchburg, Virginia, which is where I was born.  She was a school teacher there; taught in a number of schools.  Actually, she taught in the school that I actually went to, and Dunbar Middle School; she taught at Linkhorne Middle School, I think, for the bulk of her career as a teacher; she taught home economics there.
Story_ID: 25223
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm going to go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Deems Melvin Junior.  It's D-E-E-M-S; Melvin, M-E-L-V-N; and J-R for Junior.
Speaker 1: What is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth is 1924, and his place of birth is Roseboro, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  R-O-S-E--
Speaker 2: R-O-S-E-B-O-R-O, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: --Spelled like Johnny Roseboro, the baseball player?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, how far back can you trace your father's side and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: My father's side, they all were in that North Carolina area, Roseboro, Clinton, Durham, and my grandfather, he did odd jobs in the Roseboro area.  He was a--worked in the--they had a pulp wood mill there, and so, you know, a lot of physical labor, manual labor, loading and unloading trees off of trains and taking them down to the bare wood for housing and different things, so he worked in that plant for many years and was--he had lung cancer at one point in time, and he had to stop working.
Speaker 1: You think it was related to the sawdust from the mill?
Speaker 2: They never said, but you know, that industrial type of environment.  Back then they didn't have any--there was no OSHA, you know, to help people.  I'm sure that their safety was priority number one, so it could have been part of that industrial complex that contributed to his lung cancer.  So he grew up in that area also.  And my father's mother, I don't have a good history on her, but she was a Cherokee Indian, and I have a picture of my grandmother, but she died at a very early age, I think, in her early, you know, twenty five to thirty timeframe.  So, I don't have a lot of information about her, but I do remember seeing a picture of her; I think she had very prominent Native American features.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any remnants of Cherokee culture in your family?
Speaker 2: Not really.  You know, I think in Roseboro, that's something they kind of, you know, maybe, because I think she passed at an early age, that wasn't an                                                                                      influence into the family history back then, and it didn't come forward into my generation either.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your grandfather, now, did he pass before your grandmother?
Speaker 2: No, after my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how long did he live before he contracted lung cancer?
Speaker 2: I think he had the lung cancer probably--I found out about it, probably about when he was in his maybe 60s, mid 60s.  And he passed probably, maybe sixty eight, sixty nine.
Speaker 1: So the children were grown, basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what about your grandmother, did she pass before the children reached--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was, I don't know exactly the time she passed, but she was very young when she passed.
Story_ID: 25224
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: My dad was pretty much raised by my--one of my aunts. We called her big mama. She was about six-one, and she had a very commanding presence in the community, as well as with me, insuring that we all did the right thing.  I remember that many, many times going to North Carolina, down to Roseboro, and she actually lived across the street from the pulp wood plant.  And in the morning at 6:00am, you would hear the trains rolling in, you know, dropping off the wood and so forth, and she would rise early; would be there cooking breakfast and biscuits and grits and ham and she liked also--she used to dip snuff.  And so I remember, you know, this contrast of this wonderful food cooking and this little snuff bin sitting over there on the table; these contrasts, you know, it's pretty, pretty remarkable when you think back now as an adult what was going on when you were a child, and you were seeing these different things, but the sounds of that engine, the sounds of the plant, knowing that both my grandfather and my father worked there, and then to be staying right across from where all of this took place, was kind of fascinating.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind your father and your grandfather's name, Deems?
Speaker 2: I don't know that story behind that.  It's a fairly different name.  When I would say Deems, I would hear them say James.  But I don't have the story behind his name, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  That's interesting, you think that maybe somebody would dig into; where did Deems come from?  Okay.  So, big mama was your grandfather's mother?
Speaker 2: Big mama, no, was my--
Speaker 1: Or sister?
Speaker 2: --Was a sister, right, was a sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was her given name?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't even know.  I mean it's one of those things where that's all you know her as, as big mama.  I think it was Inez.  But I just know her as big mama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's kind of funny when you asked me that, it's almost Inez, as big mama.
Speaker 1: You're not the first one that's been stumped by that kind of question.  You know, when somebody in the family has a certain--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --You know, title--
Speaker 2: It's like a call sign in the military when you know a guy as--by jumper or something, so you know him as--so, yeah, but Inez, Aunt Inez, big mama.
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Story_ID: 25225
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what did your father say about growing up?  What was life like for him?
Speaker 2: Life for him, you know, my grandparents didn't have a lot of money.  I mean, it was kind of tough times, and he was always working, and always doing, you know, odd jobs.  So, whether the pulp mill plant or working, you know, doing odd jobs for people in the community, he was a really great athlete; he played football, basketball, tennis.  He was also--he sang, and he played the drums and the trumpet, so music was a very big part of his life, and, you know, even when I grew up, I was always his roadie, taking the drums and the PA systems, and everything, setting them up, getting them ready for their gig, wherever they were going.  But he was also a school teacher, and so it was kind of his chronology, he was in the military, in the air force, as a radar technician, and served in the military and then got out and went back to college.
Story_ID: 25226
Speaker 1: Now, did he serve in World War II?
Speaker 2: World War II--
Speaker 1: You would have been about the age--
Speaker 2: --World War II, uh-huh, and was stationed in North Carolina, primarily.
Speaker 1: --So he didn't leave the country during the war?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Well, it's got to be a story behind being a radar technician, you know, in the 1940s.  Did he talk about  how--that was a time, even if he went on towards the Korean conflict, it's still like a lot of conflict in the military in terms of racial tensions.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, it's kind of funny, you know, he never really talked about those types of things.  He always stayed--kept very positive outlooks.  So if there were, you know, things that had happened from discrimination or racial equality, things that happened in the military, which you know there was back then, he didn't really--he didn't really expound on it; it was more of a, you know, something happened, but let's move on and talk about the things, you know, that are positive and enlightening and--but he definitely wanted to let us know that you had to work hard for it if you wanted it, and not let anyone take advantage of you or let anyone use you to get what they wanted.  But he was a very positive, you know, very positive person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he talk about the rank he obtained in the military.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did, but I don't remember what his rank was.
Speaker 1: He was--I take it he was--well, I don't know, now, did he go to college before he--
Speaker 2: No, it was after--it was after.
Speaker 1: --So he probably was enlisted--
Speaker 2: He came in as an enlisted man, yeah.  He was an officer.  He definitely came in enlisted.
Speaker 1: I was just wondering if he was a non-com, you know, a sergeant or something?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25227
Speaker 1: When he finished service, did he go to school on a GI Bill.
Speaker 2: He was on a GI Bill, and he played--he played football at St. Paul's [St. Paul's College] and also, I think, he ran track, and you know, got his degree in education, also, like my mother.
Speaker 1: St. Paul is a small Episcopal school in Virginia?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I never imagined them having a football team, but do they, they had a football team?
Speaker 2: I think--well, I know he played football in the military; he talked about that a lot, but when he came out, I do remember, yeah, they did, I think they did have a football team, but maybe I'm confusing it with the military service, but he was always playing sports, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I was wondering, you know, you  associate football with a lot of infrastructure, you know, be in the field, you put the uniforms on, but, I mean, I don't know for sure, I'm just--I'm just--
Speaker 2: Maybe he played on another local team, or another school that was associated with him, or something.
Speaker 1: --What was he known for in football, was he a running back--
Speaker 2: He was real fast, he was a wide receiver.
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: Very fast and good hands, you know.  And that's where he taught me--he taught me how to catch and run and how to protect yourself.  You could always kind of shield himself from the blow, you know, he wasn't--he wasn't a very big guy, but he was solid.  He could take a hit, because he didn't have any major injuries.  And in baseball too, he was known for stealing bases.  And so, I know that growing up, after church, we would go to his baseball teams, and my mom would make this fantastic picnic lunch, and we'd sit out there on the grass and watch them playing in the afternoon, after church.  Those were some of my fondest memories.  Try to stay out of the dirt piles and stay--my mom would always grab me and say, we're not going to wash these clothes again, you know, you need to get out of that dirt pile and go over and sit down.  Those were some good memories.  All of their friends and people from church would come out, and it was like an extended community celebration of, you know, people watching these games.  It was just really exciting.
Speaker 1: So, what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: In Lynchburg, I went to Jackson Street United Methodist Church.  And we went--actually, that was the last church that I attended in Lynchburg, but we also went to St. Paul's Episcopal in Lynchburg.  But the bulk of the time that I was there, it was at Jackson Street United Methodist.  And recently, they just had their, I think, 150--125 years of having that church, just recently.
Speaker 1: Jackson Street?
Speaker 2: Jackson Street, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, now your father, he completed a degree in education at St. Paul's?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 25228
Speaker 1: All right, so, did he teach elementary or high school?
Speaker 2: He started out in--so he came to Lynchburg and taught.  I think he started teaching elementary, and then ended up in middle school, so there were a number of schools.  He taught at Robert S. Payne Elementary, he taught at Linkhorne Middle, where my mother taught also, and there was, I think, one other school that he taught at; Darrington Elementary, yeah, Darrington Elementary.  He taught language arts, he coached football, and let's see, I think, basketball also at Linkhorne, and Robert S. Payne, too.
Speaker 1: Robert S--I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: Robert S. Payne.
Speaker 1: --S. Payne, okay.  Now, were these schools named for African Americans?
Speaker 2: Robert S. Payne was, Dunbar was, Lawrence Dunbar, and I don't know about Darrington.  I think Darrington was the area in the city, it was named after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your father seemed like a very talented person; a musician, an athlete; he's got a degree; he's teaching too.
Speaker 2: He was very good with his hands too.  You know, his teachers, in the summertime, we would take these vacations, and as you know, the teachers didn't make a lot of money, we would go on these camping trips, and we started with a suburban, International Harvester Suburban and a tent and a Coleman stove and sleeping bags, and so that was the extent of our summer trips.  And then as time went on, my dad wanted to graduate from the tent and the Suburban and the pop-up trailer, and then we went from that to our first RV, which was a Merita bread truck that he drove into the drive way one day and had Merita on the side of the truck; I'm like, what are we doing with a bread truck?  He said, I'm going to convert this into a camper.  And I remember going out with him.  He wasn't an engineer, but he, you know, he had very good skills at creating and having a vision for seeing something in the bread truck that turned into a camper, and so we had these--my sister and I had these bunk beds that flipped down, had a little place where my parents had like a bed and the kitchen area for the Coleman stove and I think we had a little water container or something, but he was just very creative.  And then finally he had it painted to take the Merita off the side, so people wouldn't come to our house looking for bread, you know.  But very creative, very industrious, you know, always thinking about doing something to save and to be efficient.  But we went from that bread truck camper to getting a type C, you know, different types of RV type campers.  And that's how we spent our summers. And that's what I attributed a lot of my aspiration to was traveling on the road with our family, going to these different places around the country, looking at, you know, society, as you travelled down this highway and stop at a rest stop and see people from all cross, you know, walks of life, you know, growing to the grocery store, or going to these different places.  I think that was a very good introduction for me for just seeing the world around me, you know, getting out of Lynchburg, Virginia, and seeing some more of the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25229
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: From what I recall, my father was driving in Petersburg, Virginia, driving by this house and saw this beautiful woman standing on the porch, and my mother, at the time, I think she was doing some student teaching in Petersburg, Virginia, and was staying with  Mrs. Higginbotham.  And she was on the porch, and my dad, you know, was driving down this road and turned and looked and did the triple take, turned the car around and, you know, they started courting and the next thing you know, they were married and moved to Lynchburg, Virginia.  He took a job in Lynchburg, in the school system, and that's where they met each other.  Something in his eye that caught his eye, and he won her over, and they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She had just finished Virginia State at the time in St. Petersburg, right?
Speaker 2: I think it was a little bit after that, because I think she was an extension agent for New Orleans extension agents, going into schools and places to talk about home economics or nutrition and those types of things and was staying with her, Mrs. Higginbotham, at that time.  So that's the story that I know about their meeting.
Speaker 1: Now, is Mrs. Higginbotham related to the famous Higginbothams, Judge Higginbotham?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, I don't think so, but, yeah, this is a very--I remember meeting her, a couple of times; a really nice woman.
Speaker 1: Now, did your father--what did he teach in school?
Speaker 2: He taught language arts and physical education, I think, so those were two things he taught, but primarily the language arts. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25230
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' personalities and their dispositions, their senses of humor, and how they walk, how they talk, how they behave and how they look, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I would say that I--I probably take after my dad, sense of humor, you know, clowning around, and my mom is a little more serious, and so, when I'm in my work mode, I think I get into my mom's disposition, you know, focused, and working on things, usually a little more serious, all the time than my dad, so I think I combine the two personalities, depending on what I'm doing, you know.
Story_ID: 25231
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have one sister, Cathy Melvin, C-A-T-H-Y; Ann, A-N-N; Melvin, M-E-L-V-I-N.  And she's two years older than me, and lives in Lynchburg; she lives in Lynchburg, and she's a teacher at Linkhorne Middle School, where my parents taught.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so when you were growing up, the family consisted of you and your sister, your mother and father.  Did any of your grandparents or aunts or uncles live with you?
Speaker 2: No, just the four of us.
Speaker 1: Just the four. Okay. Alright.
Story_ID: 25232
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I think my earliest childhood memory goes back to maybe fifth or sixth grade, when I was playing football, and we had a--we had this championship game at the city stadium, it was "Toys for Tot's" game, and it was so cold that I thought my fingers were about to freeze off, and that was when I realized what love and care was about from my mother, because when I came back home, I think I had frost bite, and I remembered the way that she took care of me, and the way she talked to me, and the way she made sure that my hands came back to feeling normal again, and that's the memory I have, you know, that just really helps me understand what a mother's love is.  And I'm sure there were things before that, you know, where she demonstrated that but, it was--I just remember I was in so much pain.  You know frost bite is pretty--it feels like your fingers are about to fall off, and she made that feel better, and I was really appreciative, but also, just thought about the caring and the way she treated me, and did me.  Another childhood memory I have is every night, before I could read, my mother would read to me.  And one of the books she would read is 'The Little Engine That Could' you know, "I Think I can, I Think I Can" and "I could, I could, I did."  And she read that to me so many times that if she were reading and she missed a line, I could fill in the words, because I knew it so well.  And I think, you know, that book and that experience of hearing that "I Think I Can, I Can, I Could, I Did" so many times in my life as a child, helped me, you know, get to where I am today, because that's in the back of my mind; it's ingrained in me; it's in my subconscious, that you can do something, anything you put your mind to, no matter what the obstacles are, no matter what happens, you can get through it.
Story_ID: 25233
Speaker 1: A question occurred to me.  With your father named Deems Melvin and your grandfather named Deems Melvin, is there a story behind your being name Leland.  You're the only son.
Speaker 2: Right.  My mother, I think she wanted me to be, you know, to stand alone, and I think she got the name Leland out of a book.  She saw that it was different; it had a nice meter to it, Leland, you know, two syllables, and it meant calm and from the meadow.  And so it was something that she--I think she wanted me to have those qualities, being calm and from a quiet still place, and so I know that (unclear) book, but I kind of--I think that is does kind of define me.  I have a farm now in (unclear), Virginia.  I'm thinking about doing some farming, you know, when I retire from NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] , and whenever I walk the fields now, there's a meadow there that I just really identify with, and it's very calm and still, so it really does work to my name, calm and meadow.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you grew up in Lynchburg, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Is there a name for the neighborhood you grew up in?
Speaker 2: I grew up in Hilltop.  That's where I spent most of my time, on Hilltop Drive.  And it was right beside a fire station; Fire Station Number 3.  It was in a middle class community, mixed community, school teachers, janitors.  We had a very close-knit community.  I remember my father was always trying to better the neighborhood, and I remember him going down to city hall and petitioning to get a playground up the hill from the fire station.  And, you know, he kept--he was persistent, he kept going, kept going, kept going.  I remember the summer they broke ground, and they started to put the basketball court and the playground in place, and you know, soon after that, that was the place where everyone came, after church or on Saturdays to play these games.  And if you didn't get in the game early and win, you wouldn't be able to play for hours before you could get into the game, and I think, as a young child, you would be playing with these grown men, these adults and high school people.  And I think that's where I think I got a lot of skills athletically, because I would get in the game, they would let me in the game and I learned how to play ball on the hill, we'd call it.
Speaker 1: So it was primarily basketball?
Speaker 2: It was basketball, yeah, basketball.  But it was rough.  You had guys were pretty hardcore guys that would come in and knock you down, you know, wouldn't pick you up, you had to really fend for yourself.  So you learned how to take care of yourself, you learned how to play the game in that environment.  My dad had this two-hand over hand jump shot, and he would just frustrate these younger guys, because he'd come down the court and shoot this ball with this high arc and they couldn't get it, they couldn't get to it, and he also had this hook shot; he would go up and do a layup(sp), he'd do this hook shot, just come way over here like this (indicating), and so I was really impressed about how he could still play at a later age in life and still compete with these younger guys, that's because he utilized those tools of the game; that two-hand arching jump shot and the hook shot to score; very frustrating for a lot of people.
Story_ID: 25235
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now we always ask this question.  Can you describe the house you grew up in, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: So, the house I grew up in, there were two homes, one was on Pier(sp) Street in Lynchburg, Virginia.  It was a wooden frame house, probably three bedrooms and fairly small kitchen.  So the kitchen was always the primary, the focal point for me in the house, because it emanated the smells, of the meatloaf, the collared greens, you know, all of these smells that just kind of permeated the entire house and we, so we spent a lot of time in the kitchen.  So, I was in that home probably until five, maybe five years old, and then we moved to Hilltop Drive, that Hilltop region, and we  bought--my bought the house.  I remember like $20,000 from Mr. Drummond.  And it was a brick house with about maybe an eighth of an acre of land; it flanked Mr. Davis and the fire station, and the Suttons lived behind us.  And so, a big oak tree out my window, on the second floor; hardwood floors, the stairs creaked, again that kitchen was a focal point.  We had a piano in the house, you could hear music playing lots of times, and the basement was where the jam sessions were, the practice sessions, for my dad's band and so there was always music, there was always smells of great cooking, great food.  There were acorns in the yard to have to rake up and leaves to rake up every year with all the trees.  There was a cherry tree on the side yard, so that was always a, you know, always eating the cherries.  And in the back, there was a brick, it was like a brick, you know, way in the back where you could grill.  It was a brick, built-in grill with a kind of a patio area.  So my dad actually built a back porch onto the house and so it was a very, very--it was up on top of a hill.  You could look down and see the mountains in the back and see other families living down a little bit below, but it was a house on the hill--
Speaker 1: So this was like a scenic area in terms of the mountains and all that in--
Speaker 2: --Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --Lynchburg?  I've never been there.  Yeah, nice mountains?
Speaker 2: The city--Lynchburg is called the City of Seven Hills.  And it's seven hills, the James River comes through there.  You look off into the Blue Ridge Mountains from the city, just peaks of water, these really beautiful places, and you know very serene, very beautiful, a lot of history in the city.  It was a great city to grow up in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Probably, you know, in the fall, with the leaves falling, you could smell--I always associated the changing of the seasons, the leaves falling with different sports, like when the leaves fell, you could smell the, you know, the chill in the air, and just that smell of fall, you knew that the games were going to start down at City Stadium, and I'd be on the bus going from Heritage High School down to the games.  You could even hear the bands playing form City Stadium, you know, at half time, and that sound would come down; you could hear that.  Just kind of marked the passage of time every year when you heard these things or smelled these things, it was an indication of seasons changing.
Story_ID: 25236
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, how would you describe yourself as a little kid? You know-
Speaker 2: As a small child, I would describe myself as very inquisitive and very mischievous.  I remember creating an explosion in my mother's living room, because I had a chemistry set, and she had given me this chemistry set, again, before OSHA had rules on age appropriateness for, you know, chemistry sets.  And I remember mixing these two dissimilar chemicals together and creating this most fantastic explosion in her living room, and I also remember, you know, getting in trouble in school at times, like in elementary school, I remember Brandon Miller and I were scuffling; we turned a desk over, and our teacher, Mrs. Martin, grabbed us by the ear and took us to the principal's office where we had our paddling, you know that little paddle, and leaving school, going to my friend Butch's home, whose mother was a teacher also through this teacher network, heard that I had done something and I had a little hand in my development there and then got home and had, you know, the real deal, a hand in my development with my father.  This community was really, you know, tried to make sure that all these kids did the right thing.  And that, you know, everyone had a hand in your development in the community, because they wanted you to be the best that you can be.
Speaker 1: So this is a community where the teachers actually lived in the community--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --And the schools, I guess, when you were growing up.  You were born in '64 (1964).  So you started school around 1970, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, the schools in Lynchburg were still segregated, I guess, you would say--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --No, they weren't.  They were integrated by then?
Speaker 2: I went to an integrated school.  Perrymont Elementary, that was my first school that I went to.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Perrymont, P-E-R-R-Y-M-O-N-T.  Perrymont Elementary, and the school was exactly one mile from my house, on Perrymont Avenue, and we walked to school every day.  And it was, you know, a group of guys in the neighborhood would play basketball before going to school; we'd end up having to run to school to get to school on time, but it was definitely an integrated school.  And I remembered being pulled out of a class where, I guess, some of the top performing students were brought in to learn algebra in elementary school, because the teacher, you know, the principal actually taught the algebra class, and so they identified students that were doing well and wanted to help them advance even more, so we were pulled out into a special class; it was about ten of us, ten to twelve of us.  You know, where the teachers really took stock in making you the best that you could be, and if they saw promise, they would really try to amplify that with other instructions or other things.  Just like I say, coming home, everyone had a little hand in my development, because they wanted me to be the best that I could be, you know.  It wasn't that my parents were teachers, it was just, you know, you could do better than this.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was the racial makeup of Perrymont?
Speaker 2: I'd say, Perrymont, to get the--it's probably forty African Americans, sixty Caucasians, and there were students that were bussed into Perrymont.  So, it was--that makeup was made through bussing, and a lot of my friends who came from other areas in the city.  I remember one time we were in the bathroom kind of clowning around up on the rafters in the bathroom, and I remember a teacher saying to me, you know, why are you hanging with those students, the ones that were bussed in, as though that was a bad thing, and or "you're better than that".  That always stuck with me as though that, you know, these students that looked just like me, just because they came from another area that, you know, wasn't necessarily a middle class area, and you know, people taking care of their property and doing things that I could not associate or hang with them, just kind of made me upset so, there was discrimination in the school, I mean, I know that, it was more class discrimination than racial discrimination.
Story_ID: 25237
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I loved math and science.  From that, you know, early explosion in the living room to learning  about--there was a science teacher name Mr. Sutherland, who began to fill my curiosity with little projects and things, and at the school there was a creak at the bottom of the hill that we used to go down and look at frogs and look at all kinds of biodiversity in the woods and the creak, I think that was also a curiosity about life and how things work and live and there was foster through that experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were five years old when the moon landing took place?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Do you remember watching that on television or any of the excitement around then?
Speaker 2: That's funny.  I don't remember the details about the landing.  I knew that there were--something big had happened, you know, people were talking about things, but I don't recall sitting in front of the television watching Neal Armstrong set foot on the lunar surface, you know, one small step for man and one giant leap for mankind.  I don't remember those things, but I just--I do remember something happened.  And so, becoming an astronaut or thinking about becoming an astronaut was not something that I really thought about as a child, even though we lived not far from Hampton, Virginia, where the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]  Langley Research Center was and Langley Air Force Base, but I'd been there  before--I'd been in that area before; my parents had taken us down to Virginia Beach for  vacations in our camper, but I just don't recall ever making that connection with, you know, July, '69 (1969) to me being curious about being an astronaut.  But yeah, it was, yeah, I was five-years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I guess you know popular culture being a major influence on youth today, did the television or movies give you any interest in space exploration?
Speaker 2: I don't remember watching a lot of television as a child, because when I was growing up, I was very active, and so, either I was playing football, basketball, tennis or was working on my bicycle, I was out in those woods and the streams, I was always outside.  And so the television, as it is today for kids, they come home and they turn the television on, I was always--I wasn't home most of the time.  And so I was not influenced in that way the kids are today by the television.  It was more experiential, helping my dad, you know, tweak something on the camper or we had a group of kids in the neighborhood where some kids had to go home when the street lights came on, and so that was the, you know, some kids got to stay out a little bit longer, so it was, be outside as long as you could until the street lights were on.  And that's what I remember, those were my influences, really my local community of experiential learning through those types of things that I remember, and went to movies--went to movies every now and then, but that wasn't a really main part of, you know, media wasn't a big part of my life.  I remember having a red, I think, for my fourteenth birthday I got this little transistor radio that I would listen to, WJJS was the local R&B station, but that was kind of the only input; not a lot of television.  I loved photography as a child, I think my ninth or tenth birthday, my mother gave me a camera for my birthday--
Speaker 1: What kind did you get?
Speaker 2: --It was a Rangefinder, it's called a Petri.  It's a little red Petri camera, and I was fascinated by how you could, you know, click the shutter and create this image for light, and so I started developing pictures in my mother's basement.  There was another friend of mine, Greg Brewer and I would take pictures of kids during the day, develop them at night and then sell them to them the next day.  And there was a man that lived across the street by the name of Mr. Smith, who was a professional photographer, and he started helping me understand more about, you know, black and white photography.  He actually gave me a print dryer so I could buy this special paper and have this incredible high contrast paper and have this really nice shine; it's Ilford paper.  And so, I was learning all these techniques about photography and even to this day, I still love photography, and photographer, but it was those types of experiences that I spent more time on than, you know, video games or things that kids play now.  I was more, I would say experiential learning at that age.

Speaker 1: Now, back to the camping trips, how far did your family range from Lynchburg?
Speaker 2: I remember going up to New York into Niagra Falls, we went into Canada, going down to Disney World in Florida, the Smoky Mountains, probably as far as Kentucky, over going west and then Canada and probably Florida.  I think we drove down to the Keys, the Florida Keys, one or two times.  And that was the furthest south we went; Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, I think we went to Mississippi one time, but we never went out west--further out west to California or the Rockies or anything like that.  It was primarily east coast and a little bit into the Kentucky side.
Speaker 1: So typically, you'd go out, maybe, a couple of weeks?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Max maybe three weeks.  And have enough provisions to--maybe a week and a half of provisions so where you could go to a campsite that's really rural and still have everything you need to survive.  We didn't do much--we did hiking kind of radiating out from the campsite, but we didn't ever go and backpack into an area and live off your backpacks.
Speaker 1: What was the most surprising thing or the most memorable, I guess, occurrence or thing that you saw on the camping trips?
Speaker 2: I think there's a picture of my dad, myself and my sister sitting on a rail in the Smoky Mountains, and I remember at night just looking up into the sky the night sky and seeing how bright the stars were without the light pollution being in the city.  And, you know, again, I didn't think about myself going to space, or going up there, but it was just fascinating how many little pin pricks in the velvet there were.  And seeing the milky way or seeing just all this stuff, it's kind of hard to explain how did it get there, what's up there, how does it work, how are we connected.  All the "how" questions came from again these trips and these experiences looking up into the night sky, or travelling to the beach and seeing all the grains of sand and looking at the waves and tide of the ocean coming in which was, you know, dictated by the influences of the moon.  And so, seeing the moon rise off the horizon and the sun set on the other side, and seeing these kind of cosmic activities going on, but not being able to really explain them, was just again, field my curiosity about science and our planet and the connectiveness of people living and working in this environment.  So I think these grand vistas, these  spacial, grand spacial vistas really kind of set the bid in me from my curiosity standpoint, but also from a photographic standpoint of capturing the light and the color and the imagery of these beautiful, beautiful places.
Story_ID: 25239
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were an athlete in school.  How were your grades?
Speaker 2: I was an "A, B" student.  When I was in elementary school, as I mentioned, the principal grabbed a bunch of us and had this expectation that we would do well.  And we were doing well, but she just wanted to make sure that we kept doing well.  And I think it was the curiosity of things that drove my--me getting good grades more so than, you know, parents telling you, you need to get good grades; it was more internally driven than it was someone telling me this is what you have to do so that you can go to college and get into a good college and those types of things.  It was more--it was exciting to me, it was interesting to me.  And most of the subjects were interesting to me.  So kind of a "A-B", more, I guess As, more As leaning towards more As in the sciences and math, and Bs, you know, I got some Cs I'm sure at times, but you know the humanity side, the literature side, maybe Bs and so forth, but that was kind of my--the way that I gauged my interest in things was from more of that curiosity piece.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you go to a middle school, or junior high school?
Speaker 2: So Perrymont Elementary and then I went to Dunbar Middle School, where my mother had taught at one time, but I wasn't there when she taught there.  And then from there I went to Heritage High School.
Speaker 1: So you were already, as you were saying earlier, you were already playing organized football in middle school, I guess, when you were about twelve or thirteen--
Speaker 2: Elementary school.
Speaker 1: --Elentary school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started playing football when I was in fourth grade.  And then my true love--the sport that I loved the most was tennis.  My mother sent me to a summer tennis clinic to get me out of the house so that she could do other things.  I think when I was in seventh grade, and I just fell in love with tennis.  I've been playing that ever since I was a kid; I played in middle school, I played in high school and even had a scholarship to play in college, which I didn't choose that because I got a scholarship to play football also, so I went the football route, but tennis was the true love.  Individual sport, you know, the physics of hitting top spin and slice and watching the ball move through the air and drop or go up or, you know, this twist (unclear)serving, and having the ball hit and kick were all physics to me.  And it just fascinated me how you could do these different things with the ball and have it behave in a way you want or have it  slice and have it drop right over the net and watch the person just look dumbfounded.  So those were always again relating back to the interest and the physics and the science of the sport, was something that was always fascinating.
Story_ID: 25240
Speaker 1: Okay, so tennis, now this--well it seemed like--well, did they offer you more money to play, I mean, scholarship money, to play football than tennis?
Speaker 2: The tennis scholarship was, I think, out of Missouri somewhere; it was a very small school, out of Missouri, and the football scholarship was at the University of Richmond, which I knew the area, I knew Richmond; it was closer, I think.  Maybe I wanted to be closer to home, but--and you know, the tennis scholarship was more like a negotiation, you know, okay well, you may get this much.  I don't think we even went down that path that far before I said I would rather be local or closer and then know what I'm really getting into with the football piece.
Speaker 1: Now, high school football, from what I understand, you were a high school football star, right?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't a star.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.  I was a wide receiver on a school that had a running team, and so I didn't get a lot of balls thrown to me, and I remember my coach, Coach Knight(sp), I think sent my films, you know, I had some good games where I caught a few more passes, but he sent my films to Richmond, and I think to VMI, Virginia Military Institute, and they sent scouts to come a game, and I remembered Morgan Hought(sp), who was my position coach, wide receiver coach at Richmond, came and watched me drop a touchdown pass in the in-zone at a homecoming game, and started to walk out of the stadium when he heard the crowd screaming for the second time and saw me in the in-zone catch the ball.  And that one catch resulted in over $100,000 scholarship at the University of Richmond, because my coach believed in me, and you know, I dropped that first pass, went to the sidelines, thinking I was going to be benched, and my coach, Jimmy Green, looked me in the eyes and said "Leland, I believe in you, go out there and catch the ball."  Went to the huddle, everyone was looking at me like, "oh, come on you, I can't believe you're back in this huddle,' first of all, 'but that you're bringing back the play for you to catch the ball again?"  And second time lined up, fifty on the line, went down the sideline, stand home threw a perfect spiral into the end-zone, this time I focused, looked at it, caught it, we won the game.  One catch resulted in that scholarship.  And I think the coach said, "You didn't give up, you came from this adverse place."  It was a homecoming game.  All your friends were there from college, your family was there, people were there; you could have said, coach, no, I don't want to go back in, but you didn't, and again, that's a very--at the point in my life where I tell, you know young kids, we all fail at something.  That was a horrific failure for a high school senior at a homecoming game.  And it turned out to be positive because I didn't give up.  And so I think that's a good message for a lot of kids today that if you fail at something, sometimes stop and go in another direction.  But that was a big turning point in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So like your father, are you fast?
Speaker 2: Pretty fast, yes, 45-40, back in the day.
Speaker 1: Usually the prerequisite for being a wide receiver is to be fast, then you got to catch too--
Speaker 2: Then you got to catch the ball.
Speaker 1: --Catch the ball, right.  Being fast certainly helps.  So did you play basketball too in school?
Speaker 2: We played football, basketball and tennis in high school.  And so they would be coupled from--a lot of guys ran track to be faster for football, but I couldn't run indoor or outdoor track because of tennis and because of basketball.  I remember the track coach always trying to get me to come and just run a couple of events, but I said, no, I have to study also.  It was a balance between academics and getting those three sports in.
Story_ID: 25241
Speaker 1: So your academics in high school were strong?
Speaker 2: Yeah, A-B, A-B student.  I remember one professor, or one of my instructors, the physics instructor retired and went to work at another location so in the middle of the semester they needed to bring in someone fairly quickly and there was this one teacher who had just graduated from Harvard at, like seventeen, and he was our physics instructor.  So, I'm in a junior physics class, and he's teaching us calculus with physics.  He's teaching physics with calculus, but we didn't know calculus yet.  So he started teaching us calculus before we even took calculus in my senior year.  And so these were again little things that were building blocks that helped you see the connection between the physical world with, you know, physics and Newton's laws and so forth, laws of motion to the mathematical side, and I think that was a very important junior year, before I took calculus to see the relevance of what this math helps you do with the physical world.
Speaker 1: So this seventeen year old would have been, I imagine on the cutting edge of math--
Speaker 2: He was brilliant, he was brilliant, yeah he was a brilliant guy, but he had a way of explaining things, he had a way of really, you know, making it relevant, it wasn't abstract like a lot of teachers teach math, and that helped a lot with making the connections with the two.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  Now, what was his name?
Speaker 2: Mark Thomas.  And actually we're still--I still communicate with him on face book, even to this day.  He's out in Seattle, Washington, and he's a cyclist, does a lot of cycling, which I love cycling too.
Speaker 1: So, he must be some kind of phenom, or something, because he graduated from Harvard at seventeen?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a brilliant--I don't know actually what his profession is now, I just see all of his posts as being a cyclists.  I have to send him a message and ask him what he's doing now.  He was brilliant, brilliant, person.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very calm, you know, very reassured, even as, you know, we were probably the same age, because I was sixteen, seventeen in your junior, eighteen when you're a senior year, and he was our professor.  You know, he identified with us, he related to us.  We talked about college and what it was like in college and those types of things.  He gave us some life lessons besides just the physics classes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this was at Heritage High School?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in other activities in high school, I mean, did you run for class office or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I was junior league--what is it, the JC thing.  I was in a number of organizations.  I think I was class--I think I had an office, some type of office in high school. I was in the Latin Club, we did these Latin, you know, trips to Roanoke, Virginia.  We had these Latin conventions.  We'd go to conventions and speak in Latin, wear Togas and things like that.
Speaker 1: So you all were like, sort of a dying breed, because I mean Latin was cut back in high schools in the mid-60s (1960s), the late 60s (1960s)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --All over the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had French, Latin, German and Spanish in our high school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Latin, they started to cut it back and you can hardly find it in schools now.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But I know it was popular through the early sixties.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So you know Latin.  Did you find that learning Latin helped you later on with those scientific names?
Speaker 2: Scientific names were also just the roots of the words for English and for writing were so helpful in your SATs, you know, trying to figure out what the words really meant.  I think that was very helpful too, in furthering your education through the literary side, understanding the formulation of words and how they--what their definitions were even if you didn't know what it meant, you could kind of piece it together if the root was from Latin.
Story_ID: 25242
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did the football scholarship determine where you were going to go to school?
Speaker 2: It did, it did.  I had an offer from Richmond and one from Virginia Military Institute [VMI]; Lake Forest was interested, but I chose Richmond, because they came through in the end.  I could have gone to VMI or Richmond on a football scholarship, but I had intended to go to Virginia Tech in engineering, but when the scholarship came through, I thought well I can major in chemistry or physics or something like that and then go to graduate school for engineering if I wanted to do that, so those were my thoughts.  I had taken a summer introduction to engineering at Virginia Tech; it was a minority introduction to engineering, and that got me interested even more in science and engineering, so the financial part of it helping, my parents helping out going to another school, when I had a full ride.  And it also--I enjoyed football, not as much as tennis, but I enjoyed football and it was competitive and so that was my choice to go there.  My sister was also at the Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond also, so it was a way to be close to her too, I think, it's something I thought probably subconsciously.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now at the University of Richmond, you were like a, well not a star, you were honorable mentioned in football, as receiver?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  I think I was in Academic Hall America, as well as a honorable mentioned all American two seasons, I think, there, and the University of Richmond Hall of Fame, also.  I think I still have--I still think I have the record for a number of catches in a season or a number of touchdowns or something.  I think this one receiver was trying to clip side, or maybe he has, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: I read that you had like sixty five catches one year for almost a thousand yards, or something, your biggest year?
Speaker 2: Right, right. Yeah, that whole, going to college on a scholarship and playing football was--it was very, I don't know what the word is for it, but my freshman year we were 0 in 10; we didn't win one game; 0 in 10; three in eight; eight in five, and we went to the playoffs, and, you know, we did well, and that's what I think, the scouts, the college scouts saw the transformation from freshman to going to the playoffs and that what's brought them down to look at me, you know, for the NFL.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were studying--did you major in chemistry?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At Richmond, when I was--when I first went there, I had this experience, my summer before my senior year at Virginia Tech in engineering, and when I went to Richmond, they had the natural sciences; they didn't have engineering, so I thought, well maybe I can major in chemistry, and I knew that the University of Virginia had a program, chemist to chemical engineering, so I could do that, but also dabble in a lot of physics and math there too, so that kind of gave me a good foundation for then going into engineering later.  But I loved, you know, it was a great liberal arts degree I was able to do.  I was on the, I think, the Richmond College Senate; I was involved in the student activity; student body and also playing football.  The class sizes were small enough that you could do multiple things.  But also, my professor, my freshman year chemistry professor, had me do research for him as a freshman.  So I did research for all four years while playing football and taking a full load, and I think that helped me even more getting to, you know, thinking about how to be a research scientist, is the work that I did at NASA Langley [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].  Again, you know, I think of Mark Thomas being an influence in high school with physics; I think there's another teacher in high school, Cornelia Campbell, who was my chemistry teacher, who taught me some things that she might not have taught other students or saw my interests and then Dr. Myers, at the University of Richmond in chemistry, just helped me see a lot of things and give me opportunities that, you know, some others didn't have, especially other players that were, you know, trying to balance academics and athletics.  But I even had another level; I had a research experience, too.
Story_ID: 25243
Speaker 1: Now, what research project were you working on with Dr. Myer?
Speaker 2: He was looking at amine haloborine adducts(sp) that could be--these amine haloborine adducts(sp) were something called sterically(sp) hindered.  So if you look at just the geometry of how the molecules are shaped, these could be used as models for cancer-curing agents.  And so, I was trying to synthesize using different halogens; borine, chlorine, the halogens, to see if I could attach halogens to this amine haloboric--of this amine borine complex.  And so I would synthesize; I would do the reaction, then I would take that result and try to wait to see what the yield was, and then I would use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as different types of spectroscopy to see if we actually produced those types of re-agents, and I presented a paper with the American Chemical Society my senior year, and it was just again, one of these experiential things that a lot of people didn't  have the opportunity to do as a, you know, as a college student that's also playing football.  And that balance between the academics and the football was given to me with the coach that said your academics are primary.  And I said, coach, I'm going to have to miss a lot of practice because of my labs, and he said, well, you're here for academics first, and so I was still able to start as a wide receiver on the team and do the academics by missing practice; he held up his end of the bargain.  I think that was--at some schools you can't do that as an athlete and trying to do other things in the academic realm also.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds like you were very busy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a little busy.
Speaker 1: Football, research science, I mean you know, then serving on the student government, it sounds like you were extremely busy in college.  So you worked on research projects over the summer?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, from my senior year--well, from my freshman year, second semester freshman year, I started doing this research for Dr. Myers, and I continued until I graduated.  And the summers I stayed there to work out with the team, the players that stayed, and also I did research also during the summers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25244
Speaker 1: For the sake of history here, you graduated from high school in '82 (1982), right, started Richmond University, Richmond in the fall of '82 (1982)?
Speaker 2: The fall of '82 (1982), and then graduated in the spring of '86 (1986).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you were on the verge of graduating, what were your prospects?  I mean, I know you had like sports options, because you were drafted by Detroit Lions, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Had you anticipated that sort of thing, or were you looking forward to it, or what?
Speaker 2: I'd never anticipated getting a scholarship to go to college, more or less getting drafted to the NFL [National Football League].  It was, you know, again serendipity; one of these kind of things that just kind of transpired over the course of my college career.  I mean, I'd never would have imagined that playing on a team that went 0 and 10, my freshman year to three and eight, then we got better, and like I say when the scouts started coming to look at me, that's when I knew that--I didn't think I would be drafted, I didn't know; I just--I didn't really have that expectation.  And when it got closer to draft time, I started getting more letters and more interests and so Denver, Detroit, Dallas, they had all, you know, expressed an interest, whether it was draft or free agency, I think they were looking more as a free agent, to give me a shot as a free agent, but when the draft was taking place, I got a call from Detroit, and they would finally see where I would be because they were going to draft me in the eleventh round.  And so that night, it's like right before, I think it's like April time frame when the draft is, I get this call from the Detroit Lions saying we want to draft you to the NFL.  Do you want to play with Detroit?  I said yes sir.  And that was, you know, again, one of these unexpected things, but utilized it for what it's worth.  And then I remember going to--they had a minicamp after the draft.  So I went to the minicamp, I think it was May, and we had some scrimmages and different things, and then I came back home and graduated.  And then I went to another minicamp after graduation in Detroit, and then the full training camp.  But, you know, one of these things where a  small town kid, never thought, you know, you'd go to college and play football, more or less, get a chance to play with the big boys in NFL.
Story_ID: 25245
Speaker 1: I don't know, but I'm taking a chance here, but it seems like you are not the kind of guy that would be dancing in the in-zone and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: It wasn't a flamboyant dance, it was more of a--it was like more of a, I caught the ball dance, you know.  It wasn't any of that Cuba Gooding, Jr. thing, you know; doing all that and spinning on your head, it was just like throw the ball to the ref and run back to the sidelines. It wasn't that kind of dance. (laughing)
Speaker 1: So how was it?  So, you were drafted by Detroit, but you graduate.  Now, this is--this doesn't happen as often as we'd like it to that football players who are drafted actually graduate from college.  But you actually are drafted, go to a minicamp, come back and graduate, and you were able to then go on.  So what is that like?  This is an opportunity to find out what that's like.  After you are drafted, I know you want to succeed, so did you train all summer, or did your schedule change any because you were going to a pro-camp at the end of the summer?
Speaker 2: I remember going back home to Lynchburg, so, drafted, graduate, and then I think I was in Lynchburg training at the "Y", down at the YMCA.  And I remember, you know, we have this point of honor downtown where they have these, probably, two hundred stairs, and I remember running the stairs with a backpack on, and you know, summer heat, you're doing all this training.  My mother said I was eating like a horse.  I would come home, and she would cook a meatloaf for the family, I'd eat half of it; I'd eat half the potatoes.  But I remember just training, training, training and going to training camp.  I felt like I was in the best shape of my life, you know, because it was just-- this opportunity that, not many people get, and it was a fascinating process to come there and you see these, you know, these, like Leonard Thompson, was a wide receiver for the Lions, 13-year veteran; who had broken all kinds of records, and all these people that you hear about.  And granted, football wasn't my favorite sport, so I never really watched Monday night football and followed the sports, but you know, you would hear names and you would say, "oh, yeah, that's that guy whose really, really good" and pro-bowl and super bowl rings and all these things.  But I was in camp with these guys, and we were all very similar, I mean, some guys were a little bit faster, some guys a little bit bigger, but you all had the same skill set, or you wouldn't be there.  And I think the second week in training camp is when I pulled my hamstring muscle.  It was the same pull that I had when I was in tenth grade, running in the auditorium--running in the gym, and we were doing sprints, and my receiver coach in high school, coach Knight, when I called him and told him that I had pulled my  hamstring, he said, was it midway up your left hamstring?  I said, yes, how did you know?  He said because that's when you pulled up in tenth grade, one time when you were holding your muscle.  So there must have been a little damage or something and never pushed it to that limit and pulled it again.  But that was pretty much the end of my career.  It healed a little bit.  Dallas picked me up for the next season, they brought me down--
Story_ID: 25246
Speaker 1: Let's back up to Detroit for one second.  Was Barry Sanders there?
Speaker 2: --That was before Barry Sanders.
Speaker 1: Before Barry Sanders, okay.
Speaker 2: Chuck Long was the new number one draft choice quarter back, Jeff Chadwick, yeah, that was right before Barry Sanders.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's before they started the revitalization of the team in getting some of these other players in like Barry and other folks in.
Speaker 1: So you pulled your hamstring, so it never--so they dropped you?
Speaker 2: Right.  So, I got cut from Detroit, the final cut, which was, I think in the August time-frame.
Speaker 1: Now, did they pay you?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I know you're being paid.  When did they start paying you, after they draft you?
Speaker 2: They give you signing bonus; you negotiate with your agent a signing bonus, and then you go to training camp, and they give you so much money per week in training camp.  And then if you make the final, you know, (unclear) roster, that's when you get your salary that you negotiated.  So I got cut the final cut.  Dallas expressed the interest, so I went down to Dallas, and they--
Speaker 1: Did you have the same (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was--it was really quick.  So, I got cut on Tuesday, it was sometime in August.  I got cut on Tuesday.  I went from Detroit to Dallas.  Dallas had me come down just to see if I could still catch and run a little bit.  And I was out with Danny White, he was quarterback, throwing the balls to me, and then I--so I went Tuesday; went to Dallas on Wednesday and then I went to--came back home and then the Toronto Argonauts wanted try me out on the practice contract.  So Friday I was in Toronto practicing with the Argonauts, and my agent said, you know, go check that out, see what that's all about, and then when I--about two weeks later, I got a call from my agent, he said that Dallas wants to sign you for the 1987 season for the next season.  So I left Toronto, came back home, signed with Dallas as a free agent and then I had from, I think it was the end of September until minicamp, which was in March, time for me to go to Dallas.  And so I'm driving as a courier for my agent, and so, you know, didn't have anything else really to do, waiting to play ball, and I'm driving a package to the University of Richmond, and I bumped into a professor, Dr. Dominee, and he says to me, he said, "What are you doing?"  I said, "Well, I'm waiting to play football."  He said, "Well, why don't you go to the University of Virginia and talk to Glenn Stoner, a material science engineer."  You know you have a chemistry degree; I know that you've always had interest in engineering.  So maybe go take a look.  So I drive up there, talk to this professor, and he says, well, why don't you come work for me as a research scientist?  Well, you know I'm leaving to go to Dallas in March.  He said, well, yeah, you know, come on up, you can make more money than you're driving as a courier.  So I moved to Charlottesville, get an apartment for five months, and I'm working in the lab doing electric chemistry research, and then January comes around; so I got three months before I go to Dallas.  And I'm training with the football team at UVA [University of Virginia], and the professor, my professor says, why don't you start the material science masters program in engineering?  But why, I'm going to play football in three months.  He says, well we can work that out.  So I enroll in the university; I start taking material science engineering courses, math and material science and electrical chemistry.  And they--what they do is, when I leave in March, they video-taped the courses and sent them to me in Dallas.  So, I'm in Dallas, I'm catching footballs for America's team by day, but by night, I'm watching material science engineering video tapes.  And that was--I think that's the hardest thing I've ever done, because we work out, eight hours a day for Dallas.  And whether it's watching films, whether it's you know, strength conditioning, running, all of this other stuff, but at night I had to stay awake and watch these tapes and take my exams at the end of the semester.  So that was probably a very difficult time in my life.  Went out with the group one day, actually I was stretching and Danny White comes on the field, he wants to throw a little bit, and I said, well, Danny, I'm stretching and I'm coming off this previous hamstring, and I need to get really loose.  And so he says, okay, let's do this.  Why don't we run a ten-yard out, half speed, I just want to start, you know, throw it.  I said, okay.  So I line up, I see Tom Landry walking on the field.  I look at Danny, I see him looking at Tom.  He's trying to keep his job because there's some new guys that have come in that are, you know, competing for his spot.  And I can see this playing through in my mind.  He's going to do an audible on the line from a ten yard out to take it to the bar.  And being a rookie, you know, not wanting to disappoint the starting quarterback or, you know, the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys, I take it to the bar, kick it in, and I reinjure my hamstring again.  And that was pretty much the end of my football career.  But because I already set--this professor already had this vision that, you know, you're going to one day be a material science engineer, I just went back to UVA to finish my masters degree and go work in engineering. So-- And I just feel God has a way of getting you in the right positions at the right time. I was in this parking lot driving as a courier, bump into a professor who told me to go talk to a professor at UVA.  So the timing of that was just, it had to be perfect, you know.  And I think meeting people throughout my life, it's always been people leading me, telling me about opportunities that have been very fortuitous about my--you know for my career; same thing with becoming an astronaut.  I know, we'll get to that, but it's just all these little things.  I never thought about playing the NFL; never thought about--I thought about being an engineer, but not being a material science engineer, you know, because I didn't even know what material science was.  But the chemistry set me up for that, the physics, the math, so things have a way of happening--.
Story_ID: 25247
Speaker 1: We're going to backtrack a little bit and talk about music.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because you talked about your dad being a musician.  You also have some musical background, as well, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  You know my dad was always playing music in the home, and, you know, as a very--record musician; made money being a musician as well.  I was his side job to pay for my football cleats and my football uniform and the things that we wanted, he would work on the weekends playing gigs at country clubs and things; had a little trio, had a seven-piece band, and played drums and the trumpet and sang.  But, you know, during my childhood, I would carry his--set up his equipment and get everything ready so I could learn how to play the drums a little bit.  I took piano lessons, clarinet lessons, flute lessons.  Some of the band would, you know, teach me how to play sax and the flute; played violin in elementary school, but the piano was something that I always loved, just their percussive nature of those keys.  The only thing about it is it's not a percussive instrument, but it can be; you bang on the keys a little bit.  But I think, you know, that side out of the science side, the musical artistic side, the photography and the music have always blended to lead it into me to think about the creative aspects of the world around us and how that fits into being a complete person.  So I just think, you know, as we move forward with trying to get students inspired to be scientists and engineers, you can utilize things like music or sports to let them see that science is in everything we do.  You know, the notes that you play, the chromatic scale that you are going up and down is really, if you look at it in the digital realm, it's a series of sin and cosine waves, and they turn into being (unclear) transforms when you look at, you know, MP3 compressed files and these types of things, so I think, making that connection with music at a very early age, sitting there listening to these beats and these sounds from my father's band and his band members, to me, I see playing to them using this, you know, to help the future for the next generation of explorers understand what it means to be a scientist through experiential learning in all realms, whether it's sports, music or the, you know, other science and engineering.
Speaker 1: Now, we've interviewed other scientists that are musicians.  They're quite a surprising number of them, are musicians or artists and some other way they do--they paint on the side, they play the saxophone or drums, piano; we've had some of them even play for us.  The musician, Oscar Brown, Jr., discussed, physics; we interviewed him.  But there still seems to be a persistent common assumption that you either use one side of your brain or the other.  Do you have any thoughts on that?
Speaker 2: When I was in space for my first flight, I took up a CD by Quincy Jones.  And when I was in--I was getting interviewed by Tavis and Quincy in space, we're floating around; I was floating a CD around, and Quincy said something that was very impactful, he said that math and music are the only two true absolutes that use both the right and left side of the brain.  So if you know math, you really know music, and if you know music, you really know math.  But we tend to divide the two and say, you're going to either be good at this, or you're going to either be good at this.  And I think if we start to bridge the gap between the two, you will get more people looking at the math in music and the music in math, because they're really very similar in how you can use that to help kids understand some very complex things that they already learned through playing music or playing sports or understanding collisions, you know, this is just a kinetic hit of two balls bouncing off--two billiard balls bouncing off each other, the same thing as two helmets bouncing off each other; you know, the forces associated with that.  So, I think that's something that really needs to be talked about more as we educate our kids that you can do two things, because they are complimentary more so than, you know, discorded.
Story_ID: 25248
Speaker 1: Yep.  It's something you just said that reminded me of a commercial, we always see for the NFL where the two helmets bang into each other, and considering the recent recognition of brain damage, you know, we had the suicide of Junior Seau, suicide of Dave Duerson for similar reasons.  I think the autopsy on Seau showed an atrophine brain.  Did you have any thoughts about that when you were playing football about its effect on your mental process?
Speaker 2: I didn't.  I mean, you know, being a wide receiver, you're not, you know, you're not running in there and slamming heads together.  You're trying to avoid that because you're usually the one getting hit.  But I do remember a couple of times where I had led with my helmet and, you know, there were some guys that had concussions on the team, guys that were, you know, you can tell that they were having cognitive problems because of the, you know, those forces in your head, but I never felt that myself, but I did see some of the effects of that from so many other players.  And now it's just come to a really critical phase where, you know, you can't do that or you're going to have these types of altrocities and tragedies due to this constant force in your brain, you know, kind of a jello in your head moving around at these high rates, and it's just very, very dangerous.
Speaker 1: Have you ever thought that had you played football, you may never have been an engineer?
Speaker 2: Well I--I never--I try to not live life with regrets; I try to move forward.  I think everything that happens has happened so far has been the right for the right reason.  I thought, you know, what if I had made the Detroit Lions team, I could have--something else could have happened and I wouldn't have had this other opportunity to be a material scientist or maybe I would have been led in another direction, but I think the things that have happened in my past so far have been for me to be at this location right now where we are having this interview.  If it can help others see their paths to what they want to do with their lives.
Story_ID: 25249
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the University of Virginia, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Working on a masters degree in material science?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell us about that experience.  Who was your mentor there and how did you do?
Speaker 2: At the University of Virginia, I had a professor by the name of Courtney, Thomas Courtney, he was the Department Chair, and he was a huge football fan, so he was--I think he was very instrumental in me, you know, being able to do this, combined NFL [National Football League] graduate school thing and he was also--he loved racquet sports; we used to play handball and racquet ball and squash and just a very, again, relating the physical side with the physics, you know, was something that he did also.  So, he was a mentor, a friend, and it was really sad when he passed, about maybe five or six years ago; just a true champion for this whole experiential learning piece so you can learn from anything that you do.  So I really, really treasured his friendship and his guidance.  I came back from NFL and started my--I finished up my classes and my research, and I remember going to a career fair, and walking passed a NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] booth, I saw this woman behind the NASA booth, she--her name was Rosa Webster; I'll never forget this.  She's actually a good friend with another friend of mine, Woodrow Whitlow, I think you guys have interviewed, but she was behind this booth, the career fair was closing down, and she came from around the booth and grabbed my arm and said what's your name, I said Leland Melvin.  She said, well, I've been looking for you, and she said, well help me take these boxes to my car.  And so she's putting me to work, you know, while I'm really going to look at DuPont or Dial or some other company to go work for.  And you know, she talked about the things you could do at NASA; we could send you back for your PhD, you could do this, you could work in this area.  And so I think a week later, I had a job offer from NASA Langley Research Center.  And went down and looked at the types of opportunities you can have, and it just blew my mind; there's this campus and the research that was going on behind these fairly non-descript government buildings.  The hangars has its huge wind tunnel on there, models designing the latest flight dynamics for the 787 or the next, you know--the airplanes we have out right now where some of these were developed in some of these wind tunnels.  Some of the other research we're doing for aerospace vehicles.  So I think that was a very fortuitous moment; she was looking for me; I wasn't looking at NASA, but this African American woman, you know, she was a physicist, saw something in me or heard something and said we want you to come work at NASA, and that's--
Speaker 1: Now this little data housekeeping here, now you started graduate school in what year?
Speaker 2: --I started graduate school in 1987, so January of 1987, and went to Dallas in March of '87 (1987), and then left Dallas, I actually left minicamp when they cut me for the hamstring in the fall.  Then I went back to grad school in the fall, and then I think I finished in, let's see '87 (1987), '87, '88, '89 (1987, 1988, 1989), and then I started working before I had actually finished my masters, and so I finished writing my masters up and then
Speaker 1: came back and submitted it after I started working, I think, for NASA.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So your masters was 1989 or '90 (1990)?
Speaker 1: It's 2000.
Speaker 2: 2000?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you were working for NASA from what?
Speaker 1: Started in 1989.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: October, 1989.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Now, did Rosa Webster know you, I mean, did she--she knew you through Wildrow Whitlow?
Speaker 1: No.  It was just--I think she had been looking for students that, you know, could come and work at the University, I mean, at NASA.  And I think she had inquired about students who were graduating material science engineering, because Langley had a big materials group, and they saw me as, you know, potentially working there.  And so, she was recruiting for Langley and I was, you know, individual who was graduating and had a potential to come impact the research they were doing there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So it was just kind of, you know, I didn't know her by any means, but I think she went and talked to the Dean of Engineering and talked to some of the professors about candidates who were coming out and so, I've been looking for you.
Story_ID: 25250
Speaker 1: Now, before we leave the University of Virginia, what was your project for your masters degree.
Speaker 2: I was working in the electric chemistry group, and we were looking at building electrical chemical cells that could help you determine damage and composite structures; so a helicopter rotor blade that's been in salt water or sea water or it's ingested water if you want to understand it's damage state or if it's about to fail, we could use an electric chemical technique for doing that.  So that was some fairly basic research that was being funded by the Army.
Story_ID: 25251
Speaker 1: Okay.  NASA, now, I have a note here that you worked on the Fiber Optics Sensors Group of the Nondestructive Evaluation Science Branch, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, what is Nondestructive Evaluation?
Speaker 2: So, the branch that are working at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Langley looked at using different types of energy to assess damaged states in aerospace vehicles.  So if you have an airplane that has lab joints that are bonded together with adhesive and also have rivets going along the top of them, we had problems with rivets coming apart, and the only thing holding that wing together would be the adhesive below it.  So we would actually take, using Xray, using lasers, using different types of ultrasonics, using different types of energy and nondestructively or in a non-contacting way, we would put the energy in and then make measurements of what the subsurface damage was underneath that wing, or in the case of the space shuttle, how much is a tile damaged.  Is the tile about to dis-bond from the surface of the shuttle, you know, so you could use a technique that you wouldn't have destroy it none destructive to see how the damage state was subsurface.  And so whatever type of energy you could use to do that none contacting or none intrusively we could use, and then that would save time and money in having to repair things that necessarily didn't need to be prepared.  So I would take and use optical techniques for this but also use optical fibers that you could take a fiber and use it to interrogate a damaged state of a structure so the fiber could measure strain if you bond it to the surface of something.  As the fiber is pulled, the laser light that goes through it actually changes wave length at these seams called (unclear)or sensors, and that wave length change is proportional to the change in strain.  So if you have this vehicle wrapped with sensors and you see different strain states at different locations then you can detect that there's maybe a damaged area around this none uniformed strain state, and we also use them for measuring hydrogen, that we have vehicles that have hydrogen tanks, so you could sniff, use a sensor to sniff for hydrogen instead of having to--and actually be able to locate where that leak is, as well as temperature also.  So, multiple measurements, we call it, and out of a very lightweight installable bondable sensors.  So, my job was to develop the laboratory; we built an optical fiber drawn for making our own optical fiber.  And as we drew the fiber, we had a laser, an excellent laser that was actually etching the sensors into the glass before a coating cup that allowed it to coat it to make the fiber more durable.  And so these were high--pretty high-tech sensors that we were making.  And the day that we made our first sensor was the day that I got a phone call to come into the astronaut corp, so that was a very fortuitous day for me in a number of areas.
Story_ID: 25252
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is 1998 when you were called, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But before that, let's go back a little bit, you co-designed and monitored the construction of an optical NDE facility, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  That's for making the optical fibers.
Speaker 1: Where was that?
Speaker 2: That was at NASA Langley.
Speaker 1: NASA Langley.  Okay.  Now, the call to astronaut candidate training, well, tell us about that, was this just a phone call?
Speaker 2: What happens, the process is you--you apply to become an astronaut.  You fill out a standard government form.  And, you know, a lot of times people apply multiple times.  I had a friend who wanted to be an astronaut, Dr. John (unclear) Goki(sp), he worked there at Langley with me, and he said Leland, you'd be a great astronaut, so he handed me an application, and I looked at it, "okay, whatever".  I set it down, didn't fill it out, and that same year, that I didn't fill the application out, one of my co-workers, Charlie Camada(sp), who was a PhD scientist at Langley, we were working on a similar project, he got in. So I said to myself, well, wait a minute, if Charlie Camada(sp) could get in, I can get in.  So the next selection I applied and filled out the application; went down to Houston and went through a battery of medical tests and interviews and psychological testing, and that was in 1997, and then was selected in 1998.  So as we were making this optical fiber, I went to my office for a second, and this phone call came through from Johnson Space Center and I think they tried me two or three times, and the third time was the charm, and I picked the phone up, and they said, do you want to come work at Johnson Space Center to become an astronaut, and I said, yes, sir, and started celebrating a little bit.  They told me not to tell anyone  except your close family.  Tell them not to tell anyone because they want to send out a press release.  I think I told mostly everyone in that building.  But went back to the lab and we created this fiber and it was just a very, very fantastic day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were able to accomplish two things in one day.
Speaker 2: In one day, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, 1998 is--well, tell us about NASA astronaut candidate training, what do you have to do?
Speaker 2: So you come in as a specialist in an area, you're a research scientist, you do whatever, and they really want to make you a generalist and the, you know, and so if you're working on the space shuttle, you can build a flight deck and help the team get to space safely and land safely or whether you're working robotic arm or doing space walks, you know, extra vehicular activities (EVAs).  So you come into the core and you get some basic training, and land survival and water survival, in case you have to eject from your training jet over the land or water, you can take care of yourself.  Systems training in both the space station and the space shuttle, so all the different systems; you learn the electrical systems, the hydraulic systems, how to open the payload bay doors quickly so that you can have heat dissipation out of the payload bay.  My task, I think, when I started training, you know, I would either be doing robotics or EVAs as an emission specialist, because I'm not a pilot, even though they trained us how to fly the high performance jets; those would be one of the two things that I would be doing.  So after about two years of that basic training, basic classroom settings and learning how to fly the high performance 238 jets, you get a technical assignment in the office.  And so we have branches for space stations, for space shuttle, for the different systems and you get put into an assignment.  My assignment, my first assignment was to work in Russia with the engineers that were translating the code or translating the procedures from Russia to English, so I had to start learning Russia; I spent a lot of time, about two years over there, working with them to help us do this, but when I started that job, we were looking at having the first crew go to the International Space Station, which the crew members were Bill Shephard, Guric Exzinco(sp) and Survei Cricolov(sp).  So, now, my new job was to shadow them, work with them, help them get ready to go fly in space.   And so, for the year and a half, I was in and out of Russia, working with them to get them ready to go to the International Space Station as the first crew on board ISS.  And I remember watching them launching (unclear) stand, seeing them go up in a (unclear) rocket to the International Space Station; talking to them over Christmas from Michigan (unclear) up to the station, and it was just fantastic.  Pretty much after they launched, my job was pretty much complete, and it was time for me to start training for my advanced training.  So I came back to Houston and had a--it was time to start my EVA training, which is your training to do space walks.
Story_ID: 25253
Speaker 1: Let me just pause here for a second.  Let me go back to the Russian phase of this.  What year is this?
Speaker 2: So this is 1999 and 2000.  So we had about--so we came in the fall of '98 (1998) with the training; so about a year of training, and so starting maybe in the spring to summer of '99 (1999), we started going to Russia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is right after the fall of the Berlin Wall, basically, right?
Speaker 2: No, that's that was before that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was before that, I'm sorry.  What is Russia like?
Speaker 2: Russia, it was, you know, it was a very interesting place.  People, I think, in Russia from the past things that have happened in that country, you know, there wasn't a lot of trust of foreigners, and so, me coming in as an African American man, which they--a lot of people had never seen, you know, a black man before.  I had a lot of people staring at me; people very inquisitive, especially children.  Children would come up to you and say, "hi", and then run.  They just wanted you to speak to them in English.  And we were living on this formerly top secret military base where, you know, right now, the astronauts and cosmonauts train, but this was a place where our missles were aimed at this base, to take this base out, because they were our advisories and now we're working together to help build this international space station.  So you had hard-lined military people that probably did not want you there; you had people that were embracing you, there was kind of a mixed bag of emotions with people.  But we all knew we were trying to work together as one civilization to get this space station built and working as Russia and US and our other international partners.  I had a chance to travel a lot when I was, I mean, travel around the city in Moscow, you know, went places by myself, and there were times when people would chase me, you know, they would see me; there were skin heads there; there was a lot of different dynamics in that city.  But it's like any big city, you could be in New York City and have people chasing you versus in LA and someplace chasing you--
Speaker 1: You actually were chased by skin heads in Russia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was at this park, this open-air market, and I went back around the back, just walking around, you know, very curious and inquisitive, and the music started getting louder and it was more of a--it was kind of like the head-banger kind of music, it was playing, you could hear it, a lot of men drinking, saw the skin heads, and as I'm walking further, deeper into this area, you know, I'm starting--the hairs kind of jump on the back of your neck, you're saying something's not right here, and I turned around, and this guy throws a beer can at me, and these guys start running, and, you know, I'm granted that hamstring healed enough to let me kick that speed back in, because I was able to get back to front area where there were police officers and less of that element back there.  I know before I had got to Russia, there had been, I think, a marine or a guard--an embassy guard, who had been beaten up at that same place.
Speaker 1: A black African American?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And so it was--I found out about that after the fact.  So, you really had to be kind of careful where you went, but if you were kind of always looking, kind of be as careful as possible.  But that could  happen again, it could happen in any city with the wrong crowd, with the wrong people.  I didn't take that as a personal, saw it lit it is, it's just ignorant people that wanted to do bad things, which could be anywhere.  With the cosmonaut stand, worked over there, which is where we launched our soy use vehicles, and that's where we launched from; very interesting place.  I loved saffron over there; I loved to cook, so you get good saffron cheap there, but just very interesting dynamics of people that came from very different places from the space race in the cold war to working together to put this space station up in place.
Speaker 1: Now, were you impressed by the Russian science, the Russian focus on science?
Speaker 2: Brilliant scientists, brilliant engineers.  We would not have a lot of the resources like every engineer that Langley would have with their own computer, whereas in Russia everyone would necessarily--they probably shared a computer, but did a lot of things by hand, so just very brilliant, resilient people; a lot of bartering in the city.  I would see people bartering for coats and meats and different things.  So it was a very active community of people working together to get through hard, economic times or, you know, hard winters, or whatever, people really pulled together to help each other out.
Story_ID: 25254
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the space station was launched in 2000 and--
Speaker 2: The first crew went to the space station in 1999, 2000.  But the station--the first model of the station was launched in 1998, the year before that.  So when I got into the astronaut corp, I think that October of '98 (1998), we launched the first piece of the station, the BFTB, and then Zarya launched at least two modules were in space, and then we launched our--they automatically were docked and connected and then we launched the human beings up there to inhabit the space stations, to start the building process from that point on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's been the result of having the space station?
Speaker 2: Space station, you know, when I think about all the technological benefits of putting this laboratory in space, I think some of those advances pale in comparison to we're having people, that used to fight against each other working as one team, and I think of my first flight into space, I'm sitting there working with German and Russian astronauts, people that, you know, we used to fight against them, and be hostile to them, and now we're working together as one team.  I mean, we had African American, Asian American, French, German, Russian, the first female commander on the space station, working in harmony as one, and we were--and my job was to install the Columbus laboratory that's doing--medical science is looking at, you know, material science, all these different types of things that can help us here on the planet.  And on both of my flights, I did some research with activating e coli bacteria that students of Texas Southern University took those samples when we got back home and are actively doing research, comparing samples on the ground and samples in space, and I'm looking forward to getting back and finding out what has resulted from that research when I talk to some of those students or students that have graduated and doing research on space-type technology and activation.  So, this is something I think is very important to help people see what the future is of people coming together in helping see the benefits for humankind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you came back in 2000, right?
Speaker 2: So, I had two flights.  One was in 19--2008, I'm sorry.  I flew in 2008 and 2009.  Or you're saying came back from Russia?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I came back from Russia in 2000, and that's when I started my training and had this very severe accident.  I was training, going down into the water column in this suit, and realized that I didn't have my valsalva pad, this is a little device that lets you clear your ears.  You press your nose against it to clear, but you can't put your hands in your helmet.  And I came to find out that that pad was not in my helmet. And so as I went down in the water column, and I'm the kind of person who needs to squeeze my nose to clear or do something to clear.  That wasn't in the helmet, and so as I went down, I was trying to clear, but didn't, didn't, I could not clear.  So, long story short, went down, they brought me up a little bit, went down, I told the test director to turn the volume up in the head set, and when he did that, there was--I heard static in one ear and noise in another ear, it was just kind of noisy, so they ended the test, they brought me out, and come to find out, I had lost all my hearing.  This ear, there was blood coming out, the flight surgeon was talking to me, and I thought he was playing with me, because he was--I thought he was just moving his lips, but I could really not hear.  And so, you know, I've been training, I've been working to get a space flight, and now I am totally deaf.  If you back up three days before that accident, I had an event.  I had one of these things where someone shares something with you and you don't know why they're sharing it, but they are led to share, and my parents were having a 35th wedding anniversary in Lynchburg.  I flung back home, I'm sitting in a car with my cousin and a friend of hers, the friend's name is Jeanette.  She's a minister, she's ver--I mean, she's got like this direct connection, and she starts talking to me, and she says, Leland, I don't know you, but I want to share something with you.  She says that something's going to happen to you.  No one's going to know why it happened; you will be healed of this, you will fly in space, and this will be your testimony to the world.  So she told me this on Saturday.  My parents had this ceremony on Sunday.  I flew back to Houston on Monday, and on Tuesday, at 9:28 a.m., I went deaf.
Story_ID: 25255
Speaker 1: Now, this sounds, you know, like the twilight zone.  Did this, Jeanette, did she make a living--
Speaker 2: She's a minister.
Speaker 1: --She's a minister.
Speaker 2: And from North Carolina, she's in the area that my father grew up in, near Roseboro.
Speaker 1: Is she known for making these kind of observations?
Speaker 2: That was the first time I met her, and I haven't really followed up with her since then.  I probably should give her a phone call, and tell her--I mean she knows that I've flown to space and all these things, but we haven't communicated since then.  But you know, she told me this and then went to the training, lost my hearing, blood coming out of my ear, world renowned surgeons, you know, looking at my case from Israel, from all over the world, exploratory surgery, they went in to look around to see, you know, if something had happened, something called a perilymph fistula, where your inner ear can get over pressurized and cause fluid to come out and everything was intact.  So they didn't really--the only way they could find out what happened to me is to do an autopsy, and I said no, we're not going to do that.  I've got a few more good years in me.  But I remember post-op in the hospital, you know, sitting there wondering, what am I going to do with my life now.  And a friend of mine, who was at the service for my parents and had heard what Janet had said, she wrote, you know, I couldn't hear anything, she wrote on a piece of paper, you will be healed of this, you will fly in space, and this will be your testimony to the world.  So I remembered that, but at the same time, you know, you're doubting yourself, you're wondering how could I ever get through this.  Not only that but what flight surgeon could ever medically qualify you or bring you back upon flight status, when they don't know exactly what happened to you.  And so that was something that I had to get through, you know.  My hearing started slowly coming back; I had lots of loss in this ear, you know, I used to have perfect hearing; high frequency, I could hear everything and lost some of the high frequency and things.  But during this time when the surgeons had me medically disqualified, you know, I was working at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] JFC, and I was asked if I wanted to do something in education, because we were standing up this new program called the Educator Astronaut Program here at NASA headquarters to take teachers and make them astronauts, like Christa Mcauliffe and Barbara Morgan.  And so, they wanted an astronaut and educator to marry and to promote this program throughout the nation.  And so, because I was not medically qualified to fly, they said "Leland, you know, your parents were educators, you were very passionate about education, why don't you go work at headquarters with this education job?"  So I started doing that in 2000--in 2002, December of 2002, and we kicked off the program; we started going around the country talking to teachers and students about nominating their teachers, and then this, you know, fateful day of the Columbia accident happened.  I was driving from here going to Lynchburg to see my parents, and I got a phone call from my boss, at the time, saying, "Leland, something has happened.  The countdown clock at Johnson Space Center, I mean, at Kennedy Space Center is now counting up."  And I said, "Well, how much is it counting up?"  But I knew something had happened really bad.  So, I drove back to Washington, and I went to the--we have a control center upstairs--I went to the control center, and one of the things we do as astronauts, we take care of the families of fallen heroes.  And so I drove out to David Brown, who is one of the mission specialist on the flight, went to his home.  And this is another one of those transformative moments, for me because, you know, I'm coming there to console his parents, but his father says to me, with tears in his eyes, "My son is gone.  There's nothing you can do to bring him back, but the biggest tragedy would be if we don't continue to fly in space and carry on their legacy."  And so, I didn't know if I was going to ever fly in space, but I had to do everything to honor his parents, and honor the crew by, you know, by helping carry that legacy on.  So we kicked the program back up to bring teachers in.  We were flying around the country, going to the different memorial services for the crew members, and that's when the lead flight surgeon was taken notes, I saw him taking notes, looking at me, and he saw me clearing my ears, you know, and he said later, I don't see why you can't fly in space.  There's no reason why you can't fly in space.  So he wrote a waiver, while I was here, to take back to Houston to say Leland is medically qualified to fly in space.  So, if I had never come up here for this job, if Columbia hadn't happened, all these things happened to get me back in flight status to kind of, you know, carry on this prophecy from Janet, who said you will fly in space, and this will be your testimony to the world.  And so, went back to Houston with the flight status, and that was 2003, working robotics, homing my skills in robotics, since I wouldn't be able to do any space walks, and ended up getting assigned to STS 122, I think it was in 2006, yeah, the late 2005 or 2006, to train to fly in space in 2008.  I tell that story because we sometimes never know what's going to happen in our lives that will lead us to something that we can help others by sharing our story.
Story_ID: 25256
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you came back in to flight status in 2003 and trained for three more years--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --Go into space in 2006--
Speaker 2: 2008--
Speaker 1: --2008.
Speaker 2: --And 2009.
Speaker 1: So that's five years of training.  Now, what is some of that training consist of--what does it consist of?
Speaker 2: As you do a combination of things.  You have to have proficiency in the simulators for getting to space and the shuttle.  So my path to space would be through the space shuttle, learning the different electrical systems, hydrolic systems, open the payload bay doors, all the things that you need to do to get to space safely and turn the shuttle into a--into your home, into a research vehicle and docked to the space station, transferring items to the space station, from the space station back; so systems-type training, robotics training and EVA training.  So, since I had the accent, I wouldn't be able to do any space walks, because that would have put me back in the pool and put me potentially at harms way, you know, due to the hearing thing.  But I became a robotics' expert, and I was in the robotics' branch helping other crews train for their flights.  Because when you're not flying in space, your job is to help other crew members train and fly in space; so checking procedures, robotics procedures for other missions that were currently going on.  You know, after the Columbia accident, we had to put some protocols in space for scanning the leading edges and the wings and the underbelly, all the tiles to look for damage when we got to space and before coming home, so helping with those procedures for insuring safe re-entry of the orbiter, looking for damage with these robotic techniques.
Speaker 1: Just to go back and challenge you for a minute, that tile came loose, right, and caused the craft to overheat, is that correct?
Speaker 2: So, on Columbia, we had a piece of foam that came off the external tank on assent, and that piece of foam, about this size, hit one of the leading edges of the wing, and broke a hole in it.  And so, because we didn't have these inspection techniques, you know, there was this hole sitting there.  In space it's fine, but once you re-enter into the atmosphere, you're building up a plasma of about 3000 degrees fahrenheit.  And so that plasma went into the wing, melted the substructure and ended up causing the vehicle to spin out of control.  And that's why we now we--well, when the shuttle program was still in existence, we would scan all those areas of the shuttle to make sure that we didn't have any damage, whether it was micrometer or debris, or whether it was a piece of foam falling off.  And we also have a number of assets looking at the tank, looking at the launch to see if anything is coming off, or falling off from satellites too, you know, high range via cameras and so forth, and even chase aircraft, and actually take a look and see what's happening.
Story_ID: 25257
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, describe the mission in 2008, what were you to do in space and the steps approaching?
Speaker 2: My first mission, I was in charge of all the robotics activities and the transfer activities.  So, I was the lead robotic operator for the, both the arm on the space shuttle and the arm on the space station.  Our job was to install the Europeans Columbus laboratory, it's a ESA(sp) laboratory for different material science in biological sciences and other things.  I was to grab the--basically grab--use the arm and grab the Columbus module out of the payload bay and attach to the station, and all of our German flight controllers, all of our German friends and European friends had been waiting ten years for this to happen.  And so, I remember coming out of a meeting, and one of our, you know, they were celebrating me, you know, are you going to help install our module to get us up on space station.  I remember one German flight controller, as I was about to walk out of the room, he said, "Leland, you know, congratulations, high five, we've been waiting ten years, don't' screw it up."  And so, no pressure when you're seeing this vehicle getting, you know, this model getting docked to the space station, you're thinking about messing something up, screwing something, but you know, the training kicked in, and it was aligned perfectly, and you know, I can go back to that German flight controller today and say, "I didn't screw it up; you still have your job, things are going well."  But, a great sense of accomplishment; that was early in the mission.  The rest of the mission was supporting some space walks, attaching--doing different things on the module, itself.  And so, that was primarily my role for 2008.  And then in 2009--
Speaker 1: What would have happened had you screwed that up and the modules didn't connect the first time?  I mean, was there a second chance, like in the in-zone, you know, to catch--
Speaker 2: Well, it depends on how bad you screw up.  I mean, if your bringing--you have this seal around the module that if you damage the seal when you're trying to birth this module, you would make the whole vehicle inoperable, because if you were to damage that, and you do a leak check on it, and if it's leaking, leaking air, then that's pretty much an appendage that's sitting there, it's trash, it's no good, because it can't hold a seal and would compromise the rest of the space station.  So a very slight misalignment or scraping of that seal could have rendered it useless.  And a multi-billion dollar element, peoples' livelihood, their jobs, at these control centers monitoring the Columbus module, I wouldn't have been a--
Speaker 1: --Popular--
Speaker 2: --A popular guy in Europe or even in the U.S. if I had done that.  But again, the training is very good, and had the confidence, even though it's my first time flying the robotic arm, and I had other people that had done that behind me, saying you're doing great, you know, pull this in here; it was fantastic.
Speaker 1: So, the very idea that you have that assignment, you know, speaks to the confidence of a whole lot of people in you, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  I demonstrated that in the training and then working in the robotics branch, also.  I think they saw the skill set that I brought to the table. It was evident that I could do the job.  But you never know, on a simulator getting to the actual space environment and nerves and so forth, and I think, you know, me being selected into the corp, because I didn't have a lot of operational skills, I never did a lot of flying of air planes, where you have to be exact or your die, or diving or doing mountain climbing, those are some of the skill sets that we looked at for new people coming in, but I think they saw the operational bent of the professional athlete or training and working as a team member was, you know, some confidence to say that you can work in this high stress environment and do a job without, you know, getting rattled or kind of freaked about doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, just for the record, in 2008, you were a missions specialist on board the STS-122 Atlantis, that February of 7th through the 20th, 2008?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you went back after 2009--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --It was on the same shuttle?
Speaker 2: Same orbiter.  I guess I only fly Atlantis, right?  I was assigned in I think it was July of 2008 for the next mission, and it was a pretty incredible mission.  We had the--my job here was to install spare parts; so again, in charge of robotics and transfer.  But also, I was going to be flying around on the end of the arm, another African American astronaut, Dr. Bobby Satcher, who was to do the first orthopedic surgeon to operate on the robotic arm in space.  And so it was the first time that two African American men were in space at the same time.  And I remember Tom Joyner interviewing us in space; he was calling us the afronauts.  And his show has a million person listernership, and there were kids all around the country and people listening, you know, seeing this first, two African American men in space and even to this day, you know, moms seek me out to tell me, "I heard that interview, my son wants to be an astronaut and he's studying physics and science now".  So the impact of that mission had on our young African American male men as to seeing some of those like them in that environment, floating and working in space, that they could also do it one day too.
Speaker 1: That's great.  Now, this launch was in 2009?  What month was this?
Speaker 2: This was in November of 2009.  So I spent Thanksgiving in space, eating a rehydrated turkey.  And very thankful for the people that were there; thankful for the people that were on the ground in Mission (unclear), spending their thanksgivings monitoring our mission and thankful to our families, you know, who helped us do all that.
Speaker 1: Now, was there anything--did anything go wrong on this mission?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had--on ascent to space station, there was a medical situation that happened.  Actually, on the first mission, there was a--something that happened medically, and I was the crew medical officer, because we didn't have a trained physician on the flight.  I volunteered to be the crew medical officer.  So, I went through some training, emergency room training and some other different training and actually had to do some things on that mission to help some of our crew mates, but it was very empowering to know that we had to do this, because it was during the docking phase; we had to get this done, or the mission would not be successful; we'd have to come home.  And so that was something I felt really comfortable, really good about helping save that mission like that.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us exactly what happened?
Speaker 2: No, I can't tell.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I thought so, or else you would have told us.  When you think back on these missions--well, there was a second crisis, you said in 2009, a medical--
Speaker 2: No, there wasn't.  That was 2008. Okay.
Story_ID: 25258
Speaker 1: What does it look like in space?  How big is the shuttle, how many people were up there with you?
Speaker 2: On the shuttle we had six people in the shuttle on the second mission, and you know, you have the flight deck that you--you know, you have four seats, you take two down, you have more space, more volume to get around in.  On the mid deck is where we sleep and where we have our galley, so the seats that were there, you collapse them down, and you put a--actually there's a stationary bike that you put in the middle of the mid-deck, but when you think about the living space, which you have on the ground, I guess, transforming into space, because you can use now all the corners and all the places that you would not use in a 1-G environment, and so, it was quite spacious when you started looking at these other pieces.  When you're docked to the International Space Station, now you have even more volume, you have these multiple modules about the size of a 1500 to 1700 square foot house of volume that you can utilize, and looking out the window, seeing the planet from that vantage point at 240 miles, about the distance from Washington, D.C. to New York City, you're travelling at 17,500 miles per hour looking at the sun rise and the sun set every forty five minutes, and you see this sun setting in this thin blue layer of atmosphere that keep us alive, and you realize how precious that little atmosphere is because it's very, very thin when you look at it from that scale.  And you think about people on the planet, driving cars and using hair spray and all of these environmental affects that are putting holes in this environment, it's very tenuous as it is.  You see the beauty of the colors of the water, the ocean, the caribbean and you almost have to come up with new definitions for the color of blue or expand the colors of blue, because it's just so many different hues from turquoise to azure to indigo, it's so visually stunning and then to have that contrast of the oceans and then, you know, ten minutes later you're on another continent, and you're looking at the alps or the snow-capped mountains, or you're in Hawaii.  And so, visually, as a photographer, I was--I had a camera in my hand all the time, trying to shoot pictures of this planet because it's just so stunningly beautiful.  And it just changes you in that way of the beauty of our planet and that you see no borders.  You think of these, you know, societal manmade divisions and lines, but from that vantage point, you don't see that, you just see one beautiful planet.  And having flown in space with people from all around the planet and working together as one team, it lets you know how precious it is to have to work together as a team to help advance our civilization.  Those are some of the thoughts that I have looking back at the planet, looking out into the deepness of space like I did when I was a kid in the smoky mountains, making that now connection with the rest of the solar system and distant exoplanets and now using the hubble telescope, using the James Webb Space Telescope one day to see further out to put humans maybe on another planet one day on the Martian surface, like where, you know, have our emissary there and curiosity looking around for signs of past life right now, but what will we need to do to help civilization advance ourselves to maybe move off of the planet.  I was looking at a trailor for Will Smith's new movie called "After Earth" when the earth is--it's coming out in June, but when the earth eventually will be no longer habitable.  What do we do at that point, how do we keep the existence of humankind moving forward with technology, with exploration, with you know, trying to get to another planet.  I think those are some of the things that I thought about as I travelled at that very, very fast speed, going around our planet.

Speaker 1: Now, is it tougher ascending or descending?
Speaker 2: The ascent you pull about 3-Gs of your body, so you're feeling 3-Gs through your chest, three times your weight coming through your chest.  You're kind of laboring to breathe a little bit, you know, it's kind of hard to breathe after--take big gasps like that to breathe, but that's only for eight and a half minutes.  After that eight and half minute ride, you're now floating weightless.  Two and a half minutes--I mean, so then coming home, it takes you about an hour to get home once you do the deorbit burn, and the ride is now in this projector, so you're feeling gravity pulling down on you this way, so as you're trying to flip switches and look at writing your book, now your arms feel really heavy, and so it's--I'd say ascent is, I guess, flying the first time and going ascent is tougher because you sometimes don't know what to expect.  You know, you've heard people tell you about the ride, but until you experience it, it's kind of tough, because the simulators using those cetrifuges to give you that feeling through your chest of 3-Gs, but it's nothing like the ride when you have to actually do your job and monitor systems and things, and the excitement of, you know, you're launching and flying in space; but I think, probably, ascent, the first time, because entry, it gets warm, it's two and half Gs, but I think you've already felt what it's like to work in that environment, and you're kind of acclimated to the environment and the suit also.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Descent, I think I read where you said your body feels like it weighs as much as ten times as it does--
Speaker 2: No, it's about two and a half times.
Speaker 1: --Two and a half times?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, two and a half times.  You're pulling about two and a half Gs as you're coming in, but your arms--your arms feel really heavy, because you haven't been--if you haven't really been exercising on a short duration flight, the commander or the pilot they do--it's resistive exercise.  I would do--I would get on the cycle (unclear) and cycle for a little while for cardio vascular conditioning and then do some, like these rubber bands, and so some exercise with these rubber bands, make sure--your muscles have, you know, atrophied a little bit due to the deconditioning for not having to use them as much in that weightless environment, and so coming home, you feel really heavy, really sluggish, as you're starting to come back because of the atrophy.
Speaker 1: Are there any after-effects from space travel when you're back?
Speaker 2: For the long duration, space flight members, I know that there've been stories of, you know, people coming home, and they'll put food on their plate and then they'll release the plate and turn to do something else, and think the plate's going to sit there, and it crashes to the floor.  For me your vestibular system gets a little out of whack, because when you get to space, your vestibular system is not working properly because the little rocks in your inner ear are now floating all over the place.  So, your brain rejects all that data and just uses the visual cues to give you a sense of your orientation.  When you come back on ground, now those systems are working properly, vestibularly, but your brain is trying to figure out, well, do I use it or do I not use it, so you're trying to balance what you see and actually what your brain is telling you're feeling with your inner ear, and so it takes you a little while, I think, roughly about a week or a week and a half to really feel like you're stable.  My first flight, I would look at the horizon to help re-gauge my, what I call re-gauging my gyros or re-centering my gyros in my vestibular system; that helped a lot, but you don't want to make sharp turns because you will fall over, and you don't want to drive.  They won't let you drive in the first few weeks or so, because they're making sure that you're not going to fall over or pass out, you know, there are issues with, you know, your heart hasn't had to work as hard in space, and so now you're having to pump more blood, you know, blood has pulled out of your head, so you want to make sure that the blood is in the right orientation of your body so that you can function properly.  But some people have passed out when they've come back from space, just due to the blood pressure being different from not having to pump as much--pump as hard through the heart through the space environment because there's no gravity pulling that muscle down.

Speaker 1: You had primarily educators with you when you went up--
Speaker 2: Went to space?
Speaker 1: --both times, yeah?
Speaker 2: No.  On both my flights I had--we had the commander was a navy--a navy pilot and the--well, the pilot and commander were both navy pilots and then we had two--Hans was a research, he was in the army but also he did some research and then Leo Iharts was a French military pilot and then--there were six of us.  And then on the second flight, we had a medical doctor, Bobby Satcher, and then the rest were military pilots.  So, there were no educators on the flights.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So no teachers or any civilians?
Speaker 2: All right, Barbara Morgan was the first educator astronaut who flew, and then we had three other educator astronauts, Johnny (unclear) Linnenburger(sp), Ricky Arnold and Joe Acaba, who just came back from space from a long duration space flight for six months as a, you know, he was a former teacher, but now full up astronaut, so those were the people that we selected in 2003, who've all now flown and done missions and pretty successful.  So that was very, very great moment for me to know that this program that we put in place resulted in, you know, these three former school teachers now taking the class from space back in the classrooms around the country and letting teachers know that they can do this also.  It was very rewarding for me.

Speaker 1: I know every time we go in space we learn something new.  What were some of the things you learned in 2008 and 2009, when you actually went up into space?
Speaker 2: I think, as a shuttle astronaut, one of the things that, you know, we're on a very short timeframe to get a lot of things done.  And most of those things that we're getting done are building the space station.  So the first flight, the big task, the number one priority task was to install the Columbus laboratory and then from that point on it was transferring items back and forth.  The long-duration crew members were the ones actually doing a lot of the research.  So we were getting things in their hands and getting them ready to be outfitted to do some of the technological and scientific research looking from front, looking at how flames operate in microgravity to help us develop better sensors on the ground and ways of putting out fires on the ground to looking at single crystal growth for making pure materials and pure medicine for the pharmaceutical industries.  You know we had an exposure facility on the first flight that looks at different materials and how atomic oxygen can actually affect the material.  So if we're going to go to Mars or go further out, how will these materials, these space materials, be affected by that atmosphere, by that environment?  With radiation environment we were (unclear) simulators to see what the radiation levels are on our bodies, and so if you're going to do a three-year flight tomorrow, what types of measures or precautions do you need to insure that you're not exceeding the radiation levels in your body.  How do you build a vehicle that shields you from these things, or can you actually rad hard your body.  What are the countermeasures that your body needs, so we did a lot of things like measuring; we measured the vision, we measure how the blood changes, how some of the other--perhaps some medical things change in a person's body for these short duration and long duration of flights so that we can insure that long duration space flight, even longer than what we do now will be--we can do that with human beings without adverse affects to the bodies.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in 2010, you were named the associate administrator for the office of education here at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Adminisrtration], right?  Now, have you considered--did you ever have any thoughts about going back into space, or is this your--
Speaker 2: So, after my last flight, we didn't have many shuttle flights after that because retirement of the shuttle and so I knew with two flights and with a lot of other people that needed to fly, I probably would not be flying again on a shuttle flight.  And with my hearing loss from my accident, I wouldn't be medically qualified to fly long duration space flight because usually you need to do space walks when you do that, and that would put me back in the pool and potentially damage my ears because they didn't know exactly what caused that.  So I knew that my flying days were pretty much over, but I wanted to stay in the agency and work in the agency, and what better place to use the experiences that I've had than in education.  So, in 2010, beginning of 2010, I came to Washington to help with a program called the Summer (unclear).  We're trying to get hands-on experiential activities into the summer space for kids to do things like building rockets and stock rockets and different things so they could see themselves as scientists and engineers and use this as a way to excite them and motivate them and inspire them.  So in that summer or later during this time, the position for the associate administrative education came open, and some people said that maybe you should apply for that job.  I said well, I'm not an educator, they said well, you don't necessarily need to be, you need to be a leader, you need to be inspirational and use the things that you have to bring groups together to help inspire and motivate kids and to do education.  And so I applied for the job October of '10 (2010); I got the job.  And since then I've been on a crusade to help our kids see that they can do or be anything they put their mind to, especially with our administration's goals of having a more economically viable society, a more STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics] , literate, society; science, technology, engineering and mathematics, that I can use those experiences and those relationships that I've had to help work these things through NASA, but also other federal agencies that do STEM.  I'm on a task force called the co-STEM to look to see how we can better leverage the resources of the federal agencies to inspire and motivate and bring more students into STEM fields, like what I do and what scientists I know or National Institute of Health or NSF [National Science Foundation] do.  So, it's really an effort to combine our leverage resources, and even expertise.  I mean we have some of the world renowned scientists here at NASA that are Nobel Laureates that can share their expertise with our society.  And I think about the things like, we got iPhones and droids and this technology that is helping the economy, but I tell students, I say, look, why not just be a user of the technology, but be a creator of the technology, be inquisitive; take your chemistry set and create this explosion, not get in trouble for it, do it in a controlled way, but to unlock your curiosity so that you can be a science or engineer one day that will maybe cure aides or cure cancer or help our society in building something that will form a habitat on Mars.  Where all people to go off planet in case an asteroid comes and hits our planet and renders this back to the ice age, through the process of heat; stuff goes up and blocks out the sun and creates an ice age again, we need to figure out how we would keep our civilization going if something like that happened.
Story_ID: 25263
Speaker 1: --Okay.  I'm intrigued by the story you told about the Tom Joyner show, about you and Dr. Satcher in space.  When you're up in space; two black men in space for the first time, and you talk about the tremendous reaction you get from people down here who heard that show, and saw you in the news, in space, what are--from this vantage point, from the loftiest vantage point of all, like in space looking at earth, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I think one of the biggest concerns that I have about the African American community is that we empower our kids to do anything that they can put their mind to, so if they see a Dr. Satcher doing operation on a robotic arm in space, they can actually make the connection from where they are now in school; so let's say they're in middle school, what is the path that it takes to get to that, if that's what you want to do.  And we sometimes handicap our kids by telling them that, well, I wasn't any good in math, and you probably won't be either.  We handicap them by telling them what we can't do versus what we can do.  So insuring that all are on that path from whatever age you are helping identify people that have done that and letting parents even see that these things are happening.  To share that history, like what we're now is oral history, is letting people see these paths of people and then, you may not have the same path, but you can take pieces of that path and then allow it to be molded into your child's path, or just to give them those experiences.  We have such a--we're glued to the television and to media and to see the things that are very temporal in the lives right now.  We're looking at the Honey Boo-boos and these reality TV shows, we need to look past just the present situational reactions of what someone's doing to how do we take a child and say, if this is where you want to end up, show them the end point, these are the steps that you have to take to get there; if you want to be over here, these are the steps, and give the kids the tools to allow them to see these things.  So instead of a $200 pair of sneakers, maybe get them an Ipad and put some math games and some writing games and some things that will help them understand how to get some 24th century skills that can help them get a job.  And I think we sometimes, we focus on, sometimes the wrong thing but we don't--and maybe it's not the wrong thing, maybe we're just not focusing on other things that can help them get to this path and letting them know that these paths are even out there or these careers are out there, because a lot of people didn't even know that two African American men were in space at the same time.  A lot of people didn't even know that Ed White was a military test pilot, was the first African American to be asked by Robert F. Kennedy to be part of the astronaut corp, but through his death and the new president coming in, he went out of becoming the first astronaut.  But he reinvented himself, he became a world renowned artist.  At 45 he went back, he got his MFA, a master of fine arts and became a sculpture of beautiful bronze artifacts, so I think letting people know that if you do have a setback; I lost my hearing, I was deaf, I could have quit, I could have said, I'm done, I don't want to try anymore, to driving that touchdown pass, it was two moments of my life that I could have easily given up, but I didn't because I had people that believed in me, I had also this prophesy thing, that she said, you will fly in space and spew your testimony to the world.  But how many people tell you, you can do this, but you don't sometimes believe in yourself.  So instilling in our kids, instilling in our adults to believe in yourself, no matter what atrocities or hardships.  I think about Harriet Tubman; underground railroad, people transferring slaves to the north to get to freedom.  I think of all the people that have done things under the most harshest circumstances and in this day and age where we have all the technology we have, all these things, that there's no reason why, with help from others, and with belief in yourself and help from yourself that you can't aspire to do anything you put your mind to.
Story_ID: 25264
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on your career, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2: Well, considering that I didn't have any of this stuff planned out, there is nothing I would have done differently, because I didn't even know that I was going to think about becoming an astronaut or a professional ball player, or whatever, it's just, I think it's having those core skills that allow you to really do anything.  And I think having parents that really didn't pidgeonhole me in a certain area.  They exposed me to a lot of different things, as government, as the private sector industry, we all have to expose our kids to everything so that they can see what they want to be, because sometimes they don't want to know.  So I didn't know to do things differently.  Now, 20-20 hindsight, I probably would not have done anything differently because I let everything just kind work organically to get to where I am now.
Story_ID: 25265
Speaker 1: Now, do you have children?
Speaker 2: I don't.  That's the next chapter, hopefully, is to get married and have children and help raise a strong nation of my own.
Speaker 1: Were your parents [Gracie and Deems Melvin] astonished at the turn of events in your life in terms of all the things you've been able to do?
Speaker 2: I don't think they were astonished, they are more appreciative of my desire to give back to the community, through education; they were educators.  I'm not a former educator, but I'm doing it in a different way, and I think it's something that we need to definitely give back, and pay it forward, pay it back, help others.  We have been--I've been very blessed to have the opportunities that I've had.  My parents have worked hard; my dad had taken odd jobs to give me the piano lessons, the violin lessons and those things.  And to help others get those same types of opportunities so that they can see their path or see the vision for what they want their future to be.
Story_ID: 25266
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything we need to cover before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Anything that NASA-wide [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], that, let me see, I can't think of anything right off the bat that we missed in the chronology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the last question is similar to--well, it's basically, what do you see now as your legacy, and how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered, and I think back to my childhood, the book that my mother read to me so many times that no matter how small or big or what your situation is, if you believe in yourself and the little engine that could, he doubted himself at one time is that, I think I can, I could and I did.  And it's that empowerment to let others see that they think they can, they could and they did, and to spread that throughout our civilization to know that he did it.  He was a little guy from Lynchburg, Virginia, if he could do it, I can do it.  And I think that's the legacy that I want to leave; you can do anything, you can fly in space, you can get drafted to the NFL, you can play a piano if you want it bad enough, you can do it, and believe in yourself.
