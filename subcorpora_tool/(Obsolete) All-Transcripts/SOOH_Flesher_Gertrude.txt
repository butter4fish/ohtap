 Wilson  Today is June 20, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I am with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. I am in Cheyenne, Oklahoma, today, at the home of  Gertrude Flesher. I will be interviewing Gertrude as part of the  Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History Series about the 1930s. Thank you  for having me here today.  Glad to have you.  Let   s start out by having you tell me about your childhood, your family,  and about your time growing up.  I was born in 1925, and I am number two of seven children. We were  raised on a farm. Us children were all born at home with a rural doctor  and, of course, he always had a housewife or someone with him that  came. We had good horses, and we had good cattle, and we milked cows  and separated the milk, so we always had cream and butter. And then we  fed the separated milk to the hogs. So, we raised hogs.  And where was it that you were born? What part of the state?  Well, Western Oklahoma. My birth certificate said Hamburg, which I  don   t remember Hamburg, but this is before Reydon was born. Reydon  was not built until 1928, when the railroad came through. So, then, later,  our address was Reydon.  And you didn   t have to move?  Didn   t have to move. Us seven kids, I think that we have five different  addresses on our birth certificates.  All for the same location. (Laughs)  5  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  All for the same location.  Wow. So, what did your parents do?  Well, they were on the farm. They never left the farm to work. We did  trade work with neighbors, but we never collected any money for them.  We just helped them out. And we also raised chickens, white leghorn  chickens, and sold eggs. And the money we got from our eggs we  bought crackers and sugar and flour and vanilla and cocoa and things  like that. We only bought what the eggs would pay for. And our cream  check, then, went for kerosene and things for the farm.  What would you use kerosene for?  We had kerosene lamps because we had no electricity. We had no  running water. We had no gas. We cooked with wood years ago, and  then later we got coal. But for years we just had wood, and we went up  on the river and cut trees and brought them home and sawed them up for  wood.  Do you remember when it was that you got coal?  No, I don   t remember when it was that we finally got coal. Seemed like  the lumberyard would get in a load of coal, and then we would buy it  from them, which was so much nicer. And it   s hard to believe now when  we have 109 degrees that   and we did a lot of ironing because we didn   t  have wash and wear things. And when you think, you had to have a fire  going to keep your irons hot. So, you sat close to the stove where you  could reach the irons. We called them sat irons, and we had a handle that  fastened down in them, and we put one on the stove to heat while we   re  using the other one. I think we used to have three baskets of clothes  sprinkled down to iron, and we had to sit by that hot stove to iron them.  Did you raise a big garden?  We had a big garden. We had a garden by the windmill that we could  water, and we had beets and radishes and green beans and carrots and  things. And then we had a truck patch, which we had peanuts and  potatoes and sweet potatoes and things in the truck patch. And we did  not have water for them. Now then, down on the farm water has been  piped to the truck patch, but my brother is eighty-four years old, and he  has heart trouble, and so he does not raise a garden anymore.  So, the truck patch would just have to rely on the rain?  6  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Yes.  And if it didn   t rain, then     Then that was it.  And was that just enough food for your family, or would you trade or  sell any of those?  No, we usually just had enough for our family. Besides, my mother was  a cripple. She walked with a crutch. She was born in 1899, in Indiana,  and they came to Oklahoma in 1901, and she was sick, sick, run a high  fever. We don   t know whether she had polio or what she had, but  anyway, had this one leg that did not develop, and her knee was frozen.  She could swing her leg from the hip, and her foot was small, and just  her big toe touched. She couldn   t put any weight on it, but it helped to  balance her. And besides us six kids, Momma had a grandfather that  lived with us that was almost blind with cataract, and she took care of  him, too, besides the garden, besides washing on the board, hanging  clothes on the line, and all the beds. We did not get two sheets changed  the same week. We put the top sheet on the bottom and washed the  bottom sheet.  My baby sister was born after Great-Grandpa moved to  his daughters   .   Sounds efficient.  Yes. (Laughter) It is when you   ve got that many beds.  Where did your father come from?  Well, he was born up close to Vinita. I think the town   s name was  Bluejacket, and he was the product of his father   s third wife. We think  the first wife didn   t have children when she died, and the second one had  several children, but he lost, oh, I think it was four brothers in 1904 with  Typhoid fever. They lived on a farm where the water was not good and  had Typhoid fever and died. And we, Virginia and I, have been up there  and tried to find them, but we don   t know the boy   s names. But we  stopped at the library and checked on the cemeteries, and we did not find  where they were buried. So, we don   t know. But, anyway, Daddy was a  product of the third wife.  And what year was he born?  He was eight years older than Momma, so he was born in, what     1891?  7  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Yes.  And how did his family come to this part of the state?  Well, after they lost so many children, then they moved. And when you  don   t have a choice, you just move where is available. So, I don   t know  why they landed close to Reydon. Well, Reydon wasn   t there at the time,  but he had two brothers, and he had a sister, and she died in our teenage  years, so     So, do you know how your parents met?  Yes, they went to the same one-room school.  And where was that?  Oh, I don   t remember. I don   t have the book. At one time, we had 101  one-room schools in Roger Mills County. Of course, they set aside land  for school land, and they didn   t want any child to have to walk over  three miles to school. So, anyway, and my mother wasn   t able to walk,  and she rode a burro, which is like a little mule. She said it was  stubborn. Sometimes it   d just put its head down and stop and off she   d  slide.  So, she might be late to school sometimes?  Yes. (Laughter) She wasn   t able to walk to school.  Would she just tie him up at the school?  Yes. And I suppose they had a place to water them. And, of course, she  just went to the eighth grade. When you went to the eighth grade, if you  had transportation to go to Cheyenne, which is the county seat, you  could take a test. It may have only been offered at certain times of the  year. If you passed it you could teach school.  Did she do that?  No, she didn   t do that because you   ve got to have transportation to get to  Cheyenne.  So, what did she do after eighth grade?  Well, she stayed home and helped her mother take care of children, and  she married in    22. So, she was almost   well, her birthday was the  8  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  fourteenth of September, so she was almost twenty-two years old when  she married.  And you mentioned there were 101 schools in Roger Mills County at one  time. How many are there now?  There   s only three. Reydon, Cheyenne and Hammon, and Hammon   s on  the extreme eastern side, almost on the Custer County line. And they  have Cheyenne Indians in their school. We don   t have Indians here at  school. I was going to tell you, one time I was sitting at the museum, and  this lady came in by herself. She said,    I   ve looked all around for a  Cheyenne Indian.    I said,    Well, I   m sorry, but we don   t have one here.     I said,    You   ll have to go back to Hammon.    And she said,    I flew into  New York, and I   m going west, and I   m not back tracking.    And I  thought,    That   s so sad that we have a town named Cheyenne but we  don   t have Cheyenne Indians.     When you were growing up did you see Indians around?  No, we didn   t. We didn   t have colored people, we didn   t have Indians,  and we didn   t have the Spanish kids, either. And when we were growing  up, we knew all the kids    grandparents and cousins and aunts and uncles.  Went clear through school with a lot of them.  How old were you when you started to school?  I guess I was probably six because my birthday was in June, but I  finished high school when I was seventeen because my birthday was the  last part of June. So, when I finished high school, the boys   there were  just twelve of us that graduated. We had four boys and eight girls. And  the boys went right on into the military and the girls scattered, went to  work and everything. I had to wait until I had a birthday because you  had to be eighteen to go to work for Boeing.  Where was it that you graduated high school?  Reydon.  In what year?  1943.  So, where did you start out going to school?  Midway, which, years and years ago, so I have heard, that seven one-room  schools moved their buildings together to make Midway, which  9  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  was midway between Rankin and Durham. And for some reason they  caught fire and burned, and then they had to build a school there.  In Reydon?  In Midway.  Oh.  Yes. So, we had a brick building, and we had coal stoves to heat it with,  and we had a windmill, and we had a supply tank that was about five  foot off the ground. So, we had water pressure sometimes. And we had  outdoor restrooms, and we had to walk up the hill to the restrooms. And  we didn   t have air conditioning or anything. So, when we went to  Reydon, to high school, this building had been built in 1936, and this is     39, and this had indoor plumbing, toilet tissue, gas heat, and we thought  it was really uptown. It was the nicest place we   d ever seen. Well, a  couple of years ago, they bulldozed it down. They said it cost too much  to get it fixed up, and we were so disappointed because we just thought  it was a mansion when we started school there.  And was that built by the WPA?  It was built by the WPA in 1936, and we started there in    39. Busses run  their routes to Midway, and then all the high school people got on one  bus and then went to Reydon to high school. And then the evenings,  well, usually a high school boy drove the bus. And there   s only four left  of my class out of twelve, and we were all raised on a farm and all had  to get up and do chores in the morning and then catch the bus. We did  not have time to wash our hair, take a bath, or anything. We just went to  school and smelled like everybody else. (Laughter)  What were some of your chores that you would do every morning?  Well, first, I milked until some of the other kids got old enough to milk.  When they did, then I packed the lunch box buckets and watered the  chickens and fed them and helped Momma in the kitchen.  And you said you raised quite a few chickens?  Yes, we did. We had an incubator, and we hatched our own eggs for  years. And when we could buy chickens for three cents apiece, a straight  run, pullets and roosters. And I don   t know how they can tell when  they   re so tiny. They   re called straight run, so when they were about six  weeks old, we started dressing the roosters to eat. And also, Momma had  people that would call and want chickens, and we would dress them.  10  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Now, it wouldn   t work now, but we would dress them that morning, and  sometimes we would dress as many as ten or twelve. I can   t remember  what we put them in because we didn   t have plastic bags. We didn   t  have containers. And then we would deliver them in Reydon. Also,  people would ask for butter and cream, too.  How would you keep these things cool?  We didn   t. That   s what I don   t know because we went to town in the  wagon. I said it wouldn   t work now. They would think sure that you   re  going to get something from the chickens. We saved the pullets then,  and then in the wintertime, Momma could   if she saw a hen that her  feathers were pretty, and she was plump and everything, we had a hook  on a wire, a wire hook, and she would catch them by the legs. And if she  could put two fingers up there where they drop the eggs, she knew she  was laying. If she couldn   t, she knew she wasn   t laying. And when  people call for a fat hen at Thanksgiving or Christmas and things, well,  we would butcher them and deliver them. And we ate them also, and so  we ate lots of chickens. And my brother, bless his heart, is still on the  farm, and chicken is not one of his favorite meats.  How did you go about butchering them? What was your method?  Well first, my mother, the hand that she used to carry herself on the  crutch was very strong. And, of course, we cut the legs off and the wings  off, and then we divided the legs and the thigh to the leg. And then we  had to break the back, and I couldn   t always break the back. Of course, I  wasn   t very big, but Momma could just snap them so easy.  And that   s how you   d kill them? Or how would you initially     Oh, we chopped their heads off. Momma did.  With an ax?  With an ax. And then we let them bleed good. And now, them chickens  you buy, it doesn   t look like they have bled good before they were  butchered. So, anyway. This helped, too, because when you   ve got kids  in school, they need pencils and Crayolas and tablets and things. And we  could buy a penny pencil, and then we had a Big Chief, I believe it was,  tablet that cost three cents, but that was a lot of money back then.  The price of a chicken.  Yes. (Laughter) I don   t even remember what we got for the chickens. So  then, when I was fifteen, we had a baby sister born. We had already  11  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  hoped that sometime we could own a car. She was born in May of    40,  and that fall, in    39, we had enough money after we paid our taxes and  everything, we had some cash. Then Daddy had so many bales of hay  and so many bushels of maize and everything, he traded the car dealer  for a new Ford with no heater or air conditioner, stick shift and  everything. And the first time we ever had a vacation, the family all  traveled together. There were seven kids and Momma and Daddy in this  car. And the trunk wasn   t really that big, so we could only take three  changes of clothes a piece, which we did all right. But Momma took jugs  of well water and then little cans of pet milk to fix Mildred   s formula  because Momma did not have milk when Mildred was born. So, she was  a bottle baby. She didn   t want her drinking city water.  So, where did you go on vacation?  Well, we went to Oklahoma City, visited an aunt, and on to Muskogee  and then up someplace around Vinita and visited two of Daddy   s  cousins. And then we went on. Daddy had a half-sister that lived in  Coffeyville, Kansas, and we visited her and stayed a few days, and then  we went on to Colorado. We were just gone a week, but it was the only  time we ever had a vacation. And the baby, we carried her on a pillow.  Of course, there was all of us kids in the back seat, except one always  got to sit between Momma and Daddy up in front. But we were packed  in there, and I guess we were good travelers. I didn   t even have any  trouble.  What were some things you all would do for entertainment when you  were growing up?  Well, we always had neighbors to come and visit us, and we had a lot of  neighbors come and stay all night with us. We played games, and we  played a lot of dominoes because you could play dominoes by kerosene  lamp. The dominoes were black with white dots, and Momma had taught  us how to play dominoes. That way you learned to add and what five  and five and five, how much that   that   s fifteen, and so that was good.  Then after we got older we played Old Maid, and Arthur   s and Flinch,  but I don   t know how we play those now because I never see those  games. And also, everybody had a big family and in the summer time,  people would take turns having parties, and we sang and made our own  music as we went around and around. The women stayed in the house  and visited, and the men sat out around the circle and watched the kids  play.  Another thing that we did as a group is that we always canned wild plum  butter, and we had to go up on the river, where the plum bushes were,  which isn   t   you don   t need to do that now. There   s plum bushes in a  12  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  lot of places. But we   d go out and we would take our wash boilers and  washtubs and get those with the plums, and it sure did make good butter.  And we usually took a neighbor or two with us to help pick. And my  mother   I   ve seen her do it many, many times   could get up in the  wagon on one foot and pull herself up. I tried to describe it, and I can   t,  because she put her good foot up on the axle, which was several inches  off the ground, and then she would pull herself up in the seat. Later, we  had a laundry that went in, in Reydon, and so Daddy would hitch the  horses up to the wagon and load her laundry in it, and she went to  Reydon then came home. We hung it out, but I   ve thought many a times  when she has this one foot that she has to put all of her weight on, on the  axle, if the horses had just stomped, they could have thrown her off and  run over her. But they stayed still. I guess Daddy had talked to them.  (Laughter)    You   ve got to stand still.     So, until you all got this first car that you talked about, did you take a  wagon everywhere?  Yes, or we had a horse. When I was home, we didn   t have a saddle  because Daddy says saddles are dangerous. If you slide off of them, a  horse can drag you if you have a saddle. But later, Mildred had a saddle.  But we did a lot of walking from neighbor   s to neighbor   s, and we also  farmed with horses. I don   t know how old we were when Daddy  would   we had this one team that was really, really nice and didn   t give  any problems. And the first thing we did, we   d run a sled over the row  crop and pull the dirt in when the row crop was about six inches tall. We  had two horses that pulled that sled, and the horses had to walk up on the  ridge to pull the dirt into the where the crop was, and we did that. And  then we did have cultivators, too, which was bigger. And the cultivators  had the ways where you could put pressure on each side to be sure that  you kept it   not plow up any of the crops, then. And also, we spent a lot  of time on a hoe handle. We had WPA put in about two miles of shelter  belt trees in the late    30s. And when school was out, well, Daddy plowed  between the tree rows, and then we hoed the weeds out of it, between  them. And we did it again before school started. And also, during the  Dust Bowl days, we had a one-horse plow, had one horse pulled it, and  he would plow along the fence rows that went east and west, and then  we   d pull the weeds out of it so that the sand wouldn   t blow up on it.  Well, tell me more about the Dust Bowl days. What do you remember  about the dust?  Well, we had a lot of dirt. The early-day settlers, when they came, broke  out the land to plant, and then it was not covered, and it would not hold,  so there were a lot of people. Daddy owned a quarter of land when he  and Momma married, and then later we bought a quarter. And then when  13  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  I was still home, we bought another quarter. So, found out that the  ground needs cover on it all the time. A lot of the land needed to be put  back to grass, and the government helped with that. They had drills that  they loaned people to put back into grass. Daddy was a good farmer, and  he was proud of his horses and his cattle, and he was proud of his   so,  we kept the weeds down the best we could. And we always had hogs,  and what we called hog weeds. I don   t know what the name of them is.  We would go at the ends of the rows and pull those and carry them down  and feed the hogs. So, I guess it was kind of like feeding them spinach or  something, I don   t know.  Well, tell me about when it did rain in 1934.  Well, I don   t remember the rain where we were. We lived on a hill, but  what I read about it, we had over thirteen inches of rain, and we have  lots of gullies here. I was born in Western Oklahoma, where we don   t  have so many gullies, and the water all ran to the river, and the river got  out of the banks. People in the low places, then, had to abandon their  houses, and some of them grounded. But most of it was north. I mean,  between Strong City and Hammon, where the river crosses under the  highway several times. And the Indians had their teepees close to the  river for water and things, and there were several Indians that got killed.  Did you ever see their teepees?  Yes, when I started to work for Boeing, I could get on the doodlebug,  which was a one car passenger car, and it went every other day. It went  to Clinton one day and to Pampa one day, and people rode in it. I  suppose they carried some freight, I don   t know. But, anyway, when I  would get on that, and I would ride to Clinton, and then I would catch a  train there and go into Wichita, and there were Indian teepees right down  close to the railroad track. The railroad track is built close to the creeks.  Do you know why? The creeks do not have hills and hollows, and that   s  better for trains to not have to pull hills and hollows. These Indians lived  close to Hammon.  And that was in about what year?  Well, I started to work for Boeing in 1943.  So, they were still living in teepees in that area then.  Right, and then later they built them houses in Hammon, but they didn   t  teach them not to build a fire in the middle of the living room floor, so  they had a few problems. You need to train them first, before you put  them in a house with running water and gas and things. So, that was an  14  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  adjustment that the government didn   t cater to because all they knew  was to build a fire in the middle of their teepee, but that   s what I   ve  heard. And there were several programs during the Depression. They  had a CCC camp, where boys went to camp, and they worked in state  parks or built buildings and things. Most of their money was sent back to  their family to buy necessities and things. So, we had neighbor boys,  they were brothers, that went to the CCC camp, and I don   t know how  much money was sent to the family. And then we had WPA, which they  built the schoolhouse, the high school building at Reydon in    36, and  they also built the building at Durham. So, they built several buildings,  which that   s good, because they learn a trade. But I don   t know what  they drew a day because we were never on WPA. We always were self-supporting.  And then, at one time when we had a drought, the government made  people go out and cut their cattle down, not have so many cattle on their  land, and they shot them. So, I asked a man at senior citizens the other  day what they did with those, and he said,    Sometimes the Indians came  and took the cows down to where they lived,    which is good. Beef can  be   when we butchered a beef, we put some of it in fruit jars and  pressured it, and it was just like roast beef with the broth on it. And it  was so good for a base of soups and things. It was good. And our pork,  of course, they salted down the hams and the bacon, and then we ground  the sausage, and we had a grinder. I think it was on a two-by-six. It was  on a big board, and you put it between two chairs. One person sat on it,  straddled it, and turned the crank, and you ground all this pork up. And  we could fry it and then put it down in crock jars and pour lard over it,  and it kept. We also used lard to make pie crusts, made real good pie  crusts. We also used it to make our lye soap that we used. And they used  to take their lye and their lard and their water and boil it in big, black  pots out over an open fire. But when I started making lye soap, we just  mixed water and lye and made a cold soap, and it worked fine. You  could also use bacon grease and things like that for lard, but everybody  made their own soap.  And would you use that to bathe with?  Well, you could, yes. If you   re wanting to know, we usually used  Lifebouy, which smelled kind of like   what did it smell like? Lysol or  something.  Lifebouy or Lye?  Lifebouy, B-O-U-Y, soap, and it smelled kind of like Lysol, so it was  supposed to be disinfecting.  15  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Well, tell me about bath time. Where would you bathe?  Well, we had this number three tub that we used to do laundry with  when we washed on the board, and usually three people took a bath. We  had to carry all of our water in buckets from the well to the house and  heat it. And usually, three people took a bath in the same water, and then  we got fresh water. So, I always tried to be the first one. It didn   t always  work, and we just took a bath in that. But we only had a bath once a  week. We usually just washed our hair once a week. But lye soap is real  good to wash your hair with.  About how far was it from you farm into Cheyenne?  About seventeen miles, I suppose, because   well, about eighteen miles  because we were north of Reydon.  So, would you come into Cheyenne on occasion?  Very, very seldom. Sometimes we came over here for school activities  and for 4-H things, but we rode the school bus. My first school bus was  a cattle bus, cattle truck, and it just had tarps over the top and down the  sides. And then it had seats along the sides. And in the back they had  iron things for you to climb up in, but it was hard for little kids to climb  up in there. And then they haul cattle on weekends, but then in a year or  two we had a real school bus, and it had seats on the sides and then  down the center, had small seats for the kids, that was small, to sit on.  What do you remember about grade school?  Well, it was fun. A lot more fun to go to school than it was to stay home  and chop weeds. We always looked forward to school starting. During  the Depression, we never did get commodities, our family didn   t, but  there was a program where we had dried vegetables, like carrots and  peas and beans and stuff. And our cook, they moved a kerosene stove in  one of the classrooms that wasn   t used at school because they didn   t  have high school there anymore. We took a tin cup and a spoon to  school every day, and they furnished crackers, and it cost us three cents.  I suppose this helped pay for the cook, and that was really good to get to  have soup for dinner. And if somebody butchered and they had a soup  bone, well, they would send it in, and the soup was better with a soup  bone. But now, we thought it was good.  We had two little boys that were in my sister   s class that one of the little  boy   s mother had died when they were young, so the father, when they  carried their lunch, fixed them potted meat sandwiches with baker   s  bread, which was a treat because we never had baker   s bread. Another  16  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  little boy had in his lunch a biscuit with sausage. So, these little boys  would go out by the coal house and open their lunch, and they traded  sandwiches because the little boy that never had baker   s bread enjoyed  it, and the little boy that never had a sausage sandwich enjoyed it.  And the rest of you all just watched and wished that you had  that?(Laughs)  No, the reason I knew about it was a few years   oh, maybe fifteen years  ago, somebody had written the kids that went to Midway to school that  they could find addresses for says,    Tell us something which you  remember when you went to Midway to school,    and this was in one of  the boy   s stories. And I thought,    How cute,    because my daddy thought  baker   s bread didn   t have much more food value to it than going out and  opening your mouth and letting the sun shine in. (Laughter) So, we  never had baker   s bread, but eating out, of course, we went to town in  the wagon, and if we ate out   and we never did that very often. If we  had to eat out, well, we usually had lunch meat with baker   s bread and,  boy, that was a treat. And I had thought,    Boy, when I go out on my  own, I   m going to have all the lunch meat, all the bologna I want.    And  it didn   t take long. (Laughter)  What do you remember about Black Sunday?  Well, we had been to Frank Cole   s for lunch, who lived across the river.  Daddy had worked for Frank Cole before Momma and Daddy were  married, and they had invited us up there. My baby brother was born in     33, and this was April of    35. He was born in April, so he was two years  old. Momma   s youngest sister was with us, and we were just in an open  wagon. Well, as we crossed the river and got away from the trees,  Daddy looked back and he said,    Well, they   ve got a prairie fire up there  in the Texas panhandle.    It looked like smoke, and it was rolling and  rolling. Well, Frank Cole   s closest neighbors was the Shawls, and Mrs.  Shawl   and she had a son who lived with her that had never married,  and this was in April. And I don   t know why, but he had a horse out  there, and it was saddled. He saw us coming, so he ran out with his horse  and opened the gate, and then he had us to drive right into a metal barn  that had been a hay shed because there was no hay left there in April.  And then he took Mom and us kids to the cellar with his mother. But  finally, we decided it wasn   t going to move out.  There wasn   t wind with it. It just rolled in, and this dirt that we got had  come from the panhandle because it was not our dirt, someplace else.  So, then we went out and, see, here we are in an open wagon. And so,  we tried to put things over our nose, which I don   t know whether we had  any diapers with us or not. I can   t remember. And the horses knew the  17  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  way home, and we got home. Although the storm had come in from the  north and our kitchen was in the southwest room of the house, and we  had double windows behind the table, and you could write your name on  the oil cloth of the table. The way it came right   and the windows were  closed, and the doors were closed, but everything was covered with  black dirt. We didn   t milk the cows that night. So, it was terrible.  Our house faced the east, but we had a porch over it. The old house is  still there, so maybe the next time we   ll have time to go out and see the  old house. When Daddy built the old house, my uncle dug the basement  part under the house. He said he made fifty cents a day. Can you  imagine digging a basement one scoop at a time? And then they built the  house on it. At first, we had four rooms, and the northwest room Daddy  used for a granary because we didn   t have a granary. So, our family just  lived in three rooms. And then finally, he built a barn or cow shed or  something, we had a granary, so we got to use that room. And then there  was room for rooms upstairs, but they weren   t finished. So, finally,  when the family got bigger, well, we floored the upstairs and put  sheetrock up and everything, and us five girls slept upstairs.  Do you remember feeling the effects of the Depression?  Well, I felt like we were   we never went hungry, and we had kids that  came home with our kids all the time. Even with my kids when they  were growing up, we had kids all the time. And the same thing, but  Momma never complained. We always had food enough to go around.  Do you remember any banks going out?  Yes, there was banks that went out.  Did your parents talk about losing   ?  No, we didn   t have that kind of money. What money we had was in a  sugar bowl up in the top of the cabinet. So, it wasn   t much, but we got  by. I mean, you can do it if you just put your  mind to it . So, we kind of  raised our kids like we were raised. And thank goodness, when they  retired both of them had beautiful homes and a good retirement. But you  have to start teaching them when they   re young to conserve, conserve,  and don   t buy anything you don   t have to have.  Are there any other lessons that you feel that you taught them from that?  Well, I don   t know. Sometimes I thought maybe I was a little too strict  on them because down at the store there at Reydon, there was a lady that  got in a shipment of color books, and they were nineteen cents. And the  18  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Fisher  kids got ten cents a week allowance. Well, it just didn   t go that far. So, I  heard Jim tell Virginia that day,    When you get that tooth pulled and we  get tooth fairy money, we   ll have nineteen cents to buy that color book.     And I thought,    Maybe I   ve been a little too strict. I don   t want her  pulling her teeth too early.    (Laughter)  Tell me about Reydon when you were growing up. What all was in  town?  When Reydon was a booming city it had hotels, and it had lumber yards,  it had two cotton gins, and it had a newspaper. It had a bakery, and that   s  something to walk by and smell that bread cooking, and had several  stores. And even before I went to Wichita, Reydon had, oh, three or four  stores and cream stations and things. But when people were able to buy  cars to go someplace   and years ago, even when my children were born,  we didn   t have any blacktop out of Roger Mills County. Even 283  Highway was gravel. So, that   s another thing, when they get good roads,  well, people go someplace else and shop to save a quarter.  Used to, there was a store, two stores at Roll, and there was two stores at  Durham. There was a store at Crawford, and there were four stores in  Reydon. And every little place had a store and cream stations and things,  but if people   and, too, our population fell off quite a bit. But you   ve  got to patronize your home to keep them alive, and that   s what I   m  trying to do. We have one drugstore in Cheyenne, and I try to do all my  business there because a time may come when I can   t drive, and I want a  drug store. As I get older, I   m taking more medicine all the time. And  also, we have a nice grocery store now, and it   s put in a lot of money,  tax money, in our county, and that   s good. We   re just now getting wind  chargers   or we started last fall. And they are putting up more wind  chargers, supposed to put up 132 more right away.  Do you know how many already exist?  No, I don   t know how many. Carpenter was where they put up the first  ones in Roger Mills County, which is north of Elk City. But you get out  south of town a ways at night, and they are so pretty. They have a red  light on them, and they all blink at the same time, and it   s so pretty at  night.  And Cheyenne   s changed quite a bit, too?  Yes, it has. Yes. I don   t know, but I   ve noticed that sometimes the  people that are on welfare maybe haven   t been taught how to get the  most out of their money. Years ago, Virginia would cook supper, and I  went home one evening and she said,    You don   t let me buy cinnamon  19  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  rolls or fresh tomatoes, and I was down at the store a while ago, and so  and so bought cinnamon rolls and fresh tomatoes, and their daddy don   t  even work.    I said,    Honey, they   re on welfare and they know exactly  how much money they   re going to have each month. We   re working for  ourselves, and we don   t know how much money we   re going to have left  after we pay our bills at the end of the month. So, we have to be a little  more careful.    But see, that   s what welfare does. I mean, I   m glad they  have the program for people that can   t work, but most people can. But  there was big families, and then we had a lot of kids that went to school.  And, as I said, we knew most all the kids    aunts and uncles and cousins  and grandparents and it was just like one big family.  Did your parents talk about politics much in the    30s?  Not much.  Were they in support of the WPA programs?  Not really. WPA did make us an outside toilet, and they had a form that  they made the base from, which had two stools in it with lids on it that  was made of concrete. And then I suppose Daddy built the building  around it. Then boy, that was a fancy toilet. So, that was real nice.  I read they dug a lot of farm ponds in this county, also.  That   s right. After we had the flood, Mr. Males, our banker, started  working on a program here for the watershed, that if we could just keep  the water where it fell, and irrigate out of it and use it, there was so  many things we could do with it because after it goes into the river, and  then it goes on to the Mississippi River and goes on to New Orleans, it   s  gone forever. And so, WPA helped build ponds, dams, and things, too.  Well, maybe WPA didn   t have it then, because they had contractors  come in and build them, but we have a lot.  We have three nice  lakes  on federal land that are open to the public  where people can fish and boat and they don   t let them water ski  anymore on the lakes, but they have nice campgrounds and picnic areas,  and the hunters that come in, and we have a lot of hunters that come in,  bring their RVs and park in our public areas, and it   s so nice. And our  government keeps them up. The national grasslands that we saw this  morning, it   s that group that keeps up those big lakes. They   re not big,  but anyway, they   re big for Roger Mills County, and they are public  lakes for the public to use. We have a lot of people from Texas come  over and use our lakes because Texas is so flat that they don   t have  ponds like we do here. But anyway, when our kids were growing up, we  always had kids over on Sunday. Well, lots of times we took our lunch  20  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  and went out. There was a lake not far from our house, and so the kids  swam, and we had picnics and had a lot of fun with the neighbor kids.  Well, this tape is about up. I   d like to continue, but I know we have to go  to lunch. So, maybe we   ll do a part two this afternoon and talk about  some other things then.  All right, this is part two with Gertrude Flesher, later in the day on June  20, 2011. Let   s talk about high school graduation to start out with.  Where was your high school graduation held?  It was held at Reydon. We had a hard rain that night and I didn   t get to  go. Down below our house it was sandy and the water would make a  ditch across the road. And we had a car. If we   d been going in a wagon  we   d probably have made it. So, I missed my graduation because it     most the times it rains in Oklahoma May, except this year.  Yes. Which in this year, 2011, there has not been rain since, when?  Oh, it   s been at least six weeks, maybe longer.  There has been five inches all year?  I don   t know if we   ve had that much or not. Not here. It   s been terrible.  What did you do that summer before you graduated?  Well, I was working for Flesher Grocery. We had a cream station and a  grocery store. We had to write everything down on a little pad, and we  didn   t even have an adding machine. You had to add it up in your head,  the bills, and figure the tax. We also had little mills, where there were  ten that made a penny. And we had to figure it right down to the mill.  They don   t do that anymore.  And at the time, was that the only grocery store?  Oh no, they had several in Reydon, and cream stations and things. When  I started working at the grocery store, we stayed open until nine o   clock  at night. So, I didn   t get to date my boyfriend anymore, because he  didn   t want to wait until nine o   clock at night to go to the show. And  Alvin   s girlfriend had started to college, so Alvin would take me to the  show then. So we started dating then, and his girlfriend finally got  married.  Then I had my birthday, and Momma decided I needed my tonsils out  before I left home. We had a membership in the community hospital in  21  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Elk City, and Dr. Sugarman was the one that took the tonsils out. They  would wait until there were several, and then they   d do these all in one  day. We were all in the same room. There were eight of us that day.  There were two sisters of mine that went at the same time. I had to drive  myself over there with Momma, and we didn   t have any pavement out.  The roads were dusty and rough, and we stayed one night after surgery,  then had to drive home. So, I was one tired person when I got home.  I stopped in Cheyenne and they had a little ice cream thing, and I got a  milkshake and rested a while. Momma was with me, but she didn   t  drive. And so, when I got over that, I found Mr. Spurland was taking his  daughter-in-law to Oklahoma City to catch a train to Wichita. It was his  daughter-in-law, yes, because his son was stationed up there, so I went  with him. I went to Wichita and went down and took my physical and  one of the first things they said is,    You   ve got to have glasses,    which I  knew I couldn   t read well. And so, I got my glasses and then I started.  They had trouble, too, getting enough blood to take a blood test. Said  they might have to call me back. So, I guess I was kind of anemic, too.  They didn   t have to call me back, though.  How did you hear about going to Wichita in the first place? How did  you know you had to go there?  I had an uncle that went there in    41, went to work for Boeing, and  Boeing was hiring. And I had two girls that I graduated with that went as  soon as they graduated. Marrine   s birthday was in April and Irma   s had  been in December, and they got right on at Boeing. Had another girl that  I   d gone through school with that dropped out senior year and went to  Wichita and worked for Boeing.  So, you were pretty confident that you could find a job once you got  there?  Yes. I was sure I could, and my sister was already working there. She  had started to college, but she got fifteen cents an hour for cleaning  houses to help pay her education, and so she dropped out of school and  went to work for Boeing, but then she quit and went back to school. But  I stayed until I was laid off, and they paid me seventy-five cents an hour  to go to school. We went seven hours a day, and it seemed like I had so  much time on my hands that I   and this was in the fall of the year, and  so Kress was needing part-time help. So, a couple of days a week I   d put  in two or three hours at Kress   s after I went to school.  And what was Kress   s?  A little five and dime.  22  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  What town was that in?  Wichita. So, anyway, it just seemed like I had   I   d been used to  working ten, twelve hours a day, and I couldn   t believe that I had so  much time on my hands. My sister and I stayed in a home and we ate our  meals there. The lady did our laundry for us. So, that was real nice.  So, while you were working at Boeing, what were you working on?  I was working on the inboard wing section of the B-29.  And we have a replica here of a similar airplane.  Yes, there it is. And the part of the cowling for the outboard motors was  on the wings.  Can you point to where     Yes, and we put the landing gears on, and we put the flaps on and the  controls. And we also put tanks in the wings, the gas tanks, in the wings.  And we put de-icing equipment on the front of the   well, anyways, the  front of the wing before they put the edging on. And after we finished it  was set down in the fuselage in the next part.  And was it all women working on this?  No, no, no. We had men.  Were there many women working there?  Yes, because all the men that were able to work were in the Army. All  we had was a few 4Fs, or old people, and most of them were women that  were working.  So, how was the work environment?  Well, it was hot. No air conditioning or anything, and we had nylon knee   socks . We had lights and then we were working on metal, which was  hot. (Laughs) And we were advised that every time you went to the  fountain to get a drink to take a salt pill.  Really?  Doctors don   t recommend that anymore.  23  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  So, how many salt pills would you take in a day, sometimes?  Well, they had a little dispenser there that had little white pills on it, and  I don   t know how many we took, but we didn   t think they would hurt us  because they told us to take them, so we would. So then after the atomic  bomb was dropped, well, then they had a big layoff. And there wasn   t  any need in going back home. In Wichita, they had a business college,  and you could go to school a half a day and work a half a day. Well, I  had saved my money, so I didn   t have to work, and I had a roommate.  And so, I went to Wichita Business College, and I lacked about three  weeks graduating when Alvin got his discharge from the Marines and  came after me. The only thing, if I had graduated, I could have gone  back any time and taken a refresher course without paying tuition. But  anyway, so he came after me, and it took us a while to find a place to  live and things, and then we got married and we went on a honeymoon.  We were gone five weeks.  A five week honeymoon sounds pretty amazing. (Laughter)  Well, it was. It was.  Where all did you go?  Oh, we went clear up into Yellowstone and up into Oregon and Idaho  and back through California, visiting relatives most of the time.  Where did you get married?  In the back of a store.  In Reydon?  In Reydon, yes. We just had one preacher in Reydon, and he was a  Baptist preacher, and so he came and married us that evening. My  parents were there and his parents were there. I had one aunt and uncle,  and he had one aunt and uncle there. So, it was a little tiny wedding, and  we had talked about getting a wedding cake, but there was rationing on.  And if we had the bakery to make us a wedding cake, we had to give  them six months    of our sugar stamps and our shortening stamps and  stuff, so we just had a little cake.  How long did rationing last?  I can   t remember when they finally took it off.  But a few years after the war?  24  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Oh, I don   t think it was on too long for after we got married, because the  war was over, really, when we got married.  So, did you stay in touch with Alvin during the war?  Oh, sure.  Just by writing letters?  Yes, because we didn   t have telephones. But I came home before he     well, he went into the military in April, and he came to Wichita twice  while I was up there. But I came home some when he was home on  weekends. He was stationed in California most of the time.  Well, how was the community of Reydon affected by World War II? How  did it change?  Well, it took the able bodied people, the boys.  So, did that put a dent in farming?  Well, it didn   t help any. But, of course, the farmers were younger than  they are now. The thing now is everybody used to raise cotton because  they had kids to help to pick it. That   s not so anymore. Families don   t  have big families to do those things. Used to, every town had a cotton  gin. Well, that   s not the way it is anymore.  Is there a cotton gin in this county?  No, no, no. There used to be one in Elk City, and I don   t know whether  there still is or not. But when you think about how much it costs to hire  all this dang stuff when people used to have kids to do it. It made a  difference.  So, where did you settle down after you got married?  At Reydon.  And how long did you live there?  Oh, we moved to Cheyenne in    65. We got married in    46, and we  moved to Cheyenne in    65 and bought out an oil company here.  And did you have some children?  25  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Wilson  I had a boy and a girl. We married in    46. Our daughter was born in    48,  and our son was born in    50, and that was the size of my family. My  daughter was asked to come out and teach on the Indian reservation in  Arizona, and she went out there and taught. Jim went in the military, and  he took ROTC in college. So, he went in as an officer, and so when they  retired, they both moved back to Oklahoma, which I was so proud, so  proud of that. And so, I have three sisters that are widows, and myself  makes four, so we have one thing in common. But all of my family still  live in their own home and are able to take care of each other. And five  of us are in or eighties, so     And your brother lives on the home place?  My brother still lives on the home place where he was born. And his  health is not well, good, but he   s got rid of his cattle now, so we don   t  worry about him so much.  What do you see as the future of that property in the next hundred  years?  I have no idea. (Laughs) No idea. Some of the farmers are getting bigger  and some are just having to sell out and do the best they can. Our  farmers in Roger Mills County are past middle age, most of them. We  have very few young farmers because it costs so much to get started.  Land is high and everything   s high, just like my brother farms some. He  always planted some wheat and some rye. And one time he was called  up, the IRS called him up and said,    How can you buy  10,000 worth of  fertilizer and only  175 worth of seed?    He said well, he fertilized his  pastures, and he tried to raise enough seed to plant back. It   s those things  you don   t understand, just like the IRS wanted to know one time if a  bush hog was a fur bearing animal. (Laughter) So, book learning   s not  everything.  What are some wonderful things about living out here?  Out here? Because I used to know everybody. We have people now that  have moved in here because of the oil field and things. And, too, we   re  getting wind chargers up, wind farms up, so we have a group in here  putting those up. And so, I don   t know everybody, but I used to. But  still, people we know are just like family because you   ve known them so  long, and they   re the kind of people that would do anything for you. You  would never have to want for anything if you needed help in a little town  like Cheyenne.  And in my barely two days of being here, I   ve really witnessed your  tight-knit community and a great circle of friends.  26  Flesher  Wilson  Flesher  Yes, and not all of us that eat at senior citizens, but the majority of us  that eat at senior citizens, the people was born and raised here, that   s  known each other for always. But we do have a few that has moved in.  We have a few that   s moved in and stayed, and that   s wonderful. They  always say, if you stay in Roger Mills County long enough to wear out a  pair of shoes, you won   t leave. (Laughter)  That   s great. Well, thank you so much for visiting with me and letting me  stay here.  Yes. (Laughter) We   re so happy to have you.  -------  -------
