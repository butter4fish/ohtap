Evan Faulkenbury: Today is June 14, 2014. My name is Evan Faulkenbury and I&#8217;m here in Madison Heights, Virginia interviewing Dr. Monica Rose Brennan. Thanks for being here. The first question I have is to detail your birth and early childhood.
Monica Rose Brennan: Yes, absolutely. Well it&#8217;s a privilege to be here and do this interview. I was born in Lexington, Kentucky, and that was in 1977, and lived there for the first four years of my life and then moved to North Carolina. Most of my childhood was in North Carolina. My father pastored three churches there, and two of the churches [were] in very low-income areas. I remember as he was in the ministry there were many times that he didn&#8217;t really know when his next paycheck was going to come because they were very small congregations, but he knew that he had the call of God in his life and he knew that&#8217;s where we were supposed to be. So I remember it was very common for people to bring us food and clothes, and I&#8217;m so glad that I grew up that way because it has made me grateful for everything. I grew up in the mountain areas and learned so much from the people there. [I] lived in McDowell County for, let&#8217;s see, from age four to eight; then moved to Greensboro, North Carolina ages eight through fifteen; then moved back to McDowell County ages fifteen through eighteen. That&#8217;s the first part of my childhood, as far as location.
EF: Sure, and born in Lexington in what year?
MRB: 1977.
EF: Okay. Well I wondered if you can go back and describe your family members, not just mother and father but also grandparents, and then great-grandparents too.
MRB: Yes. Well the oldest living&#8211;well, not living, she passed away in October&#8211;was my Nannie Craig, Lula Craig. She lived to be a hundred and seven, had a tremendous impact on my life, and she was my mother&#8217;s grandmother. I have memories of going over to her house. That&#8217;s some of the most special memories I have. She didn&#8217;t have a whole lot but she had a whole lot of love, and I would sit and talk to her for hours and ask her questions. So my mother&#8217;s parents, both of them are no longer living. I never knew my grandmother because she passed away in her early forties. But my grandfather was a hard worker. He was the first person in the McDowell County area to own a grocery store, so he actually had two grocery stores. My mother, their home was on top of the grocery store. She shared with me lots of stories about that. My father&#8217;s parents are still living in Charlotte, North Carolina, and they&#8217;ve had a tremendous impact on my life as well. My grandfather was in minor league baseball and he was drafted to the Phillies, actually, and then the war happened, so he ended up not doing that and he went into fulltime law enforcement.
EF: Oh, wow. Okay. In Charlotte?
MRB: In Charlotte, North Carolina, yes.
EF: And your grandmother? What was she like?
MRB: She worked. She was a fulltime career woman, worked for Bell South until she retired. And they had, of course, my father, who&#8217;s an only child, so we were the only grandchildren. I have two brothers. I haven&#8217;t mentioned that yet.
EF: Right.
MRB: Jeremy and Brady. They&#8217;re both younger than me and we all have very different personalities.
EF: Well can you talk a bit about the impact of your mother and father on you, growing up?
MRB: Yes, absolutely. They have been the most influential people on my life for sure, and with my father being in the ministry that had a huge effect on my life. They never forced religion or God or any of their beliefs on us, they lived it out, and that was so impactful to me. I saw in them something I wanted, and so they pointed me to having a relationship in Christ and that has changed my entire life as a woman. They lived out biblical principles and loved people. There were times I didn&#8217;t think they should love people [Laughs] but they genuinely have a love for people more than any individuals I&#8217;ve ever met. So that really had an impact on me, to accept people where they are, whether that is rich or poor, and to love them, regardless. So that&#8217;s been so influential, and still is to this day, on my life.
EF: So can you talk a bit about what was it like being the daughter of a minister, and a minister that moved around during your childhood?
MRB: Yes, absolutely. It was challenging at times. I didn&#8217;t really think about it I guess in my early childhood, what it meant to have your father as a pastor. I mean you&#8217;re born into it and you don&#8217;t even think about it. But then when I became a teenager I began to really observe some of the struggles that Daddy had as a pastor. When there were things going on in the church that were a great burden to him, I saw that burden and I wanted to fix it. I&#8217;m the firstborn. I wanted to help the problem go away and I didn&#8217;t know how to control it, and at the age of thirteen I developed a severe eating disorder and I had that for four years. I remember I didn&#8217;t stop eating to lose weight, I was always pretty thin, but I wanted to control a situation, and a lot of women deal with that. We want control. I didn&#8217;t know how to go about helping him, and that&#8217;s where it started. So that had an impact, however I&#8217;m so glad I went through that because it taught me a lot. I was severely anorexic for two years and then I had two years of recovery.   [Brief interruption; transcript resumes at 07:42]         I think that had to do with being a pastor&#8217;s daughter. I observed a lot that I guess I don&#8217;t think a lot of teenagers observe, and when you see your father wanting to help people and yet you see him really facing challenges and difficulties, so I tried to, again, fix it and then I couldn&#8217;t. But my parents were so loving during that time, and my mother was the one that really helped me recover, because it got really bad to where they were going to send me off somewhere to get help. I didn&#8217;t want that. [Laughs] I&#8217;m a homebody, so I was like, &#8220;No, no. Don&#8217;t send me off.&#8221; My mother showed me in God&#8217;s word how I didn&#8217;t have to worry and I could trust God, but again it took me about two years to get over that. So that, growing up as a pastor&#8217;s daughter, I observed how even if your parents are wanting to do what&#8217;s right and live for God there&#8217;s going to be challenges.         Another thing I observed at a very young age was death. I&#8217;ve been to more funerals I think than the average person because Daddy always preached funerals and I was always there with him. And we always lived beside a graveyard in the parsonage. So that had a major influence on my life. I thought hard about questions as far as life and death, and so many times I didn&#8217;t have peace because I thought about it a lot. So that&#8217;s another challenge as a pastor&#8217;s daughter.         Then you realize when you get older that everybody&#8217;s looking at you, or you feel like they are. They may not all be. So there is that scrutiny of am I measuring up to what other people want me to be, or think I should be. I remember even getting ready to go into college my freshman year, everyone knowing how very close I was to my mother, and I remember all the church members &#8211; not all of them but so many of them &#8211; made comments like, &#8220;Well, I know you&#8217;re not going to be able to go to college because you&#8217;re so close. You&#8217;re a homebody, you&#8217;re so close to your mother.&#8221; And I remember Mother and I looking at each other and saying, &#8220;Let&#8217;s prove them wrong.&#8221; You can do this, and I did it and left home.         But yeah, you&#8217;re under scrutiny. People think you should be perfect. But what helped me more than anything is to realize I&#8217;m an individual and I have a choice to choose to either walk a path that is focused on Christ, which I saw my parents walk, or go my own way. We all have that choice and I chose to walk the path, not because my parents had walked it, but because it was real and it had changed my life. So, yeah, it was very interesting growing up in a pastor&#8217;s home and you hear all kinds of stories. I was a little girl that would sneak into the living room and would be behind the couch listening to conversations that my mother and father didn&#8217;t know I was a part of.
EF: [Laughs]
MRB: I knew when we were going to move and they had no idea that I knew&#8211;
EF: Oh, really?
MRB: &#8211;when he was going to say yes to another pastorate.
EF: Oh, that&#8217;s funny.
MRB: I was the little girl who already knew. I knew who was having marriage problems in the church. I mean I knew everything, and that&#8217;s a lot of information for a little girl.
EF: Yeah, sure.
MRB: But anyway, I saw how my parents responded and reacted and ministered in the midst of that, and so I wouldn&#8217;t trade it for anything. But yeah, I got the scoop on a lot.
EF: Great. During this same time period, especially adolescence and teenage years, can you talk about education and your school experiences and major influences there?
MRB: Absolutely. When I was in the fourth grade I began having a lot of difficulty reading and I would study for hours for my tests and then I would take them and did really, really bad. So we had a reading specialist come in who began a new technique with actually drawing a picture of a definition and then I was able to recall it, and it changed the way I studied to this day. I began to discover, even as a fourth grader, in this challenge I had that if I wrote things down and I said them out loud then I would be able to memorize, and I started that and I still use it to this day, even through my doctorate work when I had exams or whatever. That&#8217;s how I memorize and retain.         So I was able to overcome that challenge and in the fourth grade had a love for learning and did very well in high school. I was vice president of my senior class. I was a participant in Fellowship of Christian Athletes and then in high school I actually started a club called First Priority. There were no clubs or organizations that were for Christians that were not athletes. Even though the FCA was open I was like, &#8220;I want to start a club.&#8221; So I did that in high school, started that club, and then after high school&#8211;. Did you want me to go into that, after high school, or high school?
EF: I want to clarify, was that a public school?
MRB: Yes.
EF: Okay.
MRB: I went to a public school until I was in the sixth grade. I was in a private school from sixth grade to the middle of my ninth grade year, and then in the middle of my ninth grade year we moved again, and there wasn&#8217;t a Christian school in the area. And I really wanted to be home schooled but it didn&#8217;t work out because it was the middle of my ninth grade year. So it was a huge culture shock for me, going into private school, which I was in sixth through the middle of my ninth grade year, and switching schools in the middle of my ninth grade year, really, really difficult. Looking back on my ninth grade year, I do not have happy memories because that&#8217;s a challenge, going into a public school in the middle of the year and all the peer pressure and all that. But high school I loved. It was in public school and I loved it. I loved my high school.
EF: And this was in McDowell County?
MRB: McDowell County. I graduated from McDowell High School. I did not really enjoy a lot of the pressures or I didn&#8217;t have a lot of friendships because most everyone had different perspectives on life than I did, but I loved to learn and I tried to be friends with everyone.
EF: Well can you talk a bit more about that, I guess your social relationships or friendships or lack thereof in high school and its formative impact on you?
MRB: Yes, absolutely. Well I sought to be friends with everyone. I mean I could not stand cliques, I could not stand groups. During lunchtime I remember going to the different cliques, because I had friends in all the cliques. I had friends with those that were very gothic and they wore black and had their fingers painted black and listened to music that I wouldn&#8217;t listen to, but they were my friends. Did I hang out with them outside of class? No. But I was acquaintances with them, they knew that I cared. Then I would have friends that were very country-like, I guess you could say. Another word is &#8220;rednecks,&#8221; [Laughs] which is typical of McDowell County. Almost everyone is a redneck. But anyway, then I would have those that were in cheering and football and stuff like that and I tried to be friends with everyone. I was never invited to a party because people knew that I had certain standards and convictions, but they always knew that they could call upon me to be a friend and to pray for them. If they were going through a difficult time a lot of times they would confide in me.         So outside of the school my relationships were in the church, and I had a lot of friends that were not my age, that were a lot older than me. Some of my closest friends were very, very old, older women that I would visit with, but I didn&#8217;t even realize at that age that I was gleaning so much wisdom. I really didn&#8217;t. I would go and hang out. I remember the eighty-year-old widow that lived right beside our house, and I remember going over to visit her on a weekly basis and she would have a globe of the world in her two-room apartment there, and she would be praying over regions of the world. I remember her saying, &#8220;I can&#8217;t go there in person, but I am there because I can pray for regions of the world.&#8221; And I remember gleaning from that wisdom. So I didn&#8217;t have a lot of friends that were necessarily my age around that time but a lot of older friends, and that&#8217;s sad when they pass on because you&#8217;ve lost some really close friends early in your life and you miss those friendships.         I had one very close friend though that was my age and still is. Her name&#8217;s Nicole. Even though we lived miles apart &#8211; we were only together when I was in private school &#8211; we would write letters, and she had a great impact on my life, and still does. So, one very close friend that was my age; the others, a lot older.
EF: Well you had mentioned about you and your mom wanting to prove others wrong, go to college, that sort of thing, so that&#8217;s the next part. Can you describe your college experience?
MRB: Yes. Well I went to a school, North Greenville College in South Carolina, about an hour and a half from where I lived, and really enjoyed my time there. I changed my major several times though, and still had no idea what I was going to do. In my mind I really thought, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ll probably meet the man of my dreams, I won&#8217;t finish school, and I&#8217;ll just be a wife and mother,&#8221; which I thought was the greatest thing in the world. In my thoughts, and still today, I think the highest calling for a woman is to be a wife and mother. I think that you can have such an impact. So I didn&#8217;t even know if I was going to finish college, and it&#8217;s so crazy to even say that because now I have my doctorate and I&#8217;ve continued to go in education. I love education.         But I loved my experience there at North Greenville, changed my mind many, many times, and then after about two years I decided to transfer schools. I transferred to Wingate University, outside of Charlotte, and I chose Wingate because of their education program. They have a tremendous school of education. I went there, they gave me a tour of the campus, talked to a lot of the professors, and I was really impressed so I transferred. My parents were living in Charlotte at the time so I was able to commute from home, and I really enjoyed my experiences there at Wingate and I graduated there with a bachelor of science in education.
EF: Okay.
MRB: During my time there I student-taught at a school called Walter Bickett, which was a school that [had] a lot of low income students.
EF: Was it a high school?

MRB: No, it was an elementary school.
EF: Oh, elementary school, okay.
MRB: Yeah. I was offered a job after graduation with them but I really felt like I wanted more education. So at that time everybody was saying, &#8220;But you have your degree. You can make money.&#8221; And I was even starting out very good, but I knew in my heart I wanted to become&#8211;. Honestly, in my heart, I really wanted to study God&#8217;s word. I love to write, I love to read, I love to study the word, and I was looking over the catalog for Southeastern Seminary and they had a brand-new women&#8217;s study department, Women&#8217;s Studies, and I thought, Women&#8217;s Studies? Okay, that&#8217;s unique, because usually when you hear &#8220;Women&#8217;s Studies&#8221; on the graduate level, or even undergrad level, in your secular schools it&#8217;s feminism, right? And the definition of Women&#8217;s Studies is studies about, for, and by women. I thought, &#8220;I want to study that. I want to study about women. I want to study about studies about women, for women, by women. That&#8217;s so appealing to me, and to know that they have it at a seminary,&#8221; and I thought, &#8220;Well, how does that work? It&#8217;s at a seminary, Christian Women&#8217;s Studies, where I would be learning more about the feminist movement but I also would receive a biblical theology of womanhood, and creative writing, and communication skills for women, knowing that I had a heart to minister specifically to women.&#8221; I felt like that was really my life&#8217;s calling, to minister to women. I knew beyond a shadow of any doubt I was supposed to go.         So I moved to Wake Forest and began to take every Women&#8217;s Studies course that I could my first year. I was advised, &#8220;Do not do this. You&#8217;re going to be here for three years. Don&#8217;t take all your Women&#8217;s Studies courses at the same time.&#8221; But I was learning so much and I loved it. I just loved it. It was so challenging intellectually and theologically, and I was really in heaven. [Laughs] I loved studying everything I was studying and I thought, &#8220;Hey, even though I&#8217;m being advised to take systematic theology and Old Testament at the same time, I just want all Women&#8217;s Studies courses.&#8221; I did them all, took every Women&#8217;s Studies course in that one year.         I ended up not graduating from Southeastern though because that&#8217;s when I received a call from Liberty [University] to come and start a Women&#8217;s Studies program. Had I not taken all the Women&#8217;s Studies courses I definitely would not have been qualified to go teach. So they said, &#8220;Hey, finish your doctorate here. You can take other courses at other institutions that have Women&#8217;s Studies,&#8221; because Liberty did not and they still did not have a doctorate in Women&#8217;s Studies. So I went to Southwestern [Theological Seminary]. I took feminist theology there. I took a couple other classes at Southeastern. I did lots of independent study on women&#8217;s issues and Women&#8217;s Studies. I did my entire dissertation on a rationale for women&#8217;s education in the twenty-first century. They allowed me that freedom to do a lot of independent study, so that&#8217;s why I finished up my degree from Liberty, although a lot of my degree is independent study in Southwestern Seminary as well.
EF: Okay. That&#8217;s in Dallas?
MRB: Mm hmm.
EF: Okay.
MRB: Yes, in Dallas, Texas.
EF: So I want to get the trajectory correct. So you had only finished about a year or so of seminary at Southeastern in Wake Forest, but then Liberty already hired you to come, and not just finish your schooling there but to also create a whole new part of the seminary at Liberty as well?
MRB: Not the seminary, the undergrad,&#8211;
EF: Oh, I see.
MRB: &#8211;at the university level.
EF: I see, the undergraduate level.
MRB: Yes, so I had&#8211;.
EF: In the school of religion?
MRB: Yes, exactly. I just had a few classes left on my master&#8217;s degree.
EF: Okay.
MRB: So I actually moved there, I was not hired immediately. They asked me to create the Women&#8217;s Ministry program. So for about a year and a half all I did was research and write curriculum, so I wrote all the courses for Liberty in women&#8217;s ministry.
EF: And about what years were these?
MRB: This was starting in 2003, so I&#8217;ve been there eleven years.
EF: All right.
MRB: So I wrote for basically the first year. I had no clue that I would be asked to teach. I thought I was moving there to write curriculum. So I finished up my degree, was writing the curriculum, and then that&#8217;s when I was approached, &#8220;Would I write and would I present an academic program proposal for the undergrad level for a women&#8217;s ministry program?&#8221; Now, Women&#8217;s Ministry is different than Women&#8217;s Studies. I want to clarify. Women&#8217;s ministry has to do with a study of women in the church, history to the present. It has to do with a methodology, the how-to of ministering to women. So that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s different than Women&#8217;s Studies. So we have a Women&#8217;s Ministry program, which is hands-on. They learn feminist theology in a classroom but they learn hands-on, how can we minister to women today, different issues, different disorders, different phases of life that women go through.         So I was there for a year writing curriculum and then they asked me, and then that&#8217;s when I started teaching one class, so I wasn&#8217;t fulltime at first. For the first year I actually had three jobs. I was office manager of the campus pastor&#8217;s office, I taught Algebra I and II at a Christian school, and then I taught one night class. It was the first Intro to Women&#8217;s Ministry course ever in the history of Liberty University. I was the first woman to be hired fulltime in the school of religion in the history, which is significant. I didn&#8217;t go into it thinking, &#8220;Oh, goodness, the first woman!&#8221; I went into it really trembling, with fear and trembling, because this is a high honor and I wanted to build my rapport among the men. I didn&#8217;t want them to have the impression, &#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s coming here, she&#8217;s going to teach feminism, she&#8217;s going to take over.&#8221; I wanted them truly to see my heart, that I wanted to impact women. So it was challenging and I learned so much from all the male professors there too.         But that&#8217;s the order of how things progressed, and then after that year of teaching the one night class from 6:30 to 9:30 &#8211; which I would only give one ten-minute break because it was so much to cover &#8211; I look over that and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh my goodness.&#8221; I was pretty rigid my first year teaching. [Laughs] I had all these high expectations. But after that year then they asked me for fulltime, if I would be fulltime. I was finishing up my doctorate at that time.
EF: Okay. Well I think I got the path now.
MRB: Okay. [Laughs]
EF: I wonder if you can just &#8211; because I definitely want to ask more about some of the terms you&#8217;ve used, like &#8220;feminist theology&#8221; and &#8220;Women&#8217;s Studies&#8221; versus &#8220;women&#8217;s ministry.&#8221; But before that, can you detail a little bit more about how exactly you came to Liberty, like how did they know who you were and why did they reach out to you specifically to come?
MRB: That&#8217;s a great question because to this day I have no idea. I have no idea. All I can think of, I know that the president of Liberty Seminary at the time, Dr. Danny Lovett, probably found out from the director of the Women&#8217;s Studies program at Southeastern, which at the time was the first program ever on a seminary level to offer Women&#8217;s Studies.
EF: Okay, of all the different Southern Baptist&#8211;?
MRB: Of all the different Southern Baptist seminaries. It was the first.
EF: I see.
MRB: That pioneer woman, Dr. Dorothy Patterson, my mentor, she started that program at Southeastern. She had I guess a handful of students. I was one of her students. To this day I do not know how that happened except I received a phone call from Dr. Danny Lovett saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard you are in Women&#8217;s Studies. We would like to start a program here. Would you be interested in coming and interviewing?&#8221; I said no at first, because I didn&#8217;t think I was the right person for the job and it seemed too big. But then after much prayer I thought, &#8220;This is a great opportunity,&#8221; and I had peace about going.
EF: Okay.
MRB: So to this day I still do not know how it happened.
EF: [Laughs] Right, but&#8211;
MRB: It is a real funny story.
EF: &#8211;it did happen.
MRB: It did happen. It did happen.
EF: Well maybe you can clarify, as you&#8217;re at Liberty and as you&#8217;re writing curriculum and beginning to teach, you&#8217;re also still forming ideas as you take these other classes.
MRB: Absolutely.
EF: So can you talk a bit more about your ideas about feminism and then how they meshed with what you were learning theologically?
MRB: Yeah, absolutely. Well I would define feminism, secular feminism first of all, as the world&#8217;s view of womanhood. There are all kinds of different types of feminism in our world today and every woman has been impacted by feminism, whether they realize it or not. Studying history we learn that the feminist movement really began in the 1790s with the First Wave of feminism. However from a biblical perspective you could ask the question, &#8220;Well, when did feminism really begin?&#8221; From a theological standpoint we would say it began in Genesis 3, because Eve took on a different role than what she was designed to have. She went against God&#8217;s order and God&#8217;s design that had been put into place in Genesis 1 and 2. So feminism really originated in the fall of mankind, so from a theological perspective you can go all the way back there. Now, with the feminist movement beginning in the 1790s, as I studied that first movement &#8211; which 1790 to 1920 is what we look at as being the First Wave, 1920 being when women finally received the right to vote, which I&#8217;m so glad we have.
EF: Yes.
MRB: I studied that wave, and there may be other women that may disagree with me, with the perspective I have, but I see a lot of good that came out of that First Wave of feminism. It&#8217;s very interesting to me to study that movement because the basic thing that they were fighting for was suffrage. They wanted to be looked at as being equal citizens. Equality &#8211; again bringing in theology with this &#8211; equality is something that God designed: male and female created equal before God and yet having different roles and different assignments. So one of the main differences when you study feminism today, looking at the First Wave and then comparing it to modern feminism, is the way we define &#8220;equality,&#8221; because in the First Wave it&#8217;s like, &#8216;Okay, see me as being equal to the man,&#8221; and then 1960s to the present, especially in the present, women are wanting to take over a lot. A lot of women [want] to say, &#8220;We&#8217;re better than men.&#8221; So it&#8217;s almost like we have become what we once hated so there&#8217;s a shift in that whole thought.         So the whole feminist movement is so fascinating for me to study, and I still love studying it and I love teaching on it and learning more about that. I have friends that are feminists, so talking to them about their ideas and their perspectives is so interesting. But with modern feminism, that took on a completely different perspective than the First Wave, the whole history of modern feminism where, in the 1960s, so much changed. Women were told that they didn&#8217;t know who they were anymore. Well, I happen to believe that is still true today, so I believe with the Feminine Mystique what Betty was trying to point out is that women are clueless in regards to their identity. From a theological perspective I could not agree more. I agree with her completely. But her solution is something that I completely disagree with, that women will find themselves in a career, that they&#8217;ll find themselves by focusing on themselves first, even if that means leaving their husband and children if they&#8217;re not happy, becoming more educated. We have more women that are educated today than ever before in history. We have more women that are career women, more than ever in history, and still women don&#8217;t know who they are and they&#8217;re still unhappy. So her solution is something that I would disagree with from a theological perspective and by being a Christian woman. I would disagree with that solution. So I could say a lot more, but does that give you&#8211;? How&#8211; theology and feminism mesh to me isn&#8217;t in those ways.         EF: Definitely. From your perspective I&#8217;m glad that you went into detail. To follow that up and to get more clarification, can you talk about how, in your early years at Liberty as you began teaching, can you talk about what your classes on Women&#8217;s Studies looked like and how many Liberty undergraduates are coming through there? And what you&#8217;re teaching and that sort of thing?        MRB: Absolutely, yes. Well the first course is called a Survey of Women&#8217;s Ministry, and it&#8217;s basically an intro course where we study a theological view of womanhood, and we also study the feminist movement, we study women&#8217;s history, and we study a philosophy in women&#8217;s ministry. So it&#8217;s your intro course. So that&#8217;s the Survey of Women&#8217;s Ministry. We have a lot of young ladies that take that course. They have a heart to minister to women in need, whether that&#8217;s ministering to a woman who has an eating disorder, or who&#8217;s going through a divorce, or who is a battered woman. These students come with a great heart. Women in sex trade -- how do you minister to them? So they take this intro course, their eyes are really opened, their hearts become even more burdened, and the majority of them decide, &#8220;I want to either get a minor in women&#8217;s ministries or I want to actually major in this field.&#8221; So that&#8217;s our Survey of Women&#8217;s Ministry.         Another course is the Role of Women in Ministry, and in that course we go over your specific roles. What is the role of women? What are the different phases of life that women go through? Another course is the Christian Woman, which is basically spiritual formation for women today where we learn various spiritual disciplines and how can I become the woman that God wants me to be, how can I have purpose. Then we have a course that I&#8217;m actually currently writing on Women in Leadership. Leadership is a huge word that you hear about today, becoming a leader as a woman, and that doesn&#8217;t mean that women can only be leaders amongst women. Women can be leaders in the workplace, in different fields, politics, so it&#8217;s a course on women&#8217;s leadership. What is an effective leader?         Then there&#8217;s a course on Issues of a Woman&#8217;s Life, how to provide basic counseling to women in need, and then I teach a course on Methods of Teaching and Communication Skills where women learn how to write and how to communicate. They learn how to write Bible studies, how to communicate those Bible studies effectively, and to become really articulate speakers, whether that&#8217;s leading a small group or even in a big conference setting.         EF: Okay.        MRB: So that&#8217;s an overview of the courses.         EF: Sure, and you developed all of those.        MRB: Mm hmm.        EF: From scratch, essentially.        MRB: Yeah. There was nothing at all. But I love to write, and I love to research and read. It&#8217;s been one of the greatest thrills of my life to be able to do that. It wasn&#8217;t a burdensome task. It was something that I looked at with joy, like, &#8220;Oh! I get to write this! Let&#8217;s go for it.&#8221;         EF: You mentioned when you first arrived at Liberty you were the only woman in the school of religion, I assume?        MRB: Yes.        EF: Well let me back up. Can you talk about your path towards becoming a&#8211;? Well maybe you&#8217;ve already discussed it a bit, but you became a professor of women&#8217;s ministries, right?        MRB: Yes, yes.        EF: Okay. Well, can you describe  what&#8217;s it like being essentially the only woman in the seminary as a teacher, or a professor, and as &#8211; maybe I&#8217;m not a hundred percent right on this &#8211; but you&#8217;re either the only woman or one of a few women?        MRB: Yes, yes. There&#8217;s one other woman that was just hired last year and she&#8217;s over the Missions Department now.         EF: I see.        MRB: So now there are two in the school of religion, and according to our present dean, Dr. Ed Hindson, he would like to see some more women taking leadership positions. Now, it&#8217;s not that they have been against women taking those positions, but it&#8217;s hard to find women who have doctorate degrees in specific fields of study, and in order to teach on whatever level you are you have got to have courses within that discipline. For example, I would not be qualified to teach Women&#8217;s Ministry or Women&#8217;s Studies if I just had a heart for reaching women. There are a lot of women that have huge hearts but I had to have that terminal degree where I&#8217;ve had those courses, so it&#8217;s hard to find women that have those degrees.         But yes, when I was first hired it was something that&#8211;. I wanted to build my rapport. I recognized right on that I wanted to be looked at the right way. I didn&#8217;t want to go in as this leader that was going to be like, &#8220;You&#8217;re a man. Who cares about you? I&#8217;m here to take charge.&#8221; I wanted to make sure that they knew my heart, so I baked a lot of cookies and banana bread &#8211; [Laughs] that was a joke&#8211; for these men. But anyway, I became friends with them. I talked to them. I learned from them, their perspectives, and became great friends with all the professors there. But yeah, there were some challenges to make sure that I was understood correctly.        EF: Sure, sure. Well could you maybe go into a bit more detail about that?   [Brief interruption from 42:05 to 43:25; break in recording]
Okay and we are back. So you were continuing to tell about your relationship with some of the men in the seminary, as you were the first woman to come on board in the early 2000s, and start up the women&#8217;s ministries.
MRB: They opened up their arms to me and that meant so much to me, especially &#8211;putting away even gender &#8211; it was my first time to set foot in a classroom on that level. I had done some guest lecturing, but it really made the difference that they were so welcoming. They believed that we needed a woman teaching other women, specifically on women&#8217;s issues and all that, so they were so supportive. Their support really helped so much.
EF: Right, right. I&#8217;m wondering if you can talk a bit about, since being in Lynchburg, what else you&#8217;ve been involved in, maybe beyond the school, any other types of what you might consider to be activism, whether social activism or political activism, that sort of thing.
MRB: Well I started True Identity, which I started on campus for Liberty. It&#8217;s more reaching the community and churches, but we would go and we would really talk to teenage girls about who they were as women and how they could have purpose, so I was involved with that traveling team. I founded that and was involved with that for about seven years and then, with me writing even more courses and all that, I had to no longer do that. Then [I&#8217;m a] frequent speaker, very much associated with the Council of Biblical Manhood and Womanhood&#8211;.
EF: Council&#8211;?
MRB: The Council of Biblical Manhood and Womanhood.
EF: And what is that?
MRB: That&#8217;s an organization that takes the perspective of complementarianism, which believes men and women are created equal but they have different God-given roles, and it is based in Louisville, Kentucky. Anyway, they&#8217;ve been a real blessing. I attended the Evangelical Theological Society and that was my second year teaching I attended that. But frequent speaker, [and] really the platform that I speak on the most to women is on identity and purpose, and then I&#8217;ve done a lot of writing as well.
EF: So you&#8217;ve traveled to different conferences, I suppose,&#8211;        MRB: Yes.        EF: &#8211;and spoken on these various topics, but mostly about identity?        MRB: Mostly about identity, a woman&#8217;s security, purpose. I mean there are all kinds of different things I&#8217;ve spoken on but a lot of it ties into identity. I also speak for the Blush Conference, which is a very new, upcoming conference ministry. It&#8217;s about three years old now and real hardcore on women&#8217;s issues and I&#8217;ve spoken many times for them on women&#8217;s issues. I&#8217;ve spoken, and I continue to speak, for LifeWay Christian Resources out of Nashville, Tennessee on women&#8217;s issues. I&#8217;ll be speaking there in November on women ministering to women who are dealing with disorders, so I&#8217;ve done a lot of study on women&#8217;s issues and disorders so I talk about that as well, and I speak on communication skills. But from an inspirational perspective my heart is speaking on identity and security because I think those are the two main issues that women today struggle with, is their identity and security, and we get all mixed up when we don&#8217;t know who we are and we don&#8217;t know who we belong to, so that&#8217;s why that&#8217;s very near to my heart.         EF: Right. And I suppose you&#8217;ve discussed a good bit about identity, but I guess if you could elaborate a bit more on what you mean by &#8220;women&#8217;s security?&#8221;        MRB: Yeah, absolutely. So often we, as women, try to find our security in a man, or our husband, or where we&#8217;re living instead of having our security in Christ. I&#8217;m definitely a Christian so I have that perspective. That has changed my life. That has given me peace. But women, we often try to find our security in things and money, and none of those things are lasting. They&#8217;re all temporary. So I teach that having a personal relationship with Christ, knowing him, is how we discover who we are and from that identity, that true identity, is when we can be secure. We can hold our heads up high, regardless of the issues, regardless of the experiences, regardless of the harm, the horrible things that some of us have had happen to us. So many women are victims, but we can be strong with the Lord as our security, not things that are temporary securities that we so want to reach for. So that is what I speak on a lot because it&#8217;s changed my life.        EF: Okay. Well, as far as my questions are concerned that wraps it up, but I wanted to ask before turning off the recorder, is there anything else that you&#8217;d like to say or any other questions that I should have asked but did not?        MRB: Well, I think you&#8217;ve done a superb job, and I want to wrap it up by saying that my heart and calling is for women to really, really know who they are and for them to live out that identity based on what the scriptures teach us. I think that can change their lives but it also can change the way our culture, our world, our society is, if we have women who are influential, who set priorities outside of themselves, getting the focus off of themselves and onto others. That&#8217;s what can change the world. We have so much selfishness in our world today &#8211; I&#8217;m a very selfish person if I&#8217;m not thinking clearly or right, you know? But the purpose that God has for women is incredible. So that&#8217;s my life&#8217;s calling, and I so appreciate the interview.         EF: Absolutely. Thank you so much.
