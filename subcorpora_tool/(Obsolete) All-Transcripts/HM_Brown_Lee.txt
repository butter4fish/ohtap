Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Lee Patrick Brown [HistoryMaker Lee P. Brown].  The first name is L-E-E, and Patrick, P-A-T-R-I-C-K, and Brown, B-R-O-W-N.
Speaker 1: And, do you have any nicknames, or?
Speaker 2: Up until the time I became a police officer, my nickname was Pat.  It's taken obviously from my middle name.  My--other than that, I don't have really have any middle--any nicknames.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born on October the 4th, 1937 in Wewoka, that's W-E-W-O-K-A, Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Wewoka, Oklahoma, all right.  And, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, right now I'm a visiting scholar in the School of Social Sciences at Rice University in Houston, Texas.

Speaker 1: You're a lifelong criminologist, right, and--
Speaker 2: My career has been in law enforcement.  I started off as a young police officer.  And, have served in a number of law enforcement agencies starting as a police officer in San Jose, California where I started in 1960.  I did that for eight and a half years.  And, I left there and went to Portland, Oregon where I was a professor in criminal justice at Portland State University [Portland State College].  I did that for four years and went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] where I served as the associate director of the Institute for Urban Affairs and Research.  And, did that for two years, went back to Portland where I was the sheriff of Multnomah County [Oregon], that's M-U-L-T-N-O-M-A-H.  I did that for about a year and a half.  And, then I was appointed director of the Department of Justice Services.  And, that's a unique position because in that position, I had all of the criminal justice agencies in my department; the sheriff, the prosecutor, the courts, juvenile, jails, probation.  All those fell under one umbrella and I directed that department.  And then, after that I went to Atlanta, Georgia.  There was a national search for a public safety commissioner.  I came out number one.  Maynard Jackson was the, the mayor of Atlanta at the time.  So, in 1978, I went to Atlanta, Georgia as the public safety commissioner.  In that job, I was responsible for police, fire, correction, civil defense and also taxi cabs.  And, in fact, I had all the city's problems in my department (laughter).  And, did that for four years, and then in 197--1982, Kathy Whitmire [Kathryn J. Whitmire] got elected as the mayor of Houston, Texas.  And, she did a national search for a police chief.  I came out number one and joined the City of Houston as its police chief in 1982.  I stayed in that position for eight years.  And, then in 1990, [HistoryMaker] David [N.] Dinkins got elected mayor of New York City [New York, New York].  He in turn did a national search for the police commissioner of New York City.  I came out number one again, and went to New York [New York] as the police commissioner of New York City.  I did that for almost three years and my wife [Yvonne Brown] took ill.  She had--we determined that she had cancer, so I wanted to spend time with her.  So, I moved back to Houston so I--the family could be together.  And, went to Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas] where I was a distinguished university professor; did that for about a year.  And, then when my wife passed away in December of '92 [1992].  And, then I got a call, the White House [Washington, D.C.], from the people at the White House.  And, the president at that time, [President William Jefferson] Bill Clinton, wanted me to join his administration.  And, I ultimately did as a member of his cabinet, and director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy [ONDCP], and that's commonly called the Drug Czar.  The media labeled it the Drug Czar.  But, the correct name is the direct--director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.  Did that for almost three years and then decided, I was convinced, I didn't necessarily decide that I should come back to Houston and run for mayor.  So, I came back to Houston, campaigned, or I came and went to Rice University [Houston, Texas] for a year and a semester; a year and a half.  And, then declared my candidacy as mayor for the City of Houston.  At Rice I was a--I had a joint appointment.  I was a professor in sociology where I taught criminal justice classes and also the first senior scholar in the Baker Institute, James [A.] Baker [III] Institute for Public Policy.  I ran for mayor and, in 1997, got elected; became Houston's first African American mayor; took office on January the 2nd of 1998.  And, I served the maximum terms.  You can--we have term limits in Houston.  And, we have a lousy system where you only can--we serve two terms, you can only do three terms.  I served the maximum terms and then at this time, I'm back at Rice University as a visiting scholar in the School of Social Sciences.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, this seems strange after all that.  But, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is (laughter) November the 4th, 2004.  November the 4th, 2004.
Speaker 1: And, where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Right now, we're in Houston, Texas.  We're downtown in a high rise office building in Houston, Texas.  Where I also will be officed when I finish Rice University.
Story_ID: 534713
Speaker 1: Now before we get into depth, I have to ask these five lightweight questions. I'm compelled by management to do this and they, they only require a short answer.  The first one is, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well, I like a variety of food, and it's the food I've always liked the best would be good home cooking.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Brown.  That's an easy one (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: The fall is the best time of the year for me.  Particularly living in Houston [Texas].  Houston gets hot and humid become--when October runs around until around April, it's a chamber of commerce weather like today.  It's a beautiful day out there.  Not hot, not cold, but it's perfect.  So, I like the fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  I like the, the islands and the, and the Caribbean.  My wife [Frances Young Brown] and I, I remarried by the way, so, my wife and I, we go there periodically.  We like the Bahamas and we like some of the Mexican islands such as Cancun [Mexico], Cozumel [Mexico].  So, I like the Caribbean islands.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, I probably--if I chose one it would be what I usually say to young people.  And, that is to stay in school and get a good education.  I probably say that more than anything else.
Story_ID: 534714
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Andrew Brown] side.  We'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Zelma, Z-E-L-M-A, Brown, B-R-O-W-N.
Speaker 1: What was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Edwards.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Mississippi.  I don't know her date of birth off the top.  But, she was born in Mississippi and moved to Oklahoma at a young age.  And, that's where she met my father.  And, she lived in Oklahoma for most of her years as a young person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would you guess--was she born around, close to 1910, nineteen--I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well, she passed away about--in 1997, and she was eighty-eight at that time.  So, we could probably do the math and come with--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: An exact date.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Somewhere around 1912 or 1913 [sic. 1909], I guess.  Now, tell me what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Not very far.  And, probably no more than her parents.  I pursed that but we didn't get very far.  Her memory of what had--of her parents didn't go very far back.  So, we don't know much about the history of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know what town in Mississippi that she was from?
Speaker 2: I do.  It's written down.  I don't recall, though.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Did she talk about why the family moved from Mississippi to Oklahoma?  I mean, it's, it's probably obvious to a lot of people, but.
Speaker 2: Like most people, they moved in search of a better way of earning a living.  So, it's job related.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, they were in a position to actually move.  I know a lot of people in Mississippi were in situations where they couldn't move 'cause they owed money and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They were told they owed money anyway.
Speaker 2: Her memory was not that good on what happened beyond, before Oklahoma 'cause she was young when she moved.  And, so about all that she recall would be living in Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, did you know many of the relatives on that side?  Did you know your grandparents on that side?  I mean--
Speaker 2: I knew both of my grandparents.  My mother's mother, Haylia Edwards [ph.].  In fact, when I, when I was in Oklahoma we would at--sometimes even live in her house.  So, those--she, I do know.  I knew a number of her brothers and sisters.  So, yes, I do know some of the members of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what were they like?  What were they like, and what did they do for a living?
Speaker 2: They were doing a variety of things.  One was a farmer in Oklahoma, Wewoka [Oklahoma], when I was--when we lived there.  A number left Oklahoma.  One went to Canada.  Several came to California, ended up around Bakersfield, California.  One was a minister.  One ran a restaurant and nightclub.  So, there was a variety of things that they did.
Story_ID: 534715
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Zelma Edwards Brown] talk about growing up in Wewoka [Oklahoma], and what it was like to grow up there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We discussed that a lot in her older years.  'Cause I was kind of curious myself about what life was like then.  And, some of the things I remember, some I don't.  But, those were difficult times for, I guess, most people of color during those days.  If not, but not everyone but particular people of color.  It was--she talked about the segregation that she had to endure; the discrimination; the inability to find meaningful employment to earn a living and take care of the family.  So, there were many discussions about some of the really hard times that occurred there.  And, I guess also, there were discussions about family and how the family helped each other and kind of helped take care of the--one family helped take care of another family.  For example, at one point in our lives, I knew, I know that we lived with my uncle.  And, so, it's kind of more of, more of a family atmosphere than we see existing today.  I know that we lived with my [maternal] grandmother [Haylia Edwards (ph.)] at one time.  So, when one family kind of fell on hard times, the others would reach out and help them.  One thing she would talk about was the discrimination that took place against African Americans at that time in a little small town called Wewoka, Oklahoma.  We couldn't go to the movie theater and sit with everyone else; sit with the whites.  We had to sit downstairs; white would sit upstairs.  So, those the kind of things that we talk, when I had enough maturity to ask questions about her background.
Story_ID: 534716
Speaker 1: The '30s [1930s], now around the time that you were born, if I'm not wrong here, the Dust Bowl had hit Oklahoma.  I mean, there was a, one aspect of the, you know, this tremendous drought that made the [Great] Depression even worse in Oklahoma.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was born in 1937 and as I said, I left when I was five years of age.  That's one of the reasons we left.  My family and several other families, we were all on an old truck.  And, this gentleman used to make his living by driving the truck back and forth from Oklahoma to California relocating people.  We were part of that migration into California.  Again, looking for work, looking for a means of making a living.  And, so, my memories of Oklahoma are not that good.  I do remember the trip from Oklahoma to California.  And, I remember when we first landed here, or landed there, close to Fresno, California, a place called Sanger [California] on De Wolf Avenue.  And, I still recall my mother [Zelma Edwards Brown] and those other ladies getting off the truck.  We were on a grape farm, and they looked at the grapes on the vines, and the peaches in the trees, and kind of shouted, "Hallelujah!  We're in the land of milk and honey.  We must be in heaven."  And, I joke about it right now.  But, we were not there to eat the grapes.  We were there to pick them.  And, I could imagine some years later, some months later, when we were all under those grapevines cutting grapes, we probably thought, "Well, maybe we didn't go to heaven.  We could've gone in the wrong direction."  Particularly considering that we had over a hundred degree heat in that time and you're out there cutting grapes.  But, and we lived in an old barn at that time.  As we had several families in the barn.  We would use sheets to separate our part of the barn; that's our house, from others family's part of the house.  And, when we finally did get a house, we moved into Fowler, California and stayed there for a while.  And, that's where I went from elementary school [Fowler Elementary School, Fowler, California] to high school [Fowler High School], in Fowler.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I do recall rather vividly those days, we moved into a house and stayed there just for a short time that was owned by the, a Japanese family.  At that time, which was a sad chapter in the history of America, the Japanese were interned and their property was rented out.  So, we stayed there for a while.  When the Japanese were released and they came back home, then we moved out into the, I call it the country.  We moved on a grape farm and our house was just separated--surrounded by grapes and one house sitting there.  It was a one bedroom house for my mother and father [Andrew Brown], one sister, and five brothers.  So, there's seven kids and one bedroom.  So, the boys, all six of us, we'd live in an old army tent.  That was our house.  We, like most people in the country in those days, we did not have running water.  We pumped our water.  We didn't have indoor plumbing.  So, we had an outhouse.  That's the environment which I grew up in.  Not, not having any economic advantages.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me ask you, about concerning your mother.  Did she have a chance to get much education in Wewoka [Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: As far as I can tell, my mother got a second grade education.  So, she did not have the opportunity to go to school and get a good education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 534717
Speaker 1: Give us your father's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Andrew Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, that's spelled A-N-D-R--
Speaker 2: E-W.
Speaker 1: E-W.  Okay.  No middle name, or anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Oklahoma and I do not know his date of birth off hand either.  He passed away at a relatively young age, in his mid-fifties.  And, he passed away in, I think in 1963.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, about 1910, 1911, would--
Speaker 2: Somewhere along that, yes.
Speaker 1: --be along that--okay.  And, he was born in Oklahoma.  But, you don't know if it was Wewoka [Oklahoma] or not?
Speaker 2: I don't.  I don't know.  It's written down someplace, I just don't recall right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  So, well, what do you know about your father's side of the family?  About the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew his mother very well.  In fact, she came out to California, and lived in Stockton, California with her, one of her sons and my uncle, my father's brother.  I knew him and I knew another brother very well 'cause we were all in close proximity to each other.  We were in Fowler [California] and they were in Stockton, which is a short drive.  So, I would see them all the time.  Those are the ones I know very well.  The other one's I, I do not know very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did you--did your father have a chance to go to school in Oklahoma, or?
Speaker 2: No.  Best I have been able to determine, he got about a first grade education.  And, the reason was, he was--had to go out like many people and work the fields in order to make a living for the family.  So, he did not get a chance to get an education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you weren't out there long, but did your father ever talk about the black towns in Oklahoma, which are--at one time it was over thirty of 'em.  But--
Speaker 2: I don't recall.  We lived in Wewoka.  We lived in McAlester [Oklahoma].  And, those are the two places that I have a memory of.  I am aware of some of the black towns but I don't recall his ever talking about it.  My father was not a very talkative man to begin with.
Story_ID: 534718
Speaker 1: Has there been a story passed down to you as to how your parents [Zelma Edwards Brown and Andrew Brown] met?
Speaker 2: No.  I do not know.  And, my father is part Choctaw Indian [Native American], maybe about a quarter Choctaw Indian.  And, I never heard anyone described how they met, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, now what were your parents like?  I mean, what were their personalities like, and--
Speaker 2: As I said, my father was a quiet man.  He was a hardworking man.  Went out and tried to make a living for the family in the agricultural field with the disadvantage of not having a good education.  My mother was a, I guess, the epitome of motherhood.  She took care of her family; made sure that we had food on the table.  She worked as well.  She was in the fields.  She was a cook for a number of years.  She cooked at a truck stop there in Fowler, California.  And, to a large degree, I attributed my going on to school to her.  'Cause she would always say, "Stay in school.  Get a good education."  But, for her that meant going to high school; finishing high school.  Because, having never gone to high school herself, she knew nothing about college.  And, so, but, see I attribute a lot of my doing the things that I've done in life to her encouraging me to get a good education, which meant finishing high school [Fowler High School, Fowler, California].
Story_ID: 534719
Speaker 1: Do you have a first childhood memory, an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, the things I remember the most would be the days we lived in Wewoka, Oklahoma.  I could remember one of the old houses we lived in where we have--we're across the street from Douglass High School [Wewoka, Oklahoma].  I remember that there was a little creek that run behind our house.  I can remember goats, goats in the backyard.  I can remember living in my mother's [Zelma Edwards Brown] house in the country where the other kids older than me were going to school.  And, I was too young to go to school.  And, so, I would--had the chore of taking the food to school.  My grandmother [Haylia Edwards (ph.)] would cook the food and I would carry it up to the school.  And, the teacher lived in the house with us.  So, it was a real collegial environment.  I remember that.  And, those are the things that I remember.  I remember the trip from Oklahoma to California as well.  We always talk about the fact, one of my brothers; the one who's just a couple of years older than me.  We stopped someplace along the way in the desert and went off and left him.  So, along the way my mother counted her kids and one was missing.  So, we talk about that oft--quite often.  She had to go back and get that truck driver to go back and find her son.
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of state was he in when they, they found him?
Speaker 2: He was fine.  He was there playing (laughter).  He apparently--
Speaker 1: So, you never noticed, huh?
Speaker 2: Didn't know we left him, apparently.  But, those are the kind of things I remember.  I remember landing in Fresno [California], as I mentioned early on that grape farm.  I remember moving into Fowler [California], moving in the country, moving into Fowler again.  So, those are the childhood mem--
Speaker 1: This is, this is the trip that John Steinbeck writes about in '[The] Grapes of Wrath,' where you see people with a load, or the truck loaded down with everything they owned.  So, this is how you all--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Came across just like--
Speaker 2: Very similar to the, 'The Grapes of Wrath.'  We lived it.  We--I read the book also.  But, we, we certainly lived that lifestyle.
Speaker 1: Could you relate to what he wrote in the book?  I mean, did it seem real to you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the time I read the book, yes I could.  'Cause we were that he wrote about in many ways.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He wrote about white people that were catching hell out there, you know, the economic conditions and educational deficiencies that they have, and you're all a black family, you know, in the same situation.
Speaker 2: Well, we were black and as was the case during those days that there were also the element of segregation, discrimination, and racism that we had to deal with in addition to being poor.
Speaker 1: I guess that couldn't made it any better.  I would guess.
Speaker 2: That made it worse.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 534720
Speaker 1: Any other stories about that trip you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, that's what I remember.  I remember being on there.  There were wooden benches set up on the truck and we all sat on those benches and made the trip out there.  I remember when we arrived.  Some of my, some of the members on that truck stopped off in Phoenix [Arizona].  So, I ended up with relatives in Phoenix and friends in Phoenix.  Some stopped off in Bakersfield [California] and for whatever reason we ended up in Fowler, California on grape fields, grape fields out there.  So, people stopped off at different places along the way.  Mainly Phoenix, Bakersfield, and the Fresno [California] area.
Speaker 1: And, you said a man was driving the truck who was just driving people back and forth.  He made his living driving people?
Speaker 2: That's what he was doing.  It was his business bring people from Oklahoma to California.  Or, I guess, to Arizona as well.
Speaker 1: How long did the trip take?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was five years of age at the time.  So, my memory is not that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Clear on that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 534721
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up in Fowler [California]?  You were there for a while, but you were a lot of different places in California, right?  Well, what was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I grew up in Fowler.  Fowler is a little small town.  It's an agricultural city--town.  It's a--it's in the San Joaquin Valley [California], which is one of the agricultural centers of America.  And, a lot of the industries centered around agriculture, particularly grapes for raisins and wine.  One thing about it, we had a decent school system.  It was very diverse at the time.  The African Americans, a large number of Hispanics, and Armenians, and Japanese, as well as, whites, all went to school together.  I got a good education there.  'Cause I was getting the same education that everyone else got, and that I have a great appreciation for.  But, it was still very segregated.  Blacks lived in one part of the town.  Hispanics lived on the other, and whites lived in another part of the town.  And, our lives at school, we would play together but, soon as the school bell would ring and we went home, we went into a segregated environment.  Just as, just as is the case most places, segregated by where we lived, our residential segregation.  I remember a lot of things about Fowler because I was older enough to remember.  I remember that we spent a lot of time working.  We would cut grapes during the summertime, we'd chopped cotton, we'd pick cotton.  I remember we would go to Watsonville, California as we would pick the plums from which the prunes, prunes are made.  We would pick strawberries.  We did all the agriculture work; pick olives.  So, we were to some extent migrant farm workers with one major exception.  My parents [Zelma Edwars Brown and Andrew Brown] always made sure we had a home to come back to, and to go to school.  So, during the summer times, we would do the work.  On the weekends, we do the work.  After school, we do the work.  But, we also maintained a home.  That distinguished our style of migratory farm work from others who, where they never had a, really a place where they lived.  They moved from one crop to another.  And, one season to another.  I remember the fact that in my later years, we would go to--out there near Bakersfield, California and pick potatoes.  And, we'd sleep on the banks of the river, the irrigation ditch.  We--that's how we sleep and we would--and then my junior year in high school [Fowler High School, Fowler, California], we'd, a number of us would jump in a car and we'd go down to Blythe, California and pitch watermelons.  So, most, most of the memories I have would be, dealing with the work that we would have to do; dealing with living on a farm; pumping water; having an outhouse; seeing my father kill and strip down the hogs for our food.  So, those are kind of things that come to mind when I think about Fowler.
Story_ID: 534722
Speaker 1: I also think about the fact that I, as I said earlier, I got a good education there.  The school was good.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: In fact, just a few weeks ago, I went back to Fowler [California] for my 49th high school class reunion, which was very interesting.  There is a thing that struck me more than anything else, as I looked at the graduating class photo for 1955, there are several blacks in the class and I was--I'm the only one that's still alive in--for some reason.  That was kind of something that struck me more than anything else.  Most of the friends that I knew, that graduated with me are no longer living.  Fowler, as I said, is not a large city.  There were sixty people that were in my graduating, about sixty in my graduation class.  But, they were not all from Fowler.  They were from the rural areas and other cities like Malaga [California] and places like that.  They're--it's a unified school district so different communities came to Fowler High School [Fowler, California].  I look back on my days in elementary school [Fowler Elementary School, Fowler, California] and I can remember that I was always a good student.  I had the blessings of being a good student.  In high school, I was a good student.  One of the, one of the persons that graduated with me reminded me that when I, when we took the examination to go to college only the two of us, him and myself passed the English exam.  Which was kind of interesting because there are people who theoretically were supposed to be much brighter than, at least me; not necessarily him.  But, only two of us passed the English exam.  That had some significance that meant we did not have to take the bonehead English.  My fellow classmates, they voted me the most athletic in my graduating class, the most athletic.  I played football, basketball, track, and swimming.  Swimming you're just kind of playing around.  I was not ever a fast swimmer.  Track was never very serious either.  But, we all, some, some of the--my friends were good track people.  I was not.  But, I'd go out and play with the shot put and discus, and spend more time trying to high jump than anything else.  That was more fun.
Story_ID: 534723
Speaker 1: You've got seven, six brothers and sisters, right?  And, you're the seventh.  I guess, but you--
Speaker 2: There are seven of us all together.
Speaker 1: Altogether, right.  And, you're the third from the youngest (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My oldest brother named after my father [Andrew Brown].  His name is Andrew [Brown, Jr.].  Next would be my sister, Geraldine [ph.].  Then another brother, Nick [ph.]; Napoleon's [ph.] his name.  Then Nathaniel [ph.], then myself, and then Ira [ph.], and then Earl [ph.].  So, there's seven of us altogether.  Two of them have passed away.  My brother Ira passed away, and so did my brother Nathaniel.  So, we lost two of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, what was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: Fowler, F-O-W-L-E-R.
Speaker 1: Fowler Elementary School [Fowler, California]?
Speaker 2: Fowler Elementary and Fowler High School [Fowler, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  There're all (unclear) in the same building?
Speaker 2: They're two separate facilities, physical facilities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, they all--they both serve the small town that I grew up in.

Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a young man growing up?  What was your personality like, and what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: Well, I do recall being teased a lot 'cause I always had a book in my hand.  I was--I kind of at a young age valued learning.  I would read a lot.  In fact, they used to call me a bookworm.  And, today when I look back on that nickname that they gave me, I kind of chuckle to myself.  So, I'm glad I was a bookworm 'cause I served as the mayor of this great city [Houston, Texas] and they did not, so.  But, I studied.  I as was good student, and also a good athlete also.  I was a good football player and not an outstanding but a decent basketball player.  And, as is the case in a small town [Fowler, California] like that, all the athletes played all the sports.  That's why I was out there playing football, basketball, track.  I didn't play baseball because when the baseball season came around, I--we didn't have any money to buy baseball shoes so I couldn't--I didn't play baseball.  Rather, I messed around and really--that's a good description of it, messed around in track.  I used to be with everyone and have things to do.  But, I might also add that, that, that's probably a good thing in having those sports.  It kept us busy after school.  It gave us something to do to kill the time rather than getting in trouble.  I also remember during those days I was a member of the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  They provided us with some constructive activity at nighttime to kind of keep us out of trouble.  I taught Sunday school.  I was the--we'd go to Sunday school, go to church every Sunday.  My mother [Zelma Edwards Brown] was a real Christian.  She, she believed in the teachings of the Bible and so we would go to church.  I'd go to Sunday school; I'd teach there.  I go to church service and then we come back in the afternoon for service and surely come back at night for service.  So, Sunday was really church time.  We kind of devoted that day to church.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: It was St. Paul A.M.E. Church [Fowler, California]; St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there, was there a Baptist Church in the black community, too?
Speaker 2: When we first went there, there was not.  My mother was Baptist and that was the only church, the only black church in the city.  Some years later there was a Baptist, black Baptist church that opened up just a couple of blocks from the church that we went to.  But, we remained A.M.E.  I'm still in A.M.E.; very active now.  Not, not active in terms of being a trustee or anything but I attend the [Payne] Cathedral of Faith A.M.E. Church [Payne Chapel A.M.E. Church] here in Houston, Texas right now.

Speaker 1: So you were studious, and you're an athlete and were you--what were your aspirations when you were a young man?  Did you have any heroes or any idea of what you wanted to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: You know it's interesting, as a young person, we did not have--there were no television so we didn't see the things we see today--that many role models.  The role model that I kind of remember more than anyone was a man named Willis Adams [ph.].  He was a role model because he's probably the best worker in the agricultural fields.  He was probably the best.  He had the best crew in pitching watermelons.  He was able to do, to cut more grapes, turned more trays than anyone else.  So, it looked at someone that was doing something good.  It was just one man, and what he was doing was a hard worker.  Beyond that, you know, we didn't have many African American success stories that we were able to see.  We were--we knew about the ministers, obviously they were someone who could serve as a role model.  But, just--there wasn't many role models for African Americans at that time.  Even, even considering the fact that there was no television that made it even worst for us.  We knew our local community and that's about it.  So, that's one of the reasons I read a lot.  I was able to travel to foreign places, meet people, I did all that by going to the library picking, picking out books to read.
Speaker 1: What were your favorite books?
Speaker 2: Oh, some of the classics that we would be exposed to in school, you know, 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer' [Mark Twain], and things of that nature.  As I got older, I started reading books about African American history, black history if you would, in this country.  And, but, just to begin with, there were just, the books that we were exposed to in school, I would take them home and read them.  Check them out of the library and read them.  Things about other places, other people, that's how I kind of broaden my horizon by going to the library.
Speaker 1: Can you remember, who were the authors of some of the black history books were that you read?
Speaker 2: Well, I do now because I taught black history at one time.  The traditional ones W.E.B. Du Bois and the whole--Langston Hughes, and all the group of writers that were doing things at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Harlem Renaissance-type writers, okay.
Story_ID: 534726
Speaker 1: How was your social life in high school [Fowler High School, Fowler, California]?  Did you, you do a lot of dating in high school?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No.  We kept busy; kept busy in school in the day time.  In the summertime, we were out working in the agricultural fields, chopping cotton, picking cotton.  And, the grape season would come around, we'd cut the grapes.  And, then a lot of the work we did were in grapes that were made, turn into raisins.  When the ra--when the grapes dried into raisin, we would come and turn the trays over, get the other side dry.  And, then after that, we had to roll them up.  Some of the grapes that were cut were to be made into wine.  So, we had to do that.  So, our time was spent working.  In fact, in elementary school [Fowler Elementary School, Fowler, California], I had a little part-time job.  I'd go out and cut grass for people, make myself a quarter for cutting grass.  And, then we were busy with the sports, and so, we did not have a lot of time to do things like most boys that age.  We'd all hang out together and we'd talk about girls but there's not much more than talking (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, well, I mean, were you and honor student in high school?
Speaker 2: I got mostly A's, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did they have any kind of honors for students that did that, or?
Speaker 2: Not that I kno--not that I can recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any teachers in high school and grade school that really stand out as important to you?
Speaker 2: There were a couple.  Miss Fever [ph.] she was in elementary school.  She was very helpful in terms of kind of taking a special interest in you.  Miss Heines [ph.] in high school; no, she was in elementary school, was very helpful as well.  And, my high school coach was probably the most helpful, Lloyd Lease [ph.], who has passed away.  I remember him because he kind of kept us busy.  He gave me a job in my last year of high school.  I was paid a few dollars a week for just take--checking in and taking the towels from the athletes.  That was generally during the baseball and track season.  So, he kind of helped us tremendously.  Miss Blaney [ph.], she was a P.E. [physical education] teacher so we were very--she was very helpful.  So, there're a number of teachers that come to mind that just took an interest in us and helped us out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My high school principal, Mr. Pizer [ph.], he was helpful.
Story_ID: 534727
Speaker 1: You were saying that in, I guess, you'd had been like about eight or nine I guess when the Japanese were rounded up.  And, then what do you remember about that, again?  I mean, the details of that?
Speaker 2: Well, two things; number one, we moved into one family's house because the house were vacated and we lived in one for a short period of time.  And second, I remember that when they would return home, we were all called into an assembly and told by the principal [at Fowler Elementary School, Fowler, California] that the Japanese was returning so be good to them.  Not in those words, but that was the message he sent, to be good to them.  And, when they returned, there were no problems what so ever.  In fact, some of them became good friends, some of the young guys became good friends with me and my other friends.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, they reintegrated into--?
Speaker 2: They did.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They did.  You know, from our young age, we didn't see any difference than anybody else.  And, probably that was one of the good things about growing up in Fowler [California] because of the diversity of the population there.  They came back to their homes.  And, we moved out, moved to the country and we would all hang out together after school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you notice any--I mean, did they ever talk about what happened to 'em during the time that they were--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't recall any conversation about how they were treated.  Or, the fact that they were interned.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 534728
Speaker 1: On the verge of graduating from [Fowler] High School [Fowler, California], did--what were you prospects?  What were you thinking of doing?
Speaker 2: As I said, I was a fairly good football player and I got a scholarship to go to Fresno State [College; California State University, Fresno, Fresno, California].  And, that year, my last year, I was selected to play in the all-star football game.  It was the city against the county.  I was in the country 'cause, we're a small town.  Fresno [California] was the city, so we had a team of county people to play the first game.  And, we beat them, by the way.  And, I received a football scholarship to go to Fresno State University.  And, so, that summer the coach got me a job in Fresno working in a cleaners.  So, I didn't have to work in the field that last summer.  I'd wash clothes; put them in the washing machine, take 'em out, put 'em in the dryer.  That's what I did for that summer.  And, then I went to Fresno State when school started.  Well, before school started 'cause the athletes would come there first.
Speaker 1: Now, what position did you play in football?
Speaker 2: In those years, we played both ways.  I was an offensive guard and defensive tackle, in college.  In high school, I played just the tackle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I went to--moved into the dormitory, which was an old army barracks there next to the--right across the street from the football stadium.  And, that's where I lived during the time I was in college 'til I got married [to Yvonne Streets].  And, my ambition at the time was to become a high school football coach.  So, I was gonna major in physical education [P.E.] and then ultimately become a high school football coach.  That didn't materialize primarily because I didn't have a car.  When it came time to register, I had to catch a ride with someone else.  Ironically, the person I caught a ride with, his name was Lynn Brown [ph.], no relations to my family, but he and his family were on the same truck that brought us from Oklahoma to California.  He was a couple years older than I was and had gone to Bakersfield Junior College [Bakersfield College, Bakersfield, California].  And, Lynn had majored in criminology.  And, so, I caught a ride to him--with him, they were not registering P.E. majors, they were registering people who wanted to major in the social sciences.  So, Lynn signed up for criminology and I signed up for criminology only because I had no way to get back to that campus.  And, if the trust be told, I never heard the word criminology before that day (laughter), but that's, that's how I got started.  And, I felt that I would still wanna be a football coach so I took a lot of P.E. courses so I would ultimately change my major.  I did not.  I found out that I liked criminology courses and decided I wanted to be a juvenile probation officer.
Story_ID: 534729
Speaker 1: So, I majored in criminology with an emphasis on corrections.  I had a desire to help young people even at that young, young age.  I played football there [Fresno State College; California State University, Fresno, Fresno, California] for three years and did not play my senior year for a lot of reasons.  One, I was married [to Yvonne Streets], and I had to work most of the time in order to earn a living.  And, my last three years, I worked at a place called Fred Boyd's Hi Life [Restaurant], which was one of the best restaurants in Fresno [California].  I started off going in there at five o'clock in the morning, mopping the floors and washing the dishes.  I then, go to school, take some classes, come back at noon and wash dishes, then go back to school, and come back in the evenings and wash dishes again.  I ultimately became the supervisor of the cleanup crew in the morning.  Then, they put me behind the, behind the stove as a cook's helper.  My job was to kind of just dish up the food when the cook told me to do so.  Then, I became a salad maker.  I worked in the pantry and made salads and ultimately became a cook there at the Fred Boyd's Restaurant.  Those were the last few years when I was married, I got married in 1958.
Speaker 2: Now, how did you meet your wife?  And, what?
Speaker 1: I was seventeen years old in college and none of the (laughter) girls in college because they were older than me, wanted to mess with me.  So, what I would do, I'd go over to the high--
Speaker 2: So, this is '54 [1954], right, when you started college?
Speaker 1: Fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955], okay.  Nineteen fifty-five [1955], okay.
Speaker 1: And, so, what I'd do after--I'd go over to, this is in Fresno, I'd go to the Edison [Technical] High School [Edison High School, Fresno, California] football games.  That's the black college in Fres--black high school in Fresno, and I saw my wife and she was one of those pep girls.  She was out there cheering on the crowd and I spoke to her.  And, in fact, I think I can still remember what I said, I said, "You're pepping good."  Or, "You're doing a good job pepping," or something like that.  So, we struck up a conversation.  And, we'd talk on the phone and finally we got to dating and then we ultimately ended up getting married.  She'd left and went to San Francisco State [College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] for a year.  So, it was year where she was not in Fresno.  When she came back, we renewed our relationship and ultimately got married.  But, that's when I--I can remember the first date.  I went to take her to a movie and went by her house and her father (laughter) was sitting out there in the lawn.  That kinda scared me here, that's my first time I've ever taken someone on a date and there seems like the father there waiting for me (laughter).
Story_ID: 534730
Speaker 1: In my freshman year [at Fresno State College; California State University, Fresno, Fresno, California], I did not work at Fred Boyd's Hi Life [Restaurant, Fresno, California], but I worked at a little hamburger stand.  I'd go in there and mop their floors.  And, as I said, we stayed in the dormitory where we had a room.  I'd--my brother was also a football player, Nick [ph.].  And, so, he and I were roommates my first year.  We had a common bathroom, common kitchen, common shower for everyone, 'cause it was literally an old army barracks.  That's how I started college.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  So, criminology starts to become interesting to you--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --as you study--
Speaker 1: It was probably interesting because we had a lot of guest speakers.  They'd bring in probation officers.  They'd bring in police officers to talk to us in the classes.  I just found that intriguing 'cause before that I never had any positive experience with anyone in the criminal justice system particularly the police.  And, so, you come to learn that they're your neighbor, you know your, so, they're the same as everyone else when you get a chance to meet them out of their official capacity.  And, I start, particularly in the correctional area, I liked the juvenile probation officers when they came in and talked about their job.  Their job was a helping job.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  So, now you were there like, you got married [to Yvonne Streets] there, you stopped playing football your senior year, so did you figure to go on to graduate school in criminology or did you?
Speaker 1: Well, no.  I stopped playing for a number of reasons.  Number one, I'd played there three years and my football scholarship was fifty dollars per month only during football season.  So, we didn't make a lot of money obviously.  And, they changed the scholarship program.  And when they were going to give scholarship for what would be my last year, the new coach came in and he wanted to give me the same fifty dollars a month only during football season.  They were giving other people who had never played there before a better scholarship.  I thought that was very discriminatory.  So, I took a stand and I just didn't go back.
Story_ID: 534731
Speaker 1: You had young people coming in from junior colleges.  I knew I was better than them because I played first string for--before and they would get a better scholarship than I got.  And, that was not fair.  So, I did not play my last year.  But, in addition to that, I did work long hours.  I would get up and be at work at five o'clock in the morning.  Work there for about three hours, clean up the [Fred Boyd's Hi Life] Restaurant [Fresno, California].  As, I mentioned earlier, go to school, come back at noon, work a couple hours, go back to school, come back at night and work.  And, on Saturday, I work all day Saturday and half a day on Sunday.  Well, I was putting in sixty hours a week, plus going to school, plus having a family.  And, they pay me--they only paid me one dollar an hour so I had to work that number of hours in order to pay the rent and buy food for my family.  So, when I decided not to play football, I also decided to leave Fresno [California], whatever reason, I say, it was the creator's master plan.  I decided to go up the San Mateo County [California] right outside of San Francisco [California] and apply for a position as a juvenile probation officer because that county had the reputation of having a good juvenile probation department.  I got there, they told me I wasn't qualified because I only had three and a half years of college.  I needed one more, one more semester.  I looked in the papers and I saw that San Jose [California] was hiring police officers and they only required two years of college.  So, on the way back to Fresno, I went by and signed up and two year--two weeks later I was walking a beat in San Jose.  So, that was purely by coincident.  I still say, it's the plan of the creator that I would first major in criminology; second, become a police officer.
Speaker 2: Now, were you the first black police officer in San Jose?
Speaker 1: I was the second.  A Francis Tanner was the first one there.  Francis has subsequently passed away.  But, he was, he was the first.  I was the second.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, this is 1960--
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960], 1960.
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960], okay.  Okay, 1960.
Speaker 1: I continued to take classes at San Jose State [College; San Jose State University, San Jose, California] because they'd belong to the same state system, I transferred the classes back to Fresno.  Then one semester I needed.  And, got my degree from Fresno State [College; San Francisco State University, Fresno, Fresno, California].  But, I also continued to go to school and got a, and got a master's degree from San Jose State in sociology with an emphasis in criminology.  In fact, I even took an internship with the Santa Clara County [California] juvenile probation department, still thinking that I would become a juvenile probation officer.  But, I found I like police work.  And, so, I changed my career aspiration.  I continued my education as well.  I applied for and was accepted into the doctorate program at University of California, Berkeley [Berkeley, California] and the School of Criminology.  And, I took classes there.  I'd commute from San Jose to Berkeley [California] to take the classes.  And, then I guess it was 1968, I was awarded a fellowship by the U.S. Department of Justice their Office of Law Enforcement Assistance [Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA)].  They picked thirty police sergeants from throughout the country to give them a fellowship to go to college and get a master's degree in criminology or criminal justice.
Story_ID: 534732
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to San Jose [California] when you started.  You said you liked being a police officer.  Did, I mean, did you--and you hadn't really thought about becoming one before?
Speaker 2: No.  I had no thoughts of being a police officer.
Speaker 1: What did you like about it?
Speaker 2: After being there a while, I found that the--I spent most of my time helping people.  I could do something to help solve problems that people would have.  I saw it more as a helping job.  I guess that's my personality.  And, that's what I liked about it and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, for example, in walking the beat--
Speaker 1: So, you had a beat?  You actually walked in those days?
Speaker 2: I walked the beat.
Speaker 1: All right.  All right.
Speaker 2: Drove a car.  Did about everything you do except serve as a detective.  The chief of detectives was quoted as saying that there'd never be a black detective as long as he was chief detective.  And, he was right.  So, I never got to be a detective.  But, I worked the in patrol car, I worked radar, I worked--my first job was undercover narcotics, 'cause I was new in town; a new face.  I worked in juvenile.  I was a juvenile officer.  About all aspects of the department.  Got promote to sergeant.  I developed and directed the first Police Community Relations Unit in San Jose.  One of the first in the nation.  I left as a sergeant and director of Police Community Relations.  So, I had a variety of experiences as a member of the San Jose Police Department.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It does, it sounds like a broad experience, you know.  How many--in San Jose was about what, 100,000, 150,000?
Speaker 2: It was about 200,000--
Speaker 1: Two hundred thousand.
Speaker 2: At that time.  It was--in fact, my badge number was 104 so that kind of tells you how small--there's a big difference in San Jose now then it was at that time.  San Jose was surrounded by orchards.  Those orchards have been torn down now.  There houses and businesses all over the place.
Speaker 1: That's a decent size city, though.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It's not like it's like a little town.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't a small town.  Bigger than Fresno [California].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 534733
Speaker 1: How are you treated in the [police] department in San Jose [California]?  I mean, were there other blacks that came on after you?
Speaker 2: No, they--there were some came on after me.  I think it's important to mention that Francis Tanner paved the way.  He made it easier for me.  And, I'm sure it wasn't that easier for him, 'cause it wasn't that easy for me being the, just the second black.  There're times when I would drive up to a call, where someone have called the police wanting some assistance from the police.  I get there and then they would look at me and say, "They want a real cop."  So, those things happened all the time.  I can recall sitting in the communications center where, I worked there as well, and taking phone calls.  People call and say, say that there's a suspicious person walking down their street.  I say, "What," and ask the quest--"What is it?"  "Well he's a, a Negro walking down the street."  "Well, what is he doing?"  "He's walking down the street."  So, that's the kind of the atmosphere in which I grew up in.  And, but as I said, it's probably a lot easier on my than it was on Mr. Tanner and probably a lot easier on those that followed me than it was on me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I, I ultimately got promoted to sergeant.  I made a decision that I wanted to be a police chief in some city.  I knew I would never become police chief in San Jose.  And, but, I wanted to prepare myself.  So, that's the reason I continued my education.  I didn't anyone to be able to tell me I wasn't qualified for any job that I applied for.
Story_ID: 534734
Speaker 1: When did you become sergeant [in the San Jose Police Department]?
Speaker 2: It was in 1966.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, you were, and you stayed until '68 [1968], right?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.  So, in '66 [1966] you're a sergeant.  So, what were--?
Speaker 2: And, in '68 [1968], I went to Portland State University [sic. Portland State College; Portland State University, Portland, Oregon].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what were your responsibilities as sergeant?
Speaker 2: Well, the first time I made, when I first made sergeant, they assigned me to the juvenile division.  So, I was a juvenile officer, investigating cases against juveniles or, juveniles as victims, investigating either one.  Did a lot with narcotics.  There was a lot of narcotics in the schools at that time particularly LSD. So, I ended up working very closely there until I guess I arrested the wrong person.  'Cause the chief detective that I talked about calling me in once and said, I'm not, I'm not to work narcotics anymore so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Who did you arrest?  I mean, you probably know now.  What happened?
Speaker 2: It was a--I don't know, but it was some young person.  I know, it's just a lot of problems in the schools and my job--in my mind the right thing to do is to go and take care of the problem.  And, so, I was doing that, and made a number arrests for young people, 'cause there were so many of them there it was really kind of frightening as to what was going on at that time.  But, that was stopped so I just handled cases where young people were victims or where young people were committing crimes.
Story_ID: 534735
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968] you went to graduate school, right?
Speaker 2: Well, in '68 [1968] I just finished my one semester and sent those credits back to Fresno State [College; California State University, Fresno, Fresno, California] and got my degree from Fresno State.  But, I continued at San Jose State [College; San Jose State University, San Jose, California] and got a master's degree in sociology--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with the emphasis on corrections.  And, then I went--one professor encouraged me.  I didn't know about the School of Criminology at [University of California] Berkeley [Berkeley, California].  Julian [B.] Roebuck was one of my sociology professors.  He told me about the school.  He said, "You should go apply."  He said, "You'll do good there."  So, I drove up to Berkeley [California] and applied.  Dean Lohman, Joseph [D.] Lohman was the dean at the time and he also encouraged me to apply, make an application.  And, I did and got accepted.  And, I never will forget my first advisor, Bernard [L.] Diamond was his name, Dr. Diamond.  He was telling me, I never would graduate as a commuting student and not being there full-time.  So, I solved the problem, I changed advisors (laughter). So, I ultimate got my degree.  In fact, I was the first African American in the world to get a doctorate degree in criminology.  And, but, I must mention in between that, I got a fellowship from the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] to get a master's degree in criminal justice or criminology.  And, I took the, I took the fellowship primarily because it gave me some money to go to school.  That had never happened before.  And, I'd commute back and forth from San Jose [California] to Berkeley to take classes because it had to be a full--you have to be a full-time student.  In all the other cases, except San Jose, there were two of us from San Jose, Dave Pollock [ph.], who subsequently passed away also, and I--we were not relieved from our duty by the [San Jose] Police Department.  The other twenty-eight, they were.  So, we were carrying a full-time load in college.  We're commuting about an hour each way.
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't they let you?
Speaker 2: The chief wouldn't do it and--
Speaker 1: That's just a--
Speaker 2: Just that simple.
Speaker 1: Just a decision that the chief made?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You think that the chief was kind of jealous of you all going to school and getting your--?
Speaker 2: Well, J. R. [Ray] Blackmore, whom I accredit to my desire to become a police chief, and I say that with a great deal of affection, I spent a lot of time with him because I was the director of Police Community Relations [Unit, San Jose Police Department], I reported to him.  And, after a while, and again this is with great affection, I said, "If he can do it, I can do it."  So, I set a goal to become a police chief in one of America's large cities.  If I call--recall correct, he only had a GED [General Educational Development].  So, he did not have the, the advantage of an education like we were trying to get--
Story_ID: 534736
Speaker 1: Just for the record, in those days, I guess, until fairly recently, most police officers, a lot of 'em just had high school education and departments look for athletes, right?  For the most part athletes and guys (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I don't know about athletes but educations was not valued at that time.  And, in maybe because many of the leaders did not have college education.  'Cause I was kind of teased and criticized for going to college when I was a police officer.
Speaker 1: And, that wasn't the culture of the department.  I mean--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --of most police departments--?
Speaker 2: That's interesting because they require two years of college to become a police officer.  I think that in San Jose [California], if I'm correct, was the first one, San Jose or Berkeley [California], I think it was San Jose to require college.  And, you contrast that to a place like Multnomah County [Oregon] where I was the sheriff, they require a four-year college degree.  That was due main, mainly because one individual, Don Clark [Donald E. Clark] who was the sheriff at one time.  So, it's really is based upon individuals and their personality and their experiences.  But, I--that was probably one of the most difficult times of my life because I worked as a police community relations officer; directed that [Police Community Relations] Unit [San Jose Police Department].  That meant I had to go to meetings at night time.  So, I had a family.  I got two kids at that time.   A family, my wife [Yvonne Brown] and two kids, had to spend time with them.  I had to work in the daytime in my job 'cause I was director of the unit.  And, then I had to go out at night meetings, then I had to commute back and forth from Berkeley to San Jose, or San Jose to Berkeley, and then I had to do the homework.  So, that was a very busy time during my life.  But, I completed it.  I got the master's degree.  I think it was in nineteen-sixty--'68 [1968] I believe I finished that course and got the master's degree; the second master's from [University of California] Berkeley [Berkeley, California].  I might add, that I just recently been selected as the alumnus of the year for UC Berkeley, for this year in 2004 which I consider to be quite an honor.  And, then I completed all my work for my doctor's degree, and in '68 [1968] I went to Portland State University [sic. Portland State College; Portland State University, Portland, Oregon] as director of the administration of justice program.  And, that was just a grant at the time.  They had a grant to develop a program.  I developed a program all the way up the Ph.D. level.  While at Portland State, I also finished my dissertation and I was awarded my doctorate in criminology from the University of California at Berkeley in 1970.  As I pointed out earlier, I'm the first African American, not just in this country, but in the world to receive a doctorate in criminology.
Story_ID: 534737
Speaker 1: That puts you in a unique position, 'cause normally, you know, we're at the other end of the spectrum when it comes to criminology, we're the criminals--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, in the--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: Or, at least arrested as such and presently in 2004 as we speak, most of the prisoners in the United States are African American, disproportionately.  So, so, did you think about those things then?  Did you--were you mindful of that of this, this--imbalance in the criminal justice system?
Speaker 2: I was aware of that.  In fact, one of the interesting things about San Jose [California] at the time, I was a police officer and had a tough time even finding a place to live.  That was the irony that I saw.  I called someone wanting to rent an apartment and they said, "Oh, come on by its available, come by and take a look at it."  As soon as I get there, they see me and, it had just been rented.  So, I went through that for a long period of time.  And, one day I went by in my uniform and then I ultimately got my place--apartment to rent.  So, prejudice was alive and well at that time in that city as well.  The interesting thing about it is that the blacks in San Jose were very proud that I was a police officer.  I became, if you will, a recognizable figure in the community because I was a police officer.  My concern initially was, what would people think, here I am joining the police department and there was not a great deal of favorable attitudes toward police from black people at that time.  But, I became, just to make the point, we formed an organization in San Jose called, what's the name of it, it was something for action.  I forget the exact name right now.  Which was a coalition of all the African American organizations; NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], some women's groups and they elected me to be the president of the organization.  That tells you what respect I had as a police officer.  And, I think, I think I probably debated that issue at least, at least mentally on many occasions.  And, my position was, we needed more African American police officers, not less.  If you wanna change an institution, I felt you should be part of that institution and bring about change from, from within.  There were forces from outside the [San Jose Police] Department that were doing their job trying to bring about changes.  I felt I could make a difference by being inside the organization.  I think I did make a difference in that city.
Story_ID: 534738
Speaker 1: Particularly, I was there [San Jose Police Department] during the time we had the riots.  I was a Police Community Relations [Unit] director when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] got killed.  And, you know, you may recall how the nation exploded at that time.  We did not have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen sixty-eight [1968], yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968].  We did not have--
Speaker 2: Did you have riots in San Jose [California]?
Speaker 1: I'm sor--we did not.  That was the point I wanted to make.  I think I was--in fact, when I left the chief [J.R. "Ray" Blackmore] made the statement that, "We avoided the civil unrest because of the work that I had done."  And, that's always stuck with me and I've always operated under the philosophy that, it's what you do before a time of crisis that carries you through crisis.  I became the director of Police Community Relations because the chief assigned me and, Ted Koppels [ph.] who has also passed away, to go into the east side of San Jose, which is predominately African American and Hispanic, Mexican American, to do a study on what we could do to prevent the riots.  And, we made a number of recommendations like, facilities for young people.  But, one was to create a Police Community Relations Unit.  The chief accepted my recommendations, our recommendations, and appointed me director.  So, we spent a lot of our time just working with people in the community.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, that's how you became the Police Community Relations director?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: In the first place.  Now, this is in a lot of, well, in a lot of departments, I guess prior to the '60s [1960s], didn't have a community relations department, right?
Speaker 1: No.  They became--well, they were created mainly because of the riots.  The Police Community Relations was seen as a mechanism of increasing the communications and the relationship between the police and the black community in those days.  And, San Jose had a large Hispanic community--was also the Mexican American community.  So, prior to that, we did not have Police Community Relations Units.  As I said, the one I developed was one of the first ones in the nation.  Not the first but one of the first ones in the nation.
Story_ID: 534739
Speaker 1: This is also a time when the, when you, if you watch television all during the Civil Rights Movement, all during the '60s [1960s], you'd see southern police departments in conflict with demonstrators.  Or, even in the North, 'cause people would sit-in in front of department stores for better jobs and you'd see the police, you know, moving people, putting 'em in police vans, throwing 'em and you know, and it was always a conflict.  Not to mention, the normal criminal type activity that people are arrested for.  In California in the late '60s [1960s], you had a formation of the Black Panther Party around that area that you were in around--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Berkeley [California] and San Francisco [California] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the [San Francisco] Bay Area [California].
Speaker 1: In the Bay Area.  Yeah, and the police were seen as pigs, you know, and--
Speaker 2: Well, in addition to all of that, you had the protest against the Vietnam War.  So, a lot was going on in those days.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Police are being called pigs, basically.  And--
Speaker 2: I do believe in retrospect that the work I did made a difference in San Jose [California].  Let me give you just a couple of examples.  I remember very vividly when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed.  I was not working that day.  I had hurt my back.  I was at home.  And, I received a phone call from a lady name Charlie Harris [ph.].  She was an activist in the community.  She said, "Get out here, we have a problem."  And, so I went to the location where she asked me to go.  And, the police are lined up getting ready to march down that street because someone had shot out some of the street lights.  Well, I knew most of the people 'cause I'd been in their meetings over and over again.  I went down there myself, there were no lights down there.  And, started speaking to people and the people were scared because the lights had been shot out.  It was dark.  They didn't know what was going on.  The police were set to go in and take care of a problem that didn't exist.  The fact that I knew the--I went down there, came back, I was able to give a report.  Whoever was responsible for shooting out the lights, they're no longer there.  So, there's no need for you to march down there.  They had their riot helmets and their shields and everything, literally ready to go to war with the people.  So, we were able to stop that.  That's in one example how you're able to make a difference by having that relationship.  Another example would be that an officer got in trouble in an area and rocks were thrown.  But, I was able to go there and help solve that and--because I knew the people.  And, I remember the night that [Senator] Robert [F.] Kennedy got shot.  I was at the San Jose headquarters or campaign headquarters for his campaign.  And, when Kennedy got shot a couple of people had a very emotional reaction.  They said in effect, let's burn this city down.  But, I was there, I was able to pull 'em aside and the police start coming with their red lights and siren.  I went and spoke to the police and said, "Let me handle this."  Absent my being there and having that rapport, I think San Jose would have had a disturbance just because of about two people.  One, really, the one had start breaking windows and doing things that would be destructive rather than productive.  So, we--I think we were able to make a difference through police community relations.  But, it was designed really to deal with in that instance, blacks and the police, or Hispanics, Mexican Americans and the police.
Story_ID: 534740
Speaker 1: Now, what did you learn in school and when you pursued your doctorate that really informed your ideas of policing?
Speaker 2: Well, it--the School of Criminology was not so much a policing school.  It was nothing like police science program.  It was more a theoretically based in the social sciences.  And, I focused mainly on the etiology of crime.  By that I mean, what causes crime.  And, that was a big benefit to me, even today, that I have an understanding that there's factors that produce criminal behavior.  And, if you understand that, you can do what I did when we started one of the first, if not the first, community policing initiatives here in Houston [Texas] in the '80s [1980s].  That is, focus on solving problems not just reacting to incidents when they occur.  And, that's much more productive for the community if you could solve a real problem.  Once you arrest someone, you've, you've failed.  So, I believe very strongly that you should do things to prevent crime from happening in the first place, rather than waiting 'til someone is arrested.  And, then the machinery of the police department goes into motion trying to catch the person who has victimized someone.  I think that's the major lesson I learned at UC Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].
Story_ID: 534741
Speaker 1: This puts you at odds with all the police departments in the (laughter) United States, basically.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: 'Cause they all feel, and correct me if I'm wrong, they measure the performance of an officer by the number of arrests he makes.  And, you know, the number of busts and that sort of thing.  How many people are hauled in on a charge and very little thought is given, has been given traditionally to prevention, right, preventing crime?
Speaker 2: We can go through several eras in policing.  We had the first era when we first started policing in this country, it was politically corrupted era of policing.  Then, there are some people that came along like, August Vollmer and O.W. Wilson, they were the reformed police officers.  And, they changed it to what we now call the professional policing.  It was one problem with the professional policing.  They separate themselves from the community.  Los Angeles [California] being a classical example of that, 'cause William [H.] Parker was one of the leaders in implementing that style of reform.  So, that was the first major change in policing in this United States.
Speaker 1: Were cops instead of being on a beat would be in a car with a radio?  And--
Speaker 2: In the car.  In 'Dragnet' is probably a classical example.  "All we want are the facts, ma'am."  And, so, there's no personal interaction.  And, you're correct, you measure the success of the police and the police officer by counting, how many tickets did you write?  How many arrest did you write?  So, it's a numbers game.  Now, we're into the, the second major change in policing.  And, this is something I take a great pri--amount of pride in because I'm called by colleagues as a father of community policing because we pioneered it here in Houston [Texas].  And there we're looking at different means in majoring a police officer and the police department.  That's criteria for measuring a police department is the absences of crime on the beat.  And, so, community policing, one of its main tenants is problem solving.  Solving the problems, not just arresting someone.  If we had an ideal situation, an officer would be assigned to a beat.  It'd be his or her job to be if you would, the police chief of that beat, be the leader of that beat and deal with problems that might produce crime.  But, you have to involve the people in doing that.  If you do that, then you want to not evaluate that officer on the number of arrest that are made.  You wanna evaluate the officer on the problems that they've solve or the peace and tranquility of that neighborhood.  If you would, the absence of crime.  So, that's the big difference between community policing, which I pioneered, and the professional policing.  And, Los Angeles being a classical model of that.
Story_ID: 534742
Speaker 1: Now you are known far and wide as the police practitioner who's a pioneer of community policing and there was a lot 'em.  I think it was Robert Trojanowicz and some of the other professors that conceptualized a lot of the ideas.  And, I think there are so many people involved and it's hard to say who really started this idea.  But, it's like a--it's something that--but you are the first real (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I could pretty well tell you the story.  It started right here in Houston [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, it started for unusual reasons.  Number one, in the 1980s Houston had a real problem economically.  The price of oil went down and about 86 percent of the city's economy was predicated upon the oil industry.  So, we had a real bust, we lost a quarter of a million jobs.  I'm the police chief.  I can't hire any more police officers.  We've clothed it or closed the academy; can't get the police officers any increases in salary.  So, my job is still to protect the city.  How do you do that without having the resources you need, or a happy group of officers because you're paying them a decent salary?  And, so, I convened the meeting, we called it an executive session.  And, I asked the questions, I knew who I was gonna take it, how--what should be the future policing in this country?  And, the end result is what we call neighborhood oriented policing.  We didn't call it community policing.  But, that became the model which other cities are using.  I participated in an executive session at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and they were looking at the future policing in America as well.  And, being a part of that and sharing with the group at Harvard what we were doing, we really pioneered, literally pioneered the concept of community policing.  Now, today probably about 80 percent of the cities in America use some form or another of community policing.  It's grossly misunderstood and that's one of the reasons I'm writing a textbook on it so I can share my viewpoint.  Now, it wasn't something that just, I thought up or someone else thought up.  This represents an accumulation of years of my educational training as well as my practical experience.  When we, when we left the concept of police community relations behind, we did so many because there's no federal money for it anymore.  I was in Oregon at the time as the sheriff of Multnomah County [Oregon] and we went to what we call team policing.  Team policing involved a team of officers under one manager responsible for a geographical area of the city.  But, that was federally funded.  When the funds went away, so did the program.  And, there we had crime prevention units working with the community mainly in target hardening; teaching people about locks and alarms and lights and all of that, which is real--that's still around.  So, if you put all that together as I did, my experience in police community relations, team policing, crime prevention, my academic background, it logically led to the idea of community policing.  There's one other element--we also had about two decades of research that questioned many of the traditional thoughts of about what's good in policing would work.  Like random preventive patrol, like rapid response, like the role of detectives.  So, we had to research, my personal experience, my academic experience and almost a crisis in terms of having to police a city without the adequate resources.  And, we ended up with what we call neighborhood oriented policing.  And, it's still working today, which means, that it's been institutionalized.  My challenge was to institutionalize in someone else, so someone else could not come in and, like a radio, unplug it.  So, I'm very proud of what we're able to do here in Houston.
Story_ID: 534743
Speaker 1: Some of the research you just alluded to is really shocking.  Some of it is when you think about first as a O.W. Wilson when he came to Chicago [Illinois] in the early '60s [1960s] had officers ride around the city a lot in squad cars.  One officer, he shorted a lot of cars and just rode around all the time in concentric circles, you know, giving the impression that the police was always around.  But, that was shown not to really work.
Speaker 2: Well, there was study called the Kansas City preventive patrol study [Kansas City Preventive Patrol Experiment].  And, what they did very briefly, they divide the city into three areas.  One with the same level of patrol.  Another area with double the patrol, and third with no patrol.  And, the results showed it didn't make any difference (laughter).  So, I reached the conclusion that preventive patrol, a routine random patrol produced random results.  And, so, why do it?  Another study about rapid response that the wisdom of the police profession at the time was if you respond fast to a 9-11 call, you'd catch the criminal.  It's just--the research showed that was not the case.  And, so, those bits of wisdom that we lived under for generations were challenged by the two decades of research which helped me in formulation of my style of policing, which we call neighborhood oriented policing here, the generic term is community policing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, usually when somebody calls the police, I mean, they get upset if the police don't show up but usually the crime has already happened, right?
Speaker 2: Well, the crime has happened but usually they don't call right away either.  And, many people don't even call the police at all if it's a major--a minor crime.  But, you know, just think if--you're gonna talk to each other, you gonna talk--maybe make a phone call to somebody else, and then call the police.  So, we just didn't catch a lot of people running red, with red lights and siren to the scene of the crime.  Now, I still believe that there must be rapid response in some cases.  If it's a life or death situation, or if the criminal is still there, than there should be a rapid response.  Otherwise, research tells us, it doesn't make a lot of difference.  And, that's why we've even gone to what we call Tele-Serv, some of the minor crimes, the reports are taken over the telephone because they're only for insurance purposes.
Story_ID: 534744
Speaker 1: And then the idea that if the police are making a lot of arrests in your neighborhood, your neighborhood is safer.  That's a--I think we just alluded to that a second ago.
Speaker 2: No.  That's not the case.  And, what you want to do is to prevent crime from occurring to begin with.  Anytime you arrest someone for a crime, someone has been victimized and that's, and that's not the ultimate goal of justice, in particular criminal justice, is to prevent people from being victimized.
Speaker 1: Now, were you able to, for instances in terms of that, that aspect of it, were you able to institute changes in the City of Houston [Texas] where officers were rewarded for preventing crime?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's part of the--the reason I say community policing is misunderstood, there's still some people that put a police officer on a bicycle and say that's community policing.  Or, have a small number of officers and say that's community policing.  Whereby the rest of the department is business as usual.  If you, if you really want community policing you have to change all the systems that support the police department.  You have to ask the question, what type of person do you want to hire?  Then you go out and recruit that type of person.  My personal belief, when people who wanna serve in the spirit of service and not the spirit of adventure.  I use the Peace Corps as a good example.  They wanted a certain person to go overseas and serve, you attracted that type of person.  The same thing is applicable in police work.  You wanna ask the question, how do we train our police officers?  Historically, we train our police officers 85 percent of the time for what they spend 15 percent of their time doing.  That's enforcing the law.  Under community policing, we want our police officer to be trained in, how do you solve a problem?  There's, there're techniques of problem solving.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: How do you identify the problem?  How do you work with the diversity of the community?
Story_ID: 534745
Speaker 1: I'm a community person, I have a problem, I go to a police officer that's been trained like most of the time to arrest people and, you know, what kind of a dialogue am I gonna have with that officer, you know, about prevention?
Speaker 2: Well, it becomes the responsibility of the officer to do some crime analysis, we call it.  And, see what has historically had happened, the police would respond to incidents.  I call them incident responders.  Handle the incident, get back in the car, patrol, wait 'til the next call comes; handle that.  What we found is that there's a reason behind those incidents.  Then it becomes the response, responsibility under community policing.  But, you've got to put that picture together.  Why did the problem occur to begin with?  And, then to use the resources of both the police and the community and other agencies of government to solve the problem.  So, the answer to your question, you do crime analysis.  Try to find out why the problem occurred to begin with.  You're still gonna arrest the criminals.  Someone who's gonna violate the law, you're still gonna arrest them.  But, you want to solve problems that produce crime to begin with.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But, to do that, you've gotta retrain officers, right?  Not to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  That's--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  They have to have different kind of training.
Speaker 2: That's one of the systems I'm talking about.  You've have a different training system, what will teach officers about diversity and so they can get along with people.  Teach officers how to communicate so they can talk to people.  Teach officers crime analysis.  In addition to recruiting and training, how do you evaluate the officers?  We've talked about that before.  Rather than evaluate an officer based on how many arrest or how many citations they write or arrests they make, evaluate them on problem solving, by the absence of crime in the neighborhood.  Then you have, how do you evaluate the police department?  Historically, we use the uniform crime reports that come out annually, published by the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].  Then you, then you compare yourself with other cities.  Well, that's not a good eval--a good criteria for evaluation.  You wanna look at, again, the absence of crime.  You wanna look at the relationship between the police and the community.  So that there are different criteria for evaluation as well.  The point I make is that you wanna change the systems that support the police department.  Otherwise, you're like police community relations.  It's something you can plug in and you can unplug.  You want, you want your police department to be a valued driven police department.  I developed, what I'm told, is the first values, written values for a police department here [Houston, Texas].  I did the same thing in New York [New York].  A set of values.  And, the values involved certain things, basically certain things, involving the community in the course of delivering police services, and making sure you treat everybody right.  There nothing complicated.  Remembering that the job of a police officer is to protect the rights of the individual just as it is to arrest the individuals who commit crimes.  The job of a police officer is to solve problems.  So, those are the things that make community policing different than the traditional style of policing.
Story_ID: 534746
Speaker 1: Tell us about being a sheriff.  Now you were a sheriff of the county that surrounds Portland [Oregon], right?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Which is please--
Speaker 2: It's Multnomah [County, Oregon].  I went to Portland for the first time in 1968.  I was recruited after the international search to come there and head their administration of justice program [Department of Administration of Justice, Portland State College; Portland State University, Portland, Oregon].  That's how I ended up in Portland.  And, I developed a program, I developed an undergraduate program also all the way up to the Ph.D.  But, I also developed a black studies program.  That's still in existence.  One of the few that is still in existence.  We had a good black studies program.  There I had essentially two jobs; I was a third block to join the faculty at Portland State University.  And, so, I was a faculty advisor for the students.  What struck me when I first went to Portland State was, at lunchtime I went to a little rally, not a rally but a debate in the student union.  Here blacks students debating professors about the merits of a black studies program.  That didn't seem right to me.  And, so, I got involved and wrote the proposal.  We finally got a black studies program going.  But, after being there for four years at Portland State, I went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and Dr. Andy Billingsley [Andrew Billingsley] was the academic vice president at the time.  And, I worked with Lawrence [E.] Gary, Dr. Lawrence Gary and we created the Institute for Urban Affairs and Research [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  Dealing with research into problems that impacted the African American community.  And, I also developed there, a criminology program there at Howard.
Story_ID: 534747
Speaker 1: One day I received phone call from the person, the person who first recruited me to come to Portland State [College; Portland State University, Portland, Oregon] by the name of Don Clark [Donald E. Clark].  Don Clark had run for and was elected chairman of the board of commissioners for Multnomah County [Oregon].  So, he told me he was elected, and said, "[HistoryMaker] Lee [P. Brown], come back and join my administration."  I said, "What position?"  He said, "What do you want?"  I said, "How about sheriff?"  He said, "You got it."  So, I became the sheriff of Multnomah County.  And, I was the first and probably the only, will be the only African American sheriff of Multnomah County.  At that time it was an appointed position, one of eight in the country that were appointed.  Now, it's an elected position.  So, I served as sheriff there for about a year, a little over a year and a half, and we implemented the concept of team policing in Multnomah County.  There, I'm trying to think if there are any other African Americans in that department.  If so, there're very few.  One or two at the most.  It was a good department.  Don Clark had been sheriff.  And, when Don Clark was sheriff he implemented a four-year college requirement to become a sheriff.  The big problem I had was how do you motivate highly educated police officers to keep them motivated?  And, so when he implemented community policing, that was one, one mechanism of doing that.  I did that and then I was appointed to serve as the director of the Department of Justice Services.  And, that department as I mentioned earlier, consisted of all of the county's criminal justice agencies.  Nothing like it, that I know of ever, ever existed or exists now.  In my department it was the sheriff, the district attorney, the judges, probation, corrections, juvenile, legal services, all the criminal justice agencies in one department.  And, then I did that for about a year and a half and then Maynard Jackson called me--
Speaker 2: Now, wait a minute, let's go back to that for a second.  That does seem like groundbreaking, you know--
Speaker 1: It was.  It was--
Speaker 2: To have all those, I mean, that doesn't exist anywhere, I don't think, right?
Speaker 1: No.  It's a good concept.  The only, I guess the only difficulty, you had some of the elected officials in there.  Like the district attorney is elected, the judges are elected.  The power that the director would have that--I had budget control.  So, and we all worked, in fact, we worked well, we worked together in trying to accomplish a common objective.  So, it is, it was unique.  I don't know of any place where it exist today.  It doesn't exist in Multnomah County anymore 'cause the sheriff is now an elected official.  And, the position--
Speaker 2: Would you think it's an ideal way to--?
Speaker 1: I think it's a good idea.  In most instances the only person that sees that entire system would be the criminal (laughter).  In that place, in that place when I was there in Multnomah County, we all would meet together and talk about common goals.  Because if you can just look at the objectives of the law enforcement is difference from the objective of the prosecutor, different from the objectives of the judge, difference objectives of the correction systems.  So, you have three systems that you really don't talk to each other unless it's case by case.  And, so, that was, that was a big benefit from that position.

Speaker 1: All right, now Atlanta [Georgia], I guess--
Speaker 2: In Atlanta, a little history on my going to Atlanta.  When Maynard [Jackson] first got elected, I was at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  And, I interviewed for the public safety commissioner's job at the time and came out number one for the process.  But, I got a call from Maynard one day and [A.] Reginald Eaves and Maynard told me that he decided to appoint Reginald Eaves as the public safety commissioner.  And, that was his decision.  He knew Reginald.  He did not know me.  And, so, I didn't get the job the first, his first term.  The second term, there was some problems with Reginald Eaves.  He was dismissed from his position and then Maynard called me.  I was in Portland [Oregon] at the time as the director of [Department of] Justice Services.  And, asked me to meet him in Oakland [California].  I went down to Oakland.  We talked about my coming to take over the position as the commissioner of public safety.  And, I thought about it, and then spoke to my wife [Yvonne Brown] and then ultimately, went to Atlanta for the interview.  And, Maynard's very persuasive, I had already accepted a job.  President [James Earl "Jimmy"] Carter [Jr.] had appointed me to one of the positions in the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration [LEAA].  I was just waiting for, since this was a presidential appointment, I was waiting for the confirmation by the U.S. Senate.  And, Griffin Bell was the attorney general there.  So, I went to Atlanta and interviewed with Maynard.  As I said, he's very persuasive.  He, he had set up a meeting with [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Joseph Lowery and [HistoryMaker] Marvin [S.] Arrington [Sr.] the next morning and he had convinced me that night to take the job.  So, I agreed that night.  The next morning he told me, he said, "Don't tell 'em 'cause they're supposed to help convince you to take the job."  So, I went back to Washington, D.C. and met with Griffin Bell, the attorney general.  And, told him that I made a decision not to take the position in Washington, which was the appointment by the president, President Carter, but go to Atlanta and help Maynard Jackson with the problems of crime there.  And, I asked him, "Is it okay to back out?"  So, he was very gracious and said, "Go right ahead."  Said, he was looking forward to getting back to Atlanta himself.  So, I became the public safety commissioner in Atlanta in 1982.  I'm sorry 1978, '78 [1978].  I left in '82 [1982].
Story_ID: 534749
Speaker 1: And, we started doing some things there that would've probably started the community policing concept earlier but we had one problem.  We start finding young children who were reported missing and then we'd find their bodies sometime later at a different location.  That what they call the [Atlanta] Missing and Murdered Children case[s; Atlanta Child Murders].  Well, I was in charge of that investigation.  And, that consumed about two years of my life and two years of Atlanta's [Atlanta, Georgia] life at the time trying to find the person who's responsible for the killings.
Speaker 2: Now, this is a celebrated case on 'Nightline' and '60 Minutes' and talked all over the news--
Speaker 1: Well, it's something that never happened before.  You've--we've had mass killings before at times.  But, usually you'll find all the deaths have taken place.  In this case, it went on month after month after month after month (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This if, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's the first highly publicized, at least, black serial killer case.
Speaker 1: It, it was.  It was the first one.  And so, my job for almost two years was to catch a killer.  And, we kind of put everything else aside.  We didn't try anything.  In fact, we devoted all of our resources because we didn't know who we were looking for, what the motive was, we didn't even have a crime scene.  If you consider the fact that most homicides are solved by one of three reasons, one of three methods.  Number one, you have an eye witness who can say, "He did it."  Number two, you have physical evidence that logically leads to the killer.  Or, number three, you have a confession.  We didn't have any of that.  And, so, that's how I spent most of my time trying to find out who was responsible for the problem there.  But, it was even more complicated than that.  We mounted probably the most extensive investigation in the history of the country.  We had about, in addition to Houston [Texas], I'm sorry, in addition to Atlanta, probably about eleven other law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation; including the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], the Georgia Bureau of Investigation [GBI], surrounding cities, surrounding counties--
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: 'Cause a lot of the bodies were found--
Speaker 2: Georg--
Speaker 1: In other jurisdictions.  Not in Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Atlanta's in what, how many counties is Atlanta in?
Speaker 1: It's in DeKalb [County, Georgia], Fulton [County, Georgia], but there were counties right around Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, it's a lot of different jurisdictions to deal with, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we would find the bodies in different jurisdictions.  But, we created a task force to handle the investigation because we had to coordinate the evidence from all these different jurisdictions.  So, we had the task force and I--had reporting to me.
Story_ID: 534750
Speaker 1: In addition to the investigation [of the Atlanta Missing and Murdered Children cases; Atlanta Child Murders] probably as I said, the most massive investigation I've ever undertaken.  I found out that we started having mental health problems with our children.  I had [HistoryMaker] Dr. Alvin Poussaint and other people in the psychological and psychiatric field as my advisors.  And, so, we had to mount a major mental health program for the young people.  You can imagine if we're continuously bombarding the people trying to prevent them from being a victim, it has its impact on them.  And, then we found also that many of the parents, particularly the mothers, were having problems because their kids were with them all day and every day.  I took a drive in a helicopter over the city [Atlanta, Georgia] once and I couldn't see not one child on the streets of the city.  The parents kept them in the houses all the time.  So, we had to deal with that.  So, we had three major initiatives going at the same time.  Number one, the investigation trying to catch the killer, or at that time the killers, 'cause we didn't know.  Number two, a prevention program to try to prevent young people from becoming victims.  Number three, a mental health program for the city.  And, so, I was responsible for all of that.  Well, we ultimately caught the killer which was, which was Wayne Williams.  And, we caught him for a very unique reason.  He was never a suspect.  We had a computer program, the most power computer program ever developed, to handle all the clues we were getting.  'Cause we asked people to call in if they had any, anything that may by any stretch of the imagination be beneficial to us.  We did things that had never been done before.  We brought in investigators from other cities.  And, we just exhausted everything we could think of trying to catch the killer.  Well, we finally solved the case because we start finding fibers on one kid's body that matched the fibers on another kid's body.  For example, if you walk across this carpet in this room some of the fiber of the carpet will stick on your clothes.  So, we start finding that.  We knew they'd been in the same environment.  We just did not know where that environment was.  Someone in the investigation leaked that information which infuriated me at the time but in retrospect it was a good thing that they did.  And, that information was in the newspapers, on television, radio, big headlines that we had fiber evidence.  Well, shortly thereafter, we start finding nude bodies dumped in the rivers in Atlanta [Georgia], the Chattahoochee [River] and the South Rivers.  Well, my strategy to combat that because I thought that the killer was trying to hide the evidence, the fiber evidence.  We staked out every bridge in the City of Atlanta.  We just closed down everything in the city.  Staked out every bridge and had two police officers usually rookies under the bridge and two investigators on the top.  Usually one's an FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] agent.  And, one night around three o'clock in the morning there was a splash in the river, we ultimately recovered a body and the only person on top of the ridge--the bridge was Wayne Williams.  So, that's how we ultimately solved the case by virtue of responding to the change in the modus operandi that Wayne Williams was using at the time.  He was subsequently tried on two cases.  And, I might add before we actually arrested him, we put him under surveillance for a long time 'cause I wanted to make sure that we caught the right person.  It would be a true injustice if we arrested him and he was not the person.  So, we brought in the best fiber evidence any--from anyplace in the world; some came from Europe.  And, what we were able to define is that, some of the fibers on the kid's body matched the fibers of the rug he had in his house.  Some matched the, the car that he drove, the cars that he drove.  The dog hair we found on the kid's body matched his dog hair.  Found a blood stain that matched the blood of one of the kids.  So, we had a good case.  But, I was not prepared to even accept that.  So, we brought in the fiber evidence.  The best anyplace in the world.  And, when they finished looking at all the information they said it was the best fiber evidence case that they had ever seen.  So, we--with circumstantial evidence we did arrest him based upon the fiber evidence and tried him for two cases.  He was convicted on two cases.  And, he was sentenced to two life sentences in the Georgia state prison [Hancock State Prison, Sparta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 534751
Speaker 1: You're very sure about that but there's been a lot of speculation since that he [Wayne Williams] may not have been the one and that sort of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that's kind of normal.  They're still speculating who killed [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], who killed the Kennedys [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy].  That's rather normal in a high profile case like--if I had not been 1,000 percent sure, he would not have been arrested.  We placed him under surveillance before making the arrest.  And, then did everything but what really--two things; number one, I think there was a mistake made that night when he was stopped on the bridge.  Rather than arresting him or taking him in or investigation, they let him go that night.  And, when I found out about it, I kind of blew my top and we got a search warrant and went to his house.  By that time, he had burned a lot of stuff in the backyard; pictures and things of that nature.  Washed out his house, washed out his room.  He lived in the--with his parents so he had a room back there.  He washed all that down, washed his car down.  So, that in itself was very revealing.  Number two, once we put an eye on him and had him under surveillance, we did not have and have not had any case that meets, that match that pattern since.  And, number three, the fiber evidence.  And, so, we add all that up then it's kind of compelling that he was the one who committed the crimes [in the Atlanta Missing and Murdered Children cases; Atlanta Child Murders].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's the most convincing thing I've ever heard.  I mean, about it, has been what you just told me.
Speaker 2: There was docu-journal put out that's not accurate.  I think it's more for entertainment.  They never spoke to anyone involved within the case; never spoke to me, never spoke to the investigators.  And, so, they did not have an accurate, I mean, was it A&E on television, runs it periodically.  It's just not accurate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, those are the reasons I have no doubt in my mind that he was the person.  In fact, I told the investigators, "If anyone ever even thinks about arresting someone who's not guilty, I'll destroy your career in law enforcement forever."  And, so, there's no, there's no doubt in my mind that he was the one.
Speaker 1: Well, that's your, that's your reputation all right.  I mean, that's what people say, I mean, and that's what, you know, the type of approach to law enforcement that you've kind of, you know, fostered in your career.  So, I would expect that to be true.
Speaker 2: But, we did a lot of things that never got publicized.  As I mentioned, we had psychiatrists for every major mass murder in this country, we brought in the investigators, every major case we brought in the investigators.  That's something that never been done in law enforcement.  Where the head of a law enforcement agency going to other law enforcement agencies come and say, "Come in a help me."  No one, no one had ever done that before.  But, I think that the seriousness of that series of killings was such a magnitude, we did not want to not try anything that might have some barring on solving the case.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We even talked about exorcism and we had psychics, you name it.  And, my position was if it didn't hurt, let's try it.
Story_ID: 534752
Speaker 1: Now, it drug on for a long time and a lot--I think one of the, one of the most controversial theories was the one by [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: That the, somehow the seminal fluid of the young boys were being used to make interferon in Scandinavia or something and somebody was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dick came, Dick's a good friend of mine.  I've known Dick even before he was popular.  So, he came there and--with his theory.  He was just way off base.  It didn't contribute anything to what we're trying to do.  It just muddied the waters.  [Roy] Innis from CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] came there and holding press conference on the steps of city hall saying he knew who was responsible--those kind of, kind of thing were kind of just headline grabbing which did not help the city.  Let me try to make one point I think is very important to make.  If we had not had good relationship, we being the [Atlanta] Police [Department], with the residents, particularly the black community in Atlanta [Georgia], I would not have given a plug nickel for the city.  Again, what I said, earlier, what happens before the crisis, carries you through the crisis.  The people in our city, Atlanta, they trusted the police and we were able to get through a very difficult time.  There were rumors that the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] was responsible.  The white extremists were responsible.  All kinds of rumors that spread throughout the city.  But they stuck with us through the, throughout the investigation and when it was all done, the city came through probably one of the most difficult times any city in the world had gone through.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the trust was there from the beginning (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From the beginning.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).  How many children were killed in that period [of the Atlanta Missing and Murdered Children cases; Atlanta Child Murders]?
Speaker 2: There were over twenty.  But, we figured about twenty-one he [Wayne Williams] was responsible for.  In some instances we know who killed other--some of the kids but we couldn't prove it.  If you don't, if you can't prove it, there's nothing you can do about it.  But, we had a good idea about it.  The girls, we don't think he was responsible for killing the girls.  That was not his pattern.  So, but we tried him on two.  We had the strongest cases in those two.  And, the jury agreed with us in this instance, they convicted him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I suppose you--how did you feel when that was finally solved?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was a great relief because I spent almost all of my life devoted to that case.  As I mentioned, there were more than just the investigation.  I wanted to prevent kids from being victimized and to deal with the mental health issue in addition, the investigation.  And, so, when it was over, it was a big relief mainly because we didn't want any more kids to become a victim.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so, I was very happy when we made the decision to arrest him.  I was happy when we caught him.  I was just disappointed that those on top of the bridge did not handle it properly 'cause we really had the smoking gun there.  I didn't mention it but, in his car there was a bag with clothes in, ropes, and gloves and things like that.  And, they let him go.  And, that's what I thought was just a horrendous mistake on their part.  It was covered in the paper, The New York Times covered that right away.  If that had--if they had not let him go, I don't think there would be any question because we had really the evidence right there.  When I found out about it and we got the search warrant to search his house and cars, then it made it much more difficult to have the public see right away that this is the person that did the killings.  So, you still have people who are raising questions, but I would repeat what I said earlier, that's not unusual.  There is still debate about [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]'s death, and the--Kennedy's [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] death.
Story_ID: 534753
Speaker 1: You were only in Atlanta [Georgia] for how long?
Speaker 2: I was there for four years.
Speaker 1: Four years, all right.
Speaker 2: [Mayor] Maynard Jackson's second term.  I worked for a few months under Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] when he succeeded Maynard Jackson.  Maynard couldn't run again because of term limits.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, but, you moved on again after four years.  Now, what happened, you moved to Houston [Texas] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Houston, yeah, Houston elected Kathy Whitmire [Kathryn J. Whitmire], their first woman mayor.  And, she did a national search, in fact she had a search firm look for a police chief.  They called me, Spencer Stuart is the name of the firm.  Lou Rieger [Louis J. Rieger] was the search, executive search person.  And, called me and asked me would I be--and I told him, "No" 'cause I wasn't interested.  We solved the case [Atlanta Missing and Murdered Children cases; Atlanta Child Murders].  Andy Young had won.  He wanted--he even campaigned on keeping me as a [public safety] commissioner.  So, I was set on staying there in Atlanta.  And, then Lou kept calling and he asked, if he came down, would I have dinner with him?  I said, well, the worst thing could happen out of, I'll get a free dinner.  So, I met with him.  Then he convinced me to meet with Kathy Whitmire.  And, Kathy was trying to do this secretly.  That's why she had this firm doing it for her.  I think they--some business tentacle at that time paid for the firm.  And they, they did it at a reasonable rate.  So, we agreed, we being Kathy and myself, to meet in Dallas [Texas] for the interview with her.  And, we met at the [Dallas/Fort Worth International] Airport [Texas], in a hotel at the airport.  I came in from Atlanta.  She came in from Houston.  We met.  I liked what she wanted to do in the city.  I'd never been to Houston.  I've been there once, I think for a conference but didn't know anybody.  And so, she convinced me that I should take the job.  I convinced myself for another principle.  I had been a variable critic of white mayors or white appointed authorities of our cities 'cause none had ever appointed a black police chief.  And, I've been criticizing the white mayors for that.  And, here it was, she was going to appoint me and there's nobody else that was of color that would've been appointed.  So, I felt out of obligation to, if you would walk the walk, and otherwise it would be kind of insincere in my criticism if I didn't take the job when it was offered to me knowing that no other black would get it.  So, there are two reasons I took the job.  Number one because I liked her vision for the [Houston Police] Department.  And, I might add that Houston was a very troubled department in those days, known throughout the nation as being out of control.  And, number, number two, my commitment to principle.  If I believe very strongly that there should be black police chiefs in cities that had white mayors and I was given the opportunity, I felt obligated to take the job.  So, for those two reasons I came, came to Houston in 1982.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And, we completed the investigation.  Wayne Williams was convicted.  He was sentenced.  He was in prison for two life sentences.  That was no longer an issue.
Story_ID: 534754
Speaker 1: What was your reception like in the Houston Police Department, and in the community?
Speaker 2: I might add that I also discussed this with my family.  My wife at the time, before she passed away was--her name was Yvonne [Brown].  She and I were married for thirty-four years.  And, so, we discuss like every move I would talk to the family.  And, there's no family opposition to it.  Well, I think it would be safe to say, I was not greeted with open arms by the police officers.  (Laughter) Probably today if a police officer was on the force at the time they can tell you exactly what they were doing when it was announced that I was gonna be the next chief.  I had one of the officers talk to me who was in--out at the police academy at that time, and when--he said, "Some officer broke into the classroom," not, you know, not, "Burst into the class room and told the instructor, you know what that mayor's [Kathryn J. Whitmire] done, she's hired a nigger to be the new police chief."  And, that was kind of the reception I received internal to the department.
Speaker 1: This sounds like 'Blazing Saddles.'
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, but, I thought of 'Blazing Saddles' when I was a sheriff 'cause one of the reporters asked me, had I seen the movie 'Blazing Saddles.'  I didn't know at the time 'cause I had not seen the movie.  But, I think it was such a significant, really shock to the police department that everyone who was on the department at the time could remember exactly what they were doing.  So, I say, there were no open arms in the police department when I came here.  It was a troubled department.  It was a department that was literally out of control.  It existed for itself, didn't consider themselves as being part of city government.  Certainly, not part of the community.  That's what I walked into when I came here.
Story_ID: 534755
Speaker 1: We discussed some of the changes but, how did you--how were you able to win the, win over, or could you win over some of the, I imagine some could be won over but, there's probably a hard corps that couldn't.
Speaker 2: There are a lot of things--probably some would never get won over.  But, I set out as a goal of changing the culture of the [Houston Police] Department.  I remember my first staff meeting, they were not holding staff meetings but, I had four assistant chiefs, I think it were nine deputy chiefs.  That was my command staff.  I remember the first meeting it probably last less than five minutes.  I had an agenda and everything and went through the agenda and not one person would speak up.  And, they kind of crossed their arms and look at me.  I can imagine they were just saying, "Well, we're not gonna help that fellow," (laughter).  But, what I did, John Bales was an assistant chief.  John was the acting chief when I came here.  John was well liked and most people wanted him and he wanted to be the next chief.  He wanted my job.  The chief before me, [Bradley] "B.K." Johnson, he said he was not gonna work for that woman mayor [Kathryn J. Whitmire].  So, he just stepped down but, he was still an assistant chief.  I think it also is important to remember that, at that time, everybody except the chief had civil service protection.  So, I'm the only one coming into this job without a lifetime contract with the city [Houston, Texas].  But, I believed then as I do now that the vast majority of the people wanted to do a good job.  It was a leadership position.  They had been a culture created over the years by the former chief where people were not disciplined.  They tell me stories, if you went out and shot your gun, if you didn't hit anyone, you didn't have to write a report.  And, so, the stories of how people were abused.  People were, and this is the God's truth, were more afraid of the police than the criminal.  Some people were, not everyone.  To illustrate the significance of what I just said, I gave a speech at a banquet for medical doctors, all white, and sat at the table with some of their wives.  And, they were saying that if they were stopped by the police, they wouldn't stop if they were not in light where other people could see them.  So, it's distrust of the police.  So, it was not a good department at the time.  Now what did I do about it?
Story_ID: 534756
Speaker 1: Well, we're talking about trying to change the culture of the police department in Houston [Texas], yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I set--my goal is to change the culture of the Houston Police Department.  To do that I did a study of the department.  I did it myself 'cause I wanted to learn as much about the department as possible in the shortest period of time as possible.  So, I did a rather in-depth study of the department, and identified some of the problems that were very obvious.  And, what I wanted to do was to develop from those problems a set of values that would address the issues.  So, I developed a set of ten values.  Essentially, the values dealt with involving the community in the chore of policing.  The value dealt with the police officers cannot break the law in order to enforce it.  Values such as crime prevention rather than just arresting people.  Values stating to the effect that the job of a police officer is to protect the constitutional guaranteed rights of individuals and that's just as important as arresting people.  And, they were ten altogether, that's gives you a gist of what I did.  They would use those values for training.  In fact, I went to every training academy and I taught the class on values.  And, I wanted people to know that if you did something wrong that it was because--it wasn't because you didn't know.  Because I'm personally to tell you what the values of this department are.  I also articulated to the public as well as to the police officers that, that if you, if you're, that you as a police officer if you're found guilty of having abused someone physically, which had been a big problem, that two things would automatically happen.  Number one, you will be fired.  And, number two, you'll be sent to the district attorney for prosecution.  And, that was repeated over and over again.  You can't break the law in order to enforce it.  Your job is to protect the rights of the individual, that's as important as arresting people.
Speaker 1: Now, this is unusual because usually in police departments around the country officers that--say, they shoot somebody on the job or they injure somebody badly--inappropriately, are usually suspended or something.  And, it seems like a lot of officers think that the worst thing that can happened is to be fired, let alone be prosecuted.  I mean, hardly, they're hardly ever prosecuted.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was my point.  They may not be prosecuted but they sure will be sent to the district attorney's office for prosecution.  That's a decision made by the prosecutor.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, but firing that was my choice.  That was my decision, ultimately.  And, I wanted to get a message out there.  It's not business as usual.  You have a new person in charge of this department.  My job is not to come here and get--to drink tea with you.  My job is to make sure you, make sure we develop a department that's respected by the people in the city as well as throughout this country.  That was my objective.  So, those values were used in training, they was used in setting policy.  They were used in every aspect of the police department's operation.  After developing, after doing the evaluation of the department, I developed a plan of action.  And, the plan of action is outlined rather clearly where I wanted the department to go.  And, one of the things I did, I spend a lot of my time out in the community at night time.  Going to churches on Sunday, speaking from the pulpit.  And, that was unusual.  That had not been done before.  And, I go, I would articulate to the community what I believe in, those set of values.  It took some time but over a period of time, I would go to a community meeting and the beat officer would be the speaker and he or she would be saying the same things that I would've said.  So, it took some time but that's what ultimately happened.
Story_ID: 534757
Speaker 1: We'd end up firing a lot of people my first year in office [as police chief of the Houston Police Department] because some I guess didn't believe what I said, that I would do what I said I was gonna do.  So, some lost their jo--
Speaker 2: Can you tell us a story about--can--is there any one that you remember?  I mean, a story that you remember that you can tell us?  You don't have to give the names of the person but--
Speaker 1: Well, in most instances would be where we found someone that have abused people.  Where there's physical abuse or shooting people; there were a lot of shootings when I got here.  There was a, seemed to be a tendency to shoot at fleeing vehicles.  And, when you read the reports there all saying essentially the same thing.  "I was in fear of my life so I shot."  Well, you know, I had, I'd been a policeman long enough to know that their lawyer's writing that for them.  And, so, I developed a policy that if that's the case, you know, with a vehicle, just get out of the way.  It's kind of simple.  You don't have to stand in front of a vehicle.  And, there was a great deal of opposition to that.  When I got here we were arresting about 100,000 people a year for a city this size.  And, most of them were called class c misdemeanors.  Something you could write a ticket for.  I changed that.  And, as could be expected there was a vote of no confidence and I didn't win the vote.  So, there was a lot of opposition, union opposition against what I was doing.  Where two unions are competing for membership and they try to be more anti-management than the other.  So, that was going against me as well.  One case for example, had an officer play Russian roulette with a lady and fired the pistol with the gun pointed toward her head.  I fired him.  Another case where we had an officer shoot an unarmed Nigerian.  I fired him.  Had another case where a group of armed officers been out drinking and driving on the freeway, end up shooting a completely harmless lady who's coming or going to work.  A very celebrated case here.  Well, I fired them.  Those are some cases that I had to deal with while I was here.
Story_ID: 534758
Speaker 1: Then nevertheless, we put in writing policies and procedures that I thought were appropriate for the [Houston Police] Department.  We revised a lot of the ones I thought were not appropriate.  In fact, we became the first accredited, not the first, but the largest accredited police department in the country by virtue of some of the things that we did.  We changed our training program.  So, training people differently, a different training, different policies, start recruiting more minorities, more black, more Hispanics [Latinos], more Asians, too.  I hired to first Vietnamese officer in any place in this country.  So, those are the kind of things that we did.  And, then as I pointed out earlier, we wanted to look at how we should police the department in the future.  That's when I convened the executive session.  And, out of that came the concept of neighborhood oriented policing, what we generally call community policing.  So, we were one of the first agencies in America, if not the first, to implement community policing and we were implementing that incrementally.  We were building what we call command stations, which would be a self-contained police facility for each quadrant of the city.  So, if it had got--if we had followed through on the plan, we'd have five police stations.  One downtown, and one for each quadrant of the city.  But, I left before all that happened so it didn't materialize.  And, we implemented community policing in the first quadrant of the city in the new Westside Command Station [Houston, Texas].  Implemented it there and worked on it very hard.  And, it worked.  My goal was to, to institutionalize it.  So, we look at recruiting.  We looked at training.  We looked at rewards.  We looked at all aspects of the department.  And, when I left in 1990 to go to New York [New York], I recommended Betsy Watson [Elizabeth Watson].  A lady to succeed me 'cause she was very instrumental in our implementing community policing and we did institutionalize it.  We, we did a lot of programs to begin with.  We have a program we call the Positive Interaction Program [PIP] where police officers meet with civic associations every month.  And, they talk about crime and how they can work together to address the crime.  We started that back in the '80s [1980s].  It's still in existence today.  In fact, when I came back, I went to an anniversary--twenty-something anniversary and I was pleasantly surprised when they got up and reported no crime in this neighborhood this month.  Before that had been a high crime neighborhood, that's why we did it.  So, it works.  We implemented programs to help children.  The PAL program, Police Activities League.  It's for both boys and girls.  I never will forget when we brought the kids together for the first time, mainly minority, black and brown kids, I spoke to them and ask them to raise their hand if--about when I said, who wanted to be a police officer?  Not one hand went up.  And, after a few months, we brought 'em back and you saw almost every hand go up.  Now, we have police officers who are part of that PAL program.  We did the explorer scout program.  We did the D.A.R.E. [Drug Abuse Resistance Education] program.  Did what we could to keep kids out of trouble.  I wanted to reach those kids that were not being reached by other agencies, such as Boy Scouts [of America] and YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  We had the D.A.R.E. program.  So, we did a lot to work with young people.  But, we ultimately were able to change the culture of the department.  And, before I left in 1990, we had people coming from all over the world to look at what we were doing.  We became the model by which other police agencies were judging themselves.
Speaker 2: And, this is true.  This is true.  You know, all the people all over the country were looking at Houston [Texas] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 534759
Speaker 1: I ran for, as [police] chief here [Houston, Texas] and was elected the president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police [IACP] as well.  So, the reputation of this department [Houston Police Department] was able to get me elected as a first African American president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.
Speaker 2: And, you were like a regular speaker of the National Black Police Association's [NBPA] meetings, and are you a member of NOBLE [National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives]?
Speaker 1: Well, I wrote the proposal to bring the police executives together to form NOBLE.
Speaker 2: And, that's the National Organization of Black--
Speaker 1: National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives.  NOBLE has a very interesting history that has not been told.  I'mma do that one of these days.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: People have their own version.  But, a lady by the name of Peggy Triplett and a guy by the name of Bob Lamb [Robert Lamb], Bob was with Community Relations Services [Community Relations Service, U.S. Department of Justice].  You may have run into him.  He was a good--one of the best conflict resolution specialist anyplace in the world.  And, Peggy had been a police officer, or been with the Pat Murphy [Patrick V. Murphy] in the New York City Police Department [NYPD].  She was with the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration [LEAA].  And, we were sitting down walking one day at a little place called Faces [ph.] in Washington, D.C.  And, the essences of the conversation was, wouldn't it be nice to have an organization for black police executives so they can talk to each other and be supportive of each other.  Well, we knew there was no way to bring 'em together; didn't have the money.  So, Peggy came with the idea, said, "I work for the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration.  I know Pat Murphy at the Police Foundation [Washington, D.C.], I can get them to give us a grant to bring them together to address urban crime."  And, so, I wrote a proposal and I met with Dick Staufenberger one day from the Police Foundation.  The Law Enforcement Assistance Administration goes, Peggy's work had already prove that--Dick read the proposal and said, "Well, this won't fly."  So, I asked him to bring in a stenographer.  He did.  I dictated a new proposal to him.  He read it and said, "This will fly."  And, in 1978, we brought together about sixty-six, sixty-seven top level captains and above police executives from throughout the nation in Arlington, Virginia at the Marriott Hotel out there near the airport, international airport [Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Arlington, Virginia].  And, out of that came the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives.  So, I was one of the founded--founders of that.  I was very active with [HistoryMaker] Renault [Robinson] and the guys in Chicago [Illinois] with the black policeman's association [Afro-American Patrolmen's League; African American Police League].  In fact, I wrote a grant for them when I was in Oregon to help them get money to do things that they were--desires of doing.  I as one of their speakers at their conference on many occasions.  So, I've been actively involved in many of the things that have happened in law enforcement.  I was one of the founders of the Police Executive Research Forum [PERF].  I told you I was president of the police chiefs associations; a founder of NOBLE.  I was a member of the National Standards and Goals Criminal Justice Commission [National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals]; chaired the education training task force [Advisory Task Force on Education, Training and Manpower Development].  I was a member of the National Commission on Higher Education for the Police [National Advisory Commission on Higher Education for Police Officers].  Just many things that transpired since the 1960s, I have been fortunate enough to a part of that.
Story_ID: 534760
Speaker 1: Tell us about this transition to New York [New York].  What happened?  [HistoryMaker] David [N.] Dinkins is elected mayor, and then?
Speaker 2: David Dinkins was elected mayor.  And, I received a phone call from Ron Brown, who as you know has passed away also in an airplane crash in Africa [sic. Croatia].  And, Ron was telling me that his friend David Dinkins was elected mayor and as is the case with any mayor, his major problem would be the police department.  He asked me would I be interested.  So, I said, "Well, submit my name."  And, he did.  I interviewed for the job and I came out number one on that list and met with the mayor.  And, he thought about it for a few days and called and offered me the job.  And, I told Kathy Whitmire [Kathryn J. Whitmire] that I was leaving [the Houston Police Department].  She tried to convince me to stay and wanted to give me more money.  That was not the issue.  We had an African American that needed help and I had the background to help him.  So, I went to, went to New York as the police commissioner.  In January of 1990, in fact, New Year's Eve I went there and got sworn in the same night he got sworn in.  New York is a little different than Houston [Texas].  Going there, there was not the animosity and sometimes hostility that I found coming as the police chief in Houston.  New York's culture is whoever their police commissioner is the organization will support the police commissioner.  They know that the police commissioner represents the organization and they didn't want the New York City Police Department [NYPD] be embarrassed and if the police commissioner is embarrassed, the department's embarrassed.  So, I had a much easier time transitioning into New York than I did coming to Houston as police chief.  One of my good friends who's also passed away, Ben Ward [Benjamin Ward], he had been the commissioner.  He was the first black police commissioner in New York.  I was the second.  So, he was still there so I had his counsel and advice on issues.  In New York my major objective was to implement community policing citywide.  And, we were able to do that after one year of implementation of community policing we saw crime start going down.  And, it's still going down.  Now, David Dinkins has not received credit for what he did and every time I get a chance I'm gonna tell the story.  He put together a program, I helped write it called Safe Streets, Safe City: Cops and Kids.  And, that called for implementing my manpower study which I did that called for nine thousand more police officers for New York City [New York, New York].  But, Mayor Dinkins found the funds to hire nine thousand more police officers.  I implemented community policing in the New York City Police Department and there's a report.  All what I'm telling can be verified.  The report we wrote, the manpower study was "Policing New York City in the, in the 2000s" [sic. "Policing New York in the 1990s: The Strategy for Community Policing"].  And, the mayor's report was "Safe Streets, Safe City: Cops and Kids." So, anyone who wants to verify what I'm telling, can go and do that.  Well, any event, he got defeated by Mayor [Rudy] Giuliani and those police officers start hitting the streets on the Giuliani's watch.  Community policing had already been established and crime was already going down in New York City.  And, but, Giuliani takes all the bows for what happened.  But, that was all made possible because of David Dinkins getting money to hire nine thousand more police officers for that city.  Because we implemented community policing and saw crime start going down after one year of implementation.  You can imagine, you talk about changing a large agency, the New York City Police Department, the largest police department in the country, changing that was also a monumental task.  But, I had a--I had developed by that time a system that worked.  I used it in Atlanta [Georgia].  I used it in Houston.  By doing, well the system calls for doing an assessment of the department and I always use people in the department because if you use a consultant, it's that consultant's plan, not ours.  So, I got people to buy into it.  And, then we developed the plan of action and as a result of that, we worked together to implement the concept of community policing there.  And, it worked.  And, it's still there, still working today.
Story_ID: 534761
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the people that came around subsequently claimed that community policing was all wrong and they needed to be tougher on criminals.  They said they weren't tough enough and they received a lot of ink about that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Which is unfortunate because Bill Bratton [William Bratton] had worked as the transit commission under me when I was back there.  And, he came in and he ultimately got fired by [Mayor Rudy] Giuliani.  But, he continued and embellished on what I started, and it made a big difference.  Community policing is not soft on crime.  In fact, it's a smarter, better way of dealing with crime because you take advantage of a major resource, that being the community.  So, it's not just the police trying to fight crime, it's the police and the community fighting crime.  And, it's very effective.  Community policing is better for a lot of reasons.  Number one, you have the community working with you.  Number two, it's safer for the police.  Number three, you wanna prevent crime.  Number four, you solve problems.  So, for a variety of reasons it's just a better way of dealing with the issues of policing in any city; large or small.  Today there are probably about 80 percent of the police agencies in America use one form or another of community policing.  In fact, I introduced community policing in South Africa before there was a free South Africa.  I was in New York [New York] and the mayor [HistoryMaker David N. Dinkins] asked me to go over to South Africa because most of the emphasis was being placed on putting the government in place.  But, they overlooked what I consider to be one of the most important elements.  That being their police department.  Because the police department in South Africa supported the concept of apartheid.  Just as the police in America supported slavery during times of slavery or segregation and discrimination.  And, so, I went over there and I introduced the concept of community policing and that was ultimately incorporated into the constitution of that country.  And, so, it works every place they've used it, where they implemented it right.  But, to put a police on a bicycle and say it's community policing, that's not the right way to do it.  As I repeat over and over again, you have to change all the systems that support the police department in order for success.  When I was doing it in New York City [New York, New York], we had fifty-two I believe, different tasks that had to be completed in order to institutionalize community policing.  I developed for the first time in New York [New York], a set of values that were very similar to what I did in Houston [Texas] but, more concise as they should be.  I kind of refined the effort.  In Houston, I wanted to address the problems.  New York did not have the same problems so we were able to do maybe about four or five values that we implemented there.
Story_ID: 534762
Speaker 1: One of the features of New York [New York] that the [Mayor Rudy] Giuliani administration, well, Giuliani administration brags about is the transformation of Times Square [New York, New York].  Basically, from like a rough area with a lot of peep shows, and prostitution, and drugs, and so forth to a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What he doesn't point out, all that started under [HistoryMaker] Mayor [David N.] Dinkins administration.  We put a police station there in Times Square.  A lot of that was taken place--I guess, it's just timing.  The groundwork's done.  It can't be done overnight.  Over a period of time, it was done.  But, it happened under Giuliani's watch.  To be fair, and he has not been fair in this respect, he should've given credit to Mayor Dinkins for starting all the, that transformation in Times Square.  It is a great place, again.  At one time, it was bad.  But, the transformation part started under David Dinkins' watch.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, what are you--now, crime nationwide stated dropping in the, I guess, mid-'90s [1990s]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I guess.  And, what are you proudest of in New York?  Of your accomplishments in the City of New York?
Speaker 2: The implementation of community policing citywide.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We did not take just one part of the city, but we decided to do it citywide.  It's like turning around a big ship.  It was a major task but we were able to do it.  As I pointed out before, after one year, we saw crime started going down and it's still going down.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Do they still use some form of community policing in New York?
Speaker 2: They do, um-hm.  But, to be fair when [Bill] Bratton [William Bratton] came in, he got away to a large (unclear) from the community aspect of it, and it was more just the enforcement aspect.  But, they still use some forms of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of the things that we were doing when I was there, we had a--the 72 [72nd] Precinct was our pilot precinct.  And, all the things I'm telling you can be verified at the Police Foundation of the Washington, D.C. that--the evaluation of it.  And, we were doing crime mapping at the time.  Well, crime mapping was taken to another level by Bill Bratton in, what's it called?  Comstock [ph.].  Where you have real time reports on what crime by virtue of computer mapping.  So, he, he embellished upon that.  So, things--he did do something to improve it; what we had already started.  But, a lot of this started under David Dinkins.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now--
Speaker 2: And, that's the story that needs to be told; that he's not giving credit for the things he did in New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  There was a lot--seem to be, if I remember correctly, there's a lot animosity on the part of the [New York City] Police Department [NYPD] directed at Mayor Dinkins.  Can you--do you remember any of that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm not sure there was a lot that was directed toward him.  I see more directed toward Giuliani 'cause you had--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Protests in front of city hall by the police against Giuliani at one time during the early part of his administration.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, maybe I'm getting it confused then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 534763
Speaker 1: As you were saying earlier, your wife [Yvonne Brown] became ill in New York [New York], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We found out, I guess this is January of '92 [1992] that my wife had cancer, and we had no indication there was a problem.  And, my values are very simple.  First is my god.  Second is my family.  And, third is my job.  So, my decision was very simple.  I would resign my position from the New York City Police Department [NYPD] and come back to Houston [Texas] 'cause I have two daughters here, and be with my wife 'cause she was given one year to live.  And, it turned out to be about one year.  She died in December of '92 [1992].  A little, a few days less than a year.  And, that's the reason I resigned from New York to come back to Houston to spend time with my wife.  When I left, my first deputy Ray Kelly [Raymond W. Kelly], was appointed as a police commissioner to succeed.  But, that was my recommendation to Dave Dinkins [HistoryMaker David N. Dinkins].  Ray Kelly by the way is now the police commissioner again.  He was appointed by [Mayor Michael] Bloomberg to be his police commissioner.  And, so, I came back to Houston and taught at Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas].  I was a distinguished university professor there.  And, did that for one year.  And, then that's when--one of the major things I did at, at Texas Southern University, which his predominately African American university, one of the traditional black colleges [historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs)], I voluntarily, it was part of our contract, I directed the Black Male Initiative.  What I was interested in doing there was to get black males into Texas Southern University and get them out with a degree.  We found many entered but much fewer graduated.  So, that was the purpose of that.  And, I was carrying it down all the way to the elementary school and I wanted junior high, junior--middle school kids to mentor elementary school kids.  High school kids to mentor the middle, the middle school kids.  And, college kids to mentor the high school kids.  That was a grand plan that I had, but I didn't stay there long enough to see it through.  But, that was one of my major initiatives as a professor over at Texas Southern University.
Story_ID: 534764
Speaker 1: But, after [President William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton got elected, he asked me to join his administration as the, the Drug Czar [director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)].  And, I did that and went to Washington [D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Now, this is '93 [1993] or so, '92 [1992] or '3 [1993]?
Speaker 1: He took office in, what ninety--'93 [1993] and I went there in '93 [1993].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I went a little later than--he took office in January.  I went there in April.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, so I served as a member of his cabinet.  One of five African American members of his cabinet, which is the most you've ever had in anyone's cabinet.  He said, he wanted his cabinet to look like America.  And, he did that with Hispanics [Latinos], women, and African Americans.  I did that for a couple of years.  And, decided to--after people have asked me to run for mayor of Houston [Texas], I'd always said, "No."  Even when I was police chief, I was a very popular police chief here.  When they do polling, I--my numbers were higher than the mayor and all of that.  So, I'd always said, "No."  When I was here as the police chief, they asked me to run, I say, "No" for two reasons.  Number one, I had no desire to be an elected official.  Number two, I'd have to run against the person who hired me.  And, I think that would be unethical to do that, so I didn't.  When I went to New York [New York], my friends when they came there, when I came home to Houston, they'd asked me to run.  I say, "No."  When I went to [Washington] D.C. that continued, and finally I start giving careful considerations to it.  We held some meetings here, we did some polling and all indications were that an African American could get elected.  And, then they looked at the most electable one, electable one.  That was me.  'Cause I'd been the police chief, people knew me, and I'd been successful as the police chief.  And, so, that being the case, I did make a decision to run.  So, I came back to Houston and took the appointments at Rice University [Houston, Texas] as a senior scholar at the [James A.] Baker [III] Institute [for Public Policy] and a professor in the sociology department.  And, then in '97 [1997], I resigned when I announced my candidacy for mayor and won the race in December, with--after a run off, in December of '97 [1997], took over January the 2nd of '98 [1998], served my three terms--three two-year terms because the terms in Houston are two years.  And, the maximum you could do because of term limits would be three years.  So, I did six years, and then after leaving in 2004, this year, went back to Rice as a visiting scholar in the School of Social Sciences.
Story_ID: 534765
Speaker 1: Let's go back and talk about being Drug Czar [director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)], and what some of the challenges were.  It's popularly call the Drug Czar, and you know, what were your objectives as Drug Czar?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I kind of resisted the job.  I had just lost my wife [Yvonne Brown], I just moved back to the city [Houston, Texas], had two daughters here, and was not really interested in moving on.  But, I did go visit--a matter fact it's kind of a quick story.  He--his personnel person called and asked me to come and see him.  I told him I couldn't right now 'cause I was busy.  I was hoping they would kind of forget about me (laughter).  Then, I said, "Well, I'll be there.  I'm gonna be in Washington [D.C.] in a few--in a couple of weeks, I'll come by then."  So, they said, "Okay."  So, I went to Washington for some other business.  I went by the White House [Washington, D.C.].  They took me and they brought in Henderson Harris [ph.], 'cause he's from Texas.  Ron Brown 'cause I knew him.  Janet Reno, I knew her.  And, couple of other people to tell me it was a good thing to do.  I should do it.  Then, they took me down to the Oval Office and let President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton--and the first thing the president asked, "Did he say yes?"  And, they told him, "No."  I said, "I'll go back and think about it."  But it's, it's hard to say no when your president asks you come and serve your country.  It's just almost impossible to say, no.  I went back and thought about it and I said, "Yes."  And, ultimately came to Washington and was confirmed by the [U.S.] Senate, unanimously I might add, and took the position.  And, I never will forget, it was a very pleasant ceremony in the White House.  And, it probably meant a lot for my children.  So, I have four children.  My son [Reverend P. Devon Brown] who's a minister in Chicago [Illinois] at Faith United Methodist Church.  He has two kids.  A boy and a girl.  My daughter lives out in Flossmoor [Illinois], she's in the Chicago area.  And, she has four kids; twin boys and two girls.  And, I have twin daughters who live here.  One has three children.  The other one has two children.  So, altogether I have four kids and eleven grandchildren.  The point I'm making that my children were able to come there along with some of my friends from all over the nation to participate in the ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House.  Under most circumstances, they never would have that opportunity.  So, it's a lot of meaning for me and my family and many of my close friends to have received that appointment.
Story_ID: 534766
Speaker 1: By law, the director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy [ONDCP], commonly called the Drug Czar, is the only one in the federal government charged by law to reduce crime in America.  Now other agencies, fifty other agencies have a piece of that; [U.S. Department of] Health & Human Services with treatment, [U.S. Department of] Education with prevention and on and on.  I think the major accomplishment I made was to change the focus of drug policy for the nation.  One of the responsibilities of Drug Czar is to develop for the president the nation's drug strategy and that report is sent to the [U.S.] Congress and approved by the congress every year.  Previous to my serving in that position, the focus was on enforcement and interdiction.  And, I was able to change and place a greater focus of reducing the demand for drugs, through prevention, education and treatment.  Now, to me it was very simple: no demand, no supply.  And, you got to get--keep people from using drugs to begin with and those whose are on drugs to get them off of drugs.  But, we asked the--we had to also deal with enforcement 'cause drugs was a big problem at that time.  We deal with interdiction.  I was responsible for going any place in the world where they were drugs.  That meant I went all over the world 'cause there are drugs all over the world.  It's a global problem not just an American problem.  We're the biggest consumers but other people are the suppliers.  So, my major accomplishment was to change the, the policy of this country.  I also knew that you had to do something to break that cycle.  So, I implemented a program called break the cycle [Breaking the Cycle of Drug Abuse].  The cycle being where people are arrested for drugs, commit a crime, go to prison, and come out, get arrested for drugs, commit a crime, go back to prison.  The irony of that is that we should be treating them while they're in prison.  'Cause we know that involuntary treatment is just as effective as voluntary treatment.  We don't do that.  A major disappointment is, I couldn't get the money from the congress to mount a major treatment initiative.  I asked for $350 some million; got $59 million.  And, we had over a million people that we could identify, identify that could benefit from treatment, if we had the resources.  So, that's my major disappointment, I didn't get the resources for treat--I can get money for interdiction.  I can get money for enforcement.  What we found out is that there is a reluctance on the part of member of cong--some members of congress to support prevention and treatment 'cause they did not, did not want to be accused of being soft on, on drugs, soft on crime.  So, they give us money for enforcement, interdiction, but for treatment and prevention.
Speaker 2: There an ugly implication here, too, that perhaps, I mean, if a person--if I'm a heroin addict and I go to prison, and if prison works the way it should work, I shouldn't be able to get heroin.  So--
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: One way or another, I'm gonna be cured, you know, of the addiction by the time I get out 'cause I won't be able to get it.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  And, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, that's not the case, right?
Speaker 1: That's not the case.  And, you should be provided with those services to help you kick the habit.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But, even with no help, I'm not gonna get any drugs--
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: If it works the way it's supposed to work.  But, yet guys go and they're an addict (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, you still get drugs.
Speaker 2: And they're an addict when they come out.  Which means that there's drugs in prison.
Speaker 1: There's a problem there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 534767
Speaker 1: And, another problem that I did not able, I was not able to change the law on was the penalty for using crack cocaine versus powder cocaine.  I mean, about five ounces of crack cocaine, you automatically go to prison.  About five ounces of powder cocaine, you get probation.  Now, the vast majority of the crack cocaine users are African Americans or minorities.  The vast majority of the powdered cocaine users are white.  So, you have the same amount of the substances but at very discriminatory federal law that fills up our prisons with minorities, particularly African Americans.  I tried to change--that was not successful.  That was a disappointment also 'cause you see, we have more people in our prisons now than any other country in the world.  And, a lot of it is because of the drug problem.  So, drugs continue to be a major problem in this country.  But, I do take pride in the fact that I was able to change the course of the strategy and the policy of this country.  And, if we continue with the greater emphasis on prevention and treatment and education, that is the answer.  No demand.  No supply.  I had to go to different places like the jungles of Columbia, Peru, and Bolivia to look at where they cultivate the drugs and make the drugs and try to get those countries to do their part as well; Mexico, too.  And, so we work very hard on the drug problem.  There's still a lot that needs to be done.  One of the concerns I have, even if we build a wall around this country and no drugs came in, we'll still have a drug problem.  Because Americans are ingenious enough, they have synthetic drugs; your ecstasy, your methamphetamines, all of those things can be made with materials that are readily available here and that can be bought legally.  So, it's still a major problem.  I still consider it a great honor to be chosen to serve on the cabinet of the president of the United States, particularly President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton.  He did a good job as president.  He is someone who is very unique.  He worked hard.  He's a very bright man.  And, left the country in pretty good shape compared to where we are right now.  We were at peace.  We had a surplus, now we have a deficient.  We had almost full employment in terms of what the economists say.  We've lost a lot of jobs so he did a good job in leaving the country in good shape.

Speaker 1: I think that there was a, he even stipulated that the, you know, the Clinton crime bill [Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act] had provisions for so many hundreds of thousands of new cops on the streets and making (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, that's an interesting story in itself.  I didn't know [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton but, I was, when I was a police commissioner of New York City [New York, New York], he had been running on the platform of putting 100,000 more cops on the street.  The U.S. Conference of Mayors held their conference right here in Houston [Texas] the year he was running, I guess '92 [1992].  And, [HistoryMaker] David [N.] Dinkins and I went down to participate in the U.S. Conference of Mayors.  I was speaking on the concept of community policing to the mayors.  And, I was scheduled to speak right after candidate Clinton was schedule to speak.  Turned out that a secret service person that was in charge of his detail was a young police officer, an African American police officer I had broken in as a rookie cop in San Jose [California].  He introduced me to Clinton, that's the first time we met.  He was talking about the--he'd knew about me from my works in Houston [Texas] and New York [New York].  He was talking about his 100,000 cops.  So, I shared with him the--my belief was that it's not how many cops you have on the street, it's how you use them.  And, I told him about community policing so he changed the concept that we get 100,000 cops to either implement or expand on the concept of community policing.  So, I worked hard to help get that bill passed.  It was a good crime bill 'cause it also had money in there for prevention programs in addition to the additional police officers to either implement or expand on community policing.  So, I met him by chance that day.  I spoke after him.  One thing I learned, you don't wanna speak after the president.  When he speaks everybody leaves (laughter).  So, I ended up with not a lot of people to speak to.
Speaker 1: All the cameras follow him out.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.  The cameras leave so, so goes the audience.  But, it was a good experience serving in that position and I think we made a difference.
Story_ID: 534769
Speaker 1: Now Houston [Texas] I guess, so you taught at Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] for a while?  And--
Speaker 2: Well, when I made the decision to run for mayor, I felt if I was going to leave, I should leave before the upcoming election so it would not become a political issue.  I had some reservation by going telling President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton I was going to leave his administration.  So, [HistoryMaker] Vernon [E.] Jordan [Jr.] is a good friend of mine.  And, you know, Vernon Jordan is also a good friend of the president.  I went and spoke to Vernon.  I said, "Vernon, I'd pretty well have been convinced to go back to Houston and run for mayor."  And, so, I asked for how best can I tell that to the president?  He said, he'd tell the president and he'd handle it for me.  He did.  When I went to talk to the president, the president said, "I know what you're coming to tell me.  You're going back to Houston and run for mayor."  He said, "Good luck.  I'll help you any way I can."  So, Vernon kind of eased the dilemma I had about, about breaking not a verbal contract, more of a, not a contract in the sense of a legal contract, but a commitment to work for the four years.  I came to Rice University [Houston, Texas] as a first senior scholar in the [James A.] Baker [III] Institute for Public Policy and a professor teaching criminology in the sociology department.  I ran.  In our city anybody can run for mayor like most places.  But, we don't have a primary.  You know--this is nonpartisan government.  You don't run as a democratic or republican, you run as an individual.  And, if you get over 50 percent of the vote in general election, you're the mayor.  If you don't, there's a run off between the two top vote getters.  No one got over 50 percent because you have so many in the race.  A local businessman by the name of Rob Mosbacher, [Robert] Mosbacher was former President [George Herbert Walker] Bush's secretary of state [sic.], I believe, or secretary of commerce, one of the two.  And, he and I were in the runoff.  I ultimately won and took office on January the 2nd of 1998.  And, I might say that I really enjoyed going to work every day.  Because as mayor you can do things to help people.  I was able to do, to help those neighborhoods, those individuals that were traditionally left out of city government.
Story_ID: 534770
Speaker 1: I established for myself five guiding principles for my [mayoral] administration.  Number one, was neighborhood oriented government.  I said to myself, if neighborhood policing works for the [Houston] Police [Department] why wouldn't the same concept work for all city agencies.  Thus, birth of the concept of neighborhood oriented government.  That concept is rather simple.  It has three principles.  Number one is delivering police services and solving problems at the neighborhood level.  To do that, we divided our city into eighty-eight, what we call super neighborhoods.  Each neighborhood develops if they so desire, a neighborhood, a super neighborhood council.  That council in tern develops a super neighborhood action plan.  They present it to me and all my directors and we then tell them what we're gonna do to solve the problems they brought to our attention.  The major benefit of that is that it gives a voice to people who were historically voiceless in city government.  Number two, the second principle is accessibility.  I held town hall meetings through every segment of our city.  I had the Mayor's Night In where I opened up city hall at night.  I had the Mayor's Mobile City Hall.  On the weekends I'd go out in a van and anyone can come and talk to me about their issues.  So, we were accessible to the public.  And, number three is delivering our services in a prompt and courteous manner.  I knew from experience that long time career servants tend to forget what--that they're to serve, and they--and so, I didn't want that to happen.  I wanted our employees to be, to be able to deliver their service in a prompt and courteous manner.  To do that, we had mystery shoppers who would test our services.  Our third--our second principle was economic development and international trade, wanted to be more business here.  One or two--have business expand here.  We wanted to do more on an international level.  So, I've led trade missions through the Middle East to Asia, to Africa, to Mexico taking business people with me so we can generate business between Houston [Texas] and those countries.  Number three was transportation infrastructure.  We wanted to make sure we dealt with the transportation problem for our city.  So, we completely rebuilt our downtown area, street structure and the infrastructure under that.  We have for the first time, something that mayors have tried to do for over twenty years.  We have the first light rail system [METRORail].  And, I took it to the voters and they approved seventy-two more miles of rail in the city of our city.  That's historic for Houston because rail has been debated, talked about, voted upon for years.  It was a tough job doing it but we got it done.
Speaker 2: So, you didn't have one before--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Before then at all?
Speaker 1: That's something no other mayor has been able to do.  So, I'm proud of that.  In terms of economic development, we're able to revitalize our downtown area.  Before this was a dead downtown area.  We built it for the first time, a convention center, the Hilton Americas[-George R. Brown] Convention Center [Houston, Texas], double the size of our convention center.  Now, we're competitive in the convention business.  Dealing with transportation, we invested $2.9 billion in our airport [George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Houston, Texas]; new runways, new terminals, remodeling terminals, consolidated car rental, and a cargo terminal, did a lot to make our airport capable of being competitive with any other airport.  So, there's a lot done to make our city a better place.
Story_ID: 534771
Speaker 1: The other guiding principle would be opportunities for our young people.  I developed what we call the power card.  We used to have a library card now we call it power card.  I wanted every young person to have a library card, what we call a power card.  I wanted to expose them to the information of the library.  Like when I grew up, I could--we didn't have any financial advantages so I learned about people and places by going to the library.  I wanted other people to do that.  We were the first city to bridge the digital divide.  We put a software program in our computers in the library called SimHouston.  With the SimHouston program, anyone can go to the library and have their own personal twenty-five megabytes of space where they can create, they can store, and they can send.  No other city had done that before our doing that.  So, I'm very proud of that.  Because if you don't do that we have to classes.  Those with computers and access to the World Wide Web, and those without.  I don't want nobody left out in our city.  I had after school program that came in--we had about $40,000 for an after school program and when I left we had over two hundred--$2.5 million, and that program works.  We evaluated it.  Where we had the program, we saw crime involving kids is both, the perpetrators and the victims go down, school attendance went up, grades improved, and behavior improved.  A major, major juvenile delinquency prevent program.  So, we did a lot for our kids.  And finally, we had continuous management improvement where every year we have a number of programs to improve how we delivered our services.  A master plan for our parks.  A master plan for technology.  So, a lot was accomplished under my [mayoral] administration.  I'm told that it was the most, most prosperous six year period in the history of our city.  Most people look at the train [METRORail] as being the major thing.  They named the new metro administration building after me.  It's called the Lee P. Brown METRO Administration Building [Houston, Texas].  The downtown area is now vibrant.  We brought in the Super Bowl.  We brought in the baseball all-star game.  We did not have a football team.  We brought football back--the [Houston] Texans.  We have a new football stadium [Reliant Stadium; NRG Stadium, Houston, Texas], a new baseball stadium [The Ballpark at Union Station; Minute Maid Park, Houston, Texas], a new basketball arena [Toyota Center, Houston, Texas].  So, I can go on and on, but the point I wanna make, we had a very successful administration the six years I served as mayor.  We dealt with clean air.  When I took office we were the number one bad air city in the nation.  We put together a plan and EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] gave me an award for the best technology plan that they'd ever seen.  Transportation, I mentioned that before, but Houston [Texas] continues to grow.  We had to deal with the transportation.  So, we were able to get a handle on that.  So, all and all, being mayor of this city was a real treat because we were able to do things and help people every day.  Every day I could do something to help somebody.  It might be an elderly citizen I could do something over the phone to help.  Or, things that make our city a better place.  So I'm very proud of my time as serving as mayor of this city.
Story_ID: 534772
Speaker 1: Has it been the most rewarding thing you've done, you think?
Speaker 2: Well, I think everything I've done has been rewarding in different ways.  Probably being police commissioner of New York [New York] is the most challenging because of the nature of the job.  It's one of the toughest police job I've ever had.  The most difficult is trying to catch the killer [Wayne Williams] in Atlanta [Georgia].  So, there're just, there's something good about everything that I've done.  So, I--but, here I'm proud that having been the first African American mayor of this City of Houston [Texas], that we were a very successful administration.  No scandals, and people kinda look at us when we get those job, it's gonna be something--a scandal.  No scandals, and great progress.  People are very happy with the six years I served as mayor.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was kinda referring--maybe the feedback you get, you know, you got as mayor and some of the--I mean, people seem very positive about your administration and what it was able to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I think there's reason for the things I went through.  And, I didn't talk about all the things we've done in the interest of time.  But, we made the city a better city.  That's the bottom line.  We opened a new [sic. renovated] theater [Miller Outdoor Theatre, Houston, Texas].  We have more theater seats in this city than anyplace outside of New York.  We--I semi-privatized the [Houston] Zoo [Houston, Texas].  I--we have a good zoo.  But, we never had a great zoo 'cause the city would never put a lot of money into it.  So, we created a private non-for-profit foundation.  We put the same money that we always put in the zoo and they're raising money.  Now we have a zoo that's well on its way to becoming a outstanding zoo.  A couple of things that we have working that should come to fruition sometime in the future would be taking in the first school for blacks freed slaves in the city and turn it into an African American archival center as part of our library system.  Like the Schomburg Center [for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] in New York.  We're doing that.
Speaker 1: What's the name of it, the school?
Speaker 2: The old Grady School [sic. Gregory School, Houston, Texas].  We're in the proc--
Speaker 1: Grady School?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We're in the process of doing that.  Number two, I created a committee that's chaired by a young man by the name of Gerald [B.] Smith to build an African American museum [Houston Museum of African American Culture, Houston, Texas].  So we have a great museum district [Houston Museum District] at about thirteen institutions there.  I think it's important that the African American history be told there as well with arts--through art.  And, so those are things that are left undone that I hope will continue as the mayors come and go in this city.
Story_ID: 534773
Speaker 1: You're now the director of Brown Group International [Houston, Texas], right?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm at Rice [University, Houston, Texas].  My contract at Rice, my appointment is only for a year.  So, come January of 2005, I will implement a full-service consulting company called Brown Group International.  And, I have about a dozen associates I've worked with over the years.  Some of the brightest people in their fields that will work with me.  And, we intend to provide consulting services to governments, to corporations, and to individuals.  Our expertise will be in the area of public safety, homeland security, technology, community government, government relations, litigation support, disaster recovery; things of that nature that probably every company and every governmental jurisdiction can use those services in one way or another.  So, I'll kick that off in January and it'll be a new chapter in my life story.  And, hopefully a very rewarding one as every other chapter has been in my life story.
Story_ID: 534774
Speaker 1: When you look back on all the things that you've done so far, I mean, is there a, is there any particular, major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: In retrospect you always can find ways to improve on what you've done.  But, I think in many respects what I've done has not been my choosing.  I happened to believe that the creator has a master plan for all of us.  My major in criminology; my becoming a police officer; my going to Houston [Texas], to Portland [Oregon], going to Atlanta [Georgia] to Houston, New York [New York], those are--none of those are positions I ever applied for.  I was asked to come and take those positions.  If you look at that and the fact that I was not given as a probation officer.  I just think that the Creator has a master plan and what has transferred--transpired in my life has been something that someone much greater than you or I, or anyone else in this earth has determined.
Story_ID: 534775
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Zelma Edwards Brown and Andrew Brown] get a chance to see you become successful?  I know you father died early, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My father died after I'd been a police officer about three years.  My mother saw everything except my getting sworn in as mayor [of Houston, Texas].  She passed away during my campaign so she didn't see that.  But, she knew I was a--the Drug Czar [director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)].  She used to visit me when I was police chief and sheriff in Portland [Oregon].  She visited me in Atlanta [Georgia].  She visited me in Houston [Texas] as police chief.  But, she missed the latter part of my career.  That is serving as mayor of the city.  But, she was someone who was always very supportive and indeed proud of what I was able to do in my life.  I remember when I told her that I was going to go to the White House [Washington, D.C.] and work for President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton as the Drug Czar.  And, it was kind of a little silence on the other end.  She said, "Boy, you come a mighty long (laughter), a mighty long ways.  All the way from the outhouse to the White House," (laughter) in which literally was true.  We had, we had outhouses when we lived in Fowler [California], as I talked about earlier, then ended up at the White House.  So, she was very proud of that accomplishment.
Story_ID: 534776
Speaker 1: Just reflecting back on the Drug Czar [director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)], I think just one little question about that, I think I asked it off camera, but not on camera.  How do you feel about the legalization of drugs?
Speaker 2: I've always opposed the legalization of drugs.  In fact, I did a lot of research on it.  When I was police chief, I had mothers call me in the middle of the night, high on drugs, came home, beating on the mother, tearing the house up.  That's a consequence of drug use.  If you legalize it, that doesn't solve that problem.  Just take marijuana, people wanna legalize marijuana.  But, we know from research that marijuana has an effect on one's cognitive skills; reasoning, thinking, coordination.  A lot of accidents, serious accidents, if the police tested for it, they'd find that the person was smoking marijuana.  I think as long as, just using marijuana as an example 'cause if they, I don't know if anyone talking about legalizing opium, and the opiates--heroin and things like that.  If you take marijuana, the medical profession tells us that there are synthetic that can do that same thing that marijuana does.  Now, if the doctors, the medical profession said that's not the case, and you can benefit from marijuana for health purposes, I would not oppose that.  But, as long as you have the synthetic drugs that achieve the same purpose, I just don't think we should legalize--we create another problem for ourselves.  You see crime around marijuana for more than on reason.  Some people commit crimes to get money to use to buy their drugs.  And, others commit crimes because they are on drugs.  The latter one is not solved by legalizing.  It only exacerbates the problem.
Story_ID: 534777
Speaker 1: Likewise when you look at your life, what would you see at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: It depends on what phase of life, I've, I've had the opportunity to be the first black in many areas.  And, many people talk about that by being what's called a trailblazer, making it possible for other people to do things, either first or second.  I believe that when Kathy Whitmire [Kathryn J. Whitmire] hired me to be the police chief here [Houston, Texas], that opened up the doors to police chiefs all over the country.  Being the first African American mayor makes it easier for other African American mayors in our city; talking only about Houston [Texas].  By being someone who's had the fortunate of having a good education, the best education this country has to offer at the University of California, Berkeley [Berkeley, California], and particularly in my field of criminology.  And, implementation community policing, I have been involved in something very few people even see happen in their lifetime that is a transformation from one stage of an institution, in this case the police, to another.  As I said, "We've only seen one before with what we're seeing now with community policing."  Well, I've, I've been instrumental in making that happen.  So, there're a lot of things I think that people will see as my legacy.  In Houston for example, when I was asked what did I think my legacy would be; that was a tough question to answer 'cause I did a lot of things looking to the future; new water plant, all the investments we made in the airport [George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Houston, Texas]; new street systems downtown; the rail systems; and on and on, a new terminal at airport, all those things are for the future.  And, many will say that what I did as a legacy would be to building the light rail [METRORail], others said neighborhood oriented government.  But, what I said, since I spent my adult like in public service, I would want my legacy to be something that benefits local government, improving local government, improving public service at the local government.  As a result of that, some of my friends and supporters have developed a not-for-profit, non-partisan organization called the Lee P. Brown Center for Public Service [Houston, Texas].  And, it has as its mission to encourage people to consider public service as a career.  As this is only at the local level.  And second, to make a contribution sort of kind of a think tank to help improve the delivery of public services at the local level.  So, I guess, the bottom line is that my career helps improve public service at the local level.  That would be my legacy, amongst all the other things that we've talked about previously.
Story_ID: 534778
Speaker 1: Just another thing on the legalization of drugs, some argue that it's like liquor if you decriminalized it, you--people would still use it like they, like they're still drinking only it wouldn't be a criminal act any longer.  I mean, just be, be regulated by the state in some manner.
Speaker 2: I guess, my experience in life has shown just the opposite.  I was an undercover narcotics officer back in the '60s [1960s], that's my first assignment as a San Jose [California] police officer.  That mean--that meant that I posed as a narcotics dealer.  So, my life was with the drug addicts and at that time was heroin.  If you see the, the agony of people who can't get their drugs when they need it.  I think that alone would convince you that it's not a good deal to get sick and everything.  I have been a police officer all my life, well most of my life anyway.  And, I've seen the consequences of people who are using drugs.  I mentioned earlier, you have mothers calling in the middle of the night talking about their children coming home high and not having any idea what they're doing; destroying the house, hitting their mother of all things, and this is real.
Speaker 1: Now, what you were talking about just before we changed tape and got rolling again was that, I asked you about the situation at Amsterdam [the Netherlands].  Don't they have legalized drugs there and sure the addicts are laying around and stuff but there's not as much criminality--
Speaker 2: Well, you--
Speaker 1: And shooting around and--I mean, that's what they say.
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things you should do is talk to the police about that.  They don't--they have a tolerance in Amsterdam with what they call the soft drugs; your hashes, marijuana.  You can go into a store and buy that over the counter just as you can go to a store and buy coffee here.  But, what it--what happens there, you have people from Europe coming into Amsterdam because of their tolerance of drugs.  And, then you end up with the hard drug users as well.  And, so, if you talk to law enforcement people about the experience in Amsterdam, it's not as colorful and successful as you would hear from other places.  I've been to Amsterdam and you see some of the consequences of it.  I don't think Amsterdam should be a model for any other place relative to drug use.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, you said, I think it was before we started tape, you said you had a conversation with [HistoryMaker] Kurt Schmoke about this--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at one point, and who is one of the leading advocates.  And, as a black mayor of a major city like Baltimore [Maryland] a lot of people are listening to him.  He's on 'Nightline' talking about it ought to be legal.  And, you said you had a discussion with him where he thought maybe further study might be--
Speaker 2: Well, what happened, we were at a conference, I forget the conference, in Washington, D.C. and he was one of the speakers.  And, a number of us in law enforcement had been told or saw a speech somewhere, he's gonna call for the legalization of drugs.  We kinda pulled him aside and said, "That's not a good idea."  And, those who are in law enforcement did not think it was a good idea, and we still do not.  He kinda changed it and said, "We should study the idea."  But, he has been known for being--leaning toward the legalization.  I think he is sincere.  But, I know he's sincerely wrong.  We should not legalize drugs in this country.  I think it be one of the worst things we can do.  There are myths about legalization of drugs.  People commit drugs for many--commit crime for many reasons.  Some to get to drugs and some because they are on the drugs.  The drug itself changes the thinking process.  And, so, the first one might be taken away.  That is committing crimes in order to get money to buy drugs.  But, the second will not be taken away.  You have to look at the health consequences.  There're just myths about the legalization of drugs.  I think I'm a pretty open-minded, open-minded person, if I thought that legalization made sense, I could support it.  But, I haven't found anything in the scientific research that suggest it makes sense.  I haven't found anything in the practical life of a city that suggest it make sense.  I haven't found anything in terms of police work that suggest it makes a sense.  Haven't found anything in Amsterdam that suggest that a sense--make sense.  So, as I've studied the issue and I have, it's not been just a personal opinion, I've studied so I can--could voice an opinion and back up my opinion with evidence and I still say it would be one of the worst things could happen to our country.
Story_ID: 534779
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I pointed out that I've been the first or second in a number of things during my lifetime.  I hope they--we reach a time when they're no more first or seconds that African American will be part of what this, this country supposedly offers.  I look forward to the day when we have a level playing field.  I supported affirmative action as mayor and it advanced where we gave, not just subcontracts but prime contracts to minority business.  I would like to see a level playing field so the talent that exist in the African American community can be utilized to the extent that they can successfully compete with anybody else.  And, that's not the case right--we do not have a level playing field.  I'd like to see our children be able to realize any dream or aspiration that I might--they may have.  I know when I was mayor, I spent a lot of time with kids.  That's one little person--I told one little person, I say, "Stay in school.  Stay out of trouble.  Get a good education.  You can be the mayor of Houston [Texas]."  He kinda looked at me kind of strange, he said, "I don't wanna be the mayor.  You keep being the mayor."  He said, "I want to be the president of the United States."  I want people to have that vision in their lives, our children.  But, not just the vision but a true opportunity to see that vision realized.  In essences, I'd like to see all the barriers that prevent African Americans from achieving at their, at their God-given level to be removed.  I want education, and education is really is the key to success, to be available for every African American child.  Not just, any education, but quality education, the best that this country has to offer.  Want them to be able to go to colleges.  I'd like to see African Americans have equal job opportunities.  Not just entry level jobs but all the way up the, the ladder.  I wanna see healthcare in America, particularly for African Americans, and other poor people, to be not a privilege but a right.  These are the things I think that need to be corrected in our country.  And, if we could address all those socioeconomic issues that confront African Americans, we have to also address prejudice, and discrimination, and racism in this country in order to have a level playing field for everybody from children all the way up to our seniors.  If we can do that, that would be my dream for African Americans in America.

Speaker 1: You had this consultancy [Brown Group International, Houston, Texas] coming up but like, I don't know if you have any big future plans, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I think if I was able to write down how I would like to be remembered it would be that, I worked hard to make a difference in the lives of those who were less fortunate than I am.  I had, I've had advantages in my adult life of getting a good education, having different experiences.  But, in every way, every step along the way, I've seen many people who do not have what I've been able to achieve and do.  I would like to be remembered as someone who tried to help those who were less fortunate than I am.
