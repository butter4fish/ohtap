CLERK: 	It’s whenever you’re ready.  OK?  This is Celeste Clerk interviewing Rachel Payne, Class of ’97, for the Smith College Archives.  Hi.

PAYNE:	Hi.

CLERK:	We’ll start with a general question.  Where are you from?

PAYNE:	I was born in Southern California in San Bernardino and I grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada.

CLERK:	How did you come to Smith College?

PAYNE:	It was not on my radar at all growing up, but I had a high school guidance counselor whose best friend went to Smith and I was actually planning to go to college in L.A., and he said, “No.  You are just like my best friend and you’re a Smithie and I know a Smithie when I see one, so you have to apply.”  And he made me promise him that I would apply, so I did.

CLERK:	What did it mean to you that Smith was an all-women’s college?

PAYNE:	I was intrigued by it and when I read the material, it seemed so different from the environment that I was coming from that it interested me.  But I didn’t really have a lot of preconceptions.  I just thought it was — I thought it was cool but I didn’t really know much more than that.

CLERK:	What did you study here?

PAYNE:	So I was a gov [government] major and I double-minored in economics and East Asian studies.

CLERK:	Why did you come to the reunion?

PAYNE:	I think it’s wonderful to reconnect with everyone after so long but I also enjoy reconnecting with who I was, and stepping back into the person that I was back then and seeing that trajectory of 20 years and how I’ve changed, and just remembering what it was like to be that age again.  It’s really nice.  And I love seeing all my friends, but to be honest with you, it’s been so long, some people I don’t even recognize.  (laughs) So I just — I’m reconnecting and — and I guess meeting some people as if for the first time.

CLERK:	How is the campus different now?

PAYNE:	Well, it’s more modern.  I mean, you have Wi-Fi (laughs) which is awesome.  The — you have a campus center, which was always missing when I was here.  I had really hoped to have something like that, that now there’s a real center.  But I think fundamentally it’s not changed that much.  I mean, there’s an engineering school, which is amazing.  And I haven’t seen it yet, but I hear there’s now a Jill Ker Conway School or Innovation Center, which is very exciting and I would’ve loved to have been part of that when I was in school.  But overall, it feels like it’s continuous and that’s what I really like about it, that it doesn’t seem to change fundamentally.  I mean, it’s continually evolving but the core foundation is here.

CLERK:	What was your favorite Smith tradition?

PAYNE:	I had more than one.  I love them all!  (laughs) So tea, I loved Friday tea and candlelight dinners on Thursday nights.  That was always amazing that you could eat that well and be in college.  And even if you’re in the middle of your exams and things are crazy, it’s so civilized to sit down and have candlelight dinner.  So I really enjoyed that.  Ivy Day is a great tradition and seeing everyone from over the years.  And I don’t know.  I just think Smith has wonderful traditions.

CLERK:	Who was the typical Smith student of your time at Smith?

PAYNE:	I don’t know how to describe a typical student.  I feel like there were so many different kinds of people.  I don’t — I don’t — I’m not sure how to answer that question.  I think the typical student, if anything, was committed, hardworking, I mean, dedicated to their pursuit, but I don’t really have a lot of other generalizations.

CLERK:	Did you study abroad?

PAYNE:	I did.

CLERK:	What was your experience?  Where did you go?

PAYNE:	I went to Japan on the Associated Kyoto Program and I loved it.  It was just incredible and I fell in love with Japan.  In fact, my first trip overseas was a year in Japan.  So it was a big deal.  And I lived with a host family.  I love the language, the food.  It was — yeah, it was incredible.

CLERK:	Did you have a favorite professor?

PAYNE:	Yeah.  I had a few but I just saw him today.  (laughs) My thesis advisor was an incredible support during a really intense period of work because my — my honors thesis was — it was just a — it was an enormous — just an enormous effort and it was multidisciplinary and it was a little bit nontraditional in that it didn’t fit easily into one department.  But he still agreed to shepherd it through and was a — just a tremendous help to me.  So Dennis Yasutomo, who leads East Asian studies and government, and I worked very closely with him and he advised me on any number of areas within my thesis but also helped me work with other departments like East Asian history and comparative government and gender studies as well.  So it was very complex but he was willing to take it on and I still remember when I gave my oral defense.  It was a — it was — it was (laughs) scary.  I was a little nervous.  And afterwards, you know, it was all — they were all very stone-faced and serious and afterwards he said, “Rachel, please come with me now.  We’ve conferred.”  And I’m following him into a room and I’m so scared.  And remember, it was a whole panel of professors for my defense because I had so many departments.  And I open the door and they’re popping champagne and they’re like, You did it!  It was great!  And he was like, “I think that was one of the best oral arguments I’ve ever heard.  You did a great job.”  And at the time, they were encouraging me to get my PhD but I did not and I’m OK that I didn’t.  But it was — it was an immensely positive experience.

CLERK:	Do you remember Professor Itskov and who wrote about IPU and the protests that followed in regards to his book?

PAYNE:	No.

CLERK:	What do you remember about Smith’s administration at the time?

PAYNE:	Well I had an unusual circumstance in that I was one of the first, if not the first — I don’t know the details but one of the first students, traditional-age students, who became completely independent.  I was paying for my own college and I took care of all my own loans and scholarships and everything, and my mother remarried and they were not willing to help or able to.  And they didn’t really want to be associated at all and yet Smith — you know, your standard is to have income and tax trends and whatever else from your parents, but none of my parents wanted to be involved at all and were unwilling to commit anything.  So I actually had to petition to do it all on my own and it was a huge amount of work but I went through the head of financial aid and I ended up meeting with the president of the school and they granted me independent status.
So I was able to stay in school and it was — it was very stressful for a while because I didn’t know if I’d be able to stay since my parents weren’t going to help.  And in the absence of information, they have to give you a standard amount that your parents are expected to contribute, which of course they wouldn’t have.  And so it was just — put me in a real bind and I remember that the administration made a number of exceptions so that I could continue my studies.  Now I’m sure it helped that I was dean’s list and had great grades and all that so I could tell them how committed I was and that I would, you know, make the most of it, but I remember them being willing to work with me so that I could get my education.  So it meant a lot to me.

CLERK:	Can you tell me a bit about your social life at Smith?  Were you part of any organizations?

PAYNE:	I was a nerd.  (laughs) So my social life was mainly meals.  And I mean, I liked to have fun like anybody.  My first years, I lived in the quad so we had good parties but I was really just a nerd.  I — I was always studying and I loved it.  I just loved learning.  So for me, the social piece was more just being in the milieu of so many amazing people and having great friendships in the course of what you’re doing.  But it was less about belonging to a particular anything.  I mean, I sang a little bit with a capella but that didn’t really go anywhere.  I tried playing lacrosse.  That didn’t go anywhere.  I tried joining the sailing club, but that’s a joke because when do you sail?  Like it’s always snowing.  So it was like all these attempts at doing something and then finally I just said, “You know, I love learning and I just want to be here to learn and to study.”  So I guess my reference point was where I lived and the me— people I shared meals with and some of the fun things that we would do.  But I feel like it was a very rich social life.  It just wasn’t my focus.

CLERK:	What was dating like while you were at Smith?  Was it a hookup culture?

PAYNE:	You have to remember that I was coming from Las Vegas.  So dating there was a whole different story, like very easy to meet people, very easy to date, lots of hooking up.  And so when I came here, it was — I guess people could say that, but I — I mean, whatever.  I met guys.  We’d date.  It was never anything serious.  You know, a lot of boys from Amherst [College] would come over for parties and stuff but I didn’t care about boys.  I would like — that just wasn’t my focus.  The other thing is my first year — I should’ve started with this, I guess, but my first year I was still in a relationship from back home and so he came and visited.  And of course, it was a very serious relationship so it wasn’t a hookup at all.  It was just, you know, my boyfriend.  And that was nice.  It was really nice to have a part of my life from there here.  And actually, Smith was very accommodating about all of that.  I mean, people were really cool about it so it was great.  So I don’t know.  I don’t — I wouldn’t call it that.  I would just say it was college life.

CLERK:	Who was your best friend?  What did you guys do?

PAYNE:	Oh, wow.  I had more than one best friend (laughs) if that’s possible.  The first person I met when I came to Smith was a woman named Stella Wong who I’m still very, very good friends with and she lives in California and so do I.  And we would do these — we’d have antics and adventures.  I mean, it was things like we’d decide to go to Boston for the weekend and we had no money and we had no transportation and we would — I mean like I — I don’t even know if I should be sa— (laughs) if she would be happy with me saying this but we managed to, you know, find our way around Boston and stay somewhere without paying and like, just fun things that you do when you’re young and adventurous.  And we’d go shopping and exploring.  I mean, I’m kind of an adventurer at heart so — but we were on a real budget so it was — it was creative fun but mostly we would just laugh till it ached because we just had too much fun together.  She lived in Talbot House.  I lived in the quad and so I made a lot of friends with her friends.  Yeah.  And we were really close.  It was wonderful.

CLERK:	Do you remember changes to the social scene due to administrative efforts, maybe regarding drinking age, party regulations?

PAYNE:	No.

CLERK:	So what house did you live in and what was it like?

PAYNE:	So I lived in Morrow House for the first two years in the quad and it was — it was good.  It was very — there were a lot of seniors so as a first-year, I felt very intimidated and quiet which — I’m not a quiet person but the seniors were super loud.  (laughs) So it felt a little intimidating at first.  Sometimes a little oppressive, frankly.  Like I was on work study and a lot of them weren’t and, you know, I’d be serving them and it just — the dynamic was a little weird.  So I was pretty happy to be a senior finally and I lived in Chase House.  And I loved it.  It was amazing.  I mean, I think the quad had a really dynamic energy and it was a lot of fun.  And of course, lots of antics there too.  I mean, so many things.  But I — I don’t know if I would say I felt like totally at home there, whereas I did at Chase for sure.  And we had — we’re all seniors and so we’re — we’ve matured and we’re all on the same page and it was just a really supportive community.  I made, again, best friends there as well.  And I had a really close friend.  We’d spent a lot of time together.  So I guess — I guess in the evolution of my experience the two years at the Morrow, one year, junior [year] abroad which was also great in terms of friendships, and then Chase.  I would probably say Chase was my favorite.

CLERK:	Did you ever get in trouble?

PAYNE:	I don’t know if I ever got caught.  (laughs) And I’ll leave it there.

CLERK:	What was Smith feminist culture like?

PAYNE:	So I came here as a latent feminist.  Like there was a part of me that knew what I felt and what I believed in but hadn’t yet formulated the framework for how to really think about things.  And so I was probably a feminist from the age of 13 or so onward.  And so when I got here, it was just amazing to be surrounded by so many other feminists and to have a word for it that I — that I could really own and embrace.  And then of course, being here the more you unpeel the layers, the deeper and the richer the legacy is.  And so it was almost like I was able to tap into cultural roots that I did not inherit in my lifetime but I was able to participate in because of being here.  And it really gave me an amazing foundation for life.

CLERK:	Do you remember tense racial relations during your time at Smith?

PAYNE:	I do.  I think it was — I’m not sure if it was a particular — I don’t think there was a particular event or (pause) yeah.  I don’t know if it was driven by anything like any catalyst.  I just remember that there were — so I came from — I came from a low-income group and I was often thrown in with women of color, which is fine because I — you know, my high school, it was only 12 percent white so it was no big deal.  I was used to that.  But and so I heard a lot of that but I heard it from the standpoint as — as a woman of color, not necessarily on the other side.  And so a lot of my friends were women of color and so I —I felt like I was right in the thick of it but in a kind of a — I guess a neutral place where I — I was participating, I was listening, and I was learning.  Also about my own bias, by the way.  You know, I think one of the great things about dialogue at college is that you can — you can address bias and you can have a conversation around it and part of the learning is the dialogue.  And so for me, it was a real — like there were things I thought I knew and understood and then I definitely didn’t understand international, right?  So I came here with a certain understanding around racial politics in America but I really didn’t understand, What is the African experience like in America?  What is the — and so it gave me so much more exposure and empathy for people from very, very different walks of life.  And I feel very lucky that I got to be part of all these groups and that I — at my experience at Smith, it was wearing many, many different hats.  And so it was, you know, it was — it was great to be part of the dialogue but not on any side.  You know what I mean?

CLERK:	How did the Reagan presidency affect your time at Smith and Smith campus climate?

PAYNE:	Who?

CLERK:	Reagan.  Reagan.

??:	The president.  The president at the time.

PAYNE:	That was long before me.

GEIS:	That was in the eighties.

CLERK:	Oh.

PAYNE:	Yeah.

GEIS:	She was in the nineties.

CLERK:	Huh.  There is — there is a mix— my mistake.  There’s a mix-up.  (laughter)

PAYNE:	I mean, the aftermath, you know.  But — well, I’ll say Ruth Simmons was amazing.  I loved Ruth Simmons.  She was my favorite president.  (laughter) Although I — I guess I get to — I need to get to know the new one.

CLERK:	What were the big political issues that Smith students were interested in?

PAYNE:	At the time, we would go to protests in D.C. in support of the Violence Against Women Act.  And that was a big one because they were always threatening to cut it.  Of course, they still are (laughs) but that was a big one and my first internship was in the winter term, first year, at the Feminist Majority and I worked on domestic abuse and pro-choice events like Rock for Choice.  It was an amazing internship.  But those were the kinds of issues that we were focused on at the time.

CLERK:	Reflecting back on Smith, what do you think of your time here now?

PAYNE:	As an alum, you mean?

CLERK:	Mm-hmm.

PAYNE:	Or when I look back at when I was here then?

CLERK:	When you look back now.

PAYNE:	My Smith experience was transformative in really important ways.  It gave me a deep sense of who I am.  It helped me foster resilience.  I worked harder (laughs) than I’d ever worked in my life.  And I didn’t think I could absorb that much material, and maybe I didn’t even absorb that much material (laughs) but it was learning so much on so many different topics.  I felt — and I was hungry for it.  I was ready for it.  I was bored in school in high school.  I was — I would take extra classes just because I wanted to learn.  And here, I was among women who were brilliant who also worked really hard and studied hard, who also got really good grades.  And you know, this was more my scene.  These were the kind of people that I had been missing and didn’t know it.  And so for me, a lot of it was learning about myself and what I was capable of.
I also loved the fact that every president of every club is a woman.  And so women across the board are stepping into leadership positions by default, and you just get used to it.  So now in the corporate world and in the technology world when I look around and I don’t see enough women, it’s unusual rather than being the norm.  What is usual is having women in power.  And so I got — I got used to that and it felt right.  And so it also gave me a different frame for how to see the world.  I think Smith is really good about exposing you to different ideas and other cultures, so when I got to study abroad.  It also tells you a lot about yourself and in some ways how small your world is and how big the world is.  And it gives you a perspective looking back on the world that you did inhabit and then when you reenter, who you are after having left.  And that was also transformative.
I think my thesis, which was a labor of love, also transformed me because I felt like an academic.  It felt like I was doing the work and I was going where I wanted to go, my line of inquiry.  And it gave me a freedom to be able to pursue any studies that I would want to or any line of work for that matter.  So it was very empowering in that sense.  And I think ultimately it isn’t just the Smith education.  It’s being part of the Smith tradition and community that when you step out into the world, you have this whole institution behind you.  And I had never had that before either.  So I went from being someone who felt kind of out of place where I grew up, without a lot of support, to a place where the name itself evokes admiration and support and all of that — all of what you belong to after having been here is something you can carry with you through life, not the least of which are your friendships.  But importantly, it’s also all the things that you develop within yourself to be resilient and capable while you’re here that you can take with you forever.

CLARK:	Who have you become since?

PAYNE:	So I — when I was at Smith, I was a gov major so I thought I was going to go work in government and I was looking at roles in foreign service and doing all those interviews.  And then — this is going to sound really old, so forgive me, but it’s ancient history in your lifetime.  However for me, it was — it was the most exciting thing that ever happened.  I remember being here and we transitioned from really old school, like DOS [disk operating system] systems to — like Gopher and Mosaic — to the Internet and Netscape.  And that transition happened between my — basically between the end of first year and senior year, and it changed my life.
So here I was on a path to go into government service and, you know, I was a Truman Scholar finalist.  I was all that stuff.  Right?  So and then eek!   I took this total detour and went and interviewed for a tech company that for the first time decided to include Smith in the interview rounds.  And normally they only went to Harvard [University] and Yale [University] and maybe a couple other schools, but they decided, Oh, we’ll swing by Smith and see.  And they had two positions open for this particular role straight out of college and I met the head of the publisher of the network and that was it.  It was the interview that changed my life.  We hit it off.  We were both passionate about technology.  I didn’t know anything.  I only wanted to learn but I had a lot of ideas and I was just fascinated by where this could go and what it could do for industry.  And so he took a chance on me.  I got one of those two slots and I’ve been in tech ever since.
So I’m on — I’m working now on my fourth startup.  I’m the CEO and co-founder.  I have a holding company and I have a tech startup that’s in the video artificial intelligence space.  I’m also on a number of boards.  So I’m on the board of one of the world’s largest NGOs [Non-Governmental Organizations] called BRAC [Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee].  We do world — work all over the world around poverty alleviation, female empowerment, that sort of thing.  We also — it’s sort of got a microfinance angle to it as well.  I’ve done a lot of work all over the world in microfinance and — and I spent eight years at Google as a technology executive.

CLARK:	Thank you.

PAYNE:	Yeah, my pleasure.

GEIS:	I’m just gonna check to see if we have — I was gonna ask you a question [but we’re already over time?].  (laughs)

PAYNE:	Huh?

GEIS:	I was gonna ask you a question but I don’t think we have the time, so.

PAYNE:	Oh.
