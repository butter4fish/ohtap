Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, Ms. Palmer, we're ready.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewing today for The HistoryMakers.  Our Videographer is Scott Stearns.  And ma'am, will you please state your name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My name is Jorja Palmer, J-O-R-J-A, Palmer P-A-L-M-E-R.
Speaker 1: And give us your birth date and place of birth.
Speaker 2: My birth date is June 16th, 1930.  And the place of birth was New Madrid, Missouri.
Speaker 1: All right.  Can you give us today's date?
Speaker 2: Give you what?  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Today's date.
Speaker 2: Today's date is June 24th, year 2002.
Speaker 1: Right.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: My occupation at this moment right now is I guess you would just say a housewife now.
Speaker 1: And what was it before?
Speaker 2: Before I was a person involved in I guess you would call it the black movement.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I held many and wore many hats.  I did public relations work mostly.  Doing publicity and handling the media and putting on public relations events such as rallies, political education classes, political seminars, organizing classes and doing political fundraising which was an arduous task and it was something that I loved to do.  And more important I loved to see the effects.  I loved to see that something can be started and be brought from almost ground zero to a successful conclusion.  And that happened in so many instances and in many other instances there were a lot of disappointments.
Story_ID: 70366
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I've got five "People Magazine" type questions I need to ask you.  They just require a short answer.  The first one is what's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Watermelon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Orange.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes, the fall.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, that would be hard to answer.  I have several.  You mean would I like to go to those places continuously?  My favorite place to visit which I have visited many, many times is New Orleans [Louisiana].  And I like Toronto, Canada.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  What goes around comes around.
Story_ID: 70367
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's talk about your background and about your early years.  Can you give us the names of your mother and your father and spell them for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Elizabeth Bethel, B-E-T-H-E-L.  My father's name was Frank Williams.  My mother's name let me correct it, Elizabeth Bethel Williams.
Speaker 1: Your father's name, would you spell that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Frank Williams, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Frank the regular way?
Speaker 2: Frank, F-R-A-N-K.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any stories about your family background?  Is--do they have any stories come down from slavery times or any stories about how people, you know migrated from one place to another?
Speaker 2: Well I have some stories Larry, and one that's was very impressive in my life and helped mold my life knowing certain histories.  One was when my family sent two of their relatives to the north in caskets to save their lives from lynch mobs in the south and how they put them in caskets and bored holes in the caskets for them to get air and they shipped them out of the south to save their lives.  And my grandfather got shot by white people in Mississippi when they were living in Mississippi and my grandfather died with the bullet shells still imbedded between his spine and the spleen because the doctors could not remove it.  And how they would run from white masters and overseers and things in the south and how they would resist being beaten and how they resisted living in the south and having to jump off the sidewalks when white people would walk toward them.  And how if they worked--one of my cousins worked in a white woman's house and she accused him of raping her and they had to take him one night and put him in a casket and sip--ship him to Chicago too.  And how funeral directors down in the south would help them get them out of the town if they could to keep them from being killed.  Those are some outstanding stories that I've never forgotten.
Story_ID: 70368
Speaker 1: Now the story about the, the people being shipped up to the north in the casket and do you have any more details about that story?  What happened exactly?
Speaker 2: When they got to the north they would just get out and go to relatives who lived in Chicago [Illinois] and a lot of my relatives--
Speaker 1: Now this would be in the 1920s or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, like the Nineteen--Nineteen--in the Teens and the Twenties.  And a lot of my family lived right around close to where I presently live.  They lived in what was now--then called Ellis Park around 35th, 36th and 37th Street between what was then called South Park Avenue and Cottage Grove Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear)?
Speaker 2: And they would get jobs for them when they'd get to the north and more or less they thrived.  And I met them as older relatives and people who had survived so many unsavory incidences in, in the south, in the Deep South.
Speaker 1: Did they ever tell you what they did to have to escape?  I mean did they--?
Speaker 2: What they did to escape?
Speaker 1: No, what they did to--
Speaker 2: Well one of--woman of--
Speaker 1: --to necessitate them having to?
Speaker 2: --one woman, one cousin of mine was accused of raping this white woman.  And he said that when he walked into her bedroom that she had all of her clothes off and she invited him to come up into the bedroom.  When he walked into the bedroom and saw her stripped then he ran.  And it didn't stop her.  She still told her family that he had tried to rape her.  So when he ran he hid in the woods, right outside of Sardis, Mississippi.  And then they got into--somebody got in--he got in touch with someone and they got in touch with this funeral director and he set up the mechanism to ship him north in a casket.  Another one, a man in a store in county seat of Mississippi told him that he would--did not talk to him correctly.  They was supposed to say yes sir, yes ma'am and he just said yes and he said what else have you got to say nigga?  And he said, I said yes.  He said you're supposed to say yes sir.  So then he sent a group of men out to his farm house to get him and they told him to come outside of the house.  So they started shooting into the house and he ran out the back and ran through a thicket and ran along some bushes and things along the Mississippi River and got away.  So it's how you talked to white people or if you--or even thought of as messing with a white woman you could get killed.
Story_ID: 70369
Speaker 1: We're rolling again.  I just wanted you to spell Sardis, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: I'll be glad to, S-A-R-D-I-S, Sardis, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, well how many brothers and sisters did you have?
Speaker 2: I had seven brothers and one sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where do you--could you name them and let us know where you fit in the in the line-up?
Speaker 2: Well, the oldest is Roberta.  The second one is Clayton, C-L-A-Y-T-O-N.  The third is Marsell, M-A-R-S-E-L-L.  The fourth is Robert.  The fifth is James.  The sixth is Howard H-O-W-A-R-D. The seventh is Jorja, that's me.  The eighth was Rudolph and the ninth is Frank, Jr.
Story_ID: 70370
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now your parents--did you--what are your memories of your parents?  So I guess you--
Speaker 2: I have no memories.  I have only one memory of my sister crying and falling across my mother's [Elizabeth Bethel Williams] body and begging my mother not to die and leave us and I was about four years old then or so.  And she was just screaming, Mamma, don't leave us, and my mother died that afternoon.  And she was really crying because my mother gave birth to my youngest brother Frank and died shortly afterwards after giving birth to him.  And the way I heard it, that my mother had double pneumonia and was very sick and very weak.
Speaker 1: Well, who took care of you after your mother died?
Speaker 2: My aunt, my mother's--
Speaker 1: Well, your father [Frank Williams] died first right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father was in Chicago [Illinois] and he was teaching school and he was trying to get enough money together to bring the whole family to Chicago.  And he got held up and robbed on a bridge of the Chicago River and was thrown into the river and they found his body three days later in the river dead.  And he and another man were robbed and killed and they asked--they figured it out from a third man who lived and survived and ran that somebody walked up behind them and asked them did they have a match.  And they reached to give them a match and they conked them all in the head and robbed them.  So then right after that my mother just got weaker and sicker and sicker and sicker till she was dead too.   She didn't live much longer afterwards.
Story_ID: 70371
Speaker 1: Now you say your father [Frank Williams] was a schoolteacher?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did--do you know where he went to school and--?
Speaker 2: No, I really don't.  They were all educated in the south.  And they used to sit up and laugh and talk about some of their classrooms.  But that was after they were dead and I have other relatives talking about them and the classrooms and how sometimes they went to a schoolhouse where all the classes were in one room and one teacher or two teachers were teaching all of them.  And they talked about how strict the teachers were and how the teachers didn't take any slack.  You're going to learn the reading.  You're going to learn how to write.  You're going to learn you know everything about arithmetic.  And they talked about that in the sense that they felt that the Chicago Public Schools weren't as diligent as they should have been with students in terms of learning the basics.  And they felt that education was an all-encompassing fact of life that children should be educated to live and in how to live in the universe as opposed to a necessary or necessity of earning a living, that that was part of it, true.  But the other part of it was to give somebody a broader spectrum and a broader perspective of themselves and their place and their responsibility in the universe.  So they would talk about how the old teachers of the south instilled that into their students.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that, that's interesting.  I've never really heard that articulated quite, quite like that before but they actually felt they got a better education in the south with more diligent teachers than they (unclear)?
Speaker 2: They actually did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: They actually felt it.   They felt that their grasp and knowledge of the world was far greater when they saw us younger children up in Chicago going to schools and where our educational levels were and what we had grasped and learned like at third grade or at fourth grade or fifth grade, when some of them had read some of the great classics of the world.  Some of them had learned so much more about the world and they were just amazed at times.  Like if they'd ask a question of what's the longest river in the world and all of us would go bananas, you know.  And they felt that we should know.  We should know these things.  We should know what is the greatest mountain range is and where it's located and that we should know a lot of more basics about the world we lived in.  What is a tropical rain forest?  And what are you talking about when you're talking about a place in the world where no trees will grow and what is that place called?  And what kind of environment exists in those kinds of regions of the world?
Story_ID: 70372
Speaker 1: So Mrs. Palmer, who took care of you and your brothers and sisters after your--after both parents died?
Speaker 2: My mother's [Elizabeth Bethel Williams] sister and her husband, who was my aunt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then my grandfather and grandmother lived with us.  And that was part of the imprinting on us and our minds and stuff.  My grandmother [Anna Bethel] was an invalid who sat up in a wheelchair every day and we'd have to take food to her and sit down and help feed her and things like that but when she would sit among us, education took place.  She would gather her little young grandchildren around her and what did you learn at school today and why can't you do those mathematic tables?  And let me show you how to do it and let me show you and explain to you.  And she would tell them what an algebraic equation was and how do you readily learn how to solve it without sitting up in class and flunking out and getting a low grades?  And she had a method of teaching us and we would take big tests at school and stuff and she would sit us down and tell us the whole first rhythm of the test and then how to take tests.  And those are things I never forgot in all of my life, how to take tests and it helped me all through my life.  It helped make me the great honor student that I was in school.  It helped me to read.  She didn't see any reading material that is beyond your ability to read it and understand phenomena.
Story_ID: 70373
Speaker 1: And what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Anna Bethel, B-E-T-H-E-L.
Speaker 1: How long did she live (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well she died when I was about nine or ten years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But until she died, she made such an impact on all our lives.  Grandmother was never satisfied with a spelling test you'd bring home and you got nienty.  She figured you should get a 100.  All you have to do is learn how to spell the word.  And then beyond learning how to spell the word, do you understand the word?  Then, can you take those words and incorporate them into your life?  Can you use a word like synthesis and understand what synthesis meant, and what is the opposite of synthesis?  And I learned then antithesis, you know and how do you put these things together in your life?  And so you have no reason to flunk a spelling test.  And that was the impact she had on all our lives.  And there were times Larry, when she would take one of my brothers who could not spell the words correctly and she would make him stand up on a milk crate on one leg and he would just be balancing up on a milk crate like--she says don't lower that leg.  Spell such and such a word.  And it's amazing how after he'd flop on that milk crate for a little while, all of a sudden he'd spell it.  And she'd say okay you can lower your leg.  Now get down.  You know, now go write me three different sentences with that word in it.
Speaker 1: So she would add homework, make up (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  We did nothing but read and study.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We read and studied.
Speaker 1: Is this your father's [Frank Williams] mother or your--?
Speaker 2: My mother's [Elizabeth Bethel Williams] mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we had time to play.  She let us have fun.  She would even teach us some games.  She'd teach us how to play cards.
Story_ID: 70374
Speaker 1: Mrs. Palmer, when you lived with your aunt that was in Mississippi right?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: In Chicago?
Speaker 2: Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, so after--
Speaker 2: They brought us.
Speaker 1: --your mother [Elizabeth Bethel Williams] and father [Frank Williams] died you--
Speaker 2: They brought us from New Madrid, Missouri to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father was in the process of bringing us here anyway and then he got killed.  So my aunt came down with my grandfather and together they packed us all up and put us on a greyhound bus and brought us to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me just get this straight. Now you were born in New Madrid, Missouri?
Speaker 2: Missouri.
Speaker 1: And your family's from Sardis, Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Parts of them.
Speaker 1: Parts of them.
Speaker 2: And parts of them were from Tennessee.  It was a big family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I grew up and got into Chicago, I started meeting them from all over the south.  I met some that came from Covington, Tennessee.  I've met some of them that came from Memphis, Tennessee.  I met some that came from other cities in Mississippi, you know.  Granola, Gran--I don't remember all of the cities.  It was so many of them all the way down to Jackson, Mississippi, Hernandez, Mississippi.  It was so much.  And they could, they could take you through Biloxi on the coast of New Mexico--the Gulf of New--Gulf of Mexico all the way up through Mississippi, Alabama.  Some of them lived over in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  It's a huge family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And most of them are Williams or, or--?
Speaker 2: Bethels and Williams.
Speaker 1: Okay.  On both sides (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right.  They was lining the Mississippi River basically, on either sides.
Story_ID: 70375
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you were growing up, did you feel like a full part of the family?  Did they make you feel like welcomed, you know when you--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --when your aunt raised you?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: And can you describe to us some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in both in Missouri [New Madrid, Missouri] I guess and in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Missouri, I was too young.  When I left there I was absolutely too young.  I was just too young.  All I re--basically remember and maybe that was such a trauma, remember my sister laying across my mother [Elizabeth Bethel Williams] begging her not to die.  But the other part of it is Missouri is just a blank.  But Chicago, there was nothing like it in a great big African American family.  We have aunts and uncles that lived in Chicago.  I had an uncle named Uncle Houston, H-O-U-S-T-O-N, who lived at 349 E. 49th Street.  I had cousins who lived in various places in Chicago.  One of them lived on a street called Berkley Street and I had to grow up and go back in that area to even find Berkley Street, you know because it's not a street that you hear of a lot out on the south side of Chicago, but it's, it's  there.
Story_ID: 70376
Speaker 1: And the big, extended black family was one of making the children--make sure the children had enough food to eat, enough clothes to wear and part of that was getting welfare and that was from the Greater Metropolitan Welfare Bureau.  I suppose that was the name of it then.  And the reason why I'm saying it because there were certain times when my aunt would get my brothers in a wagon and they would go over to one of these welfare stations where they would distribute clothing to her for us and food.  And some of the things about being poor and in large families are things that seem to have segregated you in one--another sense in the community and in your lives.  You know like we got certain clothing and it was the cloth and materials was made a certain way where when people saw the clothing made up, they'd say those are charity clothes.  Those kids are on charity.  When they give you stockings they was brown, rib stockings that everybody when they see those stockings on your legs would know that that came from charity, they called it.  And then there were the foods.  They would give you not white flour, you would get gram flour.  And you'd get sugar and bags of oats and--to make oatmeal and stuff with and potatoes, big bag, sacks of potatoes and stuff.  So these were the charity children and everyone who lived around you knew cause they see you coming home with the wagons with charity food in it.  And they also could look at what you were wearing and when you went to school some children would have on pretty little navy blue skirts or pretty plaid skirts and stuff and you had this charity dress on and they knew you were the charity children.
Speaker 2: And did it make you feel stigmatized or--?
Speaker 1: Well you were definitely stigmatized.  And I had some of my brothers resented it, terribly so, till when they got to a certain age they started breaking out away from it.  And what I mean by breaking out, they started looking for jobs and they started trying to earn money so that they could buy clothing that would not stigmatize them.  And that they would have spending money to buy a lot of the other little things of life that other children had.  Like, children would have maybe some spending money or an allowance or something like that and we didn't.  We didn't have anything like that.
Story_ID: 70377
Speaker 1: But inside of the family proper, we had decent meals and adequate meals.  My aunt and my oldest sister would make certain of that.  We had plenty of food.  We had--where my aunt brought us to live was in a home that they had bought at 48th and Evans.  And the boys slept upstairs with one relative that they had asked to come up from Mississippi to stay with the boys up on the second floor.  And the girls and all of us and my grandmother and grandfather and my aunt and uncle, we slept and lived on the first floor.  And the meals were just tremendous.  They could take some of the charity food and some of the money that they had of their own too and they put together huge meals.  Now they were not meals that you would call cordon bleu but it would be adequate and plus they were good cooks.  And till this day, I cook like and probably exceed them in a lot ways with their cooking because it became a, a very important factor in my life of what the meals were and how the meals were prepared.
Story_ID: 70378
Speaker 1: Well let's talk about school.  What school did you attend here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well I attended Willard Elementary School which is at 49th and St. Lawrence Avenue, Willard School, W-I-L-L-A-R-D.  In 1940, we moved to 45th Street to 635 East 45th Street.  That's at the corner of 45th and Champlain Avenue and I attended Forestville Elementary School at that point.  And Forestville Elementary School at that time was the largest elementary school in the nation.  It was huge.  It's no longer the largest school anymore but it was at that time.
Speaker 1: Do you remember a teacher by the name of Frances Matlock [HM]?
Speaker 2: Scott Stearns:  Hold on one second.
Speaker 1: [OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 2: I can't think of her name, her maiden name Ms. Matlock.  We interviewed her and she was a teacher at Forestville for a long, long time.  Frances Matlock, she (unclear)--
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't Matlock now then.
Speaker 2: No, it was--she had three, she was married about three times (unclear).
Speaker 1: I know. I try to think of it.  I wish you could.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Cause I remember all my teachers.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 70379
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But--well what--who were some of the teachers that influenced you in grade school?
Speaker 2: There were so many of them.  I had a Mrs. Hill, Mrs. Woodley, Mrs. Agnew, A-G-N-E-W, Venita (phonetic) Baldus, B-A-L-D-U-S.  There was a Mrs. Rainey, R-A-I-N-E-Y, Mrs. Williams.  There were so many.  All of them influenced me.
Speaker 1: What kind--in what ways did they influence you?  Did they--?
Speaker 2: Well I guess because of the type of student that I was and from my grandmother [Anna Bethel] and, and my sister and all of them who made me always have this great thirst for knowledge and it just transferred into my whole school life.  And to--the teachers were very impressed and I guess you would say that I became just a target of their attention and they just helped mold me and they would bring books to me.  And then I went to--I was taken and placed in the study of the gifted child that was taking place over at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And that was Terman's, I think it was Terman, T-E-R-M-A-N, Study of the Gifted Child.  And they sent me over to the University of Chicago to participate in the gifted child program and then they would monitor me and see what I was doing and how I was making out in the program.  And that was because when I would take a great big battery test at school, I would just test so high in them and they started telling my sister and my aunt that we don't know what to keep doing with her.  We don't--how do we keep her occupied?  If we're doing fifth grade reading and she's testing above the high school level in reading, how do we keep her interested?  How do we keep her involved and what do we do with her?  So that became a challenge.
Speaker 1: Now what books were you reading when you were in grade school?
Speaker 2: Larry, it was just funny.  We had the regular textbooks and I was reading Shakespeare and I was reading other world great classics, you know.  I read the works of Machiavelli [Niccolo di Bernardo dei Machiavelli] and (laughs) it gets to be that you're sounding like a whiz kid or something, but not really.  It was just that, it was just--I was like a sponge, just, just absorbing.
Story_ID: 70380
Speaker 1: Did you have a teacher or a relative that was guiding your reading who had, who would suggest books to you?
Speaker 2: Some teachers would suggest books and sometimes they would come to me and I would say, I read that already.  And my sister would let me go to the library all of the time and I got to the point that at first someone had to go with me and then she found out that we're just going to have to trust her to go to the Hall Branch Library at 48th and Michigan Avenue, on her own.  And when I got inside the library the librarian there got to the point that she said, you know, I knew you were coming today and I've got such and such a thing for you.  And she would just hand me the books.  And a couple of days later I would be back at the library and she'd say, you finished them haven't you?  And I'd say, yes ma'am.  And she said well let me try to find you something else.  And it became a quest of what do we keep giving her to occupy her and stuff.  And my aunt was very strict and that was because the economy of our lives.  You can't burn the lights all night in the house.  They had to pay the electric bills. So my sister bought me a big, expensive flashlight and I would sit propped up in the bed with the books on my knees and the flashlight steadily reading, you know.  And I still read like that.  I belong to two reader services.  I've got subscriptions to every major magazine in the country.  It's just an insatiable thing of words, knowledge and reading.
Story_ID: 70381
Speaker 1: Now how were the other, how do--was this I guess different from other members of your family, did other people read like this too or--?
Speaker 2: Some of them did.  My oldest brother Clayton read like that.  My sister read like that but they were the kids who were educated in Mississippi.  And they kept up that type of reading.  I had a couple of brothers that didn't care anything about it and one of them became a big gangbanger and a big leader of a gang in Chicago, South Side in Chicago [Illinois], had the great big gangs.  My brother was part of The Four Corners and the Four Corners was I think the largest gang on the south side at that time.  And James was just actively involved with it, wore his brass knuckles on his hand all the time and stayed out in the streets all night and would get punished when he'd come home about didn't we tell you not to come here at this time of night anymore and stuff.  So he wasn't that interested in the scholastic pursuits and it's not that he could not have accomplished it, it's just that the big world of outdoors and the streets attracted him so.
Story_ID: 70382
Speaker 1: And when you are living in such dire poverty, it wasn't difficult for the streets to attract them.  They had no recreational centers.  There was nothing in the black community at that time for young pre-teens and teenagers and they found camaraderie and they found some sense of structure that started molding their own particular world view.  And they saw the African American as a besieged culture.  If they tried to cross Cottage Grove Avenue, the white gangs across Cottage Grove Avenue would beat them up and run them back.  And so it was always a battle royal and Cottage Grove was a boundary line between the poverty stricken African American community and the wealthy white and Jewish community.  And if you go across Cottage Grove you might get hurt or you might get killed.  So the gangbangers learned how to protect themselves and they established a turf.  This is our turf over here and none shall assail it.  And across Cottage Grove, the white boys said, this is our turf and none shall assail it.  And if my aunt who was working in a white family's home as a maid at 51st and Woodlawn wanted to stop at a store in Hyde Park and get groceries, she couldn't let my brothers come across Cottage Grove to help her bring the groceries home.  She'd have to lug them to Cottage Grove and then they would cross the street and get her groceries.   And that's how the race factor was as we grew up.  Across Cottage Grove were great big, wealthy families, the Balabons, the Katzs.  They had their own private schools.  It was in Harvard School, the little boy Bobby Franks and all of them went to the Leopold and Loeb [Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb] kidnapped and killed, you know.  And it was right across Cottage Grove from us.  But we didn't know anything about it because we weren't allowed over there.  Now we girls could go over there and pick up to get the groceries but the boys couldn't go.  They would get hurt. And it was really a race war type of situation along the boundaries.
Story_ID: 70383
Speaker 1: Now what did the black community look like in those days?  Can you describe it for us cause I asked you earlier about sight, sounds and smells.  But what was it like?  I know you're very descriptive and you're--and you got a good memory.
Speaker 2: We had nice apartment building homes.  When they call it a black ghetto, all of it isn't like what you would configure or what you--there were some streets along which we lived and the bit of irony was everybody in the area was all mixed up together regardless of your income.  Around on Champlain Avenue there were schoolteachers.  I used to go to one of my schoolteacher's homes at 50th and Vincennes and she was one of our teachers at Forestville School.  And during the war years when they were rationing food and nylons and gasoline and--she would send some of us to come to her home and go shopping for--my point is we all lived together.  Around on 48th and Champlain were beautiful two flat buildings with nice lawns and flowers in front of them and stuff like that.  And right around the other corner at 48th and Evans was a great big old ugly tenement building where people fought in it and the people was riding up to it all times of the night.  And a block from us was a great, big catholic school and its grounds.  What was the name of the catholic school that was there then?
Speaker 1: Was that Corpus Christi?
Speaker 2: Um-um, Corpus Christi was 49th and South Park, now 49th and King Drive.  This was a great big catholic school that was right behind us and later, later it became Hales Franciscan.  But before that, I think it moved out into the suburbs but my mind just isn't functioning right now but it was famous then and we'd get beaten if we went near them fences.  And sometime the nuns would come up to the gates even and draw this big thing out from under their robes at us and stuff and--
Speaker 1: What was that a paddle or something?
Speaker 2: Right, and beat us away from those gates.  We couldn't near it.  But that was the only big white institution that was sitting in the heart of us.  But all of the rest of us and our homes were, it was just scattered.  Some would be knockdown, drag out homes, especially in the large apartment buildings up closer to 47th Street.  And a block away would be a whole block of nothing but nice, two-flat buildings where lawyers, doctors, teachers you know lived in them.  And I said the school teachers, when I went to DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois] two of my high school teachers lived right around the corner from me.  Mrs. Harris who taught at DuSable High School lived right at 48th and Champlain, you know.  And Mrs. Duke was one of our teachers and she lived up the street.  So blacks of affluence finally started leaving these areas much later in my life because of restricted covenants.  And restricted covenants kept the Jewish community and the white community across Cottage Grove at its level and at its power and it kept black mobility down and it didn't matter how high you would go and what your educational background and training was, that you were restricted.  You had to live within the confines of the ghetto.
Story_ID: 70384
Speaker 1: Now how did that work, I mean what were the mechanics of the restricted covenant?  Can you explain some of that for people who haven't really lived under that and don't understand it?
Speaker 2: That just--they did not allow politically in the city, they didn't allow great mobility that real estate companies would not sell to blacks in certain areas.  And that did not happen and change significantly until the height of the 1960s movement in the City of Chicago where we fought the housing problem.  But before then, you just couldn't buy land.  You couldn't get out of where you were.  If you were a school teacher living at 48th and Champlain, you could not buy a house over in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois].  And the house could sit there boarded up for fifteen, twenty years and have a For Sale sign still, but these--this couple couldn't buy it.  You just were not allowed to purchase real estate outside of the ghetto.  And that's how the politicians and the powers that be made certain that blacks were confined.  We were on a black reservation you know.  We--as James [Luther] Bevel [HM] said in the civil rights movement when Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., former pastor, activist, humanitarian and leader of the African American civil rights movement] had come to the city and James Bevel was one of his lieutenants.  And James Bevel said that it is totally racism when twenty-five percent of the city's population is forced to live on less than ten percent of the land and that was our predicament then.  So we lived packed into these neighborhoods.  We lived with sometime two and three families occupying one floor and you lived with--if it was a four flat building it may have seven, eight or nine or ten families in it.  Somebody would have the first two rooms and, and then they would share the bathrooms and some, and some apartment buildings, everybody shared one kitchen.  And you got two rooms over here and two rooms over here and maybe another family would have the great big living room and maybe three or four of them lived in that.  So--and so arguments and fights would occur and they would occur over the whole thing of space.
Story_ID: 70385
Speaker 1: Was there a concern about law enforcement in those days (unclear) was there a concern about law enforcement?  I mean what was the relationship between the police and the community?
Speaker 2: Well the police were the--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well they were very hard on, in the black community.  I mean they would just beat you down at the least thing, no questions asked.  People had to go to jail and bail you out.  It's pretty much the same situation as now.  We fought against police brutality two or three various times in the City of Chicago.  And I'm watching it right now like full circle again.  Here we are once again talking about police brutality and then racial profiling.  And we fought it then.  There were groups who fought it at that time.  They labeled most of those groups who fought it, my grandfather was one of them.  They labeled them all communists.  They would meet out in Washington Park and have their little chairs that they would bring to sit on.  And my grandfather would take us out there and let us play around in the park while they would hold their meetings. And it was a lot of top officials.  Not officials but I don't know the word for them, people who were very erudite who knew the problems and knew how to articulate them and they would stand around and talk about them.  Like one of their problems was--and they mounted a campaign about Woolworth's and Neisner's stores in the black community and would tell black people don't shop where you can't work.  And--but I was so young at that particular time.  I didn't fully grasp--I knew that they were right on the issue because I was reading everything in the world too.  But I wasn't involved.  I was just too young to be involved with it.  But I would hear them and I would come home sometimes and I'd say, grandpa, that we can't go up to Woolworth's and get some socks?  And he'd say no, because you can't work there.  And they were trying to educate African Americans of why do you patronize all of these places and all of these big white merchants, have just lined 47th Street and 43rd and 39th and everything and they won't hire blacks in them?  And those were part of the, the first fights that I realized that were taking place by sitting out in Washington Park and listening to these men.  And I found out later on that some of them were doctors, some of them were dentists, some of them were teachers at Wendell Phillips High School [Chicago, Illinois] and DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois], places like that.  But the white world labeled all of them Communists and if ever they can crack one of them and catch one of them, they'd label them as a Communist and run them out of his job.  And that was my beginning--
Speaker 1: Can you name some of the people--?
Speaker 2: I done--can't name them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I said, but I got a mental picture, and the mental picture only comes Larry from the rest of my brothers and sisters were so glad to be in the park and play.  And I'm so glad to be in the park so I could be nosy.  You know I could sidle up near them and hear what they were talking about and I would sit sometimes and lay on the grass with my head on my hand just listening to what they were talking about.  And I see the faces you know and I would know at that particular time where I had seen them before, you know.  But to sit up and just identify them one after the other, I cannot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 70386
Speaker 1: Let's move to after--anything else about your childhood?  Do you think you were a happy little girl when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Wrong question, I really don't think so.  I think I was happy on one side of me and the other side of me was just tragically, probably invaded or impaired.  Happy, when I say happy was I loved my sister, was just like our mother to us and I loved my grandmother [Anne Bethel] and grandfather and they treated us so well.  My aunt who came to get us was not the same type of a person.  She was very biased.  She would lean toward her own children as opposed to her sister's, dead sister's children.  So she would sometimes be very wrong in terms of the treatment of me as opposed to her own daughter and we were only a few years apart.  That were--those were tragic times and heartbreaking times where I'd go to bed crying a lot and sometimes write the note to my sister that when she would come home from work I would tell her what had happened.  And then that other part of being happy was with my schooling and my knowledge.  And later on in my life I told a young man named Lawrence Landry who was a tragic figure that Mayor Daley [Mayor Ricahrd J. Daley] jumped on out here in the Civil Rights Movement when he was the co-convener with Al Raby [Albert Anderson Raby] of the Coordinating Counsel of Community Organizations and the way they broke Larry down.  And Larry finally left Chicago and one of the things I said to him, Larry, no matter what happens, Mayor Richard Daley cannot impair your mind.  What God gave you is a great gift cause he was one of the most brilliant people I'd ever met.  And I said as long as he does not destroy that great mind of yours, you can go anywhere in the world and make it.  Chicago is not the only place in the world to be somebody and to where you fought hard here but go somewhere else.  And he and the minister of my church finally kept telling Larry that and Larry finally moved to Washington, D.C., and got a great big job in D.C. and started doing better.  But when I'm saying that is my mind kept me sane, that I wouldn't let anybody breach the gap.  I wouldn't let anybody even close the gap and in the worst of circumstances I could fly over the cuckoo's nest, you know.  I would think above and over it and out of it under the most terrible of circumstances.  And I could get away from it.  I can go get me a good book and I'd lose myself for an hour or two and forget that kind of adversity was sitting there and then it would be sort of like--then I would map out a better strategy of how I'm going to deal with it a little later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But at this particular moment I'm not going to let it defeat me and it's that great quest that still goes on.  It never stops.
Story_ID: 70387
Speaker 1: Okay now, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois], 1943 to 1947.
Speaker 1: Describe your high school activities briefly.  I mean did you, I mean were you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: You're talking about being happy?
Speaker 1: Yeah, were you a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was happy.  I told you because of my mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know I got involved in stuff mentally and I wasn't happy over some of the things at DuSable High School cause one of the things--and I saw a girl in a magazine called Culture about a week ago, wrote a brilliant article and I should have that copy, I must try to get it, on the color divisions in the African American community.  And at DuSable High School you ran into it like a brick wall.  The little light bright, we used to call them damn near white looking children got treated differently than the brown skin and black children.  And I saw that immediately in DuSable.  What was the difference as far as I was concerned, it was that mind.  When those teachers start seeing it and some of them started you know singling me out, and here Jorja, read this.  Here Jorja.  Or they give a test, and they come back in the room to give the test papers back you see them staring at you, you know.  And in classes like physics or something the teacher was just bowled over, you know.  And the same thing happened when I went to college.  The physical education teacher said the papers range today from a perfect paper to a perfect nothing.  He gets ready to pass out the papers he said Jorja Williams, you know.  You see everybody staring as I go get that paper.  And when I've taken the test, I soon finish the test, I'm gone.  And you see the teacher smiling like she couldn't answer this stuff so she had sense enough to put it down and go on out of here.  (Laughing).  When they get the papers back it was a perfect paper.  She answered it so fast and got the hell out of here.  So it just started overwhelming the teachers.  So once again it was what are we going to do with her?
Story_ID: 70388
Speaker 1: You said you were involved in other clubs other than just the social club.  You mentioned a physics club, the--
Speaker 2: The chemistry club.  I worked with Captain Walter L. Dyett [Walter Henri Dyett] who was a legend at DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Can you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: Last name, D-Y-E-T-T.  There's a school now in the City of Chicago named after him, the Dyett Elementary School and --
Speaker 1: He was a famous musician.
Speaker 2: Famous, and he would put together great big shows annually at DuSable called the Hi-Jinks, H-I--J-I-N-K-S.  And he saw--like one of my English teachers said this girl is a writer.  So he said I'd like for you to help me write.  So I started writing things for him and show ideas and things like that and he just got carried away with me and then he would incorporate a lot of my stuff into his Hi-Jinks shows and we'd put--and we'd see the show go off.  And I used to get that satisfaction that I could work directly and played no instruments and nothing else, had no money or nothing to be in his bands.
Story_ID: 70389
Speaker 1: And then I started a newspaper at DuSable [High School].  DuSable had no newspaper and I went to my English teacher and I said why can't we have a newspaper like a lot of other high schools?  So she said well, I probably wouldn't mind it if the principal and everybody said okay, she said cause I would be one of your sponsors.  She was an English teacher named Ms. Yuke Ellis (phonetic).  And so she said let's get it together.  So we got it together and gave a--put a newspaper format together and I named the newspaper the DuSable Dial, D-I-A-L.  Then I started writing stories about Captain Dyett [Walter Henri Dyett] and all these band competitions in the city and DuSable's choirs that were singing in competitions.  They don't even have that anymore which is a tragedy and how our school choirs came in first place and how our bands would win the band competitions and everything and I started writing all these stories.  So then the English teacher said let her help you write some of the shows.  So we started writing on them.  And so whereas they wouldn't let us brown skin children be on the social staff, I found other outlets that they weren't even involved in and probably had no particular skills for, you know.  And in chemistry you know I went to the outer limits in where chemistry could go in the world ahead and I just started watching all of those chemical progresses and processes coming into being one step at a time.
Story_ID: 70390
Speaker 1: Now you were in high school at the beginning--during World War II?
Speaker 2: Right, World War II.
Speaker 1: Right, and what was that like?
Speaker 2: We--that's just--first dealing with the atoms and the development of the atom bomb and, and things.  That's why I said in chemistry and physics you know I just went to the outer limits on it all the way to dropping the first atom bomb.  And I went from the conception and the building of the Cyclotron out at University of Chicago at Stagg Field.  And I could get involved in learning all about all of that while the little light skinned children were worried about their little luncheons and teas and that did not phase me as much as could--was the man who is working right up under President Truman [President Harry S. Truman] gonna get the go signal to use the bomb.
Story_ID: 70391
Speaker 1: Now who were your mentors at DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: They were some of the teachers.  My chemistry teacher mentor was a teacher named Mr. Nelson Woodley, W-O-O-D-L-E-Y, and his wife incidentally was my mentor at Forestville Elementary School.  She was a counselor there.  And when I got to DuSable and she told him I see you have met Georgia and everything, and he said she's one of our best students.  That was Mrs. Julia Brown who taught zoology and biology.  And she got very attracted to me and she started mentoring and teaching me stuff.  And when I'd tell her about sad times at my household and stuff like that she would sometimes just give me new clothing.  Here's a new dress.  Here's this.  And then I had a French teacher and she finally went downtown--downstairs to the principal and she said I cannot teach her any more French here at this level in this school.  So they started wondering about could I be put into a college level for foreign languages and that was long before they started taking children and placing them into college courses when they were in high school.  They didn't do it for me but my teachers then started bringing me things.
Story_ID: 70392
Speaker 1: And I started reading the great French works of the ages.  And they'd just come and throw those big French books at me and I'd go home and just read them.  They're all in French, you know.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)?
Speaker 1: Oh, Le Pere Goriot, Les Miserables, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, all of the great French writers and the great French political fighters, everything on each side of the, the battle.  Robespierre as opposed to, you know somebody else.  And they'd bring me great books.  One of the first great books in French they brought me was the story of Jeanne d'Arc [Joan of Arc], you know.  And I read of her trials and tribulations and the Great Battle that went on between France and England at that time.  And things--the teachers would bring it to me and I would read it in French.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And till this day I have those great french books.
Story_ID: 70393
Speaker 1: So, you're quite a scholar in high school and as such, I mean what did you aspire to do when you graduated from high school [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well I wanted to be a research physicist or here's the dichotomy (laughter)--or a linguist or a journalist.  And when I got to college even they were baffled.  Now which are going to be your majors?
Speaker 1: And where did you go to college?
Speaker 2: University of Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is 1940--?
Speaker 2: Eight.
Speaker 1: Forty-Eight, okay.
Speaker 2: And it was at Navy Pier [University of Illinois-Navy Pier, currently University of Illinois-Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  But, what are gone be your majors?  And I was always baffled on what was gone be my majors.  Whether it's going to be science or whether it's going to be the languages.  And it was such a dichotomy you know, one thing pulling me one way and one thing pulling me another.  Then it became a matter of, could I sit in research laboratories day in and day out and be totally absorbed?  Would it be enough, when I liked the great big world out there too, which was the writing and the journalism and the linguist.  At one time I thought wanted to handle languages.  Like I took a year of German and I took a year of Russian.  I had the French already.  And then I said you know what, I would like to probably get involved with the United Nations and translate and do languages worldwide and--cause the next language group I got interested in was Arabic, you know.  And I saw the Middle East, particularly after the Balfour Treaty [Balfour Declaration] and the Balfour Treaty awarded Palestine to the Jews.  And then I saw that as an area of the world that I needed to probably get their languages-probably get their languages.  And I said if I learn the Aramaic and the Arabic that I would automatically get tuned in to Hebrew.  So amazingly Larry, before all those dreams get fulfilled and you are poor and you have to work, you started--start plunging between earning a living and pursuing dreams.
Story_ID: 70394
Speaker 1: And the next thing I knew in earning a living and pursuing dreams, I started working at a great big loan office at 63rd and Cottage Grove and I was also living at that time at the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] at 46th and South Park, which is now 46th and King Drive.
Speaker 2: Now you were going to the University of (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Illinois then.
Speaker 2: At Navy Pier [University of Illinois-Navy Pier, currently University of Illinois-Chicago]?
Speaker 1: Right.  And then I met a young man while at the Y [WCA] named Jamie English and then all of a sudden that wound up in marriage.  So that was the end of research physicist (laughing), and journalism at that time.  So the course of my life just starting taking another turn, a completely other turn and it was not a turn that I regret now.  It was a turn that led me to where I am now.  It was another turn in my life and some people regret their turns.  And they say, well you could have gone on and finished college after you start having babies and all this kind of stuff.  Well I had finished two years but I said--before I knew it I got called to a meeting and they were fighting for the school children of the City of Chicago.  And I had children.
Speaker 2: How many did you have at that time?
Speaker 1: At that time, two.
Story_ID: 70395
Speaker 1: I said they have got children sitting out here pushing them out into Willis Wagons.  And I say, what is a Willis Wagon?  So they said don't you know?  They said these are some wagons that superintendent of schools Benjamin Willis has built purposely to put up on the playgrounds of schools in the Black Community to relieve the over-crowding of the schools.
Speaker 2: And the schools kept getting more and more crowded--
Speaker 1: More crowded.
Speaker 2: --because you couldn't leave the Black Community--
Speaker 1: Because we were confined.
Speaker 2: --defined by--
Speaker 1: We were on a reservation.
Speaker 2: --the restrictive covenant--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you were describing before.
Speaker 1: We were confined.  And then they had--to keep you even more confined with the school system hooked up with the political process was the fact that they said the neighborhood school policy.  You had to go to the school in your neighborhood as proscribed by the Board of Education and the City of Chicago.  So if you lived between 43rd Street and 59th Street, you had to go to DuSable High School.  If you lived north of 43rd Street, you had to go to Wendell Phillips [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And all the little elementary schools in between, in each area you had to go to those schools if you lived within four or five blocks of that school.  That's the neighborhood school.  So you couldn't go across here and say I would rather go to the new school Mayo [Mayo Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] that's built up on 36th Street.  No, you got to go to school here.  You have to go to Douglas School if you live between 42nd and 45th and King Drive or it was South Park then and Calumet or Prairie.  You had to go to Douglas School [Frederick Douglass Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  That's the neighborhood school policy.  And then when the schools became so over-crowded because all of us--and the black community was growing.  And after the war years more blacks would not go back to the South.  They stayed in the large urban centers.  So they start packing more in the houses.  Landlords started dividing up their houses and the apartments more and more.  That where at one time they could get one basement apartment in a basement, they got two, you know.  And on the first floor they could put two apartments.  On the third floor which was generally larger than the first floor because the stairwell is not taking up the space on the second floor, they'd put three apartments.  People would have three apartments--had little, funny little kitchenette doors and stuff like that.  And you'd walk into a building and you would see the mailboxes and stuff.  You'd see eight, nine, ten--anyway the place was just too crowded.  So where do you put one million people together and keep them confined in the schools?  So the schools are packed.  So when I graduated from DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois], a good example, you know eight hundred of us graduated in that June 1947.  But close to two thousand of us entered as freshmen and then they just started dropping out going, you know out of school and stuff.  So when you get over two thousand coming into one little high school at 49th and Wabash and you get eight hundred that evolve out of--eight hundred was more than some of those white schools had in total population.
Speaker 2: So you had a crisis?
Speaker 1: Right, we had a crisis.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: So at that particular time I got involved in the fight, in the fight.  I said I've got to raise my children here in this?  Then I will join this fight.
Story_ID: 70396
Speaker 1: And what were the weapons used in the fight?
Speaker 2: Well we first just used to meet.  We used to organize and meet.  We'd try to get the black elected officials to argue the fight for us and they would not because politically Chicago [Illinois] was controlled by the Democratic machine and the black elected officials were part of the Democratic machine.  So going to them was just a waste of our effort.  So then we started holding rallies, we started holding meetings, we started holding--and I joined the PTA [Parent-Teacher Association] of my community.  And within a year time or two I got--no, two years, I got elected as the President of the PTA.  And then when I had moved into West Chatham that was an area that opened up that we could move into right across State Street as they were building the Dan Ryan Expressway, and we fought over there.  The whites were just fighting us and throwing bombs in our houses and chasing our children down the streets sometimes with guns, and we prevailed.  We said we are not moving, we are not running.  And I joined the PTA over there and the white--some of the white women in the PTA told us that "we are leaving it".  We're leaving this community, you can have this PTA.  But they wouldn't give us their funds that had been raised you know at the school and stuff and they took a lot of their books and stuff that they had once donated as a private library there.  They took all of that from us.  And we said okay, goodbye, that we will build from here.
Story_ID: 70397
Speaker 1: So one night after I became President of the PTA [Parent-Teacher Association], I invited a man named Warren Bacon, B-A-C-O-N, to come to our school and be our keynote speaker at our parents' night meeting.  And Warren Bacon came and because his name was famous in the city at that particular time, the school was packed.
Speaker 2: Now, what was his position?  What was he famous for?
Speaker 1: Well, at that particular time he was a great big mogul in the city, a big business man like at--what was the name of the company?  Was it U.S. Steel?  It was one of those big companies and he was a great big official in it and everything.  And he was such a statesman-like person that people started saying that Warren Bacon ought to be put on the School Board of Education and everything.  And then finally Warren Bacon got placed on the school board and then he became even more popular and so I invited him out to our school to speak.  And I said look at this school.  Our children are sitting in classrooms up on this stage and that was true.  I said look back there how the assembly hall is divided.  These are classrooms where you see the little divisions.  And the people started looking around and seeing them.  And I said and outside, look at our playground.  And our playground was just loaded.  I said our children don't have a playground to play on.  Our--the Willis Wagons are sitting out there.  And this was named after Benjamin Willis, W-I-L-L-I-S who was head of the school board of the City of Chicago appointed by Mayor Richard J. Daley.  And then we started writing letters and started setting up appointments to see Benjamin Willis and Benjamin Willis would not recognize our requests.  So then along came another man that you know of and everyone knows of who joined our battle.
Story_ID: 70398
Speaker 1: But before that happened we got invited to a meeting at T-W-O, The Woodlawn Organization.  And we got invited from our area West Chatham Improvement Association Leadership, and I was on the education committee in West Chatham Improvement Association and PTA [Parent-Teacher Association] President.  We got invited to T-W-O to a leadership meeting.  When we got to the Woodlawn Organization's meeting, I first met Reverend Lynward Stevenson, L-Y-N-W-A-R-D, last name Stevenson, S-T-E-V-E-N-S-O-N.  And another young man, much younger, named Leon Finney [Reverend Dr. Leon Finney, HM], L-E-O-N F-I-N-N-E-Y.  And it was at the Woodlawn Organization's meeting that Reverend Lynward Stevenson said, we just need to boycott the schools.  We need to show Mayor Daley [Mayor Richard J. Daley] that we will hold our children at home.  And since the City of Chicago gets this money by daily attendance, we will hold our children home and he will not get the federal funds for those days and then maybe he will listen and hold meetings with us to give our children quality education.
Story_ID: 70399
Speaker 1: Well did he?  Did he do it?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a long battle.  It was a very drawn out battle.  A lot of us went to jail over it many times.  So when we gets ready--getting ready to hold the first boycott and we started marching on the Board of Education--first we were marching and then another leader who was very famous stepped forward to help us lead the marches and his name was Dick Gregory [HM].  So Dick Gregory, who was just looked at as a comedian, a buffoon and stuff like that, Dick Gregory starting meeting us every day down on Balboa Drive and Michigan Avenue and helped us mobilize and organize the gigantic marches on the Board of Education at 222 N. La Salle Street.
Speaker 1: Now what year is this approximately?  What--?
Speaker 2: It was in the Sixties, about 1964, '65 [1965]. Sixty-Five, it was about 1965, '64 [1964] and '65 [1965], and we held--so that didn't work.  They just hauled us down the steps.  They arrested Dick Gregory a lot then they started throwing on Dick Gregory law suits that he owed the airlines so much money for traveling and hadn't paid the bills and other people in the community started raising the money and one of them was my doctor, Dr. William Riley Clark, who called me one day and said come over to my office.  I got something for you.  I went over to his office.  He went in his safe and said give this money for them to bail Dick Gregory out of jail.  And different businessmen who had money started doing it, to pay Dick Gregory's debts to the airlines and to keep him out of jail.  But it didn't stop Dick Gregory.  He said we're still marching tomorrow.  So Mayor Daley [Mayor Richard J. Daley] is going to have to acknowledge the black parents of the City of Chicago.  And then the Urban League jumped in and we said to Bill Berry of the Chicago Urban League that you're gonna have to--you're one of Daley's cronies.  You need to make him set up something and Bill Berry acted like it was nothing he could do and he couldn't violate the neighborhood school policies and so typical.  And we started calling him Tom Berry, you know.  So step by step, then all of a sudden a young black social worker and a young educator called a meeting with all of us organizations and we went to meet.  And this young man was Lawrence Landry, L-A-W-R-E-N-C-E, last name Landry, L-A-N-D-R-Y.  The other young man was Al Raby [Albert Raby], A-L capital R-A-B-Y.  And they say what are we going to do about it?  Let's form a great big coalition here.  And when we met we were amazed at the people who had responded.  The American Friends Association, the Catholic Interracial Council, the American Physicians Association, all the big neighborhood clubs like West Side Organization, Maple Park Organization, Englewood Community Organization, The Chatham Avalon Community Organization and my community West Chatham Improvement Association of which I was the delegate to that with another young man named Harry Griffin.
Story_ID: 70400
Speaker 1: And when we all met we were amazed that there were thirty-three major organizations sitting in this one room and then we began to realize the power of these big organizations.  So when we called for a city wide boycott and all of us put all of our resources together--and I remember getting ready to enroll back in school and all of a sudden you know one of the big ministers walked up to me and said we going to need you just to write the material, write the press releases, write the--call for the march, write--back again the tendency for journalism and writing.  And I said, okay.  So I'd sit up at night fixing baby bottles and changing diapers and writing. And then we'd meet the next morning and they would say, Jorja have you got the stuff?  And I said, let me read a draft.  And I'd read a draft and a few people would put their hands up and said, I'd like for you to change that sentence to this.  Well that didn't make any difference you know, but basically they would accept it.  And step by step we put together the mechanisms for boycotting the schools.  And they said, all over this country that a handful of black leaders could not make black parents keep their children at home and we begged to differ.  And as that publicity, I'm talking about that writing and how you word this stuff and--and we sent the messages out and we put out hundreds of thousands and thousands of bulletins and leaflets and we'd pay high school kids, here, drop them in everybody's door.  We went out into the shopping malls and the shopping centers and said you have to be with us.  And we started talking about the moment of truth and this is for all of our children.  We want them all well-educated.   We're not talking about children passed through a system that can't pass high school standard tests, can't pass college entrance exams and all this kind of--how can you learn if you go to school from 8 o'clock in the morning till 12 noon?  You go from 8 o'clock in the morning till 12 noon and then the other kids come in at 12 noon to--
Speaker 2: Two shifts of--
Speaker 1: Two shifts.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And we said how can they learn?  And then they said that they're not giving anything else even esoteric.  There's no gymnasium programs, there's no cultural programs, there's no music, there's no singing, there's no art, there's--and, and I still tell you about education and my grandmother [Anne Bethel] that education educates totally.
Story_ID: 91486
Speaker 1: So we're in the midst of a boycott now and tell me did you all have any kind of organizing training or anything like that before you--?
Speaker 2: Organizing training?
Speaker 1: Yeah before you--
Speaker 2: Not really.  You know one of the--
Speaker 1: Cause it's a massive undertaking (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right.  One of the key factors--and I'm glad you asked that.  One of the key factors was that Leon Finney [Reverend Dr. Leon Finney, HM] and all of those guys at TWO [The Woodlawn Organization] had been trained under the great Saul Alinsky [Saul David Alinsky]--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --who was a community organizing expert.  So up under young men out there who had all of those organizing skills, we learned and we put together the things that we needed to do to make up an effective boycott.
Speaker 1: Now did you go door to door (unclear)?
Speaker 2: We went door to door, we rang bells.  Like all the women in my PTA [Parent-Teacher Association] group, they knocked on everybody's door in West Chatham Community Organization and we literally went from door to door.  We met a lot of resistance but they let a lot of parents feel that if you can't hold your children home that you are part of the problem rather than being part of the solution.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now did you have like a list of demands, like 1, 2, 3, 4?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we demand the end of the Willis Wagons.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That the Willis Wagons be removed from our children's schoolyards, that the empty classrooms in the city shall have children who shall be allowed to cross the neighborhood school boundary lines and attend these schools where the empty classrooms were in closest proximity to their homes.  In other words, one of the demands was that that the neighborhood school policy had to go, that children had to be able to go to schools that were closest to them that had empty classrooms in it.
Story_ID: 91487
Speaker 1: And it was interesting that a lot of the white-based or predominantly white organizations that had joined us in the battle--when I told you they finally called a meeting together, Lawrence Landry and Al Raby [Albert Raby] and we formed a group called the Coordinating Council of Community Organizations.  And we called that group CCCO, the Coordinating Council of Community Organizations.  And the white groups that were in it, like the American Friends Society, the Catholic Interracial Council, there were a lot of them.  And--
Speaker 2: They're really called The American Friends Service Committee, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's the proper name for it.
Speaker 2: Quakers, yeah.
Speaker 1: The Quakers.  And I think the head of that at that particular time was a man named Kale Anderson (phonetic), Kale Anderson.  And when the newspaper said that Mayor Daley--neither Mayor Daley [Richard J. Daley] nor Benjamin Willis would release the schools that were so under-populated, then some of these white people went into the schools and started taking that census.  And amazingly a couple of big white reporters went into those schools and got the count too.  That was a big headline for a big reporter to say, this is a lie.  That here is Senn High School with a capacity in here to hold 2,800 students in the high school and only has 800 or 900 students in this school.  So that's under-use.  Then they go into an elementary school and said this school has a capacity for 675 students and only 389 attend there.  So then all of a sudden the newspapers started printing the empty classrooms and in the schools and where they were.  In spite of that, Mayor Daley [Mayor Richard J. Daley] would not relent, in spite of that.  He held Benjamin Willis to the line and would not release him, would not let him go.  So that's when we finally said well we'll just boycott the schools.
Story_ID: 91488
Speaker 1: So when you're talking about organization, we had within the confines of our big umbrella group some people like men of TWO [The Woodlawn Organization] and some men of some of these other organizations had skilled organizers and they helped us put together the fabric.  And people like myself would sit down like people like you and we said draw it, put the whole scheme together, you know network this together.  What do we say to the parents over on the west side at a school like Mason Elementary School where the very poor, dire poverty area, the parents practically all on relief or DCFS [Department of Children and Family Services] or ADC, Aid to Dependent Children and these people primarily held locked in step in the two ghettos of the City of Chicago.  One of our ghettos politically and demographically was the West Side and one of them was the South Side.  And when you talk to those parents on the west side, you're talking to an even, almost ninety percent poorer community than the South Side.  The South Side had a wider spread in terms of life support systems than the West Side.  So those parents were afraid and some of the fears were, we will cut you off of welfare and things like that.  So we had to come up with a motif, we had to come up with slogans, we had to come up with catch words that would like them know that whatever they do to you, they have to do to all of us, that we're all together in this and we're not going to let them divide us and conquer us by scaring you by saying you'll get your welfare payment--you will not lose your welfare payments.  You are to keep your children at home.
Story_ID: 91489
Speaker 1: And when the great big day of the boycott came, the big news cameras were everywhere and helicopters and--riding through the black community and they saw no parents bringing their children to school.  And only, just rare occasions and as they would get up near the schools the other parents would turn them around.  Not any fighting.  You don't want to go over there.  And I mean please support us.  Please.  We want zero attendance and the parents would turn around and they would stand and talk and say well my precinct captain knocked on our door last night.  Well who is your precinct caption?  Well I don't want my name involved with it.  No, we want to know your precinct captain's name because these are other African Americans like you are and like we are and they cannot be on the master's plantation doing the master's work against the rest of us.  We want to know who these precinct captains are and we're going to deal with it.  And don't you be afraid of it.  Don't you be afraid of it.  And we would tell them things about we're not going to elect Mayor Daley [Mayor Richard J. Daley]  anymore to the city and you don't have to worry about it and things like that.  That was much farther down the line, but eventually we did.  Unfortunately he died in office and we did not defeat him at the polls.  But we had defeated so much so the school boycott was a tremendous success that echoed around the world.  The Chicago leadership closes down the schools in the African--and they just said the black community.  We closed the schools down and Mayor Daley was in shock.
Speaker 2: Well did it move him to change?
Speaker 1: Well he dilly-dallied around another six or seven months and all of a sudden the headlines read--don't talk to us.  Not going to respect the leadership out there.  All of a sudden the newsmen and everything knew it and we saw it on the front page, Benjamin Willis steps down, you know.  Daley told him to resign.
Speaker 2: So Daley put the lid on Benjamin Willis basically?
Speaker 1: He had to.  He controlled him.  He put him there.  So then he replaced him with a man named Redmond [Dr. James Redmond], R-E-D-M-O-N-D.  One of the things we said at that time, don't shout for glee, you know.  That here's a Trojan horse done rode up here among us.
Story_ID: 91490
Speaker 1: Now Redmond [Dr. James Redmond] was he, I mean did he--?
Speaker 2: He tried to make some reforms.
Speaker 1: Okay, the ones that you were asking for?
Speaker 2: Some.  He had--they had to break up the neighborhood school policy.  They finally realized with the world spotlight on them that the world--I got a newspaper clipping from a man in Tokyo [Japan] with a picture of the Willis Wagons.  This is what American schoolchildren go to, you know.  And it just became a disgrace.  You know the France Soir newspaper in Paris, France had photographs of the Willis Wagons and stuff like that in the great, big, powerful City of Chicago and they would show Chicago's budget and its money and everything and Chicago's black children were sitting on stages or sitting out in little holes in the wagon.  They said what happened to them in the winter time?  How do you get enough heat in that Willis Wagon?  How do you do this?  And in the summer time it's a sweat box and everything.  And people started talking about them everywhere.  All of a sudden I got another picture from a friend of mine that I ran around the country with from Copenhagen, Denmark named Keld Helmer-Peterson.  His father was head of the Danish Consult in Copenhagen, Denmark.  And he wrote me a letter saying this is a disgrace.  Your children are sitting out in little wagons in the richest country in the world and one of the largest, big industrial cities of the world?  So Daley [Mayor Richard J. Daley] had to do politically do something.  And why is it that if I live right here on this street and there's a school two blocks down and I've got to go ten blocks to another school because of the neighborhood school policy when my children can just cross the street and go to school?  So people all around the world started saying this does not make sense.  So he had to break the neighborhood school policy down and it's ironic how each part of the fight became part of a larger fight. You see the larger fight was all over this country black children could not bussed to schools.  Black children sat in segregated counties and things like that.  So step by step, year after year all of it became part of the whole, the whole fight.  You see what I'm saying?  And then in the City of Chicago it first became a slight crack in the Daley [Mayor Richard J. Daley] machine.
Story_ID: 91491
Speaker 1: When parents like us would join together and then it led to my next big battle was at schools like Englewood High School and when the children were denied their books and they never opened up their math books or English books.  And then the children at Englewood High School had a teacher there named Owen Lawson and he was--started under the new I'm Proud and I'm Black program in America that evolved from out of the 1968 Democratic Convention.  And all of us went to Newark, New Jersey to the first National Black Power Conference.  And when we went to the first National Back Power Conference, Congressman Adam Clayton Powell was going to chair us in that big conference with all these national leaders.  And they ran him out of the country and he ran to Bimini to--for his life and still all of us and I was asked to be one of the delegates to the First National Black Power Conference in Newark, New Jersey.  And all of us said that we we're going to hold the conference anyway.  And he had gotten on an airplane and had run for his life to Bimini.  And when we got to Newark, New Jersey one of the key factors--and I sat on that committee in Newark, New Jersey--was on education and how do we educate our children?  And what constitutes an education for African American children?  And a lot of the blacks there said that you got to have this and you need federal funds, you need this.  And my answer as one of the education committee chairmen was, that's not necessarily true.  And as I chaired that great big committee in Robert Treat Hall in Newark, New Jersey, my response was education takes place wherever there are students and a good teacher, education can take place.  It's not based on facilities.  It's not based on how big the hall is and whether it's a great big institution looking like Harvard.  The education takes place.  If I'm a good teacher and a willing teacher and I have some students sitting down in a hole in the wall, education can take place.  And it goes back Larry to my grandmother that you can educate--and what is education?  She can sit in a wheelchair in our living room or dining room and she educated us.  Education takes place wherever there is a good teacher and a student.  So I asked them in Newark, New Jersey, let's not get hung up with we got to go get million dollar grants, we got to go get certain buildings built, we got to have--I said we have to come to a realization and an actualization of our realization that we need African American teachers who are willing to teach wherever, whatever the circumstances.
Story_ID: 91492
Speaker 1: And then I saw across this nation people like Haki Madhubuti [HM] who was just a poet at that time, and I saw others who sat up and said I'm starting a school here.  And others said--and a young man named Anderson Thompson here in the City of Chicago and Harold Pates [HM] and all of us said we can start the Black Communiversity.  And right over there at the Center for Inner City Studies [Northeastern University Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies] on Saturdays we started the Black Communiversity and we said education can take place here wherever there teachers and students and if it's a good teacher, a good teacher can teach you anywhere.
Story_ID: 91493
Speaker 1: And I got part of that premise right quick Larry also from a great doctor of mine who's named Dr. William Riley Clark and he had a two-flat medical building at Roosevelt Road and Central and he used to say to black students in medical schools--well Dr. Clark, I got to have this and I got to have a grant to do this and I got a grant to do this to be a doctor.  He said you could be a good doctor in a bathroom.  If you have to have surgery and I'm a surgeon, I can operate you on--in--on you in a bathroom.  He said if you don't believe it, I was overseas in Germany and France and we had to operate sometime on the side of a tent or up under a chair.  Medicine, good medicine, I'm just as good a doctor when I cut you under that chair as I am if I'm up with all of the lights of a, of the operating room going.  If I got some anesthetics or just some hydrogen peroxide and stuff and a sure hand, you know, he said I can operate.  And he was trying to teach black students, don't get hung up with all the manifestations and accoutrements of--that society instills in us that you have to have to be successful.  And you don't have to be--you don't have to have all that to be successful.  You want a good photographer, I've seen them won Pulitzer Prize, just got a camera. And I saw a man as I told him in Newark, New Jersey hang upside down at a window in Hungary and shoot that picture of Imre Nagy.  They said he was not captured, that he was not be held in activity. And that photographer went there and hung upside that window on that windowsill by his feet and upside down shot that picture and the world saw it next on Time Magazine cover.  Imre Nagy is incarcerated in this building.  And he got the Nobel Prize for that photography and he was straight for life.  He didn't have to say, I got to have to a van, I got to have the lights, I got to have the cars, all he needed was a camera.  I got to have a camera.  And with that camera he went and did--cause he had heard rumors and people telling him stuff along the line and he's right up there.  And he went up there and showed the world, he's right in there.  So I'm just saying that those were our battles.
Story_ID: 91494
Speaker 1: So Mr. Daley [Mayor Richard J. Daley] had to back down and he had to destroy the neighborhood school policy and we had, when Benjamin Willis stepped down, a minor victory.  And we saw that Redmond [Dr. James Redmond] had to do some of these things when he came in or we were going to continue the battles.  We were going to continue the battle.  We were not going to relent.  And by that time, that battle by 1966, January 6, CCCO [Chicago Community Council Organization] invited Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] to come to Chicago and we were battling Richard Daley so bad politically and when I walked into the 50th and Indiana YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], all of us community organizations of CCCO were there and Dr. King arrived and we all met with him and we asked him to come to Chicago and Dr. King said that he would come.
Story_ID: 91495
Speaker 1: And when he said we would come then we started holding strategy meetings and in the strategy meetings one of the leaders said that we are focusing too much--Al Raby [Albert Raby] wanted it to still be on education.  Well he's an educator.  One of the other leaders said, our biggest problem in Chicago, the next biggest problem is housing.  When I was telling you where we lived and how we lived in these little ghettos.  One island on the South Side and one island on the West Side and we couldn't get out of that ghetto.  Nobody would sell you any land outside of it.  No matter how much your income was, you could not escape that ghetto.  And so one of the leaders stood up in a Saturday morning meeting and said, no our fight has to be housing.  We're over twenty-five to thirty percent of the population of this city and we live on less than one-tenth of the land.  We need some land.  We've got to expand.  Our people have got to move out.  Our people have got to spread out.  People need space, space to live somewhere, space to be somebody, space to plan.  You know the greatest plans in the world sometimes need some space. And this leader was Reverend James Bevel [HM], B-E-V-E-L, and Bevel said they put the President of the United States in the White House.  He got all, the whole house to think it out, you know.  He said, Winston Churchill lives at 10 Downing Street.  He got the whole damn building, you know.  The Queen of England lives in Westminster Palace and he just went through all of the living places of people in the world, Italy the Duomo and all this.  He said and we expect African Americans to produce no matter how you're packed together like rat packs, you know, and things like that.  He said, we need space so we're going to have to fight for housing.  We're going to have to open up the housing in this city.  We're going to have to move out of the black ghetto. We're going to have to get out of it.  So then when we voted and agreed on it being housing then all of us got together and started doing our homework.
Story_ID: 91496
Speaker 1: And part of our homework was testing of real estate in the white communities.  What homes were up for sale, what areas were open?  And then we'd send black people in to try to buy it and they would get refused.  And they would tell them lies like we already sold it.  And then they said well are they going to occupy it?  They said of course.  And we'd sit and wait for it to get occupied and we'd go back and say that house has not been sold and it has not been occupied.  Well the owner changed their mind, things that we couldn't actually prove at one level but at another level we began to prove it. And we started a really organized legal pursuit of the property.  Who were the purchasers, who were the persons that offered to buy this property and what were the prices that were offered?  If they offered it to us, we got backed away because they would sell a bungalow that they may have sold at that time for $16,000.00 to $20,000.00 and they'd offer to us to $50,000.00 to $60,000.00, and that would make us back off.  So step by step we started sending white people in to buy it and the white person would say well how much you want for this?  And they'd say, we, oh we'll let you have it for $25,000.00.  And they'd say well here is your asking price to such and such a person.  And we'd have them.  They'd have it all written down cause they thought the person was going to buy it.  And they have made up their minds in their block clubs that if a black person would pay $60,000.00 or $70,000.00 to buy that house then that nigger could live out here with us.  They'd be willing to take one.  But most of them couldn't pay it.  They'd take one nigger, you know the token nigger, you know.
Story_ID: 91497
Speaker 1: And they did it in a lot of communities all across this country.  There's one, you know.  I've been to many a states and many a cities where there's one or two token African Americans.  And they'll tolerate one or two.  They are no threat.  They don't want fifty moving in here though.  They'll take one and they get through going through the papers they can see like well, my son lives in Wisconsin.  Well he's a research biologist and she's a great big master's degree dance instructor and things like that.  They could tolerate him.  He's a great big national scientist.  He ain't no threat.  And the little house he's moved into, he landscaped it better than everybody else that lives around there and everything.  So they got one nigger, you know.  But City of Chicago didn't want that so what started happening, they started buying up the property.  When one of them says I'm moving, well, it'd be legitimate, I've got another job in another city or I'm getting too old now.  I'm going to have to let this property go and stuff, then that block club would sit there and buy the property.  And they let the property sit there empty until they could find a white buyer and that's how they started realizing how they could save their neighborhoods from letting blacks in.  But before it got to all of that where they learned all of those techniques and till this day some of them still practice it, the thing exploded on them.  We were moving too fast and had too many people out in the field.
Story_ID: 70648
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're rolling again.  And we're in 1966, '67 [1967]?
Speaker 2: We're at '66 [1966] where Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] had been brought to the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that we decided that the focus in the city was going to be on housing and I ran the housing bid down.
Speaker 1: Right, and James Bevel [HM] (unclear).
Speaker 2: So we did--right, we did the testing in the white communities of real estate then we started marching into the white communities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when we started marching into the white communities, we started meeting with considerable, and that's just a light word, we started tumultuous opposition.  The whites started fighting us.  They started coming up with their bows and arrows and they started beating the marchers down till we got up to July 31st, 1966 and they started throwing our cars into the lagoon in Marquette Park.  And then they started jumping into trees and jumping down on the marchers.  Then way up where the police had agreed that they would protect our cars in a big parking lot, they let the white residents come in and pour sugar into the gasoline tanks of all the marchers' cars.  And then we couldn't drive our--all that weren't pitched into the lagoon had sugar poured in the tanks.  And some black cops even got in trouble because as some of us marchers would grab white people who were throwing sugar in their tanks, the white cops would come up to protect them and wouldn't let us beat them up and get them off the cars.  So they'd turn around on the black cops who were trying to give us some protection.  So it almost became a race war riot out there between the white cops and the black cops in Marquette Park that Sunday.  So finally the march leader said that we were going to have to march out of here back to the New Friendship Missionary Baptist Church at 71st, at 844 E. 71st Street is where the march started from and we were trying to get back.  And the marchers--the whites came right down 71st Street behind us and got on top of businesses and started shooting bows and arrows and missiles--
Speaker 1: Real arrows at people?
Speaker 2: Real arrows real missiles.  Sometimes they would have great big pears and cherries off their trees and they would put them in the slings and they'd shoot them at the marchers and they were maiming a lot of us.
Story_ID: 70649
Speaker 1: Were they--did they hit anybody with arrows?
Speaker 2: They were hitting them.  They were hitting them and one black girl that was sitting, walking in front of me in the park and you just have the whim whammies that she went right ahead of me and the next thing I saw is half of her head and skin was falling down across her eyes where they had hit her with one of those arrows and it just took all this part of her face down.  And then I looked up on a hill and I said to Reverend Jackson [Reverend Jesse Jackson, HM], I said they're burning cars.  We could see the black smoke and smell the rubber burning.  I said they're burning our cars.  And when we got up on top of that hill we could see those that they hadn't set on fire but they had them up in their hands and were taking them to the lagoon and pitching them in the water.  We got up even closer and saw that they were pouring sugar.  They had big bags of Domino sugar just pouring it into the gasoline tanks.  And so all of a sudden when we got there, when the march leaders told the police, you promised to protect us and the man said, well I will protect you but it's so many more of them out here.  They had the whole community out there against us marchers.  So he said well I will give you some protection.  So he brought up about three or four paddy wagons.  So Reverend James Bevel [HM] said how do we choose, you know?  Four or five thousand marchers in a--three or four paddy wagons that'll take about forty of them out of here, so how do the march leaders choose who's going to get in the paddy wagon and get out of here?  And it was getting dark.  The sun was going down.  So Bevel just turned around and took his big wooden stick up in the air and told all of us march toward the church.  By that time they opened up the fire hydrants and the streets were just running with water and I walked out of my shoes.  I don't even remember when I walked out of them in all that water.  And--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) up and aimed them at the marchers?
Speaker 2: Right.  Just opened up the fire hydrants along the streets and just put a big board in it or something and the water was just coming at us.  And I went down the side of one of the store fronts dodging a missile that somebody was throwing at us from the top of a store and when I dodged the missile, one little white boy had a piece of the sidewalk up and as I turned over like this, he just came down in the middle of my back with the concrete and down I went.
Story_ID: 70650
Speaker 1: And one nun turned around and asked one of the gang leaders that Bevel [Reverend James Bevel, HM] had taken on the marches with us to pick me up and they carried me all the way back to the church in their arms.  But by that time we were nearing Ashland Avenue and it's a funny thing, we talk about being in integrated communities.  And we were so glad we were getting near Ashland Avenue, we didn't know what to do because Ashland Avenue would be the end of the white community and the beginning of us.  And just as darkness was falling they brought up the guns then they started standing on the top of all them stores all the way down to Damen and started shooting at us.  And the bullets would go whizzing by us into store front windows and stuff like that.  And that's when Bevel lifted his cane up in the air and showed us there is Ashland Avenue and we ran for it.  And we could see Ashland, we could see hundreds and hundreds of black people standing on their porches and back porches with weapons and things in their hands as if to say come on across.  And the white people as soon as they saw that up ahead, soon as we got to about ten or twelve feet of Ashland Avenue corner itself, they turned around.  It was just amazing, just gone.  They left us and we were saved by a street.  We got back into the church and started trying to regroup.
Speaker 2: Did anybody get shot?
Speaker 1: Hmm?
Speaker 2: Did anyone get shot?
Speaker 1: Not get shot to get hurt and killed.  A lot of them got grazed and things like that.
Story_ID: 70651
Speaker 1: And you know it was another interesting thing on the march, not any of the leaders but a lot of their white followers who had joined the prayer vigils and stuff we were holding out of these various places every Sunday in the white community, when they saw them cars on fire and saw the water hydrants all get opened up, we got to a certain street and I turned to one of our black leaders and I said, they're disappearing.  You understand what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: (Unclear)?
Speaker 1: That a lot of the white marchers just melted into the streets with the white rabble.  We couldn't--and then disappear among them.  It reminded me of Lone Ranger and Tonto.  Lone Ranger said, here come all them Indians and Tonto, what you mean, white man?  You know, you know he's an Indian too.  But they just disappeared.  They disappeared into the crowd and one of the things that I thought of and a lot of us thought of it afterwards and said it to each other, some whites will be with you as long as articulating the problem or writing the problem and saying I'm with you and this, this--but when you get down to the hardcore clutches and it's a do or die time, a lot of them can't stick with you all the way to the end.  And we didn't hold it against them.  It was an out for them that's (unclear) they could melt back into those streets and go on about their business.  I saw one of them heading straight on down the street just as cool, looked back once and he was gone, you know.  He's out of it, like I didn't come out here to die over whether blacks can move in any house they want to live into.  Some of them didn't in to die.  Like I could go to the Middle East right now and I'd probably have to tell a lot of Palestinians on one side I didn't come here to die for you.  And I can get on the Israeli side and I, saying I ain't gonna die for you.  Now I'd like to try to bring this thing to a help, bring this thing to a halt.  But neither one of your sides is worth me giving up my life for, you know.  And I have a problem with that with a lot of leaders that want to go to the Middle East.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I said all they got to do is run up on one of them with a bomb around them and hug him.  And they don't mind dying, just blow themselves to pieces in order to get that leader, you know.  So anyway, that was the 1966s.
Story_ID: 70652
Speaker 1: Sixty--by 1968, we stared all getting prepared to go to the First National Black Power Conference in Newark, New Jersey and all of us booked and made our reservations to fly out of here.  And one of the reasons why we were glad to fly out of here because people like Dick Gregory [HM] and Lawrence Landry and all of them had met with all of us and said that Daley [Mayor Richard J. Daley] was going to declare war on us in the City of Chicago if we mess with his Democratic Convention, and that the convention was held in Chicago that year.  So then we said the best thing to keep ourselves from being involved in a great big reaction from Mayor Daley on us was to leave.  So we all went to Newark, New Jersey and the ironies of history is that the white kids tore up his convention.  The white kids got out there and threw bags of urine and bags of mess--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and white kids who fought them down to the wire up there on Michigan Avenue and white kids who was tearing up his city and white kids that called Mayor Daley to say "shoot to kill", you know.  And we were in Newark, New Jersey.  When we came back all of that was over but the shouting.  All of them that they hadn't arrested and, and put in jails and half destroyed.  But they had wrought a lot of destruction too because their Sheriff Richard Elrod was crippled and stuff for life and stuff like that.  It was not the black rebels that tore up his convention.
Story_ID: 70653
Speaker 1: So 1998--1968, you know--but earlier that year they had made sure that Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] wasn't part of that and in April 4th, they had made sure that he got assassinated down in Memphis [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Now there are some interesting circumstances around that day.  Can you tell us what you were doing on that day?
Speaker 1: Oh, I had gone to see my son who was sick in the hospital.  He had gotten hit by a truck and I was leaving the hospital and the nurse was crying.  And I said, what is the matter?  She said they shot Dr. King.  So I said, oh, woman tried to stab him a while ago.  So I didn't think anything else of it.  I said he will survive it.  And I was supposed to be taking Gale Sayers [Gale Eugene Sayers, HM] and Ernie Banks [Ernest "Ernie" Banks, HM] to radio station WVON at that time at 33rd and Kedzie because I was putting on a fundraiser and doing all the fundraising work for the DuSable Museum to raise funds.  And Gale Sayers and Ernie Banks had graciously agreed to be our fundraising hosts and the ticket--caused us to sell big tickets.  And I got to [W]VON and they said no, they can't--we're not going to have a show tonight.  They said Dr. King is dead and I almost fainted.  I really thought that whoever shot him, it was not a death blow.  And then I found out.  Let me say what else is very interesting about that day and that night.  I turned around out of WVON and started heading home and I lived in Chatham and I had to come down the Dan Ryan [Expressway] and I had to drop one person off around 51st Street.  And as I got to 51st Street off the Dan Ryan I saw nobody in the streets, nobody.  And as I rolled along 51st and I finally dropped her off near the corner of King Drive and I said to her, I said do you know there's nobody out here?  It was ominous.  And so then I got back on the Dan Ryan and I rolled on down the Dan Ryan to 79th Street where I lived and I didn't see another car.  And I came up the ramp at 79th Street and went to my home and parked and all along 79th Street where businesses were, silence, nobody.
Story_ID: 70654
Speaker 1: When I got in my house I received a telephone call from Andrew Young [Andrew Jackson Young, HM].  And Andrew Young was one of King's chief lieutenants and you-all all know that Andrew Young eventually became a big politician in the country.  And what was that, U.S. Senate or governor, what was it?  What did Andrew Young--?
Speaker 2: Became the Mayor of Atlanta (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Mayor, but then he became a--
Speaker 2: --the Carter administration he worked his--
Speaker 1: United Nations.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was U.N. [United Nations] Ambassador.
Speaker 1: Yeah, United Nations.  Andrew Young called all of us here and Andrew said that night you better stock up some food and call all your neighbors and we said, why?  He said cause they're going to burn this country.  I said you're kidding.  He said they're going to burn this country.  He said blacks are going to burn this country.  So I ran out and got a lot of milk and I believed him.  And I got up the next morning and the first thing I saw on the news was cities on fire.  So I went to a meeting of a group that we haven't even discussed that we had formed in the City of Chicago and that was a group called the Community Action Training Program and our purpose for organizing was that we would bring together the two strongest components of the black community and try to come up with a strategy that we could stop violence in the black community, we could enhance education in the black community, we could enhance other privileges and jobs and upgrading in the black community and stop a lot of racist acts that were committed against us here.
Story_ID: 70655
Speaker 1: So the Community Action Training Program was set up and I was one of the curriculum leaders of the Community Action Training Program.  And let me explain real quick what that meant.  I helped get together the people who would teach the classes.  If we were going to teach what housing was all about nationally we had to get experts.  And we would call in from New York people like Jesse Gray who was an expert in housing.  We called in people from the housing and development programs in [Washington] D.C.  We called in a great big housing expert in here from Detroit [Michigan] and one from Los Angeles [California] and they taught all of the ministers and community organization leaders everything there was to know about housing?  How do you get loans, what are liens, what is this, everything about housing.  What is redlining?  What are you doing with this?  And then we would bring them as teachers and maybe for about a week or two the curriculum would be housing.  Then we had people who came in and taught politics, you know.  And our ministers came from the twenty largest churches in the black communities.  And our ministers, most of them were just very learned men with the bible and stuff like that, but we started teaching basics like housing in the black community and politics and how is a national campaign run and what makes this and what makes that, they were just overwhelmed.
Story_ID: 70656
Speaker 1: One time we did vice and we went out and I as one of the curriculum leaders, we went and got prostitutes who would talk to the ministers and why I'm a prostitute and how do I make my money and where do I go and what are all the processes that I go through to be a good prostitute out in the street?  What do I do when I get in trouble with the law?  And then we had the pimps, the men who put them out there and we had the pimps and most of the time we'd have to put them behind screens cause a lot of them didn't want their faces known or shown and we guaranteed them anonymity.  And some of the ministers were just overwhelmed to know how a pimp puts together his stable and how simple it is.  It's not any big, you know deal.  There was no big, major thing.  He didn't have to be a rocket scientist to get him a stable ready and throw 'em out there on the streets, you know and how much money--and we used to laugh and tease our ministers and say you want to give up the pulpit, you know, how much money some of them would make out there with putting about five or six women on the street.  And one pimp we talked to, he had about thirty-five or forty.  Five of them were big, major call girls going in them big hotels downtown.  And then we started following some of our classes into some of these places.  We went into great big restaurants Downtown and we would watch he pimps operating the girls.  We would sit in the restaurant and watch a white customer come in and sit down and talking to the bar tender and blah, blah, we and all of a sudden this real pretty girl in this real pretty little outfit would get up and leave out of another door and leave and about five minutes later the white client would get up and leave and they had places to go to have sex and stuff like that and we used to just sit and eat dinner and watch them.  And some of the people who were telling us all this, he said that's my girl over there in that beige outfit.  That's my girl over there in that red suit.  That's--and they would look like girls walking--working in big offices Downtown, you know.  They're not what Hollywood would show or the strip and stuff.  These girls, he had them dressed nice and right. You couldn't step in a restaurant and she's sitting there at the bar having her drinks and say that's a prostitute sitting there.  You'd say it's a girl having a drink after work with a co-worker.  And he was just showing you how he put together his whole network, how some of them girls, the big doctors, lawyers, big politicians would give him a thousand dollars for the night and he'd give that girl $250.00, you know.
Story_ID: 70657
Speaker 1: And so we just showed in the Community Action Training Program all these facets of life that goes on in the large urban communities.  And once you better understand what's going on--how does a cocaine cat get his supply and where and who is his supplier?  And we also told them sometimes their suppliers are cops.  And you just went through it step by step where we get folks out of jails and stuff and they sit up and they sit up and they say well they can't try me in double jeopardy, the cops sold it to us. And they--some of them told us how when the policeman confiscates guns and a lot of the guns are supposed to go to the meltdown, the guns don't get to the meltdown.  The cops sell them and how that money keeps circulating.  Then they arrest a cat two or three weeks later and take that gun off of him again and then they sell it again.  And he can't say he took my gun.  So those were our classes and we taught practically every aspect of city life.
Story_ID: 70658
Speaker 1: And that morning, the reason why I jumped to that part of the story that's important, because that morning after King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated and I told you the streets were so quiet that night.  Then I said well let me get on down here to Community Action Training Program to see what all of us leaders are going to do about this assassination.  So when I got down there to the training program, all of them were there.  Reverend Archie Hargraves, James Bevel [HM], Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson [HM], everybody was there.  So everybody was saying that Andy Young [Hon. Andrew Young, HM] had called and we'd better do this and we'd better do that and what are we going to do about this?  And while we were meeting somebody came into the church.  We met at First Presbyterian Church at Ashland Avenue and Warren Boulevard every morning from 9 o'clock in the morning till 1 o'clock in the afternoon.  Somebody walked in and said Marshall High School kids are on the march.  And then we said oh, it has begun.  It's like they went to sleep over the night and woke up the next morning, the city exploded.  You see what I'm saying?  The city looked like it went to sleep you know, nurturing its hurt and its horror.  And I looked across the room to Reverend Clay Evans [HM} and said it has begun.  He said what are you talking about?  I told him how quiet it was in these streets last night, the quiet before the storm.  And they said the Marshall High School children are on the march.  We went out the door and saw the Marshall High School kids heading toward Madison and the big business streets of the West Side.  And by the time we got halfway down the steps, we saw the fires.  Just started--the Molotov cocktails and they were just throwing them.  And one of the ministers said to me, you were right Sister Jorja, it has begun.
Story_ID: 70659
Speaker 1: I said Andy Young [Hon. Andrew Young, HM] said they're going to burn these cities down.  So by the time I got to Madison they were tearing open the streets, the store windows were being ripped open and they were throwing fire up into the store fronts and black people were coming in the store fronts not adding to the fire but getting the stuff out of the stores and taking it with them.  And some of them were running down the streets with tables on top of their heads and chairs out of windows.  Some were reaching up in shoe stores getting boxes of shoes and then I went down the street toward a big store, no longer here in Chicago anymore called Robert Hall.  And I was looking at Robert Hall, one minute you saw it sitting there, the next minute it was gone, collapsed, demolished.  And that's when I turned and said, these are not Marshall High students that's doing this part.  You know what that was, trained demolition.  Men who had been trained in the armies and the wars of this nation that knew demolition.  Our kids could put some gasoline in a coke bottle, but I'm talking about when you see a great big department store just cave in and I said, uh-uh, the experts are out here now.  They had joined the children.  And when--farther down Madison Street there was a great big Jewish restaurant.  By the time we got near the corner, every cake pan, cooking pan, table (unclear), everything was out in the streets on Madison.  They had destroyed it.  Just bombed it and I said this--it's some experts out here now done joined the children.  So then I headed home and we had a hard way circuitously coming through the fires.  When I got home somebody called me and said our headquarters for CCCO [Chicago Community Council Organization] was at 366 East 47th Street on the second floor.  And one of the men--in fact it wasn't one of the men, it was Darryl Grisham who was the owner of Parker House Sausage Company, who said we better get all of that equipment out of CCCO up there on that second floor cause they're going to burn 47th Street now.  So they started sending the trucks and we started carrying some people up there and we said that we had better clear that place out.  They cleared out all of the copy machines, typewriters and stuff and brought them to my basement.  And before we could leave 47th Street, 47th Street was on fire from Cottage Grove to State Street, just flaming.
Story_ID: 70425
Speaker 1: Okay, you ready?
Speaker 2: So we're talking about the riots in '68 [1968].  And so what happened after the riots?  What do you--?
Speaker 1: Well we tried to help calm the black community down and started to trying to build from that.  So we still kept the Community Action Training Program alive and leaders of it like Reverend J. Archie Hargrave tried to get a big grant to open up a Center for Black Strategy.  So they got the grant and--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --they opened up a Center for Black Strategy at 1020 S. Wabash Avenue.
Speaker 2: But where did the money come from (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Money came from I think the Ford Foundation and other big white institutions.  Now I wasn't part of the Center for Black Strategy.  I was not asked to be a part of the center for Black Strategy and I did not care about being a center--part of the center for Black Strategy.  And the reason why I did not care about it because I didn't like all the premises on which it was supposed to exist.  And you have to have first of all integrity.  And if you're only interested in getting the jobs for a few of your black friends that you can call and saying, oh this is Dr.  So-and-So.  He's got a Master's degree in urban so-and-so, so-and-so, so-and-so and we are going to do this and do that.  I said, but do what?  I mean what substantial programs will you manifest from out of getting this big grant inside of a great big office and a lot of new office furniture and typewriters and the Assistant Director of the Assistant Director got to have a secretary and the Assistant Director's director got to have a secretary.  And it just became to me a hierarchical, money rip off to me while you can sit down maybe every six months, turn out a little piece of paper.  And I was really interested in a center for black strategy.  How can we, as African Americans, come together at some point in our lives and start developing a strategy and not just a strategy for whose going to get what big jobs, but how we will extend ourselves as a culture into the future?  And I told them that I was looking at the twenty-first century.
Story_ID: 70426
Speaker 1: Now along that time the--you mentioned earlier [Black] Communiversity was formed--
Speaker 2: Yes, we met with our children every Saturday at the Center for Intercity Studies at 700 E. Oakwood Boulevard.  And we were doing very well with Dr. Bobby Wright and Dr. Harold Pates [HM] and Anderson Thompson and all of us.  We worked very hard to put the black community together, a school on Saturdays for children.  So that thrived but you know one of the parts that has disturbed me most of all it seems that most of what we had begun and what thrived seemed to have done okay and still till we started going after the black mayor seat.  And it seems that a lot of our focus got off a little bit or when we got through achieving our goal that we were not able to re-trench and re-establish ourselves, and to me that's the tragedy of it all.
Story_ID: 70427
Speaker 1: Now you were involved in the National Black Political Assembly in 1972, right in Gary [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In Gary?  And I know on a--in former--late, former Senator Richard Newhouse's office.
Speaker 2: Richard Newhouse.
Speaker 1: There was a big poster of people gathered in Gary and I always believed that one of them were you--was you?
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought it was.
Speaker 2: I went over there every morning to Gary.
Speaker 1: It was a whole crowd (unclear).
Speaker 2: I was standing across a poster that was going all the way cross the room tallying votes for Richard Hatcher's great victory that night in Gary.  But we had also been going over there for a black political organizing.  That's what you're talking about, the 1972 convention in Gary?  And that was historic and I really thought at that particular time that we could come up with a strategy and once again we could not because we got bogged down with egos.  And maybe we can't do any better than that.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the National Black Political Assembly?  Who was there and what kind of things were discussed?
Speaker 2: You mean in Gary?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Listen, you got me back in history so far.  One of the problems is anybody that you guys dealing with black history would, could probably come up with more names than me.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I didn't mean to put you on the spot but I know, I know (unclear).
Speaker 2: But I'm just saying they came from everywhere.
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear) people from all--
Speaker 2: And I'm saying when I was meeting, I would be one little cog in the wheel invited to sit in a room that was meeting with so many giants till I probably wasn't of anymore consequence than, sister can you hand me a cup of water back there, or is there anymore coffee left?  And I'm not diminishing that, but I'm saying often times these kinds of things boiled down to, in the end the people who are going to really get out there and do the hard core work.
Speaker 1: Of which you were one, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.  Not the people that comes in and they said I want you to make sure that you meet--like I met Percy Sutton and I met Jesus Christ, it was so many of them, you know.  I stayed mostly confined to going in and out of meeting rooms with great big political people--
Speaker 1: Ron Dellums [Hon. Ronald Dellums, HM].
Speaker 2: Right, right Ron Dellums, right.  And Dellums was one who impressed me more than anybody with what he had to do there and say that so I can of ran behind him more.  But as far as some of them that I met and listed to, I would set up a time and say, why am I here?  Why are you here?  Why you wasting your time with this?  This is not going anywhere, you know.  And these people here are jockeying you know for top place and top dog.  And a lot of them were jealous of Ron Dellums and lot of them hated Andrew Young [HM] and a lot of them said this boy from Detroit [Michigan] was a, was a nothing.  I don't remember--
Speaker 1: Coleman?
Speaker 2: Coleman.  And it just got to be a jungle.  Till about Saturday evening or Sunday morning I was headed back towards Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 70428
Speaker 1: Now tell me about when you met Lu Palmer [Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, HM].  Now this has got to be--
Speaker 2: It's got to be something.
Speaker 1: --at about this time right, in the end of (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  Lu Palmer was covering all of these events.
Speaker 1: And I was one of the one's that said to Lu Palmer you can stay here and cover it.  That's your job.  I'm going.  Bye, you know.  And--but before that Lu Palmer and I had--he would call me up to ask me questions about the Coordinating Council.  What is the name of the minister in Englewood or TWO [The Woodlawn Organization] and I would tell him Lynward Stevenson.  And then one night--this was going on all of the time and we had a big educational conference at DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois] one Saturday and he would sit in front of me covering it for the Chicago American.  And I said--he'd turn back to ask me a lot of names.  So--and I would answer him.  When I got ready to leave that educational conference, he said I'll drive you home and that's all it was to it. Then one night he [Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, HM] called me up and said, what is the new address of Fred Hampton's office?  And I told him it's 28, I think 37 W. Monroe.  He said why?  He said there's been a shooting there.  I said a shooting?  I said when did Fred Hampton come back to Chicago, cause he'd left town.  We told Fred to split and don't come back.  He said well there's been a shooting over there so he said I'm going over there.  He said and we've called a United States Attorney to come there and I said what's--who is it?  So he said his name is Thomas N. Todd [HM].  So I said okay.  So about an hour later he called me back and said Jorja, Fred's brains have been blown out and Mark Hampton [sic, Mark Clark] was killed up in the living room.  I said what?  And that started our pursuit in getting closer together as two human beings, was the killing of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark.
Story_ID: 70429
Speaker 1: So all of us organizations and people started meeting and protesting over Edward V. Hanrahan, who had sent a special troop in there to get Fred Hampton that night.  And--
Speaker 2: Hanrahan was the States Attorney?
Speaker 1: Right.  And so when we met about it all of us groups said we're not going to let the Mayor [Richard J. Daley] nor Hanrahan get away with this. That we're going to make sure that Hanrahan's going to suffer for the death of these kids so brutally.  A knock on the door and they were dead, you know.  And so all of us started putting together strategies and so they came down to--which every good historian should trace down the facts of this, is the curfew.  We called for a black curfew in the black community.  And the reason why we called it down, it was a African American leader and I sure know he's part of your archives named Dr. Bobby Wright who said to us at one of the meetings, you know we never questioned the mobility of white people in our communities.  White people can come and go among us you know with impunity.  If we go in their communities they watching you, every move you make.  And he said once maybe in our lives we need to question the mobility of white people in our communities.  If we'd ever question it nobody could have sat in that block and thought that some Illinois Bell telephone people were out there in the streets fixing telephones at that time of the night.  And then they knocked into them windows and walked in there, stepped right over that boy and shot him, you know.  He said we don't question it.  So he said how do we question it?  So the conversation kept going and going till all of a sudden somebody came up with the idea, just like a woman question all of us on the radio, Lu Palmer [Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, HM]--I mean Jesse Jackson [HM], I'm sorry Jessie Jackson on a radio talk show one Sunday morning and said since they've arrested Lu Palmer and Dorothy Tillman [HM] them, why can't we just protest and boycott the Chicago Fest?  And that's a citizen that sits out there with that idea and everybody said fine and everybody agreed to it.  So we put on--we boycotted the Chicago Fest.  So one member in this group said why don't we just call a curfew in the City of Chicago and said every night at 6:00 o'clock all white people have to be gone from black, you know predominately black areas.  They can't come back in again till after 6 o'clock in the morning.
Story_ID: 70430
Speaker 1: Now you all had a press conference about that?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so we got Reverend C.T. Vivian [HM] who was a minister in SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Council].  Now SCLC is the Southern Leadership--
Speaker 1: Christian Leadership Council.
Speaker 2: Right, and--
Speaker 1: C.T. Vivian, now he's the one that--and I don't mean to talk over you.
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: He's the one that stood on the steps in, I think it was in Birmingham and there's a film he says, eye's on the prize (unclear).
Speaker 2: Eyes on the Prize.
Speaker 1: He stands there and he tells--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the Sheriff Jim Clark, you can turn your back on injustice but you can't turn your back on--you can turn--
Speaker 2: Turn your back on justice, on (unclear).
Speaker 1: --back on us, but you can't turn your back on justice.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Jim Clark turned around and hit him right in the mouth with a billy club.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right, C.T. Vivian.
Speaker 1: He was a non-violent model.  A non-violent--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, that's right, model.
Speaker 1: --direct action protester, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --who sacrificed his body for the cause.
Speaker 2: For our cause.
Speaker 1: And now he stands up and says (laughing)--
Speaker 2: We let C.T. Vivian who was out of Chicago when the curfew statement was written and when he got off the plane we brought him to the meeting and said hey C.T., we all voted for you to be our spokesman.  So C.T., said well great.  They killed his boys.  It was a dastardly act and he said certainly.  So C.T. Vivian started reading the statement that was written and he said the more I read it the more I like it cause it didn't have the curfew--number one, that blacks do such-and-such a thing.  Number two, that this deadly crime of these two young boys asleep in their beds, and number three, so-and-so, so-and-so.  Then therefore, it got down to we were closing the boundaries of the black community at night.  And C.T. started getting softer and softer (laughing) in his voice.  And after it was all over C.T. cursed all of us out.  He said all of you all put me in a trick bag.  He was so articulate and everything and we had put--placed C.T. Vivian in--under, in the hot seat.  And man, the reporters started running from those rooms.  I never saw reporters run like that for anybody, you know, when they said that we're closing the black community down.  Next morning headlines, "Black Curfew", lord, so-and-so-and-so, you know.  The next day had a great big article sitting there, who wrote the curfew order?  And they became more intent on who wrote the curfew order cause it was well written and then therefore and he started off and there's the curfew order.  And everybody said all of y'all sit in the meeting together and we just stuck to it, we all wrote it, you know.
Story_ID: 70431
Speaker 1: Who actually wrote it?
Speaker 2: I did.  You know Lu Palmer [Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, HM] and I wrote the curfew order.  And he'll tell it now at this point history.  He ain't got nothing to lose.  He retired, you know and I ain't got no job for them to fire me off of and it's too late.  Richard Daley, Sr. is dead.  Who wrote the curfew order?  But the newspaper people all over the country said this was a hell of an order that was written.  They could tell by the polish and finesse of that order, you know.  And didn't nobody set up just an idle meeting.  See we did all the rest of this stuff and we were at Earl Doty's house up 1135 E 51st Street, Hyde Park Boulevard.  And all of a sudden we said, well we'll finish it.  And they said Jorja, Bobby Wright--well all of them were in it.  They say ya'll gone on and finish it and we'll go get C.T. [Vivian, HM], (laughing), you know.
Story_ID: 70432
Speaker 1: So that was a coup, but my relationship with Lu [Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, HM] just started escalating and-
Speaker 2: Did curfew work?  Just to back track, I mean what, was it a--well, I know it didn't (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well you know one of the reasons why it didn't work, it was going to work that next day or two.  But then you had the black leadership that were under Daley's [Mayor Richard J. Daley] thumb who came back out and said that we were silly and isn't this ignorant of them.  And everybody wanted to kill them really you know because I don't care how much of a Tom you were with the powers that be, all you had to do was be quiet and still be part of the white power echelon.  Just be quiet and just see where it would go, you know.  Just stay out of it.  Nobody questioned his mobility, you know.  And a couple of them was like, Bill Berry of the Chicago Urban League and all of them came out on front pages and called all of this dumb and stupid and how you going to question it?  So when they asked us the leadership of our group, we said this is exactly what we are talking about.  We don't need Illinois Bell Telephone white workers in here.  You hire 'em black.  If a great big white laundry company has a company sitting up here at 39th and Princeton, then he'd better hire white people to work in his laundry--I mean black people to work in his laundry.  If you got a big restaurant sitting up here at 43rd and Drexel, he'd better have a black manager, black waitresses you know.  They cannot--longer come in here and front us off and take our money and lock up for the night and go to there to suburban communities and stuff like that.  If we're going to have any financial empowerment and everything else then we are going to run the show in the African American community.  We're going to know who's coming in here and who's coming out of it, and that's fair.
Story_ID: 70433
Speaker 1: And I gave the news media one very glaring incident.  I said one night two of my girlfriends and I played in a bridge club together.  And we were out on a 111th Street out in Beverly long before blacks.  So when I was telling them that story they had no--they knew at that moment blacks didn't even live in Beverly yet anyway.  I said we got out there and I--one of my girlfriends Myrtle had a tooth ache so badly till we said when we got up to about 103rd Street, Myrtle said I can't make it home.  Ya'll gotta stop.  Ya'll gotta stop.  So we stopped and rolled into a drug store in a little shopping center like.  We rolled into the drug store.  All of a sudden the cops were sitting over there and another set of cops was sitting and said what you girls looking for tonight?  And we said well she got such a bad tooth ache we just wanted to come in here and get some Anbesol or something like that.  So he let Millie get out and go in there and get it and when she walked out to the car Myrtle took the bag and opened it like that and took her thing and put it on her tooth.  He said you girls better get on home now.  And we just turned right on around up there on 103rd and wherever it was and turned on out of there.  And we said you know they wouldn't even--they didn't even want us to stop to get some drugs, you know to--for her tooth.  They'd follow you.  And he followed us all the way back to Halsted.  He just kept right behind just a slow, police just followed all the way back to Halsted.  We got to Halsted, we saw him do one of these (points finger) and go on back.
Story_ID: 70434
Speaker 1: I get--and we've had many a friends who would say they'd get caught over there at night and them cops would follow them.  They don't look at it and do it so ostentatiously anymore like they would do once before but they quietly know who is pulling into these places and they quietly follow you.  And I was telling that to the news media that night and I--they said they wouldn't want ya'll to get tooth drops?  I said they followed us.  And that's what Bobby Wright opened up.  He said see they don't want you in their neighborhoods.  He said but everything comes in ours.  He said white pimps walk our streets.  Everything comes through here, you know, white business men.  I just look at our neighborhoods right now.  The Arabs have just about taken over some of our streets.  And I tell blacks out here I say ya'll let them come in here.  Ya'll go in there and buy from them, you know.  And I said and that motherfucker want to spray something on your meat.  You ain't got no defense.  All he got to do, spray your meat with something tasteless and odorless but deadly.  I said all he got to do is do your ass in.  I said but right now maybe because the Arabs ain't after you (laughing), he's after these white suckers and them Jews, you know.  But you don't know who he'd be after.  You don't know who he'd be after.  I say ya'll--and I don't mean it just anti-Arab.  I meant that you have let every--we have let every group come through the black community on its way to wealth.  When I was a very young girl the Jewish people had all the stores in our community.  Forty-Seventh's Street was just loaded with them.  The clothing stores, the meat markets, the--everything.  And if you wanted credit you had to go get credit through them.  My aunt had credit at two of their little stores and (unclear) books and they'd write up how much you owe them.  And Mrs. Mack, how much more you going to pay on your bill this week and stuff like that.  I said then when the Jews started leaving, other ethnic groups came in behind and started making money off of us.  The Czechs and the Armenians and places like that.  I said even some the Orientals stared.  And the Orientals started finding out the we spend a lot of money on hair and stuff and things like that so they started opening up little stores.  I said I got to the point that you couldn't walk in one of these wig shops for them, you know.  I said everybody comes through us on their way to wealth and at this particular moment in time it's the Middle Easterners and the Arabs.  I said, and they just open up stores.  And if you think I'm lying right now for historical purposes just come out here where I am now and go down Ashland Avenue and then go down the other business streets and you'll see Rahzahn [ph.] Food Market, Ishzach [ph.] Supreme Market, Rozach [ph.] Hair and Nails, you know. It's one after the other.
Story_ID: 70435
Speaker 1: I said and they walk in there--Reverend Willie Taplin Barrow [HM] of Operation Push and Reverend Sampson fought them up on 47th Street and they got discouraged because people in the African American community walked right on by and protested in buying from them.  And I said their way to way wealth is coming here.  The prices on our commodities are higher so when they'd lock up their doors and go toward their communities, they go and become millionaires, you know.  And we're still staying in the same unstable lot in our lives as we were before they came in and made their millions and walked out of here at night.  And what I used to try to lecture the kids all over this country was form your own consortiums.  Put together ten of you put together your own consortium.  Put ten thousand dollars in it a piece a year.  Ten years' time you got a hundred thousand dollars.  That doesn't seem like much money but it's enough money to borrow money with.  You can borrow money with a hundred thousand dollars cash.  I said or make that money go to work for you.  I said, and I guarantee you if you invest a hundred thousand dollars into Wal-Mart that you're going to make some money off of it.  And then that's a strategic point with the hundred thousand dollars that you invested, sell it.  And if you sell it and its prime rate on it at that moment, it's eleven percent.  Then you got a hundred ten thousand, I mean a hundred and ten--no.  You got eleven million--ten-a hundred thousand dollars off of it.
Speaker 2: Okay, we have to change tapes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: You're a millionaire.  You're millionaires.  At a strategic point, sell it.
Story_ID: 70660
Speaker 1: Ms. Palmer, can--now, we're now in the early '80s [1980s] and I wanted you to talk about--you and Lu Palmer [Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, HM] are married in the '70s [1970s] or is it, is--?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Seventy-six [1976], seventy-seven ['77].
Speaker 1: Do you want to talk about that briefly?
Speaker 2: Well I just said it was the culmination of a hell of a courtship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'd like to state that it's a courtship that stills exists.  Lu and I are both much older, we've gone through an awful lot of health problems and a lot of health scares.  For example, one night, one afternoon, Lu was driving me over here to this agency where we're sitting now and all of a sudden he just blanked out at the wheel.  And when we got him to the hospital the doctor said, I don't even know how he's alive.  They said every valve is blocked and that he was a walking dead man.  And he went through that, quadruple bypass surgery.  He's had a stroke, he's got--had a lot of cataract surgery.  He's losing his hearing and we're just both growing old with a lot of problems that come with aging.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Till now at this point in life I understand and I agreed when they set up a whole department in the country called the Department of Aging.  It has a lot of problems attached to it.
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Story_ID: 70661
Speaker 1: In 1981, we were in the Jane Byrne administration--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and Lu Palmer was the, probably the most popular voice of the black community on the radio.  The syndicated show reached millions of black people.
Speaker 2: Millions, all over the state.
Speaker 1: All over the state, right.  And he was engaged in the black community really, was engaged with--in the struggle with Jane Byrne over the school board appointees and over Chicago Fest and a number of issues when he started saying in 1982, We shall see in '83 [1983].  And that's when you all launched the plebiscite that resulted in the election of Harold Washington. Could you go on and talk about--?
Speaker 2: Actually it was my women's auxiliary. I founded the Women's Auxiliary of the Lu Palmer Foundation and our women gave monthly meetings on major issues in the community.  One of our issues at one time was people who are hard of hearing and the Illinois Bell Telephone Company needed to provide better services and for them and they came up and showed ups the type of little gadgets that they were putting on phones, that people who could not hear could at least know that they had a phone call coming.  We used to put on all kinds of forums on Saturdays once a month.  And one Saturday I informed them that my husband had said that after the 1980 census that if we were thirty-nine percent of the population of the City of Chicago, and if two white candidates run for mayor, that we could elect a black mayor.  And the women thought it was great and everybody else said we were crazy, that black people were not yet ready.  And we said that it was no such greater moment than an idea whose time has come.  And we figured that in Chicago politics, our time had come.  And that if we politicize properly and got black people with all the problems we've had, boycotting the Fest against Jane Byrne, fighting against housing, fighting against racism in the schools, racism in top echelons of government and everywhere that if we could get the people organized and mobilized properly that we could elect a black mayor but we first had to politicize the black community.  So the women's auxiliary said why don't we take a survey?  So we went in the process of creating a survey and we went on all of "Lu's Notebook" programs and on shows like Vernon Jarrett [HM] shows and other shows and talk shows and said that the women's auxiliary was getting ready to launch a survey and we put the survey in the streets.  And in the surveys we gave people 90 names of prominent African Americans and we asked them to choose based on the criteria we set up.  And so we put the criteria before them, if they were very popular, if they made great contributions toward their people, if they were persuasive and many other attributes that would go for being a leader of people in the whole City of Chicago.  And we asked them to--for you to choose.  It's your choice.
Speaker 1: Ms. Palmer--
Speaker 2: And our principle was based on, if you make the choice then you'll back it to get that person elected.
Story_ID: 70662
Speaker 1: Ms. Palmer, can you name some of the people that are in the plebiscite?
Speaker 2: Well this is a list of ninety that got reduced to twenty.  So I'm listing them in alphabetical order now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, just some.  You don't have to do all--
Speaker 2: Carol Mosley Braun [HM], Reverend Milton Bronson, Roland Burris [HM], Manford Byrd [HM], Dr. Margaret Burroughs [HM] of the DuSable Museum, Lenora Cartwright who at that time was head of Human Services of the City of Chicago and was very popular at that time, Reverend Johnnie Colemon [HM] who was very popular, Alderman Danny Davis [HM], Alderman Mary Ann Humes, Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson [HM], Publisher John H. Johnson [HM], Alderman Clifford Kelly, Attorney Anna Langford [HM], she had been an Alderman too, Lu Palmer [HM], Cecil Partee, Sammie Rayner, Renault Robinson [HM], Congressman Gus Savage [HM], Attorney Thomas N. Todd [HM] and Congressman Harold Washington.
Story_ID: 70663
Speaker 1: This was the list that got reduced from ninety to twenty, cause we felt ninety was too unwieldy to hold a plebiscite to come up with--we got it to twenty. When we got to Bethel A.M.E. Church on the actual day of the plebiscite we reduced it to ten.  So the people then, after sending out more surveys, making more phone calls and interviews, 5,000 more letters went out for random sampling responses and we reduced it to ten.  So when they got to Bethel A.M.E. Church, it was just packed.  I never saw that many people come to any meeting anywhere, any time and it was such a cross sectioning, doctors, lawyers, we had a whole motorcycle group that joined together and rode up to Bethel A.M.E. Church on their motorcycles and sat outside.  They couldn't get inside.  And about two or three thousand people stood in the streets.  We had to put the speaker system outside.  And so the people voted and the people got the ten names on a piece of paper and said would you select the black mayor?  It's up to you.  A black mayor, it's up to you.  So the people voted and we sent out teams of people off into the minister's dayroom there, the community hall to count the votes.  And when the votes came back and people just sat, talking and we had people singing and everything while the votes were being counted.
Story_ID: 70664
Speaker 1: And it was very dramatic moment.  When they came back, number one vote was Congressman Harold Washington.  And number two vote was Manford Byrd [HM].  And I'm skipping over the real number two cause the number two vote was really Lu Palmer [Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, HM].  And the minute Lu Palmer saw that he was one of--and especially at that high a level, Lu Palmer immediately went to the microphones and took his name out of the running and said that he would not be--want--he did not want to be considered under any circumstances as a mayoral candidate.  He would appreciate the people who had voted him based on the criteria but he did not wish to be the Mayor of the City of Chicago under any circumstances.  So Harold Washington won that hands down then cause even number three was not even close enough cause Lu Palmer was so close to Harold till it put number three in a bad second place and number four in a worse third place and it went on down like that to the very end of the names.  And I didn't really want to sit up here and rank the names right now anymore because a lot of people were very upset.  And it got to be kind of amusing, were some people who thought that they would be number one, two, three, four or five, you know didn't come in at all, you know.  And people who least thought that they would be that high on a totem pole, like people were just surprised when Margaret Burroughs [HM] was number six, you know because all the men out there were about to pass out.  They didn't know any female would get that high a count or vote out of the blacks of the black community.  And it shows you kind of a, maybe a male chauvinistic problem as it were.
Story_ID: 70665
Speaker 1: But anyway, the plebiscite was held and Harold Washington was our winner and then we started putting together a massive campaign.  And so a couple of weeks later, Lu [Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, HM] launched the largest voter registration drive ever held in this country, even till this date.  And he registered over 200,000 people to vote and the newspapers and everything still gives Lu Palmer that credit.  Then Lu says we're going to have to organize and we started the political education classes.  And I was the dean of the political education classes and I put the political education classes and organized them and I've given you booklets here of our whole organization process which many students around the world could use this as a modality or a model for how to organize in the community.  And the reason why I'm only giving you them as booklets, if you want to put them on screens or whatever, it takes too long talking.  We'd be talking forever.  We could have a five hour marathon because we spelled out in these booklets Larry, exactly the steps and they don't fail ever if you follow them.  So we organized the campaign.  We organized the campaign and the political education classes first by teaching power politics.  And most of us understand politics but we don't understand the real thing of power politics and how it operates in our lives.  And we taught with power.
Story_ID: 70666
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: What is power politics and how do we go after power?  And power, we taught them, is the ability to have control over who gets what, where, why and how?  And what's the power bearing and what's--what is a political election all about and how do you organized around the political process?  How do you elect aldermen?  How do you elect state officials?  How do you elect federal officials?  How does a federal campaign operate?  What do you have to do to run for alderman?  How many names do you need on your petitions?  How do you pass your petitions?  If you want to be a state representative, what do you need to do, a state senator?  What do you need to do if you're going after a federal position?  And then how do you raise funds?  The campaign raising, how do you do your public relations? How do you prepare your literature?  How do you get to your people?  How do you do a canvassing in the black community?  How do you get your yes and your plus votes?  How do you find out who are your people for?  And how do you teach people to get that information out of the constituents, out of the voting constituency?  And once you compile that information then you'll have a ballpark figure.  And what do you need to do to either bring that vote in and bring that candidate in to victory or have that candidate drop out of the campaign because it's unfeasible at this time for this candidate to run this race.  And sometimes that has to be well and mathematically thought out, when is it time to withdraw from a race.
Story_ID: 70667
Speaker 1: For example, when Tom Eagleton wanted to run for president and they came up with all this goop about him and stuff like that, well his campaign people and his experts went out there to the masses.  And when they came back with the responses and stuff, they found out that they didn't find enough public support anymore for Eagleton to stay in the race, so he withdrew and those are very important ones.  When they out there with Bill Clinton, they got a surprise that whatever they did and their experts did all that strategy and all of that canvassing and putting out their surveys and stuff like that, that Bill Clinton had a possibility of becoming a top winner.  And step by step they knew how to organize nationally till all of a sudden Bill Clinton became a top winner and went into the convention and won as the candidate.
Story_ID: 70668
Speaker 1: So we taught all of that and how do you do that? The strategic thing about my students, Larry, was that once you sign up and become a student, you also had to sign a sheet of paper with the organization CBUC, which is Chicago Black United Communities that you will work in your respective ward.  If I had a hundred students that lived in the 8th Ward, when the classes were all over, I had peg boards up on the wall and I could assign them into the 8th ward to work.  If you lived in the 29th Ward, then I'd put you in the 29th Ward to work and then you would organize in your wards.  And step by step you'd come back to me and the big experts that I had working with me with those classes.  And I had some of the top experts in the country.  I had one--two men who were great big labor leaders and they were white, but they had worked in some of the top campaigns of the country and they knew how to help set up telephone calls, how do you call and poll the black community by phone.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: The telephone canvass.  And I had one man who worked in my campaign who had worked in two federal elections. One had just come back from working in a big presidential--all of a sudden, the mind blew.  He'd just come from working in that big campaign and he knew all the ins and outs of the federal election, what do you need to do?  How do you raise money for an election?  How do you transfer--
Speaker 2: Was that the Carter [James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] campaign he worked on?
Speaker 1: Yeah, one worked on the Carter campaign and who was the other one that ran that lost?
Speaker 2: Carter lost in '80 [1980] (unclear).
Speaker 1: I know he lost in '80 [1980], to Reagan, but--
Speaker 2: Was it Dukakis [Michael Stanley Dukakis]?
Speaker 1: Dukakis.  He had worked in the Duk--and whether Dukakis won or lost, many times some of them had told Dukakis to pull out.  And whether he won or lost, his ego wouldn't let him come out.  And there were other candidates standing in the wings that probably would have done better, but they couldn't get him out.  He had too much money and power in it.  Anyway, these men that taught my classes worked in all these kinds of campaigns and so they gave us the basics.  So when I put them out in the wards to work, it was amazing how these people assigned to the twenty black wards could go out there and start producing.
Story_ID: 70669
Speaker 1: Now this is a story that a lot of people don't know anything about.  When we talk about the Harold Washington campaign, people don't know there was this behind the scenes educational project going on.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And we put trained people--and one of my statements when I started the political education classes at Malcolm X College on August 15th, 1982, I said if you want to, to beat an organization you got to have an organization.  It takes an organization to beat an organization.  And we can't run around here forever and holler that's a political machine over there, that's this or they--you have to organize a machine against a machine.  So I went back to the hymn remember, Give me ten men who are stout hearted men who will fight for the rights they adore.  Boulder to boulder and shoulder and to shoulder and I'll give you ten thousand more.  And I told my students I need--get ten of you in a ward, ten men or women who are stout hearted who will fight.  And I had people that became those tens and they were serious.  And they went out there and they organized those wards, ward by ward, precinct by precinct.  And as they came in we would start sticking pins on the pluses and minuses.  So after a while we could point to the 27th Ward and said we got a whole enclave in there that's undecided.  We got a whole enclave over here in the 16th Ward that are undecided.  We are having a problem with the 19th.  And the 19th had just started turning to be a predominantly black ward, you remember that.  And--
Speaker 1: Right, with--
Speaker 2: --what--yes--
Speaker 1: --Alan Streeter?
Speaker 2: Right.  And how do we win in these wards?  And so our workers began to understand and then back behind the scenes, people like myself would put together the strategy, how do we get through those wards?  How do we get through the churches?  And we went through the churches and step by step we got to a point where in that campaign with our organized workers out here and then with our slogans.
Story_ID: 70670
Speaker 1: We had some of the slogans. What was on some of these posters?
Speaker 2: We shall see in '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you created some posters.  What was on one of our posters Larry?
Speaker 2: Oh, don't--
Speaker 1: The future--I got to.
Speaker 2: The future is in your hands.
Speaker 1: The future is in your hands, you know.  It's our time.  Punch 9, you know.  It's our time. Punch 9.  And those are slogans that came out, off of my desk and off of my thing.  Some of these posters, slogans came out of people like yourself and just drawing these great, big public relations pieces that attracted people.  And so the people started responding and so when they started responding, it got to a point that some of our friends and members who were school teachers even took leaves of absence and started printing buttons.  They went into the button printing business.  And I know members of our organization who would come up and give the organization money every Wednesday night at our meetings and say here Lu [Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, HM] is another thousand dollars.  I sold 5,000 Worcester buttons yesterday.  Here's money.  They started making buttons.  And then it became an art thing.  What kind of different buttons can you make?  After a while everybody wanted the teachers for quality education but a great, big yellow button.  After a while everybody wanted this button, everybody--so finally teachers even were walking around with jackets on with buttons going all up their arms and across their shoulders.  You saw a lot of them and then our, all of a sudden our students, all of a sudden our students jackets and even some of them that had on the leggings had them all down the stripes of the leggings.  It became an art form, all of those Harold Washington buttons, some of them with Harold grinning.  Some would say it's our future.  Some would say it's our time.  Some of them said you know--
Speaker 2: It's your city, and all of that.
Speaker 1: Right.  This is your city.  This is your city.  It's yours.  [It's good for you].  And people wanted all of those buttons.  They started paying one dollar, two dollars, three dollars, four dollars, five dollars.
Story_ID: 70671
Speaker 1: Then I personally helped organize a great big rally for Harold Washington at the Pavilion on February 7th, 1983.  And we went into the Pavilion, people like myself, Sid Ordower, Alderman Danny K. Davis [HM], and all of us and even Harold said to us, you're not going to pack the Pavilion.  We said yes we are.  And the same date, a girlfriend of mine who's husband was very prominent in the city at that time, Ernest Bush of Bush Construction Company, Mildred Bush then gave a fashion show for him out of the Candlelight and raised all that money out there the same day we had the rally at the Pavilion.  And when Harold walked in that Pavilion, I thought he was going to pass away, not out!  People were sitting on the floors.  We had violated every fire ordinance in the world with that many people.  It would seat 23,000 people and we had double to almost triple the amount of people.  And all of a sudden the crowd started shouting, we want Harold.  We want Harold.  And out in front the buttons were just flowing and the big placards and the posters.  And people were just picking up posters and putting them on their cars and in their windows and that was February.
Story_ID: 70672
Speaker 1: And by February it was escalating and all of a sudden, Lu Palmer [Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, HM] cut about twenty-four tapes to put on sound trucks.  Reverend Jesse Jackson [HM] got on flatbed trucks and started riding through the communities.  And as Jesse would ride through the corners and we had advanced people going ahead and saying Reverend Jackson will be at the corner of Madison and such and such a thing.  Reverend Jackson will be at Adams and this.  Then at WJPC which is the black radio station from out of Johnson Publishing Company, a boy up there cut tapes and had Lu Palmer's voice on it with an overlay of music like what is it, Curtis--this thing, We're a Winner.  What's his name?
Speaker 2: Curtis Mayfield [Curtis Lee Mayfield].
Speaker 1: Mayfield, We're a Winner.  And it said, this is Lu Palmer and so, and the people started running to their windows.  And then on the morning of the election Dr. Andrew Thomas who was very active in that movement, he's dead now.  And he paid this boy up at JPC [WJPC] to cut other tapes and brought them by our house and on those tapes in those morning, twenty-four sound trucks hit the streets and had, All things are ready.  Come to the feast.  And Precious Lord, take my hand and all that.  And then when the black people heard these old black Christian songs and said this is Lu Palmer.  If you hear my voice, you must come out and vote.  This is Lu Palmer come to the window.  If you hear my voice, you must come out and vote.  People didn't understand that Lu couldn't be on but one of the trucks.  They could just hear that voice and the people responded.  So by the time the polls closed the last thing I saw and I broke down and started crying, was a man so old that walked up to our place which was a voting booth and said to one of our worker's daughter, where can I go to vote for that boy.  Help me.  And Brenda Lett helped him in to vote for that boy.  And then we went home and went to bed.  It was raining and I told Lu that I am not going down there to that crowd cause if Harold doesn't win, they're going to through the City of Chicago into Lake Michigan.  If he does win, it's going to be the greatest stomping thing.  And honestly when I was saying that after the polls closed, all of a sudden cars were parking all up in my street at 37th till the outer drive and everyplace else near me became a gigantic parking lot.  You couldn't get to McCormick.

Speaker 1: So the people came and they rejoiced, but the greatest, contributing factor to the campaign and the victory of Harold Washington was Lu Palmer [Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, HM], and me.  But when Harold made major speeches, I used to write his speeches.  I used to run by and he'd have his chauffeur waiting to pick up his speeches.  That night on the victory night of April 12th, Vernon Jarrett will tell you that Harold kept--they said where is your speech?  We want an advanced copy of your speech.  This was the major media asking him.  And he finally looked over at Vernon Jarrett [HM] and said, shut up, I got Jorja's speech.  And Vernon Jarrett will tell you that happened.  And till that night, when I sat up in my bed and Lu said they're bringing him in now and all of a sudden Harold said, We have fought the great fight.  We have finished our course.  And I started crying.  That was my speech.  And I made Chicago in his speech like a great river and how that the tributaries run all the way out to Lake Michigan until there she stands beside her inland sea with outstretched hands to welcome you and me.  And that's the song of Chicago.  Chicago, and it goes on, Chicago is my home, my heart is in Chicago.
