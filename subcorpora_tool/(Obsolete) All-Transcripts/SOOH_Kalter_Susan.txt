 Neurohr. I   m a librarian at Oklahoma State  University. It   s June 30, 2013, and we   re in Chicago, Illinois. I   m here  to conduct an interview with Dr. Susan Kalter, who edited a book about  John Joseph Mathews and has done other research on him. This is for  an Oklahoma Oral History Research Project of the OSU Library. The  project title is Spotlighting Oklahoma. Thank you for coming here today.  You   re welcome.  I appreciate your participation in our interview. Let   s start the interview  by   if you   ll tell me a little bit about yourself.  Sure. I am a professor at Illinois State University. I have been there for  about thirteen years. I was born and raised in Ithaca, New York. My  father was a professor there, so I   m sort of a faculty brat, raised in the  shadow of Cornell University. I got my post-secondary education out in  California and was there for about a baker   s dozen years and then moved  to Illinois State. Even though it   s not what led me to John Joseph  Mathews, at one point in my after-college career I was a wilderness  skills instructor, so that   s one of the things that makes his writing  somewhat attractive to me. It reminds me of friends of mine and is  steeped in nature, always aware of that.  So at Illinois State what are your areas of teaching and research?  I was hired to teach American literature between 1870 and 1920. I was  hired for 2000-2001 as my first year, and they did not have (and I don   t  think they had ever had) a Native American literature course or program.  Since being there, I not only do the American literature canon, and way  beyond the canon, but about two or three years in, I created the first  Native American literature course  in the English department . Then  eventually, we built that into a program. We now have a minor in Native  5  Neurohr  Kalter  American studies. Right now, what I say is that I teach American  literature and Native American studies, partly because Native American  studies is so broad, you don   t want to confine it to just the literature part.  For a long time, as you may know, Native Americans did not have US  citizenship. I always try to make sure I define that as a distinction, that  I   m not just doing American literature and that that includes Native  Americans because at some points in history, it does, but at other points,  it does not. American literature and Native American studies, mostly in  the nineteenth century, actually. Doing the project on Mathews was a  little bit out of my bailiwick, a little bit further on in history than I  usually work in.  So what sparked your interest in Native American literature?  Originally, when I was an undergraduate at Stanford, I had gone on trips  with my family to the Rockies and things like that, so I   d always had  some interest in Native American history. I had the very good fortune  when I was a junior to   I just happened to be friends with somebody  who was in the photography major. We knew a resident (how would you  put it?) a resident fellow, one of the people who would live in the dorms  who was bringing in a woman from Oklahoma from Anadarko named  Linda Poolaw. I think it was later that she became chief of the Delaware  Tribe in Anadarko. She was coming to Stanford to do a photography  project about her father, whose name was Horace Poolaw. He had been a  photographer in the 1920s,   30s,   40s,   50s. She had a number of  photographic negatives that were on these index card kind of negatives,  like three-by-fives, two-by-fours  four-by-sixes .  During the first part of my junior year, I worked on that photography  project with her and a number of other students, including my friend  who was in photography, developing the photographs. I went away to  England, ironically to Oxford, for my junior year abroad, but eventually  the project became a photographic tour. They went back to Anadarko  and actually did an oral history project with the Kiowa Indians there  about the people that were in the photographs. Eventually, the Poolaw  exhibit made it to the Smithsonian and went around on a tour of the  country. That   s how I got really interested in Native American literature  because Linda would sit with us while we were developing and just tell  us story after story after story, just looking at the photographs and  talking to us about her life, about her father   s life, about her family and  what was happening in the pictures. It was really my first interaction  with a Native American woman for any length of time, and that got me  very interested.  I wasn   t really sure what I wanted to do. I took about three years out  6  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  between graduating and going back to grad school. It was around the  time of Rodney King, and I knew I wanted to sort of understand why we  are who we are, where the United States got to be where it was, why it   s  on the land that it   s on. I was doing the wilderness skills project, the  camping and rock climbing and things at the time and thinking about,     Whose land has this been over time? What kind of languages have been  spoken here in the Sierras,    and etcetera. That was kind of the impetus. I  would say that when I got to graduate school, I ended up narrowing  down from   North America is a big unit, as though I was going to be  able to understand all of North America, down, down, down to looking  at relationships between Native Americans and US citizens, mostly in  the nineteenth century.  How did you first become aware of John Joseph Mathews?  That one   s easy. I was looking for an external member of my committee  when I was looking for my PhD committee. I asked to introduce myself  to a man named Ross Frank, who is in the Ethnic Studies Department at  UC San Diego. I don   t remember how long I had known him, but at  some point he gave me Wah'Kon-Tah  The Osage and the White Man   s  Road  and said,    You should read this.    I read it, and I loved it. I learned  so much from it. I think I was still at UCSD when I started teaching  Wah   Kon-Tah, mispronouncing it, actually, at the time when I started  teaching it. Then I heard Mathews on an audio tape say the name, or  maybe it was his stepson who said the name. I realized that all of these  years I had been mispronouncing the name. In any case, I started  teaching it.  When I got my job in Illinois, for some reason the forces were  converging. I stepped on the campus and knew that I wanted to do an  article on something, sort of start out the road to tenure with a bang.  That was the book that I was really intrigued by and wanted to know  more about, so I started reading about that and did an article about  Mathews over summer and winter break that year. It was kind of a  happenstance, really. Ross Frank has a collection of Plains Indian ledger  art that he works on, so he   s very knowledgeable. He   s in the field of  history in the Ethnic Studies Department and knew a lot about Plains  Indian history, so kind of just directed me to that book. Even though I  don   t think it ever showed up in my dissertation, he just wanted me to  read it as background.  And he is at UC San Diego?  He   s at UC San Diego.  Okay. We   ll move from there into the book Twenty Thousand Mornings,  7  Kalter  which you brought a copy with you. This is what sparked this interview,  today. Explain to me your role in this project and how it came to you.  Let   s see. The article that I wrote was back in   I think I ended up  finishing it in 2001. At some point, I started going to the Native  American Studies Symposium  Native American Literature  Symposium . What is it called? I can   t remember what it   s called, but  they used to have it near outside of Minneapolis every year. I met a man  named Carter Revard. He probably doesn   t remember me meeting him,  but I met him very, very briefly. We were both on a listserv, the Studies  in American Indian Literatures listserv, and started corresponding with  each other about another article that I had written about the Cherokee  syllabary. At some point in an exchange   I think that at some point,  Martha Cutter, who is now the editor of a journal called MELUS, Multi-  Ethnic Literature of the United States, she asked me to do a headnote for  an upcoming anthology on Mathews because she had seen my article.  In the course of doing that introduction in the anthology to Mathews, I  asked Carter a couple questions about him. He found out that I knew  him, knew Mathews, and was interested. This is over the course of  several years. I think it was around 2006, he was corresponding with me  by email and mentioned sort of off the cuff that Mathews had an  autobiography that had never been published. I took that in, and I  assumed there was another researcher at University of Oklahoma already  working on it. In fact, he may have told me that at the time. Then a  couple of years later, I was corresponding with him again and found out  that, in fact, nobody was working on that project. I thought that it was an  important project.  I was on my way out to Arizona for the first College Board   s Native  American Student Advocacy Institute, so I decided to stop by the  Western History Collections on my way back. It was unbelievable. I  asked for the Mathews box or boxes. They brought something up, and  suddenly I   m reading love letters between him and the woman who  would become his second wife. From the 19   1932, I think, was the first  letter. I was just astonished, bowled over.    What is this stuff?    I think I  only had a day or two there during that visit but eventually got the  money to come back and to find the copies of   it turned out there were  five or six different versions of the autobiography in the Mathews  archive, which had diaries from decades of his life, the letters that I  found, not just with his wife but with other people, short stories that had  never been published before, and this autobiography.  So, I started working on the manuscripts for the autobiography. Which  one was the one that was going to be the authoritative version, and when  was each one drafted and typed? Almost all of them were in typescript in  8  Neurohr  Kalter  one way or another, but in one of them, there were really extensive  handwritten additions, as he called them, emendations around the  margins and on the backs and things like that. I think that was around  2008, if I   m remembering correctly.  I   ve been to the Western History Collections at least three times, so I  don   t remember exactly the sequence because I   m also working on the  short stories and seeing if we can bring out some volumes of the short  stories that nobody has seen yet. In any case, at some point, figured out  this was the version that he must have sent in 1967 to the first publisher,  and then the second, and etcetera, and decided that that one must be the  one we should work from. It started from there.  So you weren   t even sure with these different versions which one came  first and which one came later, and you had to sort of figure that out?  Right. Not at first, especially because of the way they were labeled. This  is not my memory; I was just reading my note to the text. Box number  four, folder number thirty-one, which was the first one, was probably the  one he was working on last in the 1970s. It was the one that had pages  missing and emendations all over the place, handwritten stuff, so at first  I was really focused on that one because it was the first one of the  folders. The next two were these very nice, that old typewriter that used  to do the italic script, these really nice, finished, polished versions. I  don   t remember what the last two or three were, but I think at least one  of those folders contained the missing pages from the first folder.  I really at first thought that I was going to be working from the one that  looked like he had been monkeying with it at the end of his life, but then  realized as I was going through that that it was extremely unfinished  type of editing work that he was doing and that there was really no way  to tell what he actually wanted there. Also, it appeared on closer  examination that the next two folders were exact carbon copies of one  another, so must be really the same version. I don   t remember what it  was that allowed me to date that, but somehow I figured out that that  was the 1967 version. What was the other thing I was going to say? In  terms of him working on the version in the 1970s, it was pretty clear that  he was pulling stuff out but that he might   ve also been trying to shove it  back in in different places.  As you read in the diaries between those two timeframes, like between  about 1965 to the end of his life, what we have of it, the edits that he was  doing weren   t because some publisher asked him to do them. It was  because he had sent it to a bunch of (what I call in the book)  inappropriate publishers, people who were probably not going to do an  autobiography about a Southwestern writer of Osage Indians and nature  9  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  writing and an oil magnate. They were off into science fiction and these  other kinds of projects. He started doing those emendations for no  reason except that he had gotten what he perceived as rejections and  what I was reading as,    This isn   t a rejection at all. This is one of those  things where you send off something and it   s going to the wrong place,  so they send it back to you.     The edits that he was making were what I thought were somewhat  imagined critiques of what he had written before, which I thought was  just fine. The 1967 version, to me, read the best and was the most logical  of the narratives. What he had started doing in the other version was to  try to package his stuff into what he calls vignettes and with titles and  things like that, which would   ve worked in a certain way, I think, if it  had been finished and polished work, but, unfortunately, events in his  life eventually leading to his death stopped him from being able to work  to the end on that.  Did you have an opportunity to meet any members of his family as you  were working on this?  That   s an interesting question. I had an opportunity and missed it. His  daughter was alive, I think, until, I think she was alive until about 2010.  When you did the Literary Landmark event in Pawhuska, I was  supposed to be there, and I would have met her but did not meet her  because something at Illinois State prevented me from attending, from  getting down to Oklahoma. So I never met her, and then by the time I  would have had the opportunity, when I was working on the final drafts  for the book, I found out that she had died.  After we were already in copy edits or page proofs, her brother  contacted the press. I have not had an opportunity to meet him yet, but I  have corresponded very briefly a couple of times with his wife. That  may be something that will occur in the future but, unfortunately, not so  far. I also did have an opportunity at one point to speak briefly by email  to his stepson, John Hunt, who is over in Paris, I think, still. For various  reasons, that also was very brief, and I think it is kind of difficult to  establish a relationship over email for both parties. The first steps have  been taken, but nothing further.  Okay, what about visiting sites in Oklahoma and your impressions of  those? You briefly talked about going to the University of Oklahoma and  seeing the collection there in the Western History Collections. Do you  have any other impressions of that?  Yes, I was going to say, an impression of sitting in a library, a very, very  nice library, for two non-consecutive weeks, one in, I think, 2008 and  10  Neurohr  one in 2009, where I would get up in the morning, go to the library, stay  in the library until lunch, eat a really brief lunch, come back in, and  probably everybody around me thought I was crazy.    Who is this person  who   s here for a week doing nothing but library work?    My impression  of being in the library itself and Norman and the surrounding areas is  actually delightful because the librarians were all wonderful. I was going  through five or six boxes of his stuff.  I don   t remember which trip it was. I think it was in 2008. I went to  Pawhuska. I went to the  Osage  Tribal Museum. I went to the Osage  County Historical Museum, and then I tried to find the Blackjacks, his  home most of his life, and then went to what   s now the Nature  Conservancy area there. I don   t remember what it   s called, but there   s a  state park. Unfortunately, got stuck in the mud at Bluestem Lake and  was apparently off the track of where his home was. One of my  impressions of that visit was seeing, inside the Osage Tribal Museum,  the allotment exhibit that had just all of these pictures of all of the  allottees for the Osage land. That was a fascinating trip to see that and  simply to be in Osage County and understand.  I remember at one point I was driving through what I think is the state  park and came very close to a buffalo. They brought buffalo. I don   t  think they were there when Mathews was alive, but they brought buffalo  into that park. They were crossing   well, not really crossing the road,  but sort of just wandering in the road. That was somewhat fascinating,  was to be on the plains and experience that. I   m trying to think of what  else. I think the other thing I did, since I   m interested in other Native  American writers from there, there   s a book called Drowning in Fire by  Craig Womack. He talks about the tri-city area of Wetumka, Wewoka,  and something. I always thought that was one of the funniest lines of his  book, so I went down to what is Creek Tribal lands and tried to find the  tri-city area and Lake Eufaula and etcetera.  Then I drove out to, attempted to go to a museum at Spiro.  Unfortunately, it was closed because it was Memorial Day weekend that  weekend, so I never got to see that. Tried to convince another tourist not  to break through the gate. She wanted to break into the gate. Since I  knew about the NAGPRA  Native American Graves Protection and  Repatriation Act  and the kinds of federal laws we would be breaking, I  was like,    You know, it   s probably really not a good idea for either of us  to do that, so let   s not,    even though I really, really wanted to see the  remains of Spiro. I   ll have to get back there to do that at some point.  When you talked about the buffalo, I think you   re talking about the Tall  Grass Prairie Preserve     11  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  Yes, yes, that   s right.     which is run by the Nature Conservancy. Technically, it   s not a state  park, just for the record.  Okay, yes. Somehow I have it in my mind conflated with what he calls  the Chapman-Barnard Ranch. I know I went to a ranch there.  That was part of the Chapman-Barnard Ranch, so what you see with the  Tall Grass Prairie Preserve, the headquarters of the Chapman-Barnard  Ranch are where the gift shop is now for the Tall Grass Prairie  Preserve. Mathews    homeplace, the family land, is adjacent to that.  So I got close.  You were very close.  I unfortunately did not have a guide or a map or   . I have a little bit of  an understanding of quadrants but had not really started my own  genealogical research yet, so I didn   t really know how to locate what I  saw in the allotment exhibit as his land.  Were you aware when you went into Pawhuska of the Tribal Hill and his  family home?  Yes. What I remember more than his own home was the museum. I feel  as though I must have at least looked for his home and decided at some  point which one it was. I think I also at that point knew the address for  his wife   s original home because he had sent letters to her before they  were married. I think that I drove up and down Grandview Ave. and  located those houses, but for some reason they   re not as vivid in my  recollection as the Tribal Museum. I was there for several hours. It   s  kind of an unmistakable location.  Let   s back up just a minute when you were at the Western History  Collections and you were looking through the files over his work. Were  you just taking notes as you were looking through everything? Were you  able to get copies you could take back and work with? How did that  work?  A little bit of each. It varied with the various projects that I   m doing,  partly because of my funding situation. When I was working on Twenty  Thousand Mornings, a lot of it was   well, I did get all five folders, five  or six or seven folders, that had the actual autobiography in them. The  WHC gave me my own personal Xerox. You sign a form about use and  etcetera. I know I had those with me to take home, but when it came  12  Neurohr  Kalter  to   the diary record is enormous. It   s almost unfathomable. Each time I  was there, except for the first time through when I only had about a day  or two, I was there for only a week. The library has particular hours. For  the actual published autobiography, I had very little time to go through  the diaries to try to figure out all of the things we were just talking  about, plus a lot of other aspects that I talk about like his Oxford years  and those kinds of things. I was sort of skimming, taking a lot of notes,  but didn   t have any funding to get anything more.  The next year when I came back but after this book was, I think, either  already in the process or somehow it was beyond that research, I was  doing work on the short stories and got a lot more that I was able to just  bring back for my own personal use. During the work on Twenty  Thousand Mornings, a lot of it was just skim, skim, skim.    Oh, there   s a  couple of key words.    It was interesting because some of the diaries are  very easy to read because they   re typescript, printed out. Others are his  handwriting, and some of that is very difficult to read. The smaller the  diary, the harder it is to go through. In some cases, I   m realizing sort of  in retrospect that I missed a number of things, even though they are  incidental things. I don   t know if I could even bring one up off the top of  my head, but that financial restriction that I had when I was first  working on it probably made me miss some things that might have been  interesting to note in the actual volume.  One of your major decision points, obviously, was which manuscript. So  what were some other major decision points you had to figure out?  Oh, the most torturous was that we got to, I think it was the copy edit  stage or maybe just before. The Press told me that the book was too  long. I don   t remember exactly what the word count, but something  around 100,000-something-or-other, and 120,000 words is in my head.  We had to cut about 15,000 or 20,000 words. It was basically a choice  between cutting all of the editorial apparatus, like every single thing, or  cutting out parts of what he had written. I didn   t want to do either,  obviously. I wanted just to have his complete draft from 1967 and the  editorial apparatus because one without the other would not really help  the current, present-day reader.  The biggest decision points were,    What are the excisions going to be?     In the footnotes every once in a while, you   ll see,    Excision: Josephine   s  piano lessons,    or what have you. Some of them were not that hard to  make, partly because he had already seemed to be taking those out.  Others were very hard. There was a very long passage, kind of a funny  passage. If I   m remembering this sequence correctly, he has just gotten  back from World War I and has not yet gone to Oxford. He and his  sisters and his mother go driving around the Midwest. They   re in  13  Neurohr  Kalter  Minnesota, Minneapolis. I think they go Keokuk,  Iowa , and Hannibal,  Missouri, etcetera. At some point he   s out in the rain in his coat, fixing a  tire, and then it turns out that they   re only about five minutes away from  a town. Then the rain stops and etcetera.  I did not want to cut that passage, but it was really the only long passage  that was going to get us to   . It was such a delightful passage because it  shows this side of him with his mother and his sisters, basically when  they   re all adults and kind of their thoughts, and this kind of early  motoring culture and early hotel culture because it   s got to be like 1919,  1920, 1921, somewhere in there. It was just fascinating. Unfortunately,  that was something that just did not   . I think what I decided eventually  was that it didn   t go with the narrative of his life as much, in terms of his  education, his time in World War I, and then going on to Oxford. I think  it might have been one of the ones he took out. I decided to sort of go  with that decision of his, but I really didn   t want to. I really thought it  was a terrific passage. Hopefully, other people will go read that one.  Were there any specific challenges that come to mind beyond a decision  point that you had to make, in particular?  I   m laughing because I   m thinking about reading something seventeen  thousand times over and over again. (Laughs) Hmm. I think one of the  challenges was deciding what would be in the editorial materials, the  surrounding. One of the reviewers wanted more about comparing this  autobiography to other autobiographies, for example, so that was kind of  a challenge for me because I went in sort of a different direction and  decided what readers might want is context for his life, first of all, things  that other people probably wouldn   t be able to give.  Since I   m one of the first people, or was at the time one of the first  people, to see a lot of that Mathews archive that I could fill in blanks  that sometimes in some cases we didn   t even know existed. I also saw  that that might have been a good idea, to take this autobiography and  compare it to a number of others. I think I decided ultimately that it was  probably best to use what my expertise was here and say,    Okay, I   ve  had the privilege to be one of the first people to see the diaries, one of  the first people to see the short stories and the records of him as a  manuscript reviewer for Oklahoma University Press.    Probably, people  in the scholarly community and in the popular community, both, will  want to know more about his full life. I knew I could not really make  that past a certain point, at least in full.  I knew that I would have to leave, and may forever have to leave, like,  the 1950s through 1970s to somebody else. I could do a lot to fill in the  gaps and help people who are studying, especially his novels, understand  14  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  the difference between him as a person and the characters and the  personas. I don   t know what to call it when it   s a nonfiction character,  but the people he wrote about who kind of exist in this borderline  between fiction and nonfiction so that you could see a contrast between  him   I thought it was important for people to see his artistry and to  recognize that when he wrote Sundown, for example, he was not writing  solely about himself or thinking of Challenge Windzer as himself. We  often conflate those because we had no other information. We had no  other context. Sometimes I wonder whether he wrote the autobiography  in part to show people who he was because he maybe had some sense  that they did not know his life story versus the stories of the people he  had written about.  When do you think he started writing the autobiography?  I   m almost positive that it was in 1965. I think he may have had it in  mind a little bit earlier because he was reading other people   s  autobiographies in the   60s and maybe in the late   50s. I don   t quite  remember when that starts. From the time the Marland biography  Life  and Death of an Oilman: The Career of E. W. Marland  is published to  1961, he is totally absorbed in what he calls the Osage book, and rightly  so. When he   s not distracted by other things going on in his life, but in  terms of his writing career, that is what is really on his mind. After that   s  published, he then turns to the children   s book, a book of about nine  short stories, then he starts writing his autobiography. He says it   s either  March first or June first or something in 1965.    Today I   m going to start  my autobiography,    so you don   t have to really guess. (Laughter) As a  couple people have mentioned, he sometimes had ideas about what he  was going to write about prior to actually saying in his diary,    I   m going  to do this and that.     So did he keep diaries all of his life?  I believe so. He, several times, mentions in Twenty Thousand Mornings  diaries from his childhood, which I would give an arm and a leg to see.  That would be really fascinating. He even talks about sweat stains and  etcetera in the ones where he   s probably ten years old. At some point, he  mentions that he had a war diary but that he lost it somehow. Then he  says (and it   s very unclear exactly when he was talking about) there was  a time when he didn   t keep a diary. He restarted it in 1921 because even  when he   s writing in the   60s and   70s, he keeps saying    this diary,    the  one from 1921, on. He   s thinking about this as a fifty-year text,  amazingly enough. We don   t have the ones   we know that they existed.  We know, for example, in his diaries he talks about rereading the ones  from 1927, 1928, 1929, but we don   t have them in the collection.  15  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  It seems that he tried pretty faithfully either to write every single day, at  least one entry, or to retroactively write entries and probably took them  and then elaborated on some of them. There are some where you  actually have one of those old diary books where the passage is just a  one-page passage, but then when you see it in the typescript, there is a  long philosophical, we would call it    going off on something    as  teenagers, where he just takes some subject that he had mentioned very  briefly and elaborates and elaborates. As far as I can tell, he wrote every  day of his life for at least, what is that, sixty-seven years, fifty-seven  years. Fifty-seven years. My math is bad. But probably also when he  was ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen years old.  That   s fascinating.  It   s absolutely fascinating, for anybody to do that  I don   t know a single  person who does that, except on Facebook now. It   s not really the same  kind of thing, exactly. You know, he knows for a very long time that  nobody is reading it but himself. Anyone who keeps a diary hopes that  they know that but is never really sure. Then when he goes down to  Mexico in 1939, he starts sending parts of his diary back to Elizabeth,  his second wife, who is not yet his second wife. He is simply courting  her at that time. She says to him something about how interesting they  are, and he says,    Oh, maybe I should think more about them.    Then he  says,    You   re the first person who has ever read them.    So even into the  late 1930s, he had not shown his diaries to any living person. After that,  it   s impossible to know. When they were married in the middle of the  1950s, did he show her pages every single day or never or once in a  while? Sometimes he will say things about her that are kind of cute or a  little humorous, sort of poking fun at her, or things where he   s worried  about her or her health or what have you.  Did you find anything that would indicate what influenced him to keep  diaries?  Absolutely not, (Laughs) especially because it was so early. If he was  born in 1894, and if he   s already, I think, by 1904 in Twenty Thousand  Mornings talking about reading back over his diary, there is no way to  know. My guess, though   since doing this book, I started teaching     what was it? I was doing a course on social justice movements in the  early and mid-nineteenth century. We were reading a piece. I think it  was called  Lucy Howard   s Journal  by Lydia Sigourney. It   s a novel,  but it   s fictionalized as a diary. It talks about how the school system  asked the young women to keep diaries. I wonder if it may have been  something in his schooling, if in the early twentieth century at some  point, maybe Mrs. Tucker said to the students,    Start keeping a diary of  your life and write things that will be morally educative or help you keep  16  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  your sense of direction,    or something like that. I wonder about whether  that   s the impetus since he was so young when he started. I have  absolutely no evidence of where it came from at all. It   s all conjecture.  So there weren   t any references that his mother or his sisters kept  diaries and it was a family thing?  I never found anything about that, actually. The only time he ever  speaks, if I   m remembering this right, the only time he ever speaks of  women in his family writing is in the 1940s when his second wife and  his stepdaughter try their hand at short story writing. He has a couple of  either friends or acquaintances who are female writers, like Angie Debo.  What is her name? Alice Marriott, the anthropologist. He does know  some female figures who he knows as authors, as opposed to in some  other way like romantic or just family. I never see him, ever, writing  about   the only other thing that I can remember is his mother saying to  him,    My life is like a book,    but nothing about any of his sisters  writing.  His youngest sister, Florence, who he ends up calling Dooly in his later  diaries, apparently was married to a man named Mike Feighan, who was  a Congressman from Ohio, from the Cleveland area. If I understand  what   s going on in the later diaries correctly, I think that Marie and  Lillian ended up not getting married. They, I think, were single their  whole life. Josephine, his oldest sister, was married to a man named  Henry Caudill. All I ever see of her, she had a son  Henry Jr.  who died  in World War II, and then her daughter (I think it   s Sarah Jo) is  mentioned throughout the later diary. None of those people is ever  mentioned as writing diaries. He   s never talking about having  conversations with them about    our writing    or    we exchange writing,     except for when he says,    I wrote my autobiography and sent it to my  sisters to make sure I was doing this right.     Can you talk a little bit about his writing style?  I was going to ask you if you could be more specific about that. There  are so many kinds of things you could say about that.  What literary elements stand out to you in his writing?  You know, the first thing that comes to mind is he has extremely short  paragraphs, not just in the autobiography but in some of his other works.  His sense of where you should break the thought or break the  momentum (or perhaps it   s to keep the momentum going in certain  cases) is very different from a modern day, or perhaps it   s just different  from my overly-academic kind of sense. I tend to write very long  17  Neurohr  Kalter  paragraphs. A lot of my students will write very long paragraphs. You   ll  go through three pages and say,    Where   s the break?    It   s very  interesting to see that. He will use certain kinds of repetition, but it   s not  quite exactly repetition. It   s more elaboration and variation.  I think it was also really interesting to notice   what would you call it?  This is more of an editing thing than a literary thing, but the rushing and  misspelling of words that later on in a manuscript would be spelled  perfectly correctly, so you could kind of see it was either   and it   s hard  to tell whether that   s him as a typist or his wife as a typist because they  were both working on various kinds of drafts. It   s kind of interesting to  see that he was willing to sacrifice the finer perfectionist types of points  in order to just get the draft done and to get it out. Another thing, he   ll  always write oriole O-R-E-O-L-E rather than O-R-I-O-L-E. I started  thinking about orioles with an E for a long time. I think, also, that his  life writing is a little bit different from his   even though, certainly,  Talking to the Moon is part of his life writing. He even says,    This is the  third volume of my autobiography.     I think he has something of a different cadence or approach to his early  life compared to his life as an adult. Some of the things that I find  somewhat frustrating is that he   ll be in the middle of a thought about  something that is for us, really, kind of a nostalgia, like we   re not able to  recall what he   s talking about. Sometimes it will not come clearer. But  other times, he will describe the attitudes of the day or a particular way  of seeing things in such a vivid way. I was just reading (this is not the  passage I want to read) the part where he and Spot and Bally are caught  in a tornado. They hide in this little cave, and he lets Bally find her own  way. Then he comes into this little sort of camp of these men who  were   it   s totally unclear what they   re doing out on the prairie, exactly.  They take him in. They   ve taken in Bally. They say,    Well, we put the  bars down for her,    and etcetera. They end up playing poker that night.  He gets the, especially the old man   s, expressions, so well. You can  almost picture what   s going on and the kind of attitudes. He talks about  how he wishes he could swear better, but he couldn   t find a way to fit in  certain kinds of epithets. It   s interesting, I think partly because by the  time he   s writing the autobiography he   s seventy-one, I think is when he  first starts it. I think some of what he   s doing still stays in his head at this  point. I think Charles Red Corn says,    Who can write about their  childhood with so much interest for other people, making it so vivid?     What about his tone?  Which one? (Laughter) Which one, you know, because one of the  passages I just went over was where he   s complaining about modern day  18  Neurohr  Kalter  (   modern day    meaning 1960s and 1970s) modern day obsession with  sex and (what does he call it?) vulgarities or something like that. There   s  a tone that   s kind of    I   m the older, more mature person who sees how  juvenile and adolescent you   re being.    At the same time, he pictures  himself as a juvenile, in a sort of a knowing way. Then there are places  where he   s, you know, like when he was talking about his sister  Josephine. I don   t know how to describe his tone there.  Part of him is revealing to us that he understands her better in retrospect  than he did at the time. A lot of him is still very resentful at the way she  treated him and her perceived superiority complex and bossiness. I think  there are a lot of different tones in the book, and I haven   t even covered  most of them. There   s a totally different tone when he   s talking about  going to the Rocky Mountains with his friends Floyd Soderstrom and  Leo Bellieu, more peaceful and tranquil and placid and with a little bit of  irony and a little, would you call it being snide or something, when he  talks about the Frank Hays incident, the ptarmigan.    Maybe you ought to  stuff that ptarmigan. Get a rock.    I think it   s varied with the occasion.  Okay, you mentioned tension, as far as his sister Josephine in particular.  Is there any other tension or conflict that you might want to talk about at  all?  You know, I think the most interesting tension, especially in the  autobiography, and a little bit in his other writings about the 1920s, is  the tension of wanting to be alone versus wanting to be with other  people. I guess you could say that it   s a tension, but it doesn   t really  come across to me quite as one. His real connection is, both imaginary  and actual, with animals, very much with Spot and Bally but also when  he   s imagining himself as a wolf and seeing how different he was from  Tom Mitscher when he was at play as a little boy. He was not just inside  his mind versus being active, as you can imagine lots of boys or girls  being.  What he was thinking about was actually becoming an animal, which I  don   t think a lot of children, especially today, do in quite the same way  that he would have. In other words, as he says,    We are earth detached  and not very much close to what we are talking about or imagining.     Even if a child today is thinking about themself as an animal, often that  is through cartoons or through some other kind of mediated structure.  Even though I think the autobiography really shows us a different  character from between Jo Mathews and Challenge Windzer in  Sundown, one of the tensions that I think really is autobiographical in the  novel is this feeling of wanting to have solitude and wanting to go out  onto the prairie with your horse and your dog and spend weeks at a time,  only running into people and maybe not even that and perhaps getting  19  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  lost or what have you. I think that   s a big tension in his life.  I think that that   s probably what leads him not to get married until late in  life and probably is why he ends up in a second marriage because I don   t  think he really understood himself, or he understood himself so very  deeply that he was a solitary person and so liked to do things but also  liked to have that connection to other people and, as a lot of people who  are solitary are like this, he could not find that happy medium between  being his own person and being sort of a loner and being somebody who  was very social because he was certainly a very social person. I think  sometimes what people see in him when they interacted with him was  very different from what was going on on the inside and what he was  thinking or what he would write down later on. They would never know  that.  Does anything else come to your mind right now that you want to  include? We   ll shift gears just a little bit here, I think.  I don   t think so, actually. I think we   ve covered a lot.  Yes, we have. Can you talk a little bit about the audio recordings? And  also, I think you mentioned filming. What can you tell me about the  audio recordings or the film?  I   m glad you asked that question because I wanted to talk to you about  that, specifically. It   s the one thing that I   ve been going over in my mind  in advance of this interview, thinking you might ask the question in a  different way, but I   ll tell you how I thought you might ask it, that was  that a lot of people had reported that he had an English accent. I think  what was very fascinating to me about listening to his voice for the first  time, which was emotionally unbelievable just to hear his voice. He has  a very deep voice. He does not have, by any stretch of the imagination,  an English accent. What I think he has is sort of what you might call  BBC English but in an American vein, in the sense that he sounds to me  like a radio personality, almost like an Edward R. Murrow. He speaks in  a very measured way and a slow way.  Unless of course, we always have to rely on the technology of the time.  Every once in a while, you   ll get a stretch of tape where his voice goes  into Mickey Mouse. He even notes this in his own diary, where it goes  slowly. What I think I   m hearing is, I think, his actual voice, but you can  never actually be sure unless you ask somebody who knew him when he  was alive. He has one of those, what I think in Oklahoma may seem to  somebody like an English accent but is more of a regularized American,  a kind of radio English, in a certain way. He   ll say certain words in a  very intriguing way. He   ll talk about everything else and then talk about  20  the    Yahd,    as though he   s from Boston.    Well, in the yahd, there was a  Painted Bunting who is doing XYZ.    It   s kind of funny because you can  kind of see that at some point in his life, he made a conscious or semi-conscious  decision not to speak with a regional Oklahoma accent, but  because he had been to Oxford, people thought that meant he was  speaking with an English accent. No, no, no.  He has a wonderful voice, a very thoughtful, deep, I think it   s a baritone  voice. The audio tapes are delightful because every once in a while, he   ll  be at the Blackjacks, he   ll be out at the picnic table, and he   ll punch the  tape recorder on. There   s no voice, none of his voice, that is. You   re  listening to something that he   s listening to, you know, Chuck-will   s-widow,  or (what are some of the other) a cardinal or   . He tries for, like,  months. At one point in his written diary, he   s trying for months to get  the coyote chorus, and for some reason never has the tape recorder out  on the porch when the coyote chorus is there. Or there   s an entire section  that   s simply a thunderstorm.  I was listening to this recently because the Western History Collections  was nice enough to give me copies of some of the tapes on CD. I was  listening to the thunderstorm in a thunderstorm one day on my own  porch. It was going on and on, and at this point, I think he and his wife  are in the Kihekah Hotel or Motel because every once in a while it  would get so hot on the ridge, or so cold, that they would have to flee  into town and rent a motel room. There will be things like that, and there  will be huge stretches of American history, you know, Apollo landings  and takings-off, Nixon   s resignation, Meet the Press, and these kinds of  things.  There   s a section of tape (I think it   s 1964 or    65) when his stepson and  his grandchildren through John Hunt came to the ridge. He   ll be having  conversations with Mead Hunt and Diana Hunt about berry-picking.     You don   t have to go picking blackberries if you don   t want to.    Or     You think I can turn the coyote on and off with a push-button, don   t  you?    Things like this, just sort of joking. There   s one that   s really  hilarious with Dibbs. Dibbs is Elizabeth Hunt, his second wife. They   re  having what could be an argument but may just be a playful back-and-forth  about whether or not the Chuck-will   s-widow is saying    Chuck    or     Chip.    (Laughs) He   ll be recording all of this. You never know who   s  listening, so every once in a while, you   re thinking that he   s solitary and  alone, and then her voice will come in, or somebody else   s voice will  come in.  There   s one that   s actually mislabeled as a diary on the finding source,  where he went to Rancho Seco and was hunting with J. Frank Dobie and  a couple other people. I think it was Ralph Johnston and a couple other  21  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  people in Texas. They   re getting drunk and telling racy stories, and he  just decided to record it. You have this absolutely, absolutely hilarious  tape of that. Apparently, he would play this to several people at various  times in his life. Then you have the Guy Logsdon interview and things  like that. The audio tapes are pretty fascinating, and there are both too  many of them and not enough in a certain way. When you get to the  parts that are sort of Meet the Press, you just kind of want to go through  and,    Okay, cut to the chase here,    but then when you   re listening to the  ones where he   s with his family or where he   s just outside thinking  about things or elaborating on some political point, you wish that there  were more.  I think you asked about the film. We have none of the trace of his film,  as far as I know. He mentions the film. I think the first time I noticed it  was when he   s in Mexico and he was bringing around a cine-camera  with him in Mexico. Throughout the rest of his life, he is either bringing  a camera or motion picture camera, hunting. Often he will bring them  hunting. He goes at one point to try to photograph the sandhill crane  dance, I think in Nebraska and at one point maybe somewhere else. I  have a feeling that those tapes probably went to his family. My guess is  that they   re still preserved, but Elizabeth or perhaps his son, daughter, or  stepson, stepdaughter decided to keep them because they kind of showed  a part of his personality. It would be nice if they had them or if the  grandchildren had them. It   s hard to tell what he thought of as his art and  creative bent and what he saw as anybody would take family pictures or  do this kind of thing in the 1960s and   70s when all of this technology  was coming out. Just the fact that he has tape recordings is fascinating to  me.  When did they start? Are they dated?  They are dated. When they started is a really interesting question. I  know that the Rancho Seco tape is about 1959. The motion picture  camera in Mexico is 1939. When the first taped diary is, I do not  remember, but I think it   s in the mid- to late   50s. It   s not the ones that  are in the Western History Collections. This is simply things he   s  mentioning in his written diaries. Then, some of those have been saved  in the archive. Others, like I said, probably are with his family. I think  the audio recordings are probably in the mid-1950s. He even names        Well, I   m recording the Wollensak tape onto the Blah-blah-blah tape.     There must have been some sort of system in his head about this.  Does anything puzzle you about him?  (Laughs) Absolutely, yes. I think I say somewhere in my introduction  something like,    He and I would probably not agree about who is going  22  to destroy the human race.    (Laughs) I think one of the things that   s very  puzzling to me is   how would I put this? He is extraordinarily insightful  about cultural relations and personalities and how personalities fit into  the web and landscape of culture and cultures. At the same time, he  seemed to be (I guess I would say) merely a man of his generation when  it came to things like the Civil Rights Movement or the Vietnam War.  I think some of it, maybe not a lot of it but some of it, I think, had to do  with his military background and finding, perhaps rightfully, some  offense at some of the Vietnam protests and that kind of thing. Some of  it, I think, is probably simply due to his generation at that time in  history. That puzzles me a lot, is how somebody who I think is very  empathetic in certain ways to how people can see the world in extremely  different ways and through very different lenses, especially in his so-called  unrecorded later life, in other words, the part of his life that most  people don   t know about yet, that he seemed dismissive of these  movements that I see as critical to our freedom and to values that I think  he would have shared.  I think it   s sort of a human contradiction, that it   s something that a lot of  people experience, is this kind of on the one hand having a bad reaction  to something that they see going on amongst other people who they  don   t identify with, yet at the same time in another aspect of their life,  there is something that should or would allow them to have that kind of  empathy. That puzzles me a lot. I would have liked to talk to him to  understand his point of view better. Often (I think I was saying this  about very small sections of the autobiography) in his other writings,  too, he   ll make a statement that I really want to pursue, that I really  don   t understand quite where he   s headed and from which part of his  history he is coming. I want to probe and ask and have an exchange, and,  of course, that   s never possible. It probably wouldn   t have been possible  even if I had ever met him or been able to meet him when I was an adult  or what have you.  That puzzles me a lot, whether all of that was consistent or inconsistent,  and where that   especially in his attitudes toward African Americans,  where those kinds of attitudes come from. I suggest a little bit in my  introduction that they may come from his parents and his grandparents  in the history of the Civil War and being on the Confederate side of the  Civil War, at least in some nominal way. Some history that I don   t  completely understand, especially because I know this about Oklahoma  only from reading about it, but for many tribes there were very difficult  decisions about which side to be on during the Civil War, political,  moral, and that for his family because his father   s father was not Osage,  that was a complicated decision because he was married to a woman  who was Osage, part of the tribe, and yet also having his views of  23  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  slavery, etcetera, coming from somewhere else in his background. I  think that   s a sort of a section of Mathews family history that I think is  very intriguing and not at all straightforward to understand, not at all.  Did his ancestors have slaves? Did I read that?  Apparently when his grandfather was killed, his father and brother fled  with two slaves with a family called the Audrains, so a male and a  female slave came with them. He talks a little bit about, in some diaries,  about African Americans who were doing washing for his wife, etcetera,  so he has some connections throughout his life. He talks a little bit about  being in New Mexico. There was an African American cook who was in  the group of people who were hunting or something like that. I think part  of what   s going on is that he has done anthropological reading  throughout his life and kind of has decided that somehow the  environmental factors lead to race, etcetera, so he can   t understand, for  example, an African American man in the snow. I don   t remember how  he puts it, but he says it   s incongruous to him because Africans are  supposed to be in Africa. For somebody who understood colonialism so  well, it   s sort of striking that he didn   t understand it that well. (Laughter)  He didn   t get further than what he knew very intimately.  What about gender issues?  (Laughs) What about them?  I guess probably there too, the time period, but on the other hand, he  wanted his daughter to be educated.  That   s an interesting one because I would love to hear what his first wife  felt that her side of that story was, and whether it was even different  from his. He seems to have taken it as though it was very different from  what he wanted, but I don   t know because all I have is his version. I  think it   s interesting, he is sort of stereotypically of his day in most  things about gender but not in everything. His relationship with his  daughter is one example. I think it kind of depended a lot on the woman  and how that person interacted with his  psychological  complex of early  female figures in his life, you know, his mother and his three sisters and  which of the sisters they tended to fold themselves into   psychologically  and whether he recognized that or not when he first  met them.  He loves the word histrionic, and he often uses it for women. He often  uses it for men, actually, so that   s why it   s kind of difficult to really pin  him down on gender because people will say that he had (I don   t  remember how I   ve read this) various problems with various women. He  24  Neurohr  Kalter  had a lot of problems with a lot of men, too, when he writes about them  in his diary. It   s not necessarily a gender thing when he criticizes. It is a  gender thing when he criticizes women, but it   s not an exclusively   .    I  don   t get along with these women, but I do get along with every man I  meet.    He is an equal-opportunity critic of the way people behave.  I think that my guess is that Josephine had a big influence on his psyche,  and her being seven years older. She   s another one I would have liked to  talk to, to see whether he   s characterizing her resentment of him as she  saw it, or if she had some other issue or nonissue with her family or  what have you. Again, we only get his point of view. My sense, also,  especially because I   ve read the parts of his diaries when his mother is in  her eighties and nineties, (I guess she doesn   t make it to her nineties) I  think he really admired her a lot. I think he admired his grandmother a  lot. I don   t think that you can paint him with one brush when it comes to  gender. I think it was very complex.  I think, again, it was he had a kind of biological perspective on life, and  he thought he knew why women acted the way they did based on  watching other animals and seeing often   . In a certain way it   s  interesting because he was saying things back in the   30s and   40s about  women   s power in sexual relationships that nobody would have said or  predicted, in other words, that they were, because of the Victorian Age,  being forced to kind of cover up their leadership and choice in sex and  kind of pass it off onto men. It   s not that that   s never been said, but it  was an early insight into that. I think I could write an entire book trying  to understand exactly (let me put it this way) trying to catalog the  different areas into which you can put Mathews in gender because some  of it is really ugly, and some of it is very empathetic, and some of it is  very insightful even though it has nothing to do with anyone he knows.  We   ll shift gears a little bit here. Are you aware of ways that his writings  are being used in teaching?  Yes, a little bit. Interestingly, when I first came to Illinois State, the  woman who used to be our advisor, who is now one of our associate  deans, she teaches in the sort of modernist era. First thing I saw on her  bookshelf was Sundown. I think Sundown is taught in many modernist  classrooms. I don   t know to what extent it is contextualized in terms of  Osage history, or whether it   s mostly talked about just as a modernist  novel. I think it   s probably a little bit of both. The reason Ross Frank  gave Wah'Kon-Tah to me was that he was using it in his history classes.  Although it   s not about teaching, I think that I read somewhere that the  Marland biography has never gone out of print and is one of his best  sellers.  25  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  I think that people are teaching Mathews    works in a lot of varied types  of settings. I think they teach, for sure, in Native American literature  classes, especially if they   re conscious of a kind of history before the so-called  Native American Renaissance, before the 1960s, giving the  people an understanding of the early twentieth century novelists like  Mathews and D   Arcy McNickle. I think Mathews is taught in modernist  settings. I think he   s taught in history classes. What was I going to say  about that? I wish that I heard more about people teaching his last living  work, The Osages     Children of the Middle        Children of the Middle Waters, the 800 and some pages. It is  extraordinary. He recognized, I think he says at some point, no one else  could have done it or ever will do it. He   s right about that, not just about  the Osages but that he was a person who lived at a certain period of time  of deep transition, enormous transition, even just in his own life, not to  mention in the history of the Osages. When he talks about the  technological revolutions of the twentieth century and that kind of  thing   he knew the Little Old Men. He knew their sons who often did  not have that knowledge from the older time passed on to them. He  knew their grandchildren. He wrote a book that goes from basically the  beginning of Osage time or before to the time he was writing.  I   ve never read or seen anything quite like it. I   m not a historian, so I  can   t say everything in it is accurate and theoretically sound, but I think  that, other than what Terry Wilson has done, is probably the definitive  history of the Osages still. I   m not sure how much it   s taught. I wish that  I knew that it were taught more. I think Talking to the Moon is   that   s  the one I was going to talk about. It   s probably taught in a lot of classes  about nature writing and that kind of thing. My guess is that the Marland  biography is not taught that much, even though it   s probably read  particularly by people who are interested in the oil industry and the  beginning of the oil industry, but I haven   t heard about if people talk  about that one in terms of teaching it in a college classroom. It would be  very interesting, though, to take that one on.  In your opinion, what is the current state of Native American literature  studies?  I wouldn   t call it a state. (Laughter) I would call it a dynamic. It is  changing. It is vibrant. It   s thriving. It   s so prolific that it   s hard to keep  up with. There are a lot of twenty-first century writers who I have yet to  acquaint myself with. It   s an exciting community to be a part of. I teach  two courses at Illinois State: one that I just sort of recreated, Survey of  American Literature, and then the Introduction to Native American  26  Studies. I also teach one  Native American Literature course  that   s  more for English majors. I   m sort of reformulating it as a history of  American Indian literature, rather than   I   ve been doing it as a mostly  Ojibwe literature just to focus in on one particular tribal group.  What I would like to see in Native American studies today is more  attention to the past works and to the, from at least the end of the  eighteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century so that we  understand both the written canon and the oral   it   s hard to call it  exactly a canon, but the set of oral discourses that come into late  twentieth and early twenty-first century Native literature. That   s partly  my bent because I teach nineteenth century literatures. I   m very  interested in seeing more people look into the past. I think in some ways,  I   m kind of going against the grain there because I think one of the very  legitimate criticisms about Native American studies has been so many  people looking at the past and not paying attention to the present-day  and living Native Americans. I wouldn   t want to detract attention from  that, either, but I tend to be a kind of a historically minded person in all  of what I do.  I want students, especially students who are not Native, to know how  much there is on this continent that, first of all, long precedes any  European presence and what was going on after contact in terms of the  interactions among discourses. It is very hard to get at that because a lot  of the stuff that   s in your American scripts, that   s a very, very small part  of what   s actually going on on the ground. I think that where the  dynamic is right now is attempting to make our college students and  high school students aware of the living presence of Native Americans  in our country and to help them understand that. One of the things that I  thought was interesting this week, since it   s Supreme Court Week, was  the very little-mentioned case about the Native American child who was  adopted and the Indian Child Welfare Act came in and how the Supreme  Court decided that. I   m really disappointed at our media. Almost  everywhere I looked, (I won   t name networks, but various networks)  various television programs gave only the side of the story that was  about the non-Native  adoptive  parents, gave no understanding or very  little understanding of the Indian Child Welfare Act, had no  comprehension of how out-adoption has affected Native communities.  I think Mathews was interesting because he was concerned about people  who weren   t preserving their own history. A couple times he says,    Why  do I bother?    He feels like other people aren   t trying with him. He was  also very dedicated to present day issues. Throughout the whole  Termination Era, he is trying to make sure that Washington is doing the  right thing and the tribe   s voice is heard. He   s not making a choice  between remembering the past and being involved in the present. He  27  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  sees them as all of a piece. I wish that there were more. I think it   s  growing. I think that we   re getting there, but I see too little in our  colleges and universities about Native American studies, which, as   Craig  Womack and, I think, Robert Warrior and a couple other people  have said, they ought to be the foundation. They ought to be the first  thing that we learn about, rather than the afterthought.  The next question was future outlook, so do you have anything else to  add about that, as far as Native American studies    future outlook?  Oh, the future outlook of Native American studies, oh.  Native American studies, Native American literature.  The future outlook is that there are a lot of projects to do. There are a lot  of things. Hopefully we   ll have people working on them who have  standing to work on     I think I   ve read that one of the reasons that there isn   t more happening  is that we don   t have enough Native American students that are pursuing  the higher education degrees to move into the academy, to help us  develop these. Would you agree with that?  Do you mean we don   t have enough people going from K-12 into the  universities or not enough people from   .  Not enough Native Americans that are choosing to go into higher  education and pursue graduate degrees and move into the academy.  There   s a lot of historical underpinnings to that, of course, to recognize  that aspect of it with education in America and the history there.  That   s an interesting question I   m not sure I   m totally qualified to  answer. Partly, my perspective is different because I will see the students  who are pursuing graduate studies, but I also see roadblocks. People  have talked in literature   I think Devon Mihesuah has talked about  when Native American students want to go into graduate studies or into  higher education, they would very much like to have a position in a  tribal area, for example, but our academy is set up very antithetical to  that.  For example, the position I am in at the university is American  Literature from 1870 to 1920. That   s my technical hire, not Iroquois  studies, for example, which is what I came to the university with the  most understanding of when I was first hired. Most of the student body  is not going to gravitate, especially in Illinois for example, where we  have no reservations, no significant tribal presence. We have a presence  28  Neurohr  Kalter  here in Chicago from the Termination and Relocation Era. Most of the  student body is not going to come to a class that   s labeled Iroquois  Studies or Osage Studies or what have you, or etcetera. I think that what  I see is a lot of graduate students but maybe not a lot of professors.  My guess, though, is that you   re right. Whereas I see a lot of graduate  students who are coming from Native communities, just because I have  my attention out, especially to places like University of Illinois at  Urbana or University of Oklahoma who are building programs to foster  those students, you   re probably right that the number of students coming  in is fairly low and that Native American students have their attention  taken, as all of our students do, by things other than literature and  history. Healthcare and nursing and economic development and those  sort of urban or rural planning, or those kinds of things, those are needs  that tribes and urban communities have.  I think it   s also, especially for the humanities, we   re competing, so-called,  (I don   t think it   s really competition) against lots of different  needs, so it   s kind of a difficult thing. I said that I had been at the Native  American Student Advocacy Institute back when I was doing this  research and trying to understand how to support Native American  students, especially on historically white campuses. It   s very difficult,  especially in a place like Illinois because there are other competing  projects out there when it comes to that. Trying to hire somebody in,  say, student services who has an expertise with working with Native  American students, that   s another need, I think, of a lot of campuses that  sometimes gets fulfilled and sometimes doesn   t. I think it   s hard for  some universities to understand how Native American students may  need different kinds of support from other minority students, African  American students, or what have you, especially if they don   t live in a  place where they see a big population.  Just for the record, too, I think along with all of this would be the  recognition that not all Native American students are alike, of course.  Not all Native American students have had the same experience, and  they haven   t all come in to higher education from living and growing up  on a Reservation and a very insulated community and background.  There   s a lot of differences there.  Yes. I don   t want to talk on tape about the people I know, but I  absolutely agree with what you   re saying, that there are a lot of different  backgrounds and they all need to be supported. They   re not  necessarily   for an institution trying to support those students... It   s not  necessarily predictable what you   re going to need until you meet that  student. With our very small Native American studies faculty, what we  try to do is to work with people as we meet them and try to get support  29  Neurohr  Kalter  under them, starting with the contact with the professor in the classroom  or perhaps a peer, if that   s possible, or what have you, and then work  from there. Sometimes, you know, with many of the students that I   ve  had, it   s like they   re supporting me because they know a lot more about  their tribe or about wherever it is that they   ve grown up than I do.  They   re often teaching me about,    What about this pedagogy? How   s  that working for you?    (Laughter)  We are down to probably the last three questions of the interview, so  we   ll go back now to Twenty Thousand Mornings. I wanted to ask you if  you have a favorite section of it and if you would like to read a little bit  of a favorite section, perhaps?  Yes. I love so many parts of this book, but I think, and I was saying to  you before the interview started, certainly I don   t want to read this  section because it   s the one that makes me cry. The one that I find most  touching or memorable starts on 142, and it   s about Mathews going  home when his father is dying. I   m going to read up until perhaps the  point where I might not be able to continue. The part I   m probably not  going to get to, which I think is very delightful, is when he talks about  the Big Hills,    riding up our dusty hill,    on page 145 and singing to the  picture of his father in front of his mother, and the gesture she makes. It  would have been futile, except for the fact that she never makes it, and  then she laughs at herself. That part I also love. I   m going to read just  the beginning of  page  142 because it   s also about empathy from a  person who doesn   t naturally display it. He says:  I went out for freshman basketball, but one March night my sister  Josephine called over the telephone to tell me that our father was  dying.  There were no cars on the campus, only a few Fords called     jitneys    running on shuttle from the campus to the center of the  town and back. There were a few horse-drawn hacks for hire; as a  matter of fact I had arrived in one from the inter-urban station,  when I came to the University.  My fraternity brothers felt the drama of the situation, and they  got McIntyre, the livery stable man to come out and pick me up to  take me to the inter-urban. They had got him out of bed, and he was  unhappy, drowsy and surly.  As we clop-clopped in the hack to the inter-urban, he seemed  suddenly to realize that after all this call must be very important,  since we were in the midnight hours, and the surliness had left his  face as I paid him. He was especially helpful about the luggage, a  thing he was not noted for.  He said,    I hope it ain   t nothin    too bad.        My father,    I said. He became clumsily apologetic in manner  30  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  only; he said nothing.  The family had sent a team to meet me at Nelagony, the  junction of the casual Midland Valley Railroad, whose roadbed was  so new and wavy that the locomotive   s bell tinkled periodically on  its own, in mild hesitant protest, and the important Missouri, Kansas  and Texas road.  It was about four in the morning when I arrived at the house,  and my sister Josephine was alone, the nurse having gone to sleep.  She came to me without tears and with no sign of her accustomed  dramatics, and said:    He is afraid of coma, and he wanted to   to     to, I guess, say goodbye.     We stood and looked at each other for some time, and then for  the first time the beauty of soul that neither one of us had ever been  aware of in the jealousy-dominated spoiled child, for the moment  was ascendant in the young woman.  I had a short talk with my father about the things we usually  talked about     This is where I   m going to start to lose it.     then the nurse came in to tell me it was time to go. My father  frowned and said,    Why does it hafta be this way?    He plucked at  his sheet, then said,    Why can   t a man die like a man, and not like a  baby?    He shook a fist at the nurse: a gesture that was mock anger  and at the same time evidence of dissipating control.  We waited. As we waited I recalled incidents of my boyhood  and my father   s association with them, and suddenly I was shocked  to realize that he was almost fifty when I was born, and he was in  his sixties when we camped and slept under the Indian wagon, deer  and turkey hunting. He was in his sixties when we hunted behind  the bird dogs, and shot plover on the wing, and when he, himself  hauled the Samaris to Salt Creek and drove back on the running  gear of the wagon. We were both impossible as fishermen, but we  tried, usually going fishing during the time that some game bird was  in season, even when we took mother and my younger sisters to  camp with us.  Before the final coma, he said,    I   ve had the horses taken to  pasture, Son.     Very powerful.  My students would be shocked that I didn   t lose it. (Laughter)  Is that a passage that you read to them in class?  No, I actually have not taught this in class yet. My round of courses is  31  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  before this era, so I   m trying to figure out where to work this in.  Interestingly, I told some people on a committee about this passage  because we were having a discussion about (what do you call them?)  bereavement policies for students at universities. Someone I perceive to  be a little bit lacking in empathy about the need for them, so I mentioned  this passage and said,    Maybe we should think about this,    especially  the part afterwards where he has to stay at home to take charge of the  finances with his mother. Professors can be very cynical about    My  XYZ died, and I have to go home.       My grandmother died,    that excuse,  they can be very cynical about it. I was, frankly, cynical about it when I  first read the policy, but then I thought about this passage. Sometimes  there are things going on in our students    lives that we don   t know. We  don   t realize how adult they   re being asked to behave. I think that   s an  example.  How should John Joseph Mathews be remembered?  (Laughter) I   m laughing because I don   t know if I should have the  responsibility to answer that question.  Let   s narrow it down. What is one way that he should be remembered?  What is one way, okay. This must be it because it made me smile. What  I love is this other passage that I quoted in my introduction (I don   t  know if I can find it quickly) where he has gotten a rejection for the  autobiography. He says other people might be driven to suicide. Here we  go. It   s on  page  twenty-five of the introduction.  If one were really a dedicated writer, this sudden impression of  dullness would make one very unhappy; perhaps in some cases  almost suicidal   . As for me, the Philistine, non-writer, I should  have liked to saddle a horse and lope across the prairie into the  goddamned wind of Just-Doing-That-Moon.  (Laughter) I think that Mathews should be remembered as somebody  who didn   t take writing so seriously that he didn   t live his life or neglect  other things that were important to him. In fact, for probably ten years  when he was on the Tribal Council, he in many ways neglected writing  for the sake of doing something political that he thought was quite  important. I think that   s a good way to remember him is that he had a  round, full life where writing was a part of it. The writing that he did is  more significant, as I also say, than I think a lot of people realize or have  ever been introduced to. In many cases, people don   t even know who he  is. Just the books that were published during his lifetime are incredible  books.  32  Neurohr  Kalter  He never was out of perspective about them. Even when he is reading  them over and over again to himself because he loves the sound of his  own words, he   s never out of perspective about where writing fits into  the larger scheme of things. You can   t let it take your life over. You  can   t let it be so important that it makes you despair because you   ve got  a lot of other things that are enjoyable that you could be doing, and he  did them. He made life the priority, rather than making just writing the  priority. I think that   s how I would like to remember him, as somebody  who teaches me that when I read him that, you know, there is a lot of  other stuff going on in your life and it   s hard to tell what   s the most  important at any one point in time.  Can you talk any about any of your upcoming research writing projects  over Mathews    works?  Sure. I think I said this, (I don   t remember if we were on tape or not)      but I   m hoping to bring out the short stories that are in the archive.  Wonderful in two totally different ways. Maybe not totally different, but  wonderful in different ways. One set is a very fascinating children   s  book all around characters, coyotes, cougars, sand hill cranes. I would  really love to see that one in print. He tried to get it in print in the early  1960s right after The Osages was published. Again, I think as with the  autobiography, he was sending it to the wrong people. My guess is (it   s  hard to trace this) I think the diary is kind of going   in other words, it   s  not in the diary what he does, but I   m guessing that he just gives up and  maybe sends the stuff to his grandchildren or something because that  was his first audience for that book, anyway.  Then there   s also a really intriguing set of short stories that he wrote  because he needed money in the 1940s. They are so varied, I wouldn   t  even begin to describe any of them. I think they help us understand a  different dimension of Mathews that (I say a little bit about this in the  introduction) couldn   t be pre-packaged into a kind of stereotype. I have  a feeling that may be partly why they were never published during his  lifetime because so many of the books that he sold were sold because of  his Osage identity, rather than simply his writing skill. In the short  stories, I think because all of the themes are so varied, you have to look  at him again in this kind of larger picture of who he was as a person, as  opposed to,    I   m just a writer,    you know, what I was just saying about  that. I   d love to see those two (I hope it   s just two) volumes published  because I think they give us a picture, also, of him.  It   s always interesting to look at people who are known for longer works  and to see their short works and what they do. I think you asked about  his writing techniques. I   m not really sure exactly how I would describe  it, but he   s got a sense of humor in his short story writing that is about  33  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  Neurohr  Kalter  mocking in certain way, mocking our culture, mocking the way we look  at things, and the way we look to other people even though we   re not  conscious of it. I   d love to have people see and experience that, read  that, hear it, so to speak, in their heads. I keep coming back to the word  snide, but I don   t think that   s quite the right descriptor. He   s always both  understanding of somebody and at the same time mocking them, sort of  trying to get them to step a little bit out of their skin for a minute and see  how ridiculous they   re being, or what have you. I   d like to see that.  Is there anything else you would like to add?  No, except for: Read John Joseph Mathews. It   s an experience, and  you   ll be changed when you do. (Laughter)  Okay, thank you so much for participating in the interview and this  project. We really appreciate it.  It   s funny to think of myself as part of an oral history. (Laughter)  Well, you are.  Who knew? (Laughs)  -------  -------
