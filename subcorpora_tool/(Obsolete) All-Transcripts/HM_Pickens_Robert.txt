Story_ID: 56015
Speaker 1: I've got five "People Magazine"-ish type questions, questions I need to ask you.  The first one is, they just require short answers.  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food, rice.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: All right.  And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, not particularly.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I really like the winter.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh boy, let me just think about it for half a second.  I think it was Eleanor Roosevelt said for you to-"for someone to make you feel inferior means that you've given them the liberty to do that."  And I think that which, in essence is, know you are the master for your own fate.  You determine how you project yourself.  You determine how people perceive of you.
Story_ID: 56016
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were born in 1943 in Chicago [Illinois].  Could you tell us what you know about the background of your--well, first, the names of your mother and father and could you state them and then spell them.  Tell us something about your mother and father and your background.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Sarah Stampley, S-A-R-A-H, S-T-A-M-P-L-E-Y.  My father's name was Nathaniel Pickens, spelled the same as mine, N-A-T-H-A-N-I-E-L, P-I-C-K-E-N-S.  My father was from Alabama, my mother was from Mississippi.  Both of them worked.  My father was a spring setter.  My mother was a housekeeper for private families and also for hotel chains during her (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they--did either one of them talk about their grandparents or life in Mississippi or Alabama?
Speaker 2: As they got older, they would talk a little bit about it.  They talked about Mississippi. It was interesting because I believe the name of the place is called Stampley Station, Mississippi, kind of reverse society.  The African-Americans were in control, political strength, economic strength; and the white cousins were people who worked with them, in conjunction with them. So, that was kind of fascinating.  And I've a quest.  I want to go to Stampley Station, Mississippi, and see this for myself or-- and then I'd prevail, as (unclear) did when she was a child, but it would be, I think, an interesting experience.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, I've, heard of Mound Bayou [Mississippi] as an all-black town (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: --black-controlled town in Mississippi (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: --Stampley Station (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as well.
Speaker 2: Where is Stampley Station located?
Speaker 1: I think it's up near--is it northeast, northwest Mississippi.  I'm--I'd have to ask my cousin, who also is a Stampley.  He's more familiar with it than I am.  And this is a recent desire.  It wasn't anything.  It wasn't existing for a long time, but as you grow older, you become more interested in trying to find out more about your family basis.
Speaker 2: Have you ever been there?
Speaker 1: Have I been to Stampley Station?  No, but I've been to Jackson [Mississippi].  We have a strong family there.  That was about the only place I've gone in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Does your mother have any stories about Stampley Station?
Speaker 1: No. Naw.
Speaker 2: And with a town named Stampley Station and their name being Stampley, did her ancestors have anything to do with the founding of the town?
Speaker 1: I would imagine they did.  There wasn't--there was not a lot discussion about family history.  But I guess really the challenges--the day-to-day challenges didn't really allow us to sit down and talk about that. We moved around a little bit, so there's never really any real in-depth discussions about the history of the family. And the quest for that information and the desire for it only came in recent years as I got older.
Speaker 2: So there's some work to be done.
Speaker 1: Mm-mm.
Story_ID: 56017
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your father [Nathaniel Pickens], he's from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Alabama.  I know very little about his family.  I don't--Birmingham area.  I don't think he had any brothers or sisters.  As far as I recall any discussion, no mention of brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: Did--so did he have any stories about how he came to Chicago [Illinois]?  Your father or your mom [Sarah Stampley](unclear) or either one of them had stories about how they end (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, my father and mother were estranged, (unclear) that was an interesting experience at about four years old and they separated.  I have an 80-year-old aunt who's full of stories, you know, talks about, you know, the father that they had, who left and came to Chicago, and ultimately the mother sent them to Chicago to find a better way of life.  You know, not too untypical of many of the African-American families that have traveled from the South to the North, looking for brighter futures, greater opportunities.  So, I'd say we were about average in that, in that quest.  So it's not anything unusual.  It was no striking of gold or anything like that. It was just--it was a need to move to the next step and try to enhance their lifestyles.
Speaker 1: Do you have a story about how your mother and father met?
Speaker 2: Never was discussed.  I was too young, really, real young when they left.  And then after they separated, there was very little discussion regarding my father in the household.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did your father, like, leave the household?  Did you wind up with your mother or (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I was with my mother, yes.  She remarried. We moved to Evanston [Illinois]. And my stepfather, Robert Wilson, raised me.  And I--as I grew older, I learned to love him as a father, so the only father I ever knew.  And he's a wonderful man.
Story_ID: 56018
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.  So can you give me some of the ideas of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  There was Foster Field [Chicago, Illinois], which was a playground about half a block away, and I recall fairly vividly the farm league for the Negro League, Baseball League.  You know, they had a team called The Flashers, which were all African-American baseball players, and Delbert Williams was the coach, and a guy named--I don't remember all the guys that played. But that stands out vividly in my mind.  Bobby Crenshaw, the bass player, he was friends with one of my buddy's brother who was a piano player and had the Doberman Pinscher which attacked me (laughter).  I remember that vividly.  They would trade the houses and not be able to move, but I survived it. (Pause)  Northwestern University in Evanston [Illinois], you know, I was a young African-American kid.  You walk by and see these huge buildings and wonder if you'll--would be able to get into anything like that.  I'd say one of the most memorable stories is the Lord's Department Store, went and looked for a job and the guy says, "No.  I don't think you'd be able to be successful."  And then turn, I go to Sears and become national sales manager-national buyer; matched up for hire, write for the chairman of the board, travel all over the world for the company for eighteen years.  And you know you stand back and you reflect upon those experiences, not angrily, just saying that, you know, you beat the odds.  You know, you went to another step.  So, that's what I spent my whole life, the whole time, beating the odds, and I kind of relish it, the challenges.
Speaker 1: When were the odds that were stacked against you? When you were young?
Speaker 2: Oh, the odds of being a little fat, scaredy-cat guy who was not very assertive and going to high school; 5 feet 6, 5 feet 7, 270 pounds, trying to be a bully and running into a little Syrian guy named Melias (ph) says, "If you're so tough, come on out for wrestling," and that was the beginning. That was the beginning.  And from that point forward, things started falling into place for me as a person.
Speaker 1: What kind of--you said you were like a fraidy cat?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  They used to--they used to--they used to mess with me.  So after my freshman high school [Evanston Township High School], a guy named Eddie Akins came up to me.  He says--they used to call me Big Bobby because I had a cousin that--who was small.  They call--it's reigning the hallways of Foster Field.  Eddie Akins says, "Big Bobby, I need 50 cents."  I looked in his eyes and said, "The days of 50 cents are all over."  He said, "Aw, man.  I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding."  And I guess I earned the respect from my achievements in sports and treated them with great humility of never trying to push you in front of anything else, always focused on education and trying to be humane to people.  So I never was a-- even though I had been bullied, I never bullied.  And that--those are the kind of experiences that I've kind of gone through.
Speaker 1: But before that time--before that time, you were picked on?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I was chased home.  One time I got chased in the house and jumped on me.  And I said, ultimate-- that is an ultimate embarrassment to be beat up in your own house.  But, again, I was--it was one of the many experiences as I chocked up as experience.  And most guys I've grown up and looked at and deal with, again be friendly with, and respectful of and never treating them in any, any disparaging way.  So I didn't feel as though I had any, any of them--that is, achieve or engage in.  I just thought that through my accomplishments, I could, you know, complement my family and my culture and my community; and hopefully, you know, it'll give some incentive to some other child or some other kid who may have had the similar type background and let them know that there are opportunities if you push for it, not give up. So, that's pretty much been the basis for my character.
Story_ID: 56019
Speaker 1: Um-um.  So, who all lived in your household when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Oh, man. Who lived in the household?  The roomers lived upstairs.  You remember the roomers.  Those are the ones who had the choice rooms and paid rent to your parents [Sarah Stampley and Robert Wilson].  I had a grandmother [Rose Stampley], I had one aunt and uncle on my father's side.  And had five kids, I don't know how we did it to this day, but they all lived there.  I had an uncle, Uncle Henry Eskridge, you know, that used to drive a gorgeous little turquoise blue ford, that stayed polished and sat in front of the house, would hardly move.  You know it was my mother and stepfather.  I have a brother [Errol Wilson] and I have a sister [Rosa Cannon].  I never knew what my own personal, private, personal bedroom was until I was in college almost, because we had a house by day.  It was all beds at night. And then  also we had a honky-tonk, I mean we, at night we'd close  down, and turn the juke box on and some barbecue, beer, whiskey, and you know, supplement the income.  Yeah, it was a real live honky-tonk.  You know, piano playing, whopping, hollering, you know.  It was (laughter), but you know you learn how to close on and off because my door was closed, and I slept in the living room, in the let out couch, you know, for most of my life.  And, it didn't, you know, I never looked at angrily.  I looked at it as my parents were doing the best that they could do.  And, even though I didn't have a lot of things, and as much to the other kids had or I wasn't socially active with a lot of the kids because I was trying to focus on education. While I was focusing, I had no idea sis that I had that interest in sports and education because I found, I think a level playing field in both of those arenas.  I did okay in school, you know.  I was a 'B' student, C+ student, liked Literature, liked classical music, all my life.  It's kind of like doing the unusual things that were unusual to my group of kids or my culture.  Wrestling, football, track, all those things were team building experiences, you know, can be, oh just so many opportunities to interact with people and I never would have done that with.
Speaker 1: Did you play an instrument?
Speaker 2: I tried the trumpet, I tried the saxophone, I tried the drums.  You know the typicals, you know, you think you want to do it and then you get into it and find out that you don't have the talent or the skill.
Speaker 1: Give any good stories about the juke joint (unclear) in your house.
Speaker 2: Oh, no shootings, and no cutting (laughter). It was just a lot, a lot of noise, you know on the weekends, especially.   And used to make hot tamales back in the pantry; you know, best barbecue in the city.  They, (pause) I think that the experiences are more subliminal than visual, because I heard it was more from the auditory expense.  I wasn't allowed to be in that environment, I wasn't allowed to be physically present. You know, I, the next morning I would go through or before they would set up shop, and you know, sell the barbecue, beer, and play the juke box.  But I was never really physically involved from a visual stand point.
Speaker 1: Was it easy for you all to make ends meet?  You know from this activity?
Speaker 2: Mm, mm.  My parents [Sarah Stampley and Robert Wilson] worked, where they didn't have fancy things.  I think they were leveraged just like everybody else, you know.  I think my dad made about $5,000.00 a year.  My mother may have made $4,000.00 and that was back in the '60's [1960s] so you know that was not a whole lot of money. It was more, as even less, it was much less than today, but it was a whole lot, you know.  But we were able to make ends meet.  You know, we had a car every now and then.  So...
Speaker 1: Mm, um.
Speaker 2: My dad, my stepfather [Robert Wilson] worked steadily.
Story_ID: 56020
Speaker 1: Did you have any mentors in school?  Can you name the school you went to?
Speaker 2: Evanston Township High School.
Speaker 1: What grade school?
Speaker 2: Foster Elementary and Haven Junior High.  I had two memorable experiences.  One in grammar school taught me honesty and truthfulness, which I've, you know, steadfast by all my life.  And then in high school I was taught to accept the challenge and not give up and not say no, you know, to anything that come to pray.
Speaker 1: And what was the incident in grade school?
Speaker 2: We used to line up in a circle in a gym so that the gym teacher had to go out of the gym for a minute or what have you.  And then pandemonium broke out.  He came back and everybody jumped back in place.  He says: "Who was making noise?"  Everybody stood there.  "So, I give you one more chance, who was making noise?"  So I stepped down said, "I was."  He says the rest of you guys run around the gym twenty times. Honestly (chuckle).  And simple basic, basis for my existence is to be honest and fair.  High school, I was a freshman in high school and we were in the book line and I says six, I was 5'7, about 270 pounds, I was huge and absolutely huge.  And I was in line and I was pushing up to the front.  This little Syrian guy named Melias George, who may have been about 33 years old saw me push.  He says "what you doing?" I said I'm going to the front line.  He says: "I don't think you're going nowhere."  He says you so tough.  I said I'm, I'm flex, flexing fat, I guess (laughter).  He says "if you're so tough, he says you come on out for wrestling."  I didn't play football my first year because I had a heart murmur, and the doctor, Dr. Elizabeth Hill she was not, she just thought wrestling was tussling around but actually wrestling is extremely, extremely difficult.  So I went out for wrestling in November, I mean late October.  I lost 70 pounds and I grew four inches inside of about four months, and I wrestled on the varsity team, I became the state champion.  I was a runner up, I was on the Olympic team [1964] as a wrestler.  And at the end of the Olympics, I kind of closed my career down because there were not many avenues available to you then.  I did get one offer though to wrestle pro.  Three hundred dollars a night, pay your own expenses, I said, "I don't think I want to do that" (laughter).  I had a family and I said, "that's not anything I really want to engage in."  So I just didn't pursue that.
Story_ID: 56021
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, when you were, are there any memories from grade school [Foster Elementary] you want to share with us?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  There was, I think her name was Mrs. Flint, Mrs. Flint still could not crush my spirit as a third grader, I was fairly talkative.  So what Mrs. Flint did to me was I think the absolute insult to intelligence.  She put me behind the piano for three quarters of the year.  I sat behind the piano in her room. Whereas, I would come to class with everybody else, I'd have to go sit behind the piano and I'm not accessing any type of education, any type of stimulus.  And at the end of that third grade, I flunked.  Obviously, if you can't this space (unclear), you flunk.  And I remember as I came, (laughter) I was right there in the school, so when school was out, and you know, everybody knows who flunks.  And I remember it was like, came by the house, kids and their little chant: "Bobby flunked, Big Bobby flunked, lah, lah, lah."  And probably you know, it had an impact upon, it did have an impact upon me.  I didn't know what it was.  But again, it probably not from a household stand point, because it was not a lot of reading, not a lot of intellectual exchange, it was just you know basic working people who were good.  Some little voice down inside said: "you cannot give up," so I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you have to repeat the third grade?
Speaker 2: Um, mm.
Speaker 1: And, second time around, I guess was a better experience than the first time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, much better.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so she had you sit next to the piano to, to (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Behind the piano.
Speaker 1: Just because you liked to talk? (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Talked.
Story_ID: 56022
Speaker 1: Was there a mix of students in the class [Foster Elementary], or?
Speaker 2: No, it was all black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All African-American.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you basically grew up in a black neighborhood in Evanston [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, absolutely.  It was the lines of demarcation were very clear, very, very clear.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean there was, oh,(unclear) the first time, we came in contact with white kids as classmates was in junior high, Haven Junior High School because it was run from North Evanston and Central Evanston where most of the African Americans lived.  And that's where, additional exposures, you know; art, play, theatre.  I remember (laughter) so one great experience; one night I went to a play without telling my mother [Sarah Stampley] and I got home about 11:00 o'clock.  I may have been like 12 or 13.  I walked in the house, I mean, what excuse you gone give.  "I went to see a play."  She was ironing and I remember like it was the other day.  She pulled the ironing cord out and chastised me.  But, again there was one of those situations where subconsciously I says "I like art and I like play and I'm not gonna be pushed away because I got a spanking for doing something I should not have done."  And after that point and time, I've always called my parents and 11:30, "I'm a little late and now here's where I am," and I'd be where I said I was at.  And it was all cool.  I never had a real, real difficult time with my parents, going through high school.  It was more, they were amazed at the types of things that I was engaged in.  You know, they'd love to go to the sporting contest and my mother loved the wrestling, because of the personal, you know, the personal aspect of it.  The personalization of your relationship with that guy on the mat.  You know, it was, my just seeing my mano to mano and best friend would win.  And she was there, rooting and hollering, jumping there with the other mothers.  My dad [Robert Wilson] worked most of the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, by the time you get into high school, you seemed like you were really engaged in a lot of activities.
Speaker 2: Primarily, sports.  But I still focused in the classroom.  I liked, I liked music appreciation.  I have a fairly keen ear for music.  You can play one, one note and I can usually tell what the song is, particularly if it's a classic.  If it's Brahms, Chopin, and things like that. You know I am a 6'4, over 300 pound guy, so you know think of me as a guy that has a pension for classic music, but I love it, 98.7 [WFMT-FM in Chicago, Illinois].  My seven-year-old grandson also has a tremendous ear for classical music and jazz, at seven.  He'd rather listen to that, than listen to the other stuff when we're travelling together.  So, I got to high school [Evanston Township High School], it was a, another awakening.  It was another level of challenge because, you know, there were four tiers of educa..., four tiers of powers; your freshman, sophomore, and you had, and you go through the stages.  And you earn your right to be and, you know, to be in the front line; you earn your right to sit at the table and all the others.  So it started teaching you that you had to go through some process to get to wherever you're want to get to.  And, I think it was in high school, was it high school, or was it college?  I sat down and wrote a list of things that I wanted to do the rest of my life.  I've accomplished just about every one of them, and I think I have accomplished every one of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm, mm.
Speaker 1: Did you do something you kind of developed on your own?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Somebody inspire you, in doing? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No, just a little bird: "chirp, chirp", (laughter) said sit down, write down what you want to do and I said I did it.  And, you know, God hass blessed me to be able to accomplish them.
Speaker 1: And, so have you always been concerned about planning and.......
Speaker 2: I plan appropriately.  I'm not a fanatic for planning.  Sometime, I'll procrastinate to almost to the end, but never to the end.  I always am able to, find the right, appropriate time to put the plan in place.
Story_ID: 56023
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, just to go back from then to the task of music, how did you become interested in classical music?
Speaker 2: Because of Evanston [Township] High School, they had a class called Music Appreciation.
Speaker 1: That was basically,
Speaker 2: That was basically Rachmaninoff, Chopin, Brahms, Handel, all those guys, and Mozart.
Speaker 1: Did you have a good teacher?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was in a large class, so it wasn't like it was personalized.  But, again it was a wond.., new exposure to me because, I didn't know anything about classical music.  WGES, I believe was the station of choice back then, which is WVON today, I believe, if I remember the transition, yeah.
Story_ID: 56024
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what was your social life like in [Evanston Township] High School?
Speaker 2: I never went on a date until I was nineteen years old, (laughter).  I didn't, didn't, I was bashful, shy.  I think I was a decent looking guy, good looking guy, I was built extremely well.  I worked very, very hard at my physical powers, but I had focused on sports and education.  I wasn't really interested in, you know, chasing girls and things like that.  A real small friend basis as I have now, you know, a very private person.  She don't ask for and ain't gone tell you (laughter).  I think that all the things that God has allowed me to do were things that he allowed me to do is not anything for me wait, to ask for or try to use to compromise situations.  But, I'll share my experiences and, you know, help anybody accomplish what they want to accomplish if it is in the realm of what I have the capacity to do.
Story_ID: 56025
Speaker 1: Okay, now.  Yeah, talk about these pants again.
Speaker 2: Well, the dress were sport coat, and slacks, white shirt.  I didn't have the pants.  So, my mother took a pair of my father's pants and tied them.  I had a sport coat on, so, you know, it was like 90 something degrees, Friday the 13th, 1958.  So, I'm okay, you know, I can get to the thing and you know, I know my dad's pants were on me.  So we get to the stage and just before going out, the coordinator says I got great news for you since it's so hot, you don't have to wear your sport coats.  I says, "Wow, how am I going to handle this?"  I handled it and it was just another challenge, it was just something you had to go inside yourself and hold on to and not be impacted on how people responded to you or perceived of you, or laughed or what have you, because they were cruel, kids are cruel.
Speaker 1: So, your parents actually tied up the?
Speaker 2: They were tied in the back with a piece of rope.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (laughter)  My dad was a huge man, I mean, was (unclear) do I and kind of, I got through the day, I got through the day and went on. And in high school, mostly experiences were good.  I was an accomplished athlete and I did well educationally.  I had to make some decision, I think, one decision is that I had a literature test on Monday, and I had an offer to go to the University of Washington.  Which one you think I did?
Speaker 1: The literature test?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I chose, I said, "Forget the trip."  So, I've always kind of, I think I've kind of focused on the things that are important for my continued growth; not necessarily for my enjoyment at this point and time.
Story_ID: 56026
Speaker 1: Okay. We're rolling again, I wanted to-- you're at high school [Evanston Township High School], I guess when we, as you were approaching graduation, what was going on?  You were wrestling, you were playing football? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Track, football, track.  I was a three sport letter person, I was Athlete of the Year in 1961.  I got an untold number of offers of college education.  I chose Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison], as the school to go to.  It was, but also, you know, being, I was a year older than most of the kids.  And I kind of had some social experiences at that would lead into marriage.  (laughter) And I remember I sat my mother down.  I could sit here Larry, "I says momma, I'm going to tell you something." "She says what?"  "I'm a get married, and she said "What you say?" I said I'm a get married.  I was dating a girl two, three years older than I was.  She said "say that again."  I said I'm a get married.  She says, "I'm going to break your bleep neck if you even approach that."  You're going on to get yourself an education.  So, I didn't get married (laughter).  And I went on to Wisconsin and first year I made the Dean's List.  Second semester I went on probation; third semester, I got, I literally had almost flunked out.  And I appealed, and I got back in.  I had enough credits to play football, so I played as a sophomore and I was a sophomore, preseason, All-American, think this Big Ten sophomore, "Lineman of the Year" in 63, [1963] and the fourth semester, I flunked out.  I mean, I just lost it all.
Speaker 1: Um, mm.
Speaker 2: But again, it was one of those things, that I said this coach, I told you about, Elias George, I called him.  I says, "Elias I'm going down to join the Marines."  He says, "Hold on for a minute.  He says why don't you come home, let's talk this thing out."  So to make a long story real short, I competed in the AU, and competed enough to gain eligibility to compete for the Olympic Team, which I did.  And they sort of turned my life around.  But it was a wildest thing in the world.  This is something I have not told a lot of people.  Now, I am an Olympian [1964], I'm six in the world.  I'm just recently from this high school [Evanston Township High School], so I go back to the high school to talk the superintendent about employment.  And Dr. Lloyd S. Michael, at this long table, you know real stateous table and I go and say "Dr. Michael, I'm back from the Olympics, you know, I want to try and get me a job, you know, and I'd like for you to try and help me."  He said: "Well, Bob," he says, "Swertzoff Construction Company needs a laborer."  Now, this is in October, November.  The Olympics were toward the end of the summer. In September, I said: "Ah naw, I says that's not really what I'm looking....He says: "Well come back in a couple of weeks, and I think I can work something out for you, where you know, you'd be inside or something like that."  I said: "Oh, good."  I came back and he says: "You know, Bob, he says, and he was so adamant about it, "You know I found the perfect job for you."  I said, so I kind of looked, and said "Oh yeah."  I got two years of college. He says, "You know we have a janitor's job open up in our Athletics Department and the job is yours."  I said, "Dr. Michael," I said, "I really don't think that, that's what I really want to do.  I said I really appreciate everything you've done for me and I hope you have a wonderful day.  And I got up and walked out." Not with an angry tone, so I went to work for the city [Evanston, Illinois] in the Forestry Department, for, in between time.

Speaker 1: But, but just a second, I wanted to go back to the [1964] Olympics.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because that's a big deal.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's, it's (simultaneous)......
Speaker 1: I know we want to go forward, but let's go back to the Olympics.  You were (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: The Olympics was a saving grace for me.
Speaker 1: All right.  And even then, the [University of] Wisconsin [Madison] Football team, I think, in those days they were pretty good.
Speaker 2: They were pretty, a very good football team.
Speaker 1: Ron Vander Kelen
Speaker 2: Ron Vander Kelen was the quarterback for (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Lost the Rose Bowl.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and lost the [1963] Rose Bowl to USC [University of Southern California Trojans].
Speaker 1: Did you go?
Speaker 2: No, I was a freshman then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a freshman, so I didn't participate in that one.
Speaker 1: So, that was a big deal.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were a lineman at the University of Wisconsin.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was lineman, linebacker; I was pretty good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And just couldn't adopt to some things, and you know.
Speaker 1: What was the team's record when you were in there?
Speaker 2: I think when we were there, we, we won more than we lost.  We had a pretty good team, pretty good.  And we were on the contingent for the Big Ten.  But, you know, we had a respectable season when I was a sophomore.
Speaker 1: I think for years in Wisconsin, they talked about that team because that's the last time they went (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: That was the last time they went to the Rose Bowl until Barry Alvarez, he was then coach, who was my linebacker at the University of Nebraska [Lincoln, Nebraska].  I went to Wisconsin and Nebraska and I came back to play at Wisconsin on Nebraska's team (laughter).  So, it was kind of really a wild experience.  And Barry Alvarez was my, the middle linebacker for the Nebraska team that I played with, who is now the head coach at the University of Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: What was it like being the athlete of the University of Wisconsin?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was an extreme challenge.  I met a lady named Jane Laster, in my freshman year.  And when we met I was walking down, oh, I can't remember the streets, but she was walking just as arrogantly, and as stateous as an African American sister could, whose parents were middle class, living in New Jersey.  I said, "My name is Bob Pickens."  She says my name is Jane Laster.  My dad's [Thomas Laster] a vice president for IBM.  I said, "My name is Bob Pickens, my mother's a maid." (laughter).  We hit, you know, we kicked back for a couple of years, you know, and it didn't work out.   And Jane went to Africa, I went to Nebraska, probably two similar environments culturally (laughter).  No misgivings about Nebraska, Nebraska gave me a chance to re-gather my thoughts and start to refocus my energies upon education and I--
Story_ID: 56028
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you go to [University of] Nebraska [Lincoln, Nebraska] with kind of a different kind of attitude, you had just gone to the Olympics.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, let's talk about the Olympics.
Speaker 2: Oh, the Olympics were unbelievable, that was the wildest, wildest.  Everyone in Chicago knows [HM] Willye White.  I knew Willye White, she was the lead person, a wonderful lady, and carried herself with dignity. Willie Davenport, unfortunately just passed away, he was on the Olympic Team with me.  Bob Hayes was on the Olympic team with me.
Speaker 1: Bob Hayes was the world's fastest (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: World's fastest human being. George Wilson, from [John] Marshall [Metropolitan] High School, Bill Bradley.  Buster Mathis, who beat Joe Frazier.  Naw, Joe Frazier was on the Olympic team with me. He beat Buster, Buster Mathis broke his hand.  I think Buster beat Joe in the trials.  But because he broke his hand, Joe Frazier was the heavyweight of choice.  It was a cadre of guys, you know, some icons, some sports icons on that team.  Donna De Varona, I remember her.  Mark Spence, yeah he was, wait, I'm trying to remember, was he or not?  But, also, in also all those great experiences, another story I never really told very much. The wrestling team, I got six in the world, which is the highest an American had ever attained in Greco-Roman Wrestling as a heavyweight, period, that was the highest an American had ever achieved.  So, were going through everything, and you know we were scheduled to leave after the closing ceremonies.  We got a note says the wrestling team was going to leave early.  Well, we didn't win any medals, we, you know, six places a plaque.  I--still it was a great plaque.  So, we get on the plane and you know we're flying back and we stopped in some place to refuel.  We land, we're coming into L. A. [Los Angeles, California] And as the guy touches down he says, "I have an announcement."  I said "Oh."  He said:  "When we pull up to the gate, would all the gold medal winners get off on the front and the remaining athletes exit from the rear?"  I said "Welcome to America."  But, again, I said:" Okay."  So I collected my bags, got off, collected my bags went back to Chicago [Illinois].  Again, went through the Dr. [Lloyd S.] Michael experience, so I had two real interesting experiences over a short period of time.  The wrestling experience also was interesting because six years later I was playing football in Canada and they had the World Games.  And a buddy of mine, named Dave Albo, knew I was in Canada say, "Come on Pick, let's go over to the games, and watch some wrestling."  So, I went over and when I walked in, the Russians and the Bulgarians stood up and applauded, and came over to me and hugged me and said: "Oh, Pickens, where you been?"  "How are you?"  That was an absolute memorable occasion.  It was about 4:00 o' clock in the afternoon.  And to be recognized by world class athletes as you approach the venue or enter the venue, is immeasurable.  So, that's put away in the little computer too, you know.
Story_ID: 56029
Speaker 1: Now, was this the first time you ever... The 64 [1964] Olympics were in Tokyo [Japan], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was another first there, too.  Three African-American wrestlers: Charlie Tribble, Bobby Douglas, would become a world renown wrestling coach, myself and in 1964, all three of us wore our hair like this, shaved, I mean we were a sight to behold, you know.  Nobody bothered the wrestlers because we were in our own little world, you know.  But I reached out, I met some, you know, interesting people while I was there. (Laughter) But, it was a great experience, it was just, you know, you can't imagine the feeling of walking into, the, the Olympic Stadium or walking into Olympic (unclear), which in Japanese Olympic Village and seeing all these world class people, you know.  It has, you know a lasting effect, it doesn't stay in front of you the whole time, but you know you are able to reflect upon it, when, you know, like I talk to you.  You think about the temperature.  You think about the people, how nice they were.  I met Madame Butterfly's daughter, I met a gal, lady, young lady, from Australia, named Barbara Fletcher.  We chummed around a little bit, you know, kicked back a little bit, and she was a gymnast.  And we just had, a real, we communicated over several years, and, it just kind of, you know, faded away. But, you, you meet wonderful people, you know.  Everybody's there, you know, you talk about the cream in most cases.   So, that was a, just a, you know, a real wonderful experience.  And it was needed, because remember I'd flunked out of school, and I'm sitting around scratching my head about what am I going to do.  And with the grace of God, I was able to make the Olympic Team and also with the help of this little coach again, because I was a political issue.  I had wrestled and I'd beaten a guy from Toledo [Ohio] named Merrill Sollowen (ph.).  So, I got beat after wrestling him.  And Joe Scalzo, who is a high ranking wrestling official, got his guy invited to the Olympic Camp.  My coach says:  "Woo, wait, wait, wait, naw".........and his glasses flew off. Pitt bull. He jumped right in the middle of the (unclear) and he says, "If he goes, my guy goes too."  And keep in mind, I was not wrestling on an ongoing basis, this was like over the summer and picking up the skills.  And, so I went to the camp and I was fortunate enough to, I was runner up to the freestyle group and I was a champion for Greco-Roman, and then from there on, it just started building.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did you think of Tokyo [Japan]?  Was it your first time out?
Speaker 2: It was my first time, let's see, that was the second plane ride.  I had, well, I had plane rides as a team player on the football team, but that was the first time I was out of the country.  And I've been back since then.  You know I have a small trading company in China and I worked for Sears, and I bought internationally so I had a chance to revisit Tokyo (unclear), the grounds and the different statues that were there, you know, was twenty years later, so, maybe. So Tokyo was just mind boggling, you know just so many people and so many lights and so much script that you can't understand and you say "oh wow."  But it was, again, it's one of those things when you stop to reflect upon, you can see the colors; you can see the people; you can see all those wonderful things that were in place, you know, at that time.
Story_ID: 56030
Speaker 1: Okay. I just want to reflect back on that, and, are there any other stories from the [1964] Olympics that you want to share with us?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Charlie got sent home, Charlie Tribble, one of the African American wrestlers.  Charlie was a beautiful guy, just absolutely beautiful, give you his heart.  But he got beat severely, by, I forget a Bulgar..., oh yeah, by a Bulgarian and he just kind of like mentally lost it.  I mean not literally, but figuratively. And he was to wrestle again, but he went back and he gained 20 pounds in about three days.  And fell away and they sent him home, put him on a plane by himself, sent him home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know how that impacted upon him.  One story I'm going to tell you, it was very interesting about wrestling.  We met a guy named, was his name Jerry Burke.  He wrestled 157.  I may have the weights off, when a guy named Russ-, Wayne Baughman who wrestled one night and he won.  So, they both were wrestling Bulgarians.  So, the Bulgarian coach comes up to our coach and says:  "let's cut a deal."  And, you know, Jerry has one black, Jerry has four black marks; five, you're out.  If you win, you get a black mark.  Wayne has one black mark and they both wres.., and the Bulgarian was just the reverse, in each way.  So the guy says have messed around a little bit and not get pinned, (laughter), being, being swift.  I remember, it's like the other day he says: "Oh, no, that's not the American way."  Well, both Americans got beat. (laughter) But deals go on.  I mean, you know, I'm not saying it's corrupt, but I mean it's a lot of, you know, inside trading I guess you may say, in some of the sports.  I mean but it's just the way of life.  I mean it's not our standards, it's not our principles, but, you know, we're not the majority force, we may be a governing force but when you get into the actual competition, we are fewer the participants as the rest of the world.  So, they do all sorts little deals; that was kind of interesting.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, any other stories from the Olympics?
Speaker 2: Mm, mm, no, not really.  Oh, the ceremony, the parade, walking into the stadium and, you know, it's electrifying.  It's something to just kind of like, you know, just kind of almost collapses you.  You get (unclear).  When you finally assemble in the middle of the field, what the old pros say: "when they let the pigeons go, do not look up," for obvious reasons and that was the case,"boop, boop"; you know, then don't look up.  (laughter)  So, you don't look up.
Speaker 1: That's the other side of the Olympics.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the other side, that's the other side of it.
Story_ID: 56031
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let's go over to [University of] Nebraska [in Lincoln], yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, the Hinto Land?
Speaker 1: Yes.  So, you go from Tokyo to...
Speaker 2: I go to Tokyo [Japan], Evanston [Illinois], on to [Lincoln] Nebraska.  George Kelly, who was an Alex Agase was coach at Northwestern was friend of George Kelly, coach at Nebraska.  And, yeah, I was a decent guy, and my coach was friends with Elias George again.  This guy, this guy is all through my life, okay.  Called Alex, said: "You know, Bob want, give Bob another chance."  So, they got me to Nebraska, I had to work my first semester.  I had to pay my way through, and eventually, I was able to get a scholarship there.  It was, it was a wonderful, wonderful experience.  I was like 21 years old when I went there, so I was a little more mature than most of the guys.  People were, were fairly friendly.  There were people in our class that had never seen a black man, a real live black man in their life.  This is '67 [1967].  I mean I'm serious, they never before, before they came to the University of Nebraska, they'd never seen an African-American male or woman in their life.  They saw them on campus and in my case, the classes I took, were classes of consequence, you know, accounting, finance, stuff like that.  They'd never been in the classroom, or Philosophy.  I always kept my fingers in the Art Program, pending; kind of like, it was a rest list for me from what I was doing.  But, it was just interesting to see their responses to show that you could talk, think, and logical in your approaches.  And I took it, as a teaching experience to some of the people who had never experienced this.  So, I had a little bit on me to try to keep myself in a front row position, which I did.  I graduated in 1969.  I remember when I went to the registrar's office, bursar's office to pay my money.  I said would you send my diploma to my home.  The lady says: "You mean you don't want to walk across the stage."  I said: "Ma'am, this is my seventh year in college."  See, I didn't stop, I kept from '62, [1962]; took breaks and stuff, but, you know for various reasons. And I said: "At 96 degrees I be danged if I'm put a black cap and a black robe and stand out there and die."(laughter)  So, I said: "No, you just send the diploma home."  So, they mailed it home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm, mm.
Story_ID: 56032
Speaker 1: Now, what was the [football] team like when you played for Nebraska?
Speaker 2: We, we had a championship team.  We lost two games, one was Oklahoma [University] and the other was to [University of] Alabama, 1967.  Sugar, was it Sugar, yeah, Sugar Bowl.  I remember that vividly, too.  We had, we'd kicked off to Alabama and they were like on the 35 yard line, going out, the quarterback was Kenny "Snake" Stabler, the receiver was Ray Perkins.  Before we went to the game, the defensive coach, Jim Ross told our linebacker, he says: "The first play from scrimmage, will be a deep fast, go to Ray Perkins."  So, myself and Harry Wilson, a half back, and being Ray, was sitting on the sidelines.  He'd stand up for the first play, but see Snake Stabler, and who rifles out, wham! Ray Perkins zoomed, I turned around to Harry, I said: "Harry, we're in for a long day (laughter). They beat us like 34 to 13, 14.  It was interesting, (laughter), it really was.  I've had all sorts of goofy experiences.  I've been away at games and hotels and some of our, our visiting fans would see me at the door and asked me to take the bags.  They thought I was a doorman.  I'd look at them and says: "No, I'm one of the players on the team.  And, they'd get embarrassed and turn red and all this.  I mean I got my marks when I responded in a polite way, but a very, very deliberate way.  When we were in New Orleans [Louisiana], it was interesting because during the, prior to the game, everybody at the hotels was extremely friendly.  At the end of the game, when it's over, they got to be snappy and somewhat racist in their approach to us, as African Americans, you know, in their facility.  But again, that's life, that's the way it is, you know.  You kind of make those adjustments.  So, if you fall in, you fall to that stuff, then you're operating on someone else's plan, and not yours.  So, all those little juicy experiences have been kind of helpful with me to keep a more of ecumenical attitude toward life.  Today, I operate on a basis of I have a plate that's only so big and in order for you to get on my plate, I have to invite you.  If I get too many people on the plate and I can't have some impact upon what's going on, I reduce it to a saucer.  So, somebody has to go.  And I think all the little experiences in my life have taught me to put things in perspective.  I think God has graced me with skills and talents.  I take them very humbly, I don't take them as anything that I pushed down people's throat.  Remember, I told you early, if you don't ask me, I ain't gonna tell you, that's the way I treat my personal life, my business life, my sports experiences, my political involvements.  I'm just another guy walking the streets here to help and do what has to be done.  So, all those little situations have kind of like taught me to be ecumenical in thought and humane, humane with humility as you go forward.  But the Olympics was good; college was good; parents [Sarah Stampley and Robert Wilson] was very proud of me; was able to do some things.  As I went, oh, one other experience, in Nebraska.  They had a National AU Wrestling Tournament in Lincoln, Nebraska.  So, it was during the spring football.  Well, I went to spring football practice, changed clothes, went to the stadium and wrestled in the National AU Olympics, I got third, from--my day was classroom, football practice, AU.  People didn't believe it, they didn't understand how you could do that?  And again, (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: That's a lot.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. But it was a lot of fun.  You know, you stretched.  I was in my world, you know the sports world, which is, and that, that was a good experience.  I'd say after the Olympics had taken place.
Story_ID: 56033
Speaker 1: Now, by this time, you're still not married, right?
Speaker 2: Naw, naw.  '67, [1967] that's when I got married, the first wife [Doris Pickens].  Yeah, I got, got married.  I wasn't in the, that was in '66, [1966] when I did the... No, no it was in '65, [1965], the Olympics was in '64, [1964], '65, [1965]; '66, [1966].  I met my wife in '66, [1966].  I picked her up on a corner, a little grad student going into class.  I looked at her and I said:  "That's the woman I'm marrying her."  I married her.  And she, she (pause, crying), died (pause, crying) after 34 years.  You do Doris, Doris Pickens, yeah.  She died (tears) and at 34 great years.  I think God blessed me because he brought somebody else into my life who's since then I've married.  And, not that I make comparisons, but, you know, some things you have to take a look at.  And, you know, in her own right as stateous, as professional, as a warm and caring as Doris was.  But I met her in college, we had a child and went on to professional football.  But Nebraska was kind of an awakening that said "Okay, you know, you can only screw up so many times before you're gonna be, you know, not, given an opportunity."
Story_ID: 56034
Speaker 1: So, I went there and I achieved my goals, I graduated, you know, I was drafted by the Chicago Bears and the Kansas City Chiefs.  And I had never played a minute of football at Nebraska.  I got drafted, higher than anybody who was playing, that didn't sit well with some of the kids, they were tickled, they got a little angry at that.
Speaker 2: And, so, you didn't play much in [University of] Nebraska [in Lincoln]?
Speaker 1: I played one season in Nebraska.
Speaker 2: Mm, mm.
Speaker 1: One season, two spring sessions and one season.  So, after that occurred, I signed with the Bears versus Kansas City.  I was drafted second by Kansas City and third by the Bears and I saw a brighter future in Chicago, than I did in Kansas City, and I made, made the right decision,   that it, it's been great.  And I came here and I played, I got hurt severely my first year, and my ego didn't allow me,  did not allow enable me to use common sense, so I  played, continue to injure myself, not very productive.  Second year I played five games, I played twelve the first year, and five the second year.  Third year, they fired me after the New York Giant game.  It was kind of funny, you know, because I had come home and set the table and had the candles and stuff, and you know, my wife [Doris Pickens] was coming home from work and she says: "what happened today for you to do this?"  I says, "Well, I was fired."  She says:  "Oh, you were.  She said: "Well, let's just sit down and figure out how we want to approach our life from this point."  So, I went and played for Canada for a couple of years.  And then, it was, we were, we were in the Preliminaries of the Grey Cup and it was like second down, mid way through the fourth quarter and I got in a huddle, and I stood up and I says:  "What in the heck am I doing out here? (laughter)" I said, "Why am I out here, what am I doing?"  You know, hey, I'm going nowhere.  So I came back, went to work for Foote, Cone, and Belding Advertising [FBC].  I had a wonderful experience in meeting people like Jeanne Morris, who has, you know, has Jeanne Morris and Associates, Sarah Dansey. Phil Gant, who was a little intern who came to us in the summer, says: "you know, I'd like to, you know, get into the advertising business" has become, you know, a very highly recognized art director here.  Bernie Washington, these are guys, African-Americans who trail blazed in the advertising industry, here in Chicago [Illinois].  I go back to black advertising games, [HM Thomas] Tom Burrell, Frank Mingo, you know all these guys were kind of, Naurice Roberts, you know, they were all part of my little arena that I had, you know, that I was blessed enough to be part of.  So, I worked there for a bit, then I was on a recruiting trip, met a guy named Bill Wilson, who said: "Man, you ought to look at Sears."  So, I went to Sears and I worked there 18 years, 18 wonderful years.  I remember when I went there, my first check was $365.00, (laughter).  I took a $15,000.00 a year pay cut to go to work for Sears, and it was one of the better decisions I made in my life because I made some wonderful friends.  I had some wonderful experiences, I had some challenges, had a few bumps in the road, but in my 18 years, I think I had 16 jobs.  So, and I wrote for the chairman of the board on a case.  So, that was a wonderful transition from pro football, to Canadian football into industry.
Story_ID: 56035
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, you know, I lost my first wife [Doris Pickens].  She passed away after thirty-four great years of marriage and I've known another lady for about ten years professionally, and I went to a conference, we saw each other, we talked and opened a lot of doors, you know.  Big people love is different from kid love.  You know, you focus on those things that are good for what you have to do.  But, opening the doors, being more focused, having had been prepared to meet the challenge by, you know, your previous spouse who God called home.  It gives you some insights into relationships that are not there if the marriage was a stormy, fatuous relationship or if it ended on a down note.  I mean, I don't have any regrets, you know, my wife was sick for 96 days and I was there virtually every day. I took a couple of days off.  And she was a great partner.  The lady that I recently married [Judith Jamison] is a great partner; similar thoughts, feelings, focus, and same sign, two Aquarians, which is kind of unusual.  So, if you read the sign, you know what kind of people we are.  We're pretty true to our, true to our sign.  But, each of us, humanitarians, we both have, you know, family goals.  We both are religiously involved in the church.  I belong to Bishop Brazier's Apostolic Church of God and Christ [Chicago, Illinois], and also Pastor Robert's Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta [Georgia].  I belong to those two churches.  And, my wife belongs to Ebenezer Baptist Church.  Aw yeah, she lives in Atlanta and I live in Chicago.  (Laughter) okay, and that works out fairly well.
Speaker 2: So, that's not hard, hard to manage?
Speaker 1: No.  You're talking about two grown-ups.  You're not talking about children. Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She owns a home in Atlanta and you know I spend time down there.  I'm looking in opening some businesses and opening a business in Atlanta, you know, to allow me, which won't take away from any of my responsibilities here and in my time here. I estimate three fourths to two thirds of the time I'll be spent in Chicago.  Because my move towards nine asset based businesses is more in the soft side of consulting and, and program development, collaborative facilitation and things like that.  I've got a little experience in that.  But, I think that, one of the strengths of any person is to have a partner who can stand up with them and move in the same direction, provide the support services that can only come from somebody who is committed to you as a person.  And I'm committed, my wife Judith is committed.  Doris was committed. I was committed to her.  People say: "Well, you got married too quick."  I say, "There's no timeline".  You have to again, remember I operate on a plate.  My plate is set up to accommodate what my needs are and I found in life that where there's two people involved, typically they work their things out.  Where the problem comes about is when the third party steps into your arena.  You know, I mean, then you don't have the exchanges, you don't have the controls that you normally have so, we, I try to live a wealthily, private, but meaningful life.  I'm not, well I don't know about social events, I go to them if it's gonna benefit somebody, or benefit me as a person.  If it's gonna support somebody on something, I'll go but I just don't go to go.  I love going to the movies, you know.  That's a no brainer.  You can go there and sit there and go into, you transfer yourself into the movie and all this other stuff that's just sitting there dealing with kind of like just disappears for that two hours or two hours and 15 minutes.  So, I have my escape mechanisms too.
Story_ID: 56036
Speaker 1: Okay, now, just a word about [Pickens' first wife] Doris Pickens.  She was very much involved into the community.
Speaker 2: Doris Pickens was one of a kind.  Nobody could replicate her efforts, nobody could duplicate her energy.  She is a, she was a little Wynne, Arkansas lady who was focused, who had energy, who was creative, who was a forward thinker, who was committed to her household, did not have a tremendous need for social experiences outside the household.  Gaged her time extremely well was a, truly a visionary, visionary.  I mean she was a lady, she was a person who thought of the benefits of the Cook County Tax Reactivation Program.  She and her staff worked on that.  She and I worked on developing a marketing plan for Bank of America to engage in retail banking.  You see the results of that with TCF Bank and these, with these free standing stations.  We made that recommendation, I think seven, eight years ago to Bank of America and they chose to get out of the retail banking and TCF, I think, came into that.  And her staff, and believe me when you're married to persons for not-for-profit, (laughter), you're in it too.  I mean, I worked for Sears [Roebuck, and Company] but the evening, evening chats and the things and the strategies are all worked together. So, I see myself part of her team too.  Still I think about eight or nine hundred moderate income housing units in South Shore [Chicago, Illinois].  She and I went into business in 1997. I put my trading company on the sidetrack and just dealt with deal specific situations and we, we developed between 100, I think it's 105 condominiums before the condo market became an issue.  So, we were always on the cutting edge.  Maybe the first one is a step into the pit.  And, being African American condo developers, it is kind of a difficult task because your clientele is expecting more from you than what, you know, typically is asked for, from other types of developers and you have to try to deliver, so the margins are shorter.  You don't make tons and tons of money, you make enough to be comfortable and put a sock away some stuff but it was a wonderful experience, she had a, she and I both had our hearts into providing a quality condominium structure for people.  Did we have problems?  Yeah.  Are there some problems that linger on?  Absolutely.  Every one of these condos that come up, they'll always be something that somebody is not happy with, so, you have to kind of make a decision how you would approach that situation.  I do another condo conversion.  I'll buy a maintenance insurance policy and say "call the maintenance people," I'm not, and not to say, disparaging, but that would be my additional support.  I will always have a hands-on position in terms of any housing that I engage in.  I just think it's, it's such a wonderful experience to go from ground to bricks and mortar and finally go into build, finish up a structure and put the people or programs in there that you kind of like on plan on doing and seeing the net results from the positive sense of the word.  So that's, that's where my focus is, is in the housing market.
Speaker 1: Ok, and you've seen, I guess, over the last, you know, 15, 20 years, I guess, a lot of changes in South Shore [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, absolutely.  I remember how we found our house.  I was playing football in Canada back in 1970 and Doris [Pickens] called me and said "I've found a great house" and it was a great house, still is.  We still, I still have it.  Bought it for $35,000.00, so the guy was moving to Florida and he just wanted to get rid of the house.  So, we've had very few, if any problems in the house and, you know, it's appreciated substantially.
Speaker 1: How much you think it's worth now?
Speaker 2: Between three and 350 [$350,000.00].  So that's better than the market,(laughter) better than the stock market.  I'm not a big stock market person, but I think real estate is a great basis for developing any kind of income base.  Although rows are a challenge nowadays.

Speaker 1: Okay, well let's go through your business career and you started with Sears [Roebuck and Company].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started with Foote, Cone and Belding.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Foote, Cone and Belding.
Speaker 2: As Assistant Director of Personnel.  My responsibility was to try and create a more positive environment for African American professionals in Foote, Cohn and Belding and attract African American professionals from outside of Foote, Cone and Belding to come on board.  And, I guess I did an okay job.  One of the most funniest things happened is that I had been doing all this research upon an expression of a plan as to how to attract the people into, how to enhance positions as well as to attractive new people into Foote, Cone and Belding.  And my supervisor's name was Marlon Merkie who also was from Evanston [Illinois].  He was fairly conservative, taught me a lot, taught me a lot about gestures.  You know, visual gestures when you're talking to people and try to, you know, reading what they're really saying by way of what they do.  So he went on vacation and the chairman of Foote, Cone and Belding called on us as... I want to get that minority report, you know, right away.  So I wrote up the report, zoom, zoom, zoom.  Marlon seen it when he came back, he says "what".  Because he, you know, he wanted to tweak it and as his (unclear), you know, Jeanne Morris, Bernie Washington, Sarah Dancey, who was a pretty strong-- very strong sister.  Phil Gant, all these people were, moving through the system and the doors were opening.  It was in 19--, right about 1970, '71' [1971] when the advertising industry was starting to open up.  From there I went to Sears [Roebuck and Company] and went through a series of jobs, had a wonderful experience, I had very few, if any road blocks.  One of my most interesting jobs was being the assistant; I was the Assistant Buyer, Assistant Marketing Director of Style Aisle, that was Sears answer to intercity fashions and so...
Speaker 1: Style Aisle?
Speaker 2: Style Aisle.  You may remember that tag.  And it was, it was an honest attempt to try and provide ethnically correct clothing to African Americans who patronize our stores.  So myself and a guy named Nate Wilson, we were, we were the team.  And we did it, and we had a nice little, nice little work.  Then Nate left and the guy, named Dick Hassler came on board and we continued working towards an end.  Then I went into sales manager for Men's Sports Wear, at a dubious distinction of having four territories out of five.  That was wild.  I mean, I was on the road all the time.  I would, matter of fact, I would never unpack my bag.  I'd just take it to the next venue and get it cleaned there.  Then, I had a chance to go to work for Guy Ingraham, who is the Vice President of Retail Merchandising.  And in that position, it was kind of a showcase position where you were exposed to all departments and somebody would pick you to probably become a sales manager.  So, at that time, I did some writing for [Arthur] Art Wood, who was the Chairman of the Board.  I facilitated all of the meetings, all the key meetings outside of the [Sears] Tower as well as inside in the Tower.  I did writing, I did research and a whole bunch of good stuff that, you know, you'll never thought this little guy from 1931 doing in Evanston [Illinois] would ever have a chance to do.  But again, I still treated it very graciously and with great humility and I also there to try and assist.
Story_ID: 56038
Speaker 1: The one experience that I had there that was, was just kind of mind boggling. A guy named Jim Smith, wonderful, older, African American brother who was like in Personnel.  If you remember, back in the '70's [1970's] the United Negro Fund, Defense Fund was in Mississippi and their expenses were extremely high, and they were really running out of money.  So, somebody approached Jim and I was on corporate staff so Jim and I put together a letter to the African American professionals.  We..(unclear) says, you know, "The Defense Fund is out of money, would you make a contribution. Yada, yada (unclear)" and we thought was, you know, it was just a great gesture.  A couple of the African Americans who were at Sears took this letter to their white supervisors and says "Why am I getting a letter like this?" (laughter) These are the ones and I, who are not consequential, but they were the ones who came into Sears, lived in Naperville [Illinois], Wheaton [Illinois], etc., you know, never really assimilated into the African-American culture, and when Sears started chopping the heads, who were the first ones to go?  They were.  Okay.  But I mean, you experience, you know, if you've noticed each of my life experiences are always an experience that teaches you a life's lesson, you know, so as a result of that, I became even more into my own culture, you know.  I believe in my culture, I think that we have one of the most beautiful cultures in the world.  It's so diverse, so rich with knowledge, so rich with experience and I mean, it's just something, there's nothing mundane about being in the African-American culture.  It is an exciting, vibrant learning experience on a day-to-day basis.  I think, that, and I said without reservation.  I think in terms of the female population, we have some of the sharpest, most focused, most beautiful human beings that walk the face of the earth and I travelled all over the world, okay.  I mean, my wife, Judith [Jamison], she and I talk about this, you know, about the beauty of our culture, about the exchange, you know, about the vibrancy of the African-American, you know, females and males, the interaction, the challenges, so that's something that stays on our plate continuously as a discussion topic.  And, it's just the, the strength that's, that's generated from that association.  Mm, mm.
Story_ID: 56039
Speaker 1: You've been involved in trade in the Far East, as well?
Speaker 2: Mm, mm.  For over 20 years.
Speaker 1: Now, how did that happen? How did you get involved in that?
Speaker 2: (laughter) That's just a, that's a great story also.  That's a Sears story.  As a buyer of Sears [Roebuck and Company], I bought internationally as well as domestically and I've travelled to the Far East several times and, remember I told you about that list I made early in life.  One of them that was on there was to be an international businessman, that was, whatever the heck that meant, I mean, it just had a great ring about it, I said: "I'm gonna be an international businessman, etc., etc.," So towards the end of my career, Sears was downsizing and they were cutting people so I was on the hit list.  I know I was on the hit list but nobody would ever tell me.  So, I started looking for my next move so I developed a doll line called 'Rainbow Classics,' as you saw in there, and I had the dubious distinction being the second largest black doll manufacturer in the world, for a point in time.  I distributed more than anybody else, except for Tanline, out of Detroit [Michigan].  Then Olmec [Toys] came with Yla Eason, who was very, very, good businesswoman, created a great relationship with Hasbro.  They bought into our concept and she soared ahead of all of us.  But, that's, that China thing was a wild experience.  I mean, it was just a wonderful, wonderful experience to go to our foreign country, put together a deal, see the deal come to fruition.  They deliver your products to the dock and 21 days later you got your money (laughter).  I shipped FOB Hong Kong, irrevocably letter of credit.  So when the goods hit the dock and the manifest cleared, the process for generating your money was in the process so it took about 21 days.  And so the checks were issued.  I did maybe about three to five million dollars in business in about four years.  It was respectable and I was a one man band.  I didn't have no staff.  I've always, pretty much, been a one man band.  My businesses now, I do, I do have partners.  But, in my international trade business it was pretty much me and my agent who was over there who did a lot of processing and paperwork.  As far as a physical corporate structure, it was me and as I started to grow a little bit, I brought somebody else in.  And then what happened was that the major doll manufacturers became ethnically correct and started really pushing out some really nice product and then the retailers wanted you to play in the same playing field and I said "I didn't have the money." So, I said: "let me back away and do little deal specific situations".  So, on occasion something comes up, I'll do it.  I still had my structure in place.  And my partners in place and who are always willing to do something.
Story_ID: 56040
Speaker 1: Now, the idea of black dolls as an idea I think I, I think in terms of retail sales in black dolls, Marcus Garvey, Garvey started doing that in the 1920's, [1920s].
Speaker 2: Mm, mm.
Speaker 1: But, I think, you know, why is this--but it remains a recurrent theme and when you talk about toys for black children.
Speaker 2: Mm, mm.
Speaker 1: The idea of a black doll, a doll that looks like them.
Speaker 2: Mm, mm.
Speaker 1: I mean, what's the importance of that to you, do you think?
Speaker 2: I think that it's important that from infancy that, do it like this, I'll make it a simple answer.  It has the same relevancy of an African American child going to a black university.  Because all the keys around him are typically African American, the power, the structure, the control, so it creates a self-satisfaction, it provides a basis for saying, "I'm okay, and I'm pretty, you know, I'm good, I'm competent," okay, as opposed to living in a sterile society and not seeing those types of reference points.  I think that the one of the things that kind of took our culture into a tail spin was the elimination of viable black businesses in the black community because they escaped; they ran away, you know, as we went through the integration process, you know, a lot of our folks left and did not support the community any longer.  And it took a pi.., a chunk out of the community that could almost be difficult to replace.  I mean, I remember the black shoe maker, and a hat shop, you know, the meat market, all those things which gives you, I think, a stronger sense of who you are as people.  The black dolls, dolls have always been looked at as symbols of beauty.  So, when you, and I'm not talking about a singular ethnic profile, because again in our culture, as I said earlier, we're all over the board color wise, shape wise, feature wise, but, it was not a situation where you just take a whitened doll and paint it over.  Now one interesting thing about the dolls facial structures, European dolls in many instances, have similar type of facial features as African, or African Americans.  I've never sculptured an ethically correct doll, but I did search the market to find European typed dolls who had facial structures and nose structures and eye sockets similar to African Americans and then we went through the process of painting and coloring and making sure the color was correct from the shades are right, stuff like that.  And, it was fairly successful.
Speaker 1: What other kinds of dolls did you make or what (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I had a clown, I had a black clown.  I still got him, he's cool (laughter).  He's face funny, didn't sell, but he's still wonderful.  I had, like, a great clown, I had ragdolls, okay.  The 111/2 inch fashion dolls, I had some baby dolls.  I had layette sets, baby dolls with 15 sets of clothes and stuff.  I did a white one, I sold 50,000 items in the Sears Catalog, so that was great.  Hey, you go with, you do what you have to do, you know, I wasn't just singly focused. I had in many cases, I had a white counterpart which has sometimes allowed me to get into the door.  And then you know with, and then the black dolls ran about 20 percent of the sales value, so.
Speaker 1: Was there a doll that focused on the Far East community?
Speaker 2: No, no.  They hadn't gone to that point, there was a beginning to move into the Hispanic dolls and that was almost a shading issue of how you shade and color.  And then I left the industry.  I really am out of the industry.  I haven't done dolls in years, you know, I do a little electronics, or a little something like that, you know.
Story_ID: 56041
Speaker 1: Do you still trade with Japan, or China?
Speaker 2: Only on a deal.  If somebody comes through with a deal, I'll go to, go to my partners.  I'm working on a few things now that might make sense, you know.  But, it's a, as I told you, depends on who you're talking to, you determine how difficult it is.  If you've been in like anything else, if you know the mechanics of it, it becomes part of your routine, but if you don't know and you try to enter into it, that's a very, very, difficult experience to try and get something to completion and also get production time to get it delivered on time.
Speaker 1: You're fairly diverse in terms of your business interest and activities.  Is that, is this how you (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: It's my character, I'm, you know.  Again, one of my dreams, I want to have fifteen phones on the table and each one represent a different deal (laughter).  I can't, I cannot find the basis for it, but I've, there's some value of diversion, there's some value being focused okay.  I make a decent living, you know, I'm not extravagant.  I'm not protected, but I mean, I have enough diverse interest if something went to the, went south, I could kind of push a little more energy in another area and it would help bring me back to where I should be.  So, diversion has always been my life.   Three-sports, you know, all sorts of, you know, not a whole lot of community activities but, you know, mostly active in the South Shore [Chicago, Illinois] area since (unclear).  And that was a good experience, I'm from Evanston and I came to South Shore, I came to Chicago and I'll tell anybody that I said: "South Shore has been very good to me and I've been good to South Shore," I think, okay. But, I found people in Chicago were willing to share, not pulling you down, giving you an opportunity to go forward in life and so I've been here for thirty years, thirty-two years, okay.
Story_ID: 56042
Speaker 1: Okay.  You also have a, you say, you don't have that many volunteer activities, but it seems like there's a lot, you know on..
Speaker 2: Well, they're all over thirty years, you know, the list gets longer, you know.  My major focus right now is being a commissioner with the Park District.  That is, that was a dream that came true.   And it wasn't a dream that was on the plate.  It wasn't an item was on my list, but it was a venue that I think I can have an impact upon, you know, and hopefully, I am having an impact upon the services that provided not only children, but also senior citizens and families.  As a commissioner, you know, you have policy responsibilities.  I don't deal specifically, directly with the day-to-day activities.  That's, that's a responsibility of the General Superintendent.  But, I do have impact upon ideas and concepts.  I keep a list of ten items (laughter).  I've come back to this list again, that I write out, and the only way they get off is if they get fulfilled or somebody tells me I can't do them.
Speaker 1: Mm, mm.
Speaker 2: And I'm involved in ten wonderful projects in the Park District that are, that are having, I think I have an impact.  One thing, which I don't mind talking about is, I'm involved in the development of viable, real live, functionable playground equipment for children with different abilities.  Children who may be physically handicapped to mentally handicapped or sensory off balanced, what have you.  But, that's something that, if I leave any kind of legacy as a commissioner, I want to be thought of as a guy who really pushed the button as far as that's concerned.  I've pushed the envelope.  And as a result as being involved in that, it also comes, or brings you to awareness that the same sort of play or respice situations should be available for seniors in our parks.  So, I've had no opposition to move into that direction and I would hope to see the Chicago Park District in the next couple of years, make a very, very, live statement in terms of that area.  Currently, L.A. [Los Angeles, California], I think, has twenty-six parks that are built with that, that configuration.  Rhode Island, there's several parks, Maryland, there's several parks.  I'm thinking in Peoria [Illinois], there's a park.  But I'm saying, Chicago Park District, when it bites off on something, it becomes a meaningful issue.  As my seven-year-old grandson said one morning, he says: "Grandfather, aren't these parks beautiful?" And I said: "Yes, son, they're probably the most beautiful parks in the world".  Yes, they're some venues in other countries, other cities, that may be higher than our comparable venue, but holistically, our parks are really an unbelievably beautiful environment for respice for our communities.  And we're not just focusing on the lake front, we're going to the inner city parks as a, one evidence was at Austin Park, which is at Austin and Lake.  We just put in a multimillion dollar water park.  If you have children, I recommend you go there.  If you're not familiar with it, go to Channel 25 and look at the screen and view "Come Out to Play", which is information on the Park District activities.  But, this last Saturday, I think it was the 20, 23rd, we opened up Austin Park Water Park with the Mayor [Richard M. Daley] and it was a wonderful, wonderful experience.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Austin community is one that's long needed something like this, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I'll fight for the resources for, I want some on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] too.  I mean, I make no bones about it.  "Hey, wait a minute, this guy is getting everything over here, what am I, what I'm working on?"  Like I said, some great projects that are going to, you know, really make a statement in our parks and the South Side of Chicago, too.
Story_ID: 56043
Speaker 1: In terms of the Park District, what do you, you have like ten priorities, you said that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have ten, ten.
Speaker 1: What are some, can you tell me what other kind of changes that would make the parks accessible to people who, other than that are not traditionally accessible to, I mean? (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You mean in the parks?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were talking (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well, well, you know, one of the difficulties is that, you know, wherein, even though the inflation factor is not excessive, there just some hard core costs that just keep changing that don't impact upon the quote, unquote "inflation factor."  Nothing is being done to gouge anyone.  I mean, it's basically it ends up being a washout.  If you want to try and keep the quality of services and the type of access that we've had in the past years.  The fees are appropriate.  I mean, they are appropriate in the sense that they allow the Park District to generate the income to support the programs that people have alluded to and that have been traditionally good for the parks.  There's no excesses being generated, that I'm aware of.  There's no pools of money that are being stored, that I'm aware of, at this point.  So, I don't know how to concretely answer that question.  I can only share with you the basis for some, we've made some adjustments, we've made some adjustments and fees that are paid for usage of facilities, you know.  Any time there is a request to do something different, sometimes people are more aggressive than the real situation would allow and we've been able to make some adjustments in those areas.  I get a question like: "Can we have the baseball fields for free?"  I say "Yeah, you know, you go buy the dirt; you do all the maintenance; you do the grass cutting." And I said: "that and you might be able to get a discount rate."(Laughter)  But what happens is that we have advisory councils at most parks and depending on how aggressive that counselor is, a lot of the things that were done by the Park District personnel are being done by them.  They've taken a proprietary interest in their parks and they're not waiting for Big Brother to come to the table with the remedies of situations that occur.  So, what we would like to do, I think, is push more toward a collaborative, towards a collaborative effort with the community people.  In terms of parks and the advisory councils and in some cases it works extremely well.  In other cases, they're still some challenges in front of us. Hopefully, I answered your questions best I could.

Speaker 1: Can you talk about your work with the National Football League Players Associations?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that's one of my loves.  I really love that.  I'm involved with the National Football League Players, Retired Players Association.  There's a distinction, there's the active players and retired players.  And contrary to belief that the active players are selfish, non-caring human beings, they have invested a significant amount of funding in place for retired players.  And, we have, again, that bell curve.  Twenty percent are very successful, sixty percent are like you and I, work every day, and twenty percent are either physically, mentally or economically deprived or destitute and that's just an unfortunate thing, but it doesn't seem like there's anything you can currently do than not have some of that.  I'm with the Retired Players Association and what it does, it provides me an opportunity to kick back with some of the old guys and talk, have a good time, have a cocktail, have a meal.  But also, we do a fair amount of charity work.  Golf outings, we appear, you know, we service and different (unclear) people buy tickets.  I think last year National Football League Retired Players Association generated over four million dollars in support funds for various organizations throughout, throughout the country.  We have a national convention where issues are brought to the table in terms of retirement, health care, etc. for the participants.  Our dues are nominal, but the benefits are unbelievable.  We have access to replacement of hips, knees, ankles, arms, whatever, you know.  I'm just being somewhat facetious, but also we have situations where there supplemental services available for heart transplants, circulatory problems; eye, ear, nose, and throat and there's also a medical plan that's available to us, too.  So, it's kind of like providing services for guys who've been in the game, and who want to sit around a little camp fire on occasion; and have a beer, have a little marshmallow toast or something like that.  So that's my involvement.  I've been, I was past president of the National Steering Committee.  I was the past president under Chicago Chapter of the National Football League Retired Players Association.  I'm currently the treasurer for the Chicago Chapter and we try to find things that make sense and I can generate funds for ourselves, as well as other groups.  We also have, like, I think it's like, eight scholarships that are ongoing that we provide to students who played sports but were not good enough to get a scholarship.  We give them two thousand dollars [$2,000.00] a year, that's a lot of money, I think.  And, typically that's for four years and they can count on that check.  Mm, mm.

Speaker 1: I know you volunteer with Better Boys Foundation.
Speaker 2: I was, I've been involved with Better Boys Foundation.  I'm re-energizing my relationship with them.  Absolutely a noteworthy organization, North Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois], one of the pioneers as far as community service is concerned.  I think it got caught up in a lot of free standing services that were being delivered by people only focused on those areas, so they had to reinvent themselves and refocus their energies into areas that, that they were able to deliver the services at the level they wanted to.  They had a Joe Kellman School [Kellman Corporate Community School] on the West Side, I think that's changed.  That was a Chart-one of the original Charter School and Joe Kellman is a, I guess a stellar, he's a stellar individual.  I mean, even in his older years, he's still energetic, focused guy that feels as though he wants to give back to North Lawndale Region.  So, that was my relation with Better Boys Foundation.

Speaker 1: What are your concerns and hopes for the black community today, as we talk about this?
Speaker 2: Well, it's kind of like my 88-year-old aunt who relies upon me solely and I've got brothers and sisters and cousins who're quite capable but don't direct their energies to her.  I'd say the black community, holistically, economically, in pockets are better off than it's ever been.  Not as, head not standing as high above the water, but there's a lot of people who are above their chin, in other words, they're people with capacity that for whatever reason may be does not offer that capacity in situations.   How do I see the black community or what do I see in the black community?  I see the need to wrap your arms around the older population in particular, provide some direction for the young population, as well.  In terms of the movement of people from public housing into the areas, I think everything is doable if it's done with a plan.  If it's not done with a plan, then nobody ends up winning.  And, I think everybody is entitled to a quality of life.  I had some, some rental apartments and I had some Section 8 people in my apartments.  I'll tell you this, I'll challenge anybody to go into those apartments and find something wrong.  They had great, I mean they were people, human people like nice things.  They kept the place clean, they, you know, lived up to their responsibilities so, the few that don't do it are the ones that set the stage for the interpretation.  So, people, from, you know, high-rise living situations under government subsidy, I think are entitled to opportunities that live in a quality lifestyle like anyone else.  Now if they choose not to be of a responsible level, then they should be, you know, sat down, talked to, try, try to reorient them and then after that I think that it's just, you do what you have to do.

I don't need no testimonial, I don't need know he did this, that.  All that I want people to know me as is a guy whose fair, who's honest, he did a good job.  Not the best, not the worst.  But, he was a good man.
Speaker 1: That's the way you'll like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  No more, no less.  I've been blessed by God to have experienced more in a lifetime, than a community probably could experience in two decades.  And, it's been just, it's been a good run, I'll tell you, I've had a great run.  I'm, if God call me on home tomorrow, I would think that I have had a good run.  I would think that I've had more people think kindly of me than to think negatively of me.  Do I care about that?  It's not something that drives me.  It's not something that I set the stage to do what I have to do.  I do what I have to do based upon my needs and my interests and I have no interest	in compromising anybody.  I have no need to crush anyone, okay.  I live a fairly quiet life and anytime I'm called upon to make a contribution physically, spiritually, or financially, I try to find a way, notice I say I try to find a way, to do it.  And it I can't, I'm gonna tell you, "I can't, I can't." You're not gonna wonder what's gonna happen.  So, if, then they say "he's a good dude" than, I think I'd feel as comfortable as you could feel laying there looking up.  If you could feel laying there looking up.  But, I do believe in God.  I have a close connection to the Lord.  I don't ask anybody else to take on my beliefs.  My beliefs are good for me.  I think that there is a need for you to have what I call, a spiritual outlet, something that could allow you to dream; something that could allow you to expand your horizons.  I'm not a religious zealot.  I put it in prospective just like everything else.  I like Sundays.  I love taking my grandson to church.  He loves going to church with me.  I love walking in church, hand-and-hand with my wife [Judith Jamison].  I sit in the next to the last row.  I ask for no recognition in the church.  I go there for the spiritual enhancement.  I don't go there to show off.  I don't go there trying to amass power or importance.  I go there to share my spirit with the spirits that are around me and that's the way I treat my day-to-day life.

Speaker 1: Now, you've got two children, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they, they've been around a lot of community activity and (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Mm, mm.
Speaker 1: So, are they taking up the cause?
Speaker 2: My daughter's [Tori Pickens] kind of dabbling.  She wants to looks a little realistic.  My son [Todd Pickens] is a salesperson, you know, he's in his era, my daughter's also.  I think my daughter, my daughter's a single parent and she's done, I think, a great job.  She has her own home.  She has a great job.  She has a great son and she doesn't call too much (laughter).  If she calls, you know, I'll help her get through the, you know, the little challenges that she has.  But, my oldest son, he's organizing his life.  He's never been a major problem.  You know, he does boy things, stupid things sometimes but, overall he's basically a good guy, you know.  And as you go through transitions in life, you connect, you disconnect.  We're in the process of reconnecting and I feel really good about that.  I mean, it's nothing like having your man child in your family that you can feel comfortable with and, you know, we're reaching those comfort zones once again in our lives.  As my daughter says, "You are the parent, so you have to open up your heart and look through the challenges that either one of us give you".  And, that's essentially what I've, you know, I've done.  So there is a relationship, you know, overall, they're good kids, and seem to be on track with trying to establish their lives.

Speaker 1: Is there something that you'd like to say that we haven't asked you?
Speaker 2: No.  It's been interesting because I think if you can list all my stream of consciousness information deliverer, I don't develop outlines.  I think that everything that you've asked me has certainly stimulated thought because I've had to go back and revisit things that come back up.  I think that HistoryMakers is; HistoryMakers as a process, is significant to our community in that, many African American families, like mine, never sit around the table to talk about the legacy of the culture.  And, part of the reason is that, the day-to-day physiological, social, spiritual, and financial challenges are so intense in our community.  It's very little time for respice where sit back and reflect.  And by, I think, cataloging these interviews with the various people that I have come across the stage, so far, certainly provides our community an opportunity to go back and look at some of the icons that have impacted upon our community.  I don't consider myself an icon so I don't, erase that, as far as referencing me with some of the great people, you know.  The [HM] Margaret Burroughs, who was just an unbelievable person.  [HM] Vernon Jarrett, who has, you know, you have to get close to him, to feel him because he has his own way of delivering information.  The [HM] Abena Joan Browns, you know, the [HM] John Johnson's.  All of these people, these people have, have really laid the foundation for the roots and the tracking and the roads that are being built.  And I don't think there's enough, enough expression of that.  I mean, I take a look at Juneteenth, you know, I mean, you know, June 19th, 1865 was the final liberation of slaves, where our people are not aware of.  Slavery currently exists in the world and the fastest growing trade is that trading of human beings in, in the world.  So, without the knowledge, there is no power and through the grace of God and some determination of myself, I've tried to amass enough knowledge so that I can maintain some capacities to have an impact upon the day of, each day of my life.  That's about it, I don't, it's simple (laughter).  My life is not complicated.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you, okay.
