Speaker 1: So I'm Shawn Wilson, the interviewer for the History Makers.  This is Scott Stearns, the videographer for the History Makers and of course you know Denise Gines--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --the observer.  And we're gonna start and I'm gonna ask you some basic questions but I'll have you start if you'll slate your name for me and spell it out?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Elizabeth Omilami, E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H, Omilami, O-M-I-L-A-M-I [now Elisabeth Omilami].
Speaker 1: Your date of birth?
Speaker 2: February 18, 1951.
Speaker 1: Place of birth?
Speaker 2: Atlanta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Today's date?
Speaker 2: April 14--12, see.  April 12, 2006.
Speaker 1: The location of this interview?
Speaker 2: At my home in Atlanta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: And your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am an artist-activist.
Story_ID: 110633
Speaker 1: Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Chocolate ice cream.
Speaker 1: Favorite color?
Speaker 2: Purple.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Beach.
Speaker 1: And your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: It's only what you do for others that will last.
Story_ID: 110634
Speaker 1: So I'll start with your name.  The last name sounds African.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is it?
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.  My husband [Afemo Omilami] was a student at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] in 1972, '71 [1971].  He actually left the college and went to live in a Yoruba village in South Carolina called Oyotunji because he's so related to the Yorubas of Nigeria.  Changed his name completely and I actually met him when he returned from being down there in a, in a play.  We were actors, both actors together.  His name at that time he changed it to Afemo Omilami.  And so that's how I got the last name Omilami, which means water heals me which is, which is very true for me because whenever I get stressed out, I need to do some soul searching, I, I have to go to the ocean several times a year or I just--and, and I live in Atlanta [Georgia] which is landlocked so I, I guess that doesn't make sense but I do whatever I have to do to get to, to the ocean and so it, it makes sense for me to have that name.
Story_ID: 110635
Speaker 1: So we're gonna start with your family tree.  And your father [Hosea Williams] was extremely well known.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But we'll start with your mother [Juanita Williams].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Your mother was well known as well on your mother's side of the family.  So if you can state your mother's name for me and spell it out?
Speaker 2: Juanita Terry Williams, J-U-A-N-I-T-A, Terry, T-E-R-R-Y, Williams, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S.
Speaker 1: Does she not take your father's last name?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh she did okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, Terry is her middle--is her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh yeah, I'm, I'm thinking your father's--I'm thinking his first name is his last name [simultaneous]
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother was born?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in Columbus, Georgia.  And she actually was raised in the Bates-Block [ph.] house because her mother [Elizabeth Terry] was the laundress and worked for the Bates-Block family for most of my mother's young life.  As a matter of fact she kind of raised herself because her mother being a laundress and the nanny spent most of her time with the you know this wealthy white family, the Bates-Block family.  And my mother would be at home and get herself to school and so forth and we had the opportunity to actually meet that family later on.  But she was very, very, very bright and went from elementary school, graduated high school, went to Atlanta University [now Clark Atlanta University], got a master's degree in library science, then went on to Washington, D.C and actually worked as one of the secretaries that would send the letters to the soldiers who had died.  Send letters to their families letting their families know that they had died.  And she, she didn't--couldn't do that very long, but, but that's where she and my father met.  So she was of--not just the first African American black woman in her family to go to college but to get a master's degree.  But even on a laundress' salary, her mother, which at that time I think was about $25 a week saved up enough money to send her to university, to buy her a Packard automobile.  My, my great--my grandmother Elizabeth Terry were owned two houses, owned property on a, on a maid's salary.  Just, just an incredible testimony to her ability to, to manage what she had and she passed that on to my mom who ran the family affairs, you know, the accounting and, and all of that.  So she was the power behind my father being very famous and very out front man.  She was behind the scenes.  She did everything.  She never worked for anybody else because he was determined that she, she would not have to work so she stayed at home and during the transition that my family made, she from her working as a professor at Savannah State College [now Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia], she transitioned from there to the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: So let me just break it--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --down and get some details--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --from your mother.  So what year was your mother born?
Speaker 2: 1921.
Speaker 1: So in 19--so she was born during the depress--well in the late '20s [1920s] with the depression?
Speaker 2: Un huh late '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: And what year did she have the opportunity to go to college to Atlanta?  Was it Atlanta you said?
Speaker 2: Atlanta University.
Speaker 1: And what year did she graduate?
Speaker 2: And that would have been about 1940--in the 40--1940, '41 [1941] because it would have been about ten years before I was born.
Speaker 1: So she graduated Atlanta University--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in 1941?
Speaker 2: Un-huh.
Speaker 1: [unclear] And then she went--after that she went to?
Speaker 2: She was hired--yeah she went to Washington, D.C. to work for the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: But then she went back to school?
Speaker 2: No she--
Speaker 1: She okay.
Speaker 2: --when she, she met my father in Washington and she left there and came back to Atlanta and sort of went back and forth between Savannah and Atlanta.  When I think the first stop she made after she left Washington was to come back to Atlanta, gather her mom up and, and they got married and then we moved to Savannah, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Well why did she go from Atlanta to Washington to begin in the first place?
Speaker 2: I think that she was hired by the Army and tarns--transferred there to work in Washington.  She was always wanting to get out.  Always wanted to, to, to be a, a, a better, to, to have, to take advantage of more opportunities even though she had a degree in--master's degree in library science, she did not wanna work at a university.  She wanted to see more of the world and see what it was, what it was like outside of Atlanta, Georgia.
Story_ID: 110636
Speaker 1: So your--her [Omilami's mother, Juanita Williams] mother, your grandmother [Elizabeth Terry] was a see--what, what was she?
Speaker 2: She was a laundress--
Speaker 1: A laundress?
Speaker 2: And a nanny.
Speaker 1: And a nanny.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But she was able to send her daughter to college?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now do you know your grandmother's name and her date of birth?  She was Elizabeth Terry, you said?
Speaker 2: Yes, Elizabeth Virginia Terry.  And I'm not sure about her date of birth but I have it, it in my files.  And I also have a photograph of her mother who--
Speaker 1: What was her mother's name?
Speaker 2: Her mother's name was Virginia Terry, who was half Cherokee Indian and so we have that you know.  A lot of African Americans in Georgia have Cherokee Indian in their family line.  So that, that Columbus, Georgia area was where they came from and these women were entrepreneurs from my great, great-grandmother moving forward.  They always were able to own property and own their own homes and never rented.  And even though my mother was the first one to finish college, they never felt that they were poor.  You know, they never had the understanding that they were poor even though they were workers.  My great, great grandmother was also a seamstress and you know worked in, in white, white home and they, they were great money managers.
Speaker 1: Now she must have been [simultaneous]
Speaker 2: Which I didn't get [simultaneous]
Speaker 1: --a slave right, your great, great grandmother?
Speaker 2: No, she wasn't.
Speaker 1: No.  Okay.
Speaker 2: No she wasn't.  She, she worked as--was paid for her, her labor, paid for her wages.
Speaker 1: Okay so then that's your mother's?
Speaker 2: That would be my mother's--
Speaker 1: Side of the family?
Speaker 2: --side of the family.  And unfortunately don't know a lot about the men.  I just know I have a picture of my mother's father.  They separated when she was born and so he was never around although he's--his funeral, she attended his funeral, didn't really know him well.  Interesting link is that he had something, they always said he had bad blood.  And what my mother died of was a very rare blood disease, one in a million people get it, something called TTP [Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, Moschcowitz syndrome].  She had never been ill a day in her life and so that bad blood whatever that was that they kept saying her dad had, was evidently passed on to her.  And she contracted--the disease showed up when she was seventy-five and she was gone in a year.  So it does matter who, who your--but, but I can't go back much further in terms of him.  But I--
Speaker 1: Can you go back, I'm sorry go ahead.
Speaker 2: --But I do have something with his name on it.  I can't even recall his name right now.
Speaker 1: Do you have any--can you link the ancestry to the Cherokees like do you know--or are any of the like the Cherokee side?  Can you talk about--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --about them?
Speaker 2: No, I just know that that's what we were always told and we had some pictures of my great, great grandmother and who was very bright-skinned with straight hair and looked, looked like she was mixed from something.  And so we just go, you know, I've never been back to Columbus [Georgia] to kind of track that down.
Speaker 1: So do you know if there were any--that like if any of those Cherokee customs became African American customs that you know of within your family?
Speaker 2: Well I know that my grandmother always kept Native American artifacts in her bedroom.  She would have feathers, she would talk about the Cherokee people in terms of the bread that they made, the johnny cakes that they made which then turned into African American food.  It was the same transfer that those flat cakes that they would bake.  She would talk about the, the fabrics and that they used.  So she taught us from a very young age that we had Cherokee heritage and she, she also taught us that Jesus was black.  She, she took me to the Bible.  She said see it says his hair is like wool and his feet are like brass and she believed that thoroughly.  And she taught me that at a very, very young age.  And I was like oh really, that's cool?  And so she, she was, she was even though she lived all her life in the, the, the, a small room in the basement of a, a rich white family, she had these ideas that she was so much more than that.  And that she was gonna give her daughter so much more you know than that and her grandchildren.
Speaker 1: So when she was living in the basement, where did the children live?  Did they grow up within--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that apartment with her?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Or they grew up with the aunties across town.  So they didn't live--she was a live-in.  So she didn't raise my mother in, in the traditional way that we think of things.  She lived there.  She raised the Bates-Block's children and my mom's aunts raised her.
Speaker 1: So she was almost like the immigrant who goes off and works and sends the money back to the family--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --to take care of the children.
Speaker 2: Definitely.  And they gave her Coca-Cola stock, you know my grandmother, the Bates-Block family.  When she died, they took it back from the estate.  But so she had a little bit of that dividends from that you know $12, $13 a month dividends from that coming in.  And she'd put everything away, every penny, she put it away to--because she was determined that her daughter was gonna go to college.
Speaker 1: Well what year did she pass away?
Speaker 2: She, she passed away let's see, I think in the late '70s [1970s] because she was at my college graduation and she passed away I guess '78 [1978], '79 [1979].
Story_ID: 110637
Speaker 1: So what did your mother [Juanita Williams] say about her own childhood having to grow up and knowing that her mom [Elizabeth Terry] was taking--?
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --you know some place else and she was being raised by her aunts?  Does she talk about her child--her own childhood?
Speaker 2: Well yes, she talked about having to take care of herself from a very young age, having to be mature, you know not feeling that she could you know getting the best hand-me-downs from the rich white people's children.  So she was always very well dressed.  She was always you know she always looked like she was rich.  And everybody else thought that she had money because she would get their hand-me-downs and hand-me-downs to them was wear a dress two times you know and pass it on.  She never seemed to feel that she wasn't loved though.  Never seemed to feel abandoned or going without a sense of love from the women that surrounded her because my grandmother had three sisters and they all lived together in the house on Fair Street until one of them moved out, got married and moved out and moved just around the corner.  So this, this, this community of women took the place of the mothers that weren't there and they would share the care of the children.
Speaker 1: Well who took care of the women financially that the three aunts who lived?
Speaker 2: They all worked.
Speaker 1: What jobs did they do then?
Speaker 2: There were working with for--as, as maids, as nannies, as laundresses, pretty much domestics all of them.
Speaker 1: So then going to Colum--I mean coming to Atlanta [Georgia] was the big city--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for your Mom having grown--having lived in Columbus [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  And they, they bought a house almost immediately.
Speaker 1: Well what--I'm sorry, go ahead.
Speaker 2: So what they were doing in Columbus to get the money together to buy a house together because they, you know, I'm not, I'm not sure I never got that story, but I do know that they--as soon as they moved to Atlanta, they were owning property.
Speaker 1: So all, all of the sisters moved to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: They all moved here, Elizabeth Terry, Teeney [ph] and Sister, that's what I know them as.  I'd have to think about what their real names were.  And they all lived together in the same house until they got married and, and, and moved out.  So they--I do know though that my grandmother's name was on the lease for the property.  She was the one that purchased the property.
Speaker 1: Now was, was your mom, your mom, what was--what happened to your mom when the sisters moved to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Well she--I don't think she was born yet.
Speaker 1: Okay so she came along afterwards?
Speaker 2: She came along after that.
Speaker 1: Okay so any other stories about legends in the family on your mother's side.  I mean sounds like that they were all very strong women.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Any other stories about the strong women in the family on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Well, we had stories about one of my grandmothers had a daughter who was--had, had epilepsy but in those days they didn't know about epilepsy and they thought that she had a mental problem and she had this long beautiful hair and they sent her off to a mental institution in Milledgeville, Georgia and they performed electric shock on her.  And when, when she, when she returned home she had lost all her hair and she--they had a closed casket funeral for her.  And that was always a very, a sort of hurtful moment in--with the women in the family because they didn't know what else to do for her.  There, there's another story about my, my grandmother and the insurance man that I want to tell you, talking about strong black women.  You know, the insurance man used to come to your house and get the, get the money for the--to pay for the insurance.  And he came to the door one day and my grandmother answered the door and he said, oh Elizabeth, I came to get, you know.  And she hit the ceiling because he called her by her first name.  And she was to be called Ms. Terry and he was not to call her by her first name.  And that was kind of passed on to my mom because these are women that were very small in stature none of them were over 5'2" or 3".  They were very quiet and you see 'em, they just be sitting you be thinking to yourself, oh what sweet little women.  But honey you say the wrong thing and get those women riled up and they would tear a new hole for you.  So that, that's, that's you know kind of the, the images that, that I have of them and, and I don't know a whole lot more about them.
Story_ID: 110638
Speaker 1: So, but they [Omilami's great-aunts] were there to prop your mother [Juanita Williams] up--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --and to make sure she go--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --move along further than they did, it sounds like.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So she was the first to graduate college?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the first to receive a master's [degree]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, she met your father [Hosea Williams]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What year do you know?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, well they married and then I just wanna sort of get into your mother's adult life and her political life because do you--can you give--take me along that story chronologically?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Now we were, well we were living in Savannah, Georgia.  She was a professor at Savannah State College [Savannah, Georgia].  So this had to be in 1951 around the time that I was born.  And he [Hosea Williams] was the first African American to be hired by the United States government as a chemist.  So he was a chemist, that's his background.  He is a scientist.  She's working at Savannah State College.  We have a cataclysm in our family where we are denied service on a Sunday.  He would take us every Sunday to get ice cream.  This particular Sunday in Savannah, we go in the early '50s [1950s] to get ice cream and evidently wondered in the wrong ice cream parlor and he was told we don't serve no niggers here.  So that was the beginning of the earthquake in our family because he quit his job as a research chemist.  She quit her job as a professor at Savannah State College and instead of us being the nice little middle class family in Savannah, Georgia that rode around in the red Cadillac and had the frou-frou parties with the people and the, the, the champagne and had the well-dressed children and the perfect nest of it all, we became the civil rights leaders of the south east.  And those cute little parties with the women in the dresses and all changed into men and women and scotch and cigarettes and cigars coming to the house and she became the facilitator of all of that.  It was her job to make sure everybody had--all the civil rights workers had food, to make sure that whoever slept overnight had a pallet.  To make sure they all had fresh biscuits and eggs and grits in the morning.  To make sure that, that the offerings that were taken up at the civil rights meetings and the rallies were handled properly and doled out to people in miniscule portions so that everybody could get a little bit.  To make sure that we, children, there's seven of us, were cared for and well-dressed and still well-educated even while all the rest of this was going on.
Story_ID: 110639
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Well let's just, let's step back for a minute 'cause we're getting--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --let's introduce your father [Hosea Williams].  Tell me your father's name, your father's date of birth.  Let's get his background and then we'll come back to the two of them marrying and their stories--
Speaker 1: Un huh.
Speaker 2: --together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it seems like it's gonna make more sense chronologically.  Because--so your father's name?
Speaker 1: Hosea, H-O-S-E-A, Lorenzo, L-O-R-E-N-Z-O, Williams.
Speaker 2: Date of birth?
Speaker 1: January the 4th, 1925.
Speaker 2: Place of birth?
Speaker 1: There is a question about that.  We don't know if he was born in Valencia, Florida or Attapulgus, Georgia, which are very close to one another.  So it--in his birth certificate says Valencia, Florida, but there--we can't find any such town.  So there must have been a town at some time named that so we have to figure that out.
Speaker 2: So what did you--what do you know about your father's childhood, his parents, like all the things you know--
Speaker 1: Un huh.  Un huh.
Speaker 2: --about your mother's background?  What do you know about your father's?
Speaker 1: Well I know that he was born to two blind people at the school for the blind in Valencia, Florida.  This is, this is the way the story goes, that they could not keep him at the school, so they asked an aunt, A.Z. Hines [ph.] to raise him.  His father's name was Willie Wiggins.  And his mother's name was Larcenia, which is my middle name but they spelled it wrong.  My middle name is L-A-C-E-N-I-A.  His mother's name was L-A-R-C-E-N-I-A.  And they were both blind.  Now he was handed over to A.Z. Hines, the auntie, back in the early '20s [1920s].  This is, this is rural.  This is country, dirt.  This is poverty.  This is nothing like my mother's beginning.  These women though eventually did get educated, but A.Z. Hines at that time was a farmer.
Speaker 2: Now A.Z. Hines was not the blind man?
Speaker 1: No.  A.Z. Hines was the auntie.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That he was passed over to.
Speaker 2: So it was the brother and sister to his real biological parents that were blind?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: What were their names?
Speaker 1: Willie Wiggins and Larcenia Wiggins.
Speaker 2: So they were his biological parents--
Speaker 1: Parents?
Speaker 2: --they were blind?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And what was the name of the institution, the blind?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay, but it was in Valencia?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And the town was so small that it disappeared from the maps?
Speaker 1: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 2: So rural?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm following you.
Speaker 1: And we're thinking it became Attapulgus down near Tallahassee [Florida].  We're thinking it became Attapulgus, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Okay, so I'm following you now.
Speaker 1: Un-huh.
Speaker 2: So the aunt and uncle that he moves with are?
Speaker 1: Yes, farmers.  So they make their money by growing corn, and peas and beans.  The, the, the, the--she was not married.  So she was raising him and raised him up to the age of thirteen down there.  And he worked in the tobacco fields and the cotton fields like all the other men did there.  But he also went to school.  Now somewhere along the way before he got thirteen, A.Z. Hines, that was the auntie, went to school and became a librarian.  Now we don't know how she did all that down there with--in the poverty that they were in, but she--so she started working at the library.  Now when he was thirteen, he ran away from home.  And he went--ended, ended up on living in a brothel with some prostitutes and a madam and was working there at thirteen years old somewhere down in south Georgia and they would pay him to run their numbers and you know clean up and cook--he learned how to cook there and they would--that's how they were paying him.  Well he then gets in a fight with a white man and has to leave the brothel and goes to join the U.S. Army.
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: Don't know.  I really don't know.  I don't--it--but I have some information that, that I can give you that will track this for you and I'm gonna make sure you have it.  So that's kind of what I know about how he, how he was brought up.
Speaker 2: So I have a minute left on this tape so this--
Speaker 1: Un huh.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --just to give me.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: I even met Willie Wiggins later on as I grew up and he even, he has the railings in this house to get around and everything.  He still had to you know, never had any, any sight and so here you have a little boy who--but there's still something in him that wants to get away from all of that so this running away from home at thirteen I think is just this, this drive to seek more.  There was no thing, nothing that happened that he had to run away but he was not gonna stay there.
Story_ID: 109425
Speaker 1: Okay, but I just want to go back to something we talked about off-camera and you were telling me--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --how you knew that the women were mixed.
Speaker 2: Yes, in my--on my father's [Hosea Williams] side of the family, I never heard talk about any you know mixed marriages or anything like that, but I do know that they didn't have to get perms in their hair.  And that told me something that they just wet their hair, comb it and go.  You know we used to say that's good hair, so, so going back in his family line that was there.
Speaker 1: Okay so that's good hair.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So we're gonna move forward.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And your father we know that he did run away at thirteen.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And we'll have to clarify--
Speaker 2: The prior.
Speaker 1: --prior.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we know that he ran away at thirteen and at the brothel--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --he was chas--he left because--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --he had had fight with a white man.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where did he go after that?
Speaker 2: Well he joined the [U.S.] Army and he was in the Army in World War II and was--got to be a [Staff] Sergeant and there was a accident in a fox hole.  There were--he and five other people in the fox hole, which was bombed and he was the only one who lived out of that, but ended up having surgery and having a honorable discharge and ended up coming back to Atlanta [Georgia] and a financier helping him go to Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia] where he got a degree in chemistry.
Speaker 1: Some things I just wanna add because I think they're important--[unclear]
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --is that he earned a Purple Heart.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that he came back and completed high school before he went to college and he was twenty-three already.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that they were Nazis that bombed the hole and it was an all-black regimen.  So just start--
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Those were just--go ahead.
Speaker 2: There were--as in Germany, Nazis that bombed a fox hole that he and five, five or seven other men were in.  And he was the only man that lived from that and ended up being--having surgery but as a result of his work in the Army, he received a Purple Heart when he returned back to United States.  But he had not finished high school.  So you're absolutely right.  He did finish high school when he got back to Atlanta and talked--and I have the name of the attorney that paid for him to start at Morris Brown College where he, where he studied chemistry.  He was always interested in science and in why things happened, why things have to be the way--but he was determined not to be poor.  He was determined that his family no matter what was not gonna suffer, was not gonna suffer financially.  He was gonna find the finest black woman he could find and marry her and have a whole lot of children and live a good life and he was well on his way to doing that, 'til that day in the ice cream parlor.
Story_ID: 109426
Speaker 1: So let's, let's get to the point where they [Omilami's parents, Juanita Williams and Hosea Williams] meet and marry.  So she's in Washington [D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Washington.
Speaker 1: --working for the government.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He goes to Washington?
Speaker 2: He's at Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia] and I don't know why he was in Washington but they met briefly there and then she shortly thereafter meeting came back here [Atlanta, Georgia] to work at, at [Atlanta] University [now Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and I'm very--not clear about how they met or when they met but I know that they ended up courting here in Atlanta somehow.  And, and had something to do with her relationship to Atlanta University and him being at Morris Brown and they're both being educators.  Because when he came out of Morris Brown, he didn't go straight into the chemistry lab, he started teaching in the public school system and I keep running into people that tell me your dad, your dad was my teacher in this county and that county and I try to write it down, but I haven't done a good job in keeping up with it.  But, but they met and ended up courting in Atlanta, both of them.  And my grandmother [Elizabeth Terry] was determined that her daughter was not gonna marry this man because he was you know my father always had a very rough exterior.  Even though he was a chemist at Morris Brown, he sort of came off like a gangster.  I mean he always wore red silk shirts and you know I mean he was just a rough guy.  Liked to gamble, rough and tumble and my grandmother did not approve of him.  But he knew the way to my mother was to win over my grandmother.  So he would bring her presents.  He would court my grandmother.  He would take her out for rides and, and eventually I think he must have won her over because they, they, they were married in I think 1948, '49 [1949] because there was one child that died.  There were twins that died before me and I was born in '51 [1951] in, in, in Atlanta, but then we moved to Savannah [Georgia].

Speaker 1: So can you just list the siblings at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: And just--and the order, yeah go ahead.
Speaker 2: The eldest has another mother, Dr. Barbara Emerson.  Now he [Hosea Williams] was with her mother before he met my mother [Juanita Williams] but then there was a period when he was with both her mother and my mother, but she's, she is sixty-one now.  She's about ten years older than me.  And so then after her, I come.  After me would have been Hosea Williams, Jr., who died very young from blood disease in 1998, very rare blood disease [thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), Moschcowitz syndrome], same thing that took my mother so there's this onus hanging over.  And then there's Andre Williams who is now forty-six.  Then there's Yolanda, attorney Yolanda Williams Favors who is thirty-five.  And then there are other siblings out and about (laughter) who have other mothers.  There is Torrey Williams who has another mother.  There is Juanita Collier who has another mother; there's these other mothers.  And then there's this little Hyron Williams who died at eighteen just two years ago in a car accident.  And so we found out about these other mother children after we were just about grown at Christmas dinner one night (laughter) and my mother was like, oh, but you know she received those children into her home and start taking care of them just like they were part of the family and it was just amazing to me and because of the way she reacted that was kind of how we all start reacting to them and they were pretty much generally accepted by the family.  So that's all of us as far as we know (laughter).
Story_ID: 109428
Speaker 1: So then you--they [Omilami's parents, Juanita Williams and Hosea Williams] moved to Savannah [Georgia] and you are a young child?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I'm, I'm very, very well taken care of, upper middle class African American family in Savannah, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Now he worked as a chemist and she worked as a homemaker or did she?
Speaker 2: She, she was a professor at Savannah State College [now Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] and he was working for the United States Department of Agriculture as a chemist.
Speaker 1: And so now tell me about this incident in the--
Speaker 2: In the, in the ice cream parlor.
Speaker 1: Ice cream parlor.
Speaker 2: So we're, we are every Sunday, we're Presbyterians because so Presbyterians have short church services.  And after church they go out to dinner and we would go out and he is famous in Savannah for riding around in a red Cadillac with his family.  His family was always very important to him.  This Sunday we go to an ice cream parlor and I can remember sitting on this stool swirling around and around and around and then hearing, "we don't serve no niggers in here."  And I remember the stool just kind of slowly stopping and I'm looking at my dad and I'm thinking, "what did he just say?"  And this, this had to be, I have to think of the exact year that this happened because Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed in '68 [1968], we moved to Atlanta in '65 [1965] so this had to be--I had to be like ten years old maybe.  And my father started to weep right there standing in the ice cream parlor.  Whenever he would get really, really angry, he would start crying and so which is why I told my daughter never marry a man unless you've seen him cry because if he gets really, really angry, he doesn't cry, he might hurt you.  So then everybody just quit their job.  She, she left Savannah State University.  He left the chemistry lab and he started organizing blacks in Savannah, Georgia to bring about integration all by himself.  But then he started--there were other people of like minds but you needed a leader to pull 'em altogether.  Now I told you my father was a gangster.  I, I'm saying that because he had no fear.  That's why he could do this.  He was not a non-violent man even though he became a follower of Martin Luther King.  He believed that--did not believe in non-violence but took non-violence on as a cloak because it was a strategy to get what, what needed to happen.  So how he knew what the tactics were in terms of gathering people together, having meetings, getting all the preachers together, getting all the businessmen together, getting some finances, and then starting to have rallies and educate and preach to people and then marching and sitting in and all that boycotting.  How he knew what to do, I'm not, I'm not sure unless he was studying what was happening in other cities.  I, I haven't figured that out.  Maybe my oldest sister [Barbara Emerson] could help us with that.  But this is the movement that started and it was, it was Chatham County NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] at first.  But then he was too radical for the NAACP.  Because they believe that you should handle things in the courtroom.  They were much more moderate and so he started his own organization in, in Savannah, Georgia and began this wild ride through not just Savannah, but Martin Luther King said he was the single man most responsible for integration in the southeast.  So we were going into--he was going into little towns all over the South.  Now I was the--all the siblings are there in the house.  This is happening in '60- [196-], early '60s [1960s], late '50s [1950s].  But somehow I ended up being the one who was just old enough to follow him around without my mother worrying because all the others Andre [Wiilliams], Hosea [Williams, Jr.], Yolanda [Favors] were kept at home.  Barbara [Emerson] was--as soon as she got old enough she left and went to her mother who was in Asbury Park, New Jersey and start living in New York.  So that left me there with my dad and I followed him everywhere he went.  I mean I hung to his coattail.  So there we are in Savannah, Georgia and this is pre-1965.
Story_ID: 109429
Speaker 1: Then let's to maybe help clear the dates, let's talk about school then and your earliest memories of Savannah [Georgia].  So were you in Savannah as far back as you can remember--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --from your childhood?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Went to elementary--
Speaker 1: What are some of the--
Speaker 2: --school
Speaker 1: Let's start with like even before elementary school.  What are some of your earliest memories of Savannah, Georgia?
Speaker 2: Just swinging on the swing set having, having Ms. Janey [ph.] take care of me while my mother [Juanita Williams] was at Savannah State College [now Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] as as--we had a nanny.  Being raised with white lace socks and black patent leather shoes and sitting in Presbyterian church and being told if I move, I would die.  Taking piano lessons and ballet and having my hair done, hating every single minute of it because I didn't have good hair.  I had to get my hair permed and it hurt.  And being sent to a beauty parlor and having all this hair and having to have it combed through and hot combed and getting burnt and ow and stop and, and going down to the, to the, to the water in Savannah 'cause you know water heals me so I'm, I'm getting fresh shrimp and all this seafood and just, just great, just a, just a great little life.  Went to St. Benedict Catholic School.  That was where I started getting in trouble.
Speaker 1: Is this first grade?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about it.  What do you mean you start to get into trouble?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was in the third grade, I drew a picture of a nun with horns because they were so mean (laughter). They were.  They were just you know--I remember--and it started when I had, I fell off of the merry-go-round and scraped the skin off my knee to the white meat and the nun poured this alcohol on it and she said, you need to just give it up to Jesus.  You need to just give the pain up to Jesus.  So I start you know I drew this picture and then I got expelled from school in the third grade and sent home and--much to my father's [Hosea Williams] chagrin--and after that just sort of started doing things I think to get his attention.  I'm not, I'm not quite sure.  But did, did some things like scratch his red Cadillac with a key because--I ran away from home but didn't go far was hiding in the bushes in the front yard.  I, I was the real, real active child and was an actress from the beginning because they kept catching me playing in the mirror in the bathroom, making faces instead of taking a bath and I'd come out and have my socks on and said you took a bath you still got your socks on.  Oh well I put my socks back on to keep my feet clean.  So I always had an answer you know.  So St. Benedict was, was where I, I went until I was--and I, but I was still going to jail.  All the time that I was in St. Benedict before I was in the ninth grade, I was going to jail.  I went to jail so many times and I'll show you the article we got it, but it's too dark for the cameras.  Went to jail at least six times before I was in the ninth grade because of civil rights that I got sent away to boarding school.
Story_ID: 109430
Speaker 1: Before we jump ahead to that, there are a few things I want to probe on when you were a child.
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: Now I know you were born in '51 [1951]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but in '54 [1954] they, they started to integrate schools.  Was Savannah [Georgia] integrated at the time you went to school or did you go to an all-black segregated school?  Like were the nuns black or white?
Speaker 2: White.  The nuns were, were white but all the students were black at that time.
Speaker 1: Now was it--did--wasn't a public school?
Speaker 2: No it was a Catholic school because all the upper middle class black people sent their children to Catholic school.  But they had a black Catholic school and they had a white Catholic school.
Speaker 1: With the same names?
Speaker 2: I don't--
Speaker 1: Were they sister schools?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: Any other memorable moments about those early years?  Anything happen then that, that you think as you think about it now would have been pivotal for you being arrested when you were before--you know that many times before ninth grade?
Speaker 2: I just really needed to be with my father [Hosea Williams].  Somehow I had a hunger to be around him and he was so much bigger than life for me.  And I can remember--you know we would march and my mom [Juanita Williams] had my baby sister Yolanda [Favors] on her arm and, and then the police would coming at us she took my baby sister and hit the policeman with my baby sister.  I mean this is just how far out there we were.  Just you know [arm swinging] like that.  I always ended up going to jail because I figured out that they had a thing called a paddy wagon [police van] and when you, when you, you would march and then you'd be marching along singing songs and then the police would come out and they'd say disperse this group right away you know you must disperse immediately.  And then we would go down and pray and then we would get up and we keep marching.  Well then they'd come with the billy clubs and they'd round everybody up and whoever didn't run away got arrested and got put in the paddy wagon.  Well my daddy was always one of the first one arrested.  So I'd get in the paddy wagon with him.  I would be there with him.  Now there was a time during that whole time where I had to just lost the fear of death.  I just don't know when it happened.  But in order to keep marching, you had to not be afraid to die because you would die.  And I just remember just growing up knowing that sometimes you just march you just keep going and you throw caution to the wind and whatever happens, happens.
Speaker 1: So the ten-year-old march started it all for you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When were you arrested for the first after that incident in the ice cream shop?
Speaker 2: I, I, I don't remember the sort of progression of it.  I just, I just remember that we started out with night marches and him preaching at--from a rock called Tomochici's Rock in Savannah, Georgia and we would go down there in the--certain evenings and I could remember standing at my house and looking out of the pane glass window and seeing a cross burning in the yard at, at, at I guess around the age of five or six and, and seeing a black car pulling off and then wondering which [Ku Klux] Klan that was that that huge seven foot cross had set this cross on fire so I, I can't quite you know.  Leonard put it together in a linear way.
Speaker 1: So but there was a cross that was burned in front of your house?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 109431
Speaker 1: Can you talk to me then about what that neighborhood was like in Savanna [Georgia]?  Who were your neighbors?  Were they involved in this movement with your father [Hosea Williams]?  Did--like who were the people who lived across the street, next door?
Speaker 2: Don't remember.
Speaker 1: No.  Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I just remember that they weren't involved.  This was a very upper middle class neighborhood.  Professors from Savannah State College [now Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] on Gilbert Avenue was the name of the street.  And I can probably track some of those names down for you.
Speaker 1: But they were not involved in this movement [Civil Rights Movement]?
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: So your father--
Speaker 2: --we--
Speaker 1: --was a crusader?
Speaker 2: --Yes and we were causing problems in the neighborhood because you know we weren't supposed to be behaving that way and, and, and causing you know suddenly the street nice--little quiet street is filled with cars and meetings and, and, and, and, and these civil rights workers were wild, they were not quiet people.  The people on my father's staff, he had to go out and get the Big Lester, [Trash] Brownlee, Ben Clark, these were ex-prisoners.  These were people who, who had some fight in them that, that, that he that he had--he needed these kind of men, because see his job was to go into these little towns, march, get the people all riled up, get them to march, get them to beat-get beat.  When his--their blood was shed, them smooth talkers like Andy Young [HM Andrew Young] would come in or, or other smooth talkers from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and they would tell the town fathers well you know if you don't negotiate with us and do what we want you to do, we gonna let Hosea and his gangsters tear up this town.  So that was his job to get beat throughout the South.  And he could take it and so could his staff members.  And you know they were the sacrificial lambs.  And they understood what their role was and they functioned in that way.
Story_ID: 109432
Speaker 1: Do you know when he met Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], your father [Hosea Williams]?
Speaker 2: For the first time, I believe in '63 [1963] in Savannah [Georgia] when Dr. King came there for a rally which they had already been as in many other cases throughout the South and they already had a movement going before Dr. King came but he always said that when he met Dr. King, he met Jesus Christ.  He--Dr. King introduced him to Jesus Christ.  And, and he decided that he would be non-violent because he was just not wanting to be non-violent.
Speaker 1: So it was in 1965 that they marched together on Selma, Alabama?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember that as a child?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  I was there.
Speaker 1: What do you remember?
Speaker 2: My mother [Juanita Williams] has a wonderful--she did her masters' thesis on the Selma-Montgomery march and she did the demographics of the people that were there.  And the three or four days that it took the marchers to get to that moment when they crossed that bridge and I just remember a lot of young white people.  There were white students from the North.  I remember looking at them saying--thinking to myself you know what in the world are they doing here?  You know, I mean I just remember the, the, the songs and the guitars and the camaraderie and, and not really having the sense of real danger.  I remember sleeping outside and during the march and eating in people's homes and stuff like that.  I mean you know it's kind of all of that whole season is, it, it's just all one big lump for me.  It doesn't separate itself out because it was like being in a tornado.  You didn't have a sense of time or space.  You just knew you were in a movement and it was happening and you, you were so excited to be a part of it until I got sent away to boarding school.
Story_ID: 109433
Speaker 1: What was life like at school before you got sent away to boarding school having to, having to you know having this active movement that you were participating in as a kid?  How did that affect your life as a student at school?  Were you a good student, an average student?
Speaker 2: Average student.  Weren't--you know I wasn't' really interested in what was going on at that school.  I was more interested in why you put ashes on your forehead on Ash Wednesday and how cool rosaries are and, and, and how come this white man could throw this water on me and I was suddenly blessed.  That was the things I was thinking about.  But I did, I did well in school.  And, and academically generally.
Speaker 1: Why were you sent away to boarding school?
Speaker 2: I was just too far out there.  I was just--
Speaker 1: What does that mean?
Speaker 2: --I mean I just wanted to hang around the civil rights people, workers all the time you know.  And I was maturing as a young lady you know.  I was beginning to mature.
Speaker 1: Date boys?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and but I was interested in the civil rights workers (laughing) and so I can remember kissing this civil rights worker on the back of the bus on one of the, one of the tours and he disappeared.  I never saw him again.  So where they sent him, I don't know.  But they decided, no, she need to be sent away to boarding school so she can--we want her to be you know this is--we want her to get control of her life because she cannot grow up to be a civil rights worker.  But I--but then again also Boggs Academy [Keysville, Georgia] was where all the up and middle class black people in the South send their kids.  It was a private boarding school in Keysville, Georgia run by the Presbyterian church and you got up every morning, Sunday morning, you put your hat and your gloves and you got your stockings and your little pocketbook and you went to church and you're supposed to become somebody, you know, going, going to Boggs Academy.  So, so that, that's where I was sent and I just remember feeling such a great sense of--and didn't get over that until I got older of--betrayal.
Speaker 1: But we have a minute left on this tape but I wanna ask you, by shipping you off to this boarding school, did, did it take you away from the movement [Civil Rights Movement]?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Completely.  Completely except for the summers when I couldn't really plug back in then, because it's an ongoing river.  And I would come back in the summers and, and plug back in to some degree.  But that was the end for that for me.
Story_ID: 111717
Speaker 1: So we will go back to before you were sent--
Speaker 2: Un-huh.
Speaker 1: --to boarding school, you were arrested five times in the summer for Chatham County Crusade for Voters?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was my father's [Hosea Williams] organization and it was a crusade for voters because he was trying to get black people registered to vote but it was also the organization that did all the night marches and all the civil rights rallies and all of the preaching and, and everything came up under that.  So even though it was named Chatham County Crusade for Voters, it was his organization that he created when he left the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 1: And he left the NAACP because?
Speaker 2: He was too radical for them.  I mean they were very moderate, they want to negotiate, slow down, take time, you know, this thing is gonna--and he was like no we need to take this thing by force and but they were very helpful 'cause they would help get you out of jail (laughter). So we needed them.  They found their role and he found his role as the agitator.  You know when he--these like, like you know you wash clothes, you put clothes in the washing machine, you have to have something in there to shake 'em up to get 'em clean.  Well that's what he was.  That's how he functioned and so I just, I found that very exciting.
Story_ID: 111718
Speaker 1: What did you--what were you hoping to accomplish as that teenager being arrested five times that summer?
Speaker 2: I wanted my freedom.  That's all I knew.  I knew that I, I was supposed to get my freedom and I was supposed to be able to go in that ice cream parlor if I wanted to and get ice cream.  I was supposed to be able to, to, to swim in the swimming pool.  I know one of those times we ended up in St. Augustine, Florida and they poured acid in the swimming pool so we wouldn't get in the swimming pool.  And we ended up getting arrested and, and I remember sitting behind the jail cell singing songs, eating bologna sandwiches just being just as happy because I was getting my freedom.  And, and, and my daddy [Hosea Williams] said that that wasn't right for them to be able to tell us what we couldn't do.  And so we were the ones that were chosen and we were gonna get our freedom.  So that's what I was doing.
Story_ID: 111719
Speaker 1: So once you're sent off to Boggs Academy [Keysville, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --your life becomes what?
Speaker 2: My life becomes preppy, black school, schedules, classes, choir.  That's where I found acting though, because I couldn't do anything else.  I, I was constantly calling home crying begging them [Omilami's parents, Juanita Wililams and Hosea Williams] to come and get me.  I was constantly just--then they said well go try to be in the choir.  Couldn't be in the choir because I sang tenor and women don't sing tenor.  Go be in home economics.  Couldn't cook, wasn't domestic.  Wasn't raised at home, was raised in the streets with my dad.  Go try to be with the agriculture department.  Couldn't shoot pigs, didn't like blood, didn't want nothing to do with them pigs hanging up there cut open.  Wandered into the drama department and found out I could act and start winning state awards all over the State of Georgia as an actress.  But I went to Bogg Academy in the eighth grade, ninth grade, tenth grade and I did relatively well.  I did you know A's and B's, but you raise yourself there.  You didn't have any parents there.  You had dorm moms, but the whole thing of coming to womanhood and getting your period and finding out about boys and I, I didn't have anybody there to teach me how I was supposed to behave--what it was like to become a young woman.
Speaker 1: Well when you became a young woman, what did you do?  What did you think?  How did you know what was happening to you?
Speaker 2: Well, I--Miss, Miss, Miss Harris in a dormitory was our mom--everybody's mom.  And so we went to her with everything.  I remember going to the student center and, and finding out what it's like to kiss boys outside, but she'd be out there with her flashlight move along, move along, uh, uh, open up, open separate.  So we were very well supervised.  And I remember finding out that I, I was a great lover of people that I just had so much passion because I come out of this whirlwind and I had, I had passion for life you know.  But, but this--the job of Boggs Academy was to turn you into a lady.  More like my younger sister Yolanda [Favors] became.
Story_ID: 111720
Speaker 1: And I was just not gonna become a lady, but you know, so we had conflict and then when I got to the eleventh grade, this Mormon school [Wasatch Academy] in Mount Pleasant, Utah, called SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Council] and said we've never had a black person in our town.  And we will pay a years' full scholarship if you'll send one out here so we can see what it's like.  And I went, got sent to Mount Pleasant, Utah in the middle of the mountains in a Mormon city in the middle of the snow, had never seen snow before, had a Native American girl as a roommate for that year and that was 1968.  And I'll never forget it because that was the year Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated and had Native Americans and Mormons rubbing my skin to see what it was like to be black.  And I got sent out there by my dad [Hosea Williams] to represent the black race in Utah and that was, that was, that was something I'll never forget because I--the first thing they gave me was a little black mammy doll made out of black cloth that they set on my bed.  They thought they were doing something good for me.  I took that doll and tore it apart and started running up and down the hall screaming, I wanna go home, I wanna go home.  But, but you know there's always this sense of duty.  There is something that you know you have to do this because you have to help get your freedom or, or whatever the purpose is you know, you, you, you, you have to do things for a big reason, for a bigger reason.  You don't just do things because it's Monday and you're going to school.  There's always this bigger reason for things.
Speaker 2: Did you resent white people at the time?
Speaker 1: Umm.
Speaker 2: How did you feel about white people?
Speaker 1: Well I think the reason that I didn't resent white people--
Speaker 2: Did or did not?
Speaker 1: --did not was because there was so many white people in the movement [Civil Rights Movement].  And I grew up seeing them coming and going all the time.
Speaker 2: In Savannah [Georgia]?
Speaker 1: So I knew--in Savannah, yeah.  So I knew that there were good white people and there was dastardly, bad white people.  So I, I, I never was into the black power movement because I knew about Viola Liuzzo that got shot in the back of the head.  I knew about Reverend James Reeb that got beat to death with the baseball bat.  I knew about all these people so I, I could never be like the black power, white man is the devil person.  So I, I had a real good balance in that area.
Speaker 2: What did your father and your family think of Malcolm X then?
Speaker 1: Never talked about Malcolm X.
Speaker 2: Never ever?
Speaker 1: Never ever talked about him.  Never.  We were--we completely ignored Malcolm X.
Speaker 2: But you knew he existed?
Speaker 1: We knew he existed and that there was these black power people out there but that they were never gonna be successful because my daddy said it was like trying to kill an elephant with a BB gun.  And so ain't no need in even talking about it.  And we didn't.
Speaker 2: So eleventh grade you were out with the Mormons?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They give you a doll, you tear it up, you're screaming--
Speaker 1: Un huh.
Speaker 2: --running.
Speaker 1: And then Dr. King gets killed and I have sort of a light nervous breakdown.  Because they're asking who's Dr. King and why am I upset.  And they take me into the auditorium and I'm supposed to do a speech to teach everybody who Dr. King is right before I'm shipped off to the funeral.  And I get up there and I can't do it.  I just can't do it.  I just can't.  And so I come home for the funeral and my dad is very upset about a lot of things.  Very upset about how the murder even took place.  Very upset about the fact that there were no policemen to protect him when there should have been.  Very upset about why the SCLC guard was not in place that day as it should have been.  He is ranting and raving and he won't leave the casket side of the casket.  He's just--everything is broken apart.  Another earthquake has happened and I don't even remember very much about the whole time, that whole time except that everything was black, everything was shrouded.  And my father was very angry at everybody.  So I did go back to Wasatch Academy and finish the year and then I finished my senior year at Boggs Academy [Keysville, Georgia].
Story_ID: 111721
Speaker 1: What did that do for your father [Hosea Williams] and your family and you when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed?  What did that do in reference to you and the movement [Civil Rights Movement]?  Well you were away, so what did that do them in the movement?
Speaker 2: To, to, to them it was--in-fighting that Dr. King was able to kind--see his genius was that he had all these men around him who were different, so different but he knew their unique skills and he could place them in the place where they were the best.  Without him there you had these, I call it all the King's men you know.  They didn't get along because their roles were so different and so they start trying to figure out what was gonna happen.  Didn't really know who's gonna be the president, and who's gonna be the leader and then [Ralph] Abernathy was there, maybe Abernathy should be the leader.  No, he's too, he's too passive, he's really quiet, well may--, you know, make Hosea [Williams], no, no Hosea was too, too crazy.  He's wild, he's too radical.  Well, well what, what about Andy [HM Andrew Young].  I don't know Andy is just you know, he, he, he do too much negotiating.  He's not direct.  So this went on for a while and my father actually was the president at SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] for a while and so, but the first thing that happened with him was that he got sent off to a seventeen-country tour of Africa 'cause they had to get him out.  He knew too much, and he was doing too much talking.
Speaker 1: Meaning he would be killed?
Speaker 2: Meaning he would tell secrets that you're not supposed to tell about what happened to Dr. King.  What he felt happened.  And about how the, the person that they had that shot him is no way in the world he ever could have figured out how to do that.  But he was not the gunman, that there was someone else there.  You know, he was upset about too many things.
Story_ID: 111722
Speaker 1: Well has, has enough time passed for you to tell me what your--why they sent your father [Hosea Williams] away?  I mean can you tell me some of the things he thought happened to Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] like the theories?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that--
Speaker 1: Or what he knew?  I'm interested in what he knew as to why?
Speaker 2: --well what he actually--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I you know I think that I need to really think about that before I say anything publicly in that, in that area.
Speaker 1: Aw.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I need to think about what I, what I, what I need to say--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know because you know we all know that James Earl Ray, that was--didn't kill Dr. King.  We, we--that's an accepted fact that he, he didn't have the intelligence or the skill to pull off that assassination.  And so it was, it was orchestrated by the United States government.  So knowing all that and, and not being able to prove it and also knowing that FBI had plants inside of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] itself--
Speaker 1: Who were the plants?  Has it come out yet?
Speaker 2: --No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  But that day that they were there and that they were on the executive staff.
Speaker 1: Had they infiltrated King's inner--
Speaker 2: Infiltrated King's inner circle.
Speaker 1: Inner circle as well.
Speaker 2: And my Dad knowing--beginning to try to figure things out, they develop this ambassador thing for him.
Speaker 1: Who developed it?
Speaker 2: Andy [HM Andrew Young] and, and, and Bevel [HM Reverend James Bevel] and, and some of the inner city folk--inner circle folk.
Speaker 1: How could they develop that?
Speaker 2: Well he's on the staff.
Speaker 1: Of SCLC?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, he's the president--
Speaker 2: Not.
Speaker 1: --at this point?
Speaker 2: No.  Un-un.
Speaker 1: Oh he wasn't okay.
Speaker 2: So no ,he's on the staff and, and if anything my father was very loyal.  He was always trying to do what he felt was best for the organization even though he didn't like the people who were left there after Dr. King died, because he knew that that the direct action was pretty much over because nothing but the negotiators were left not the direct action people.  So as a staff member they decide that and I don't know who was the president when this was decided, it might have been Abernathy, that Hosea was gonna go on a seventeen-country tour of Africa as an ambassador of SCLC and we are gonna get him out of America for a while.  This is when I'm at Hampton Institute [now Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay so this is--you graduate Boggs Academy [Keysville, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Un-huh.
Speaker 1: In what year?
Speaker 2: '70 [1970]--'69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay and then?
Speaker 2: I go to Hampton.
Speaker 1: In '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: '69 [1969], '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Un-huh.
Speaker 1: And, and your father is sent away in 1970?
Speaker 2: '70 [1970] yes.
Speaker 1: To tour Africa?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: And my mom [Juanita Williams].
Speaker 1: And your mom as well?
Speaker 2: Yes for six months.
Speaker 1: What does the family think?
Speaker 2: For six months.  And I'm in Hampton, again, left out of everything.
Speaker 1: But they're seven children, what about the, the kids?
Speaker 2: Terry Randolph, my father's secretary, is left to be with the children.  Not good.  [Laughing]  Couldn't cook.  Cooked tuna fish casserole every day.  That's what they ate and that's all they ate.  She was his secretary for thirty-five years and she was also the secretary for Dr. King for a while and Dr. [Ralph] Abernathy for a while, ran away from home, white girl.  Ran away from home sixteen years old, joined the movement, never left, is at my office to this day at Feed the Hungry [Hosea Feed The Hungry and Homeless].  So she's there with them and I'm off at Hampton and my mother and father are going all over the world.  First black man to enter China since United States China relationships were reestablished to calm him down and to keep him from talking.  And so that, that's where we--that's where he ended up and I, I'm becoming something between a hippy and a bohemian artist.
Story_ID: 111723
Speaker 1: So you graduate Boggs Academy [Keysville, Georgia], how did you decide on Hampton University [then Hampton Institute, Hampton, Virginia]?  And do you decide that you're gonna major--that you're gonna be an actress at this point?
Speaker 2: No.  They [Omilami's parents, Juanita Williams and Hosea Williams] decided for me.  I didn't decide.
Speaker 1: You didn't decide which school you were gonna go to?
Speaker 2: Just like they decided Boggs Academy.  No.  Next step for you Hampton because I'm supposed to become this lady, you know.  I'm supposed to become this black princess, that's what I'm--that's what they're trying to make me be and it's too late.
Speaker 1: And you're becoming a bohemian?
Speaker 2: Yeah I'm just flat out no bra, t-shirt and blue jeans.  And I come and my dad would say you look like you're homeless. (Laughter)  And I was just you know not hearing all of rest of this stuff.
Speaker 1: What were you doing with your hair at the time, were you wearing a natural or you straightening it?
Speaker 2: Yelp.  Natural.  Yep, wearing a natural just flat out rebellious, mad.  Didn't--left me down there at Boggs Academy, sent me out to Utah, now you send me to Hampton something, I don't even know where this place is.  But I find some people there that, that I like.
Speaker 1: Who are the people that you find--
Speaker 2: [OFF CAMERA:  Hold on one second gonna take a short pause.  Okay.]
Speaker 1: Byron Saunders, Donald Bryant, actors in the theatre department led by [HM] Marjorie Moon who is now the director of the Billie Holliday Theater in New York who was at Hampton at that time, which was--saved my life because I was totally lost.  I didn't fit in anywhere.  I didn't know how to be a regular person.  I remember going to a football game seeing those girls at that game all dressed up and I'm like this is not real.  You guys need to be fighting for your freedom, you know.  What's wrong with you black people.  I didn't fit in anywhere.  Failed philosophy because I got in an argument with the teacher because he was trying to tell me there was no eastern thought, there was only western philosophy.  So, so the theatre was my place to hide.  I could go in the theater and it was dark in there and I didn't have to see anybody, I didn't have to look at anybody.  I could become somebody else and I was really good at what I did.  So that's all that mattered for me and so that's where I buried myself.  That's where I, I committed myself totally and completely to the theater.
Story_ID: 111724
Speaker 1: Where were the other daughters of the Civil Rights Movement, King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] daughters, Malcolm's [Malcolm X] daughters?  Where were they?  Did you, did you, did--I mean I guess I'm assuming that all of you would have that in common--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --so that you would be in contact with one another.
Speaker 2: To some degree, but usually the King kids were at the hotel and when the march was nearing the end, they would drive up and get in the front.--
Speaker 1: But I even mean--
Speaker 2: --So I had been--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --sleeping outside in the mud in Resurrection City when they were in the hotel.  When my father [Hosea Williams] was the president--was the mayor [sic, Director of National Mobilization] of the Poor People's Campaign in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay, let's start that again 'cause I jumped in.  So start again.
Speaker 2: There was a difference in how the King kids and even the [Ralph] Abernathy kids were related to the movement even as my younger siblings were related.  I think as I remember it that they were not allowed to be in the marches and in the, in the, in the, in the grit--in the grime of the movement because there was a fear for their lives.  You know they, they, they could be killed at any moment.  So they were, they were kept away from and then my father was you know the, the field captain.  He was the one that was with the people and, and, and, and doing a level of work whereas they were on a upper level of more--a higher echelon of participation.  So I--you know, Yolanda [King] and I came in contact with each other a little bit coming and going and, and, and shared our love for the arts.  But I didn't run into them that much.  I don't think they ever went to jail.  So see there was even classifications of functions in the movement and where my dad was it was, it was different than where they were.
Story_ID: 111725
Speaker 1: So you fall in love with the theater.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I do pretty well in college [at Hampton Institute, now Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Can you talk to be about, I think name escapes me, but she's in New York now the head of the Billie Holiday Theatre.
Speaker 2: Yes, [HM] Marjorie Moon.
Speaker 1: Marjorie Moon.
Speaker 2: Marjorie Moon was--is a lifesaver for me because she took me as a young woman and taught me my gift.  She was a wonderful coach, a wonderful, wonderful teacher.  All of the people that were in my graduating class are still functioning as theater artists, which is a testimony to how she poured into our lives.  And because she was there for me I made it through college.  She was a mother figure.  She was a sister.  She was--she became everything to me.  And I you know I owe what I do know in terms of the theater to her.  Yeah, and I might need to track her down and tell her that.  So I stay in Hampton and you know I did a normal thing college folks do.  Luckily I never got into any heavy drug use, which I--which was a blessing.
Speaker 1: Because it was the '70s [1970s] and everyone did it.
Speaker 2: Everyone did it yeah.  I was smoking a lot of marijuana and I say that in my testimony.  But in terms of heroin and cocaine and stuff like that I--we didn't have that there, had acid.  But white folks did acid.  We didn't do acid.  That was--that sent you off the edge.  So I stayed pretty stable.  Couldn't drink, you know, alcohol always made me sick to the stomach so I, I didn't have that problem.
Speaker 1: But the theater life is it something you had resumed from childhood?  Remember when you talking about as a kid or was this actually the first--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --professional opportunity at Hampton that you've been given to act?  Or did you do it as a child?
Speaker 2: Yes.  From, from playing in the mirror to Boggs Academy [Keysville, Georgia], didn't have any drama at St. Benedict [Catholic School, Savannah, Georgia].  But a lot of--that's all I ever did at Boggs Academy was the drama club.  So I, I didn't start out at Hampton as a theater major, I started out as a psychology major.  But then when I started running into problems in these philosophy classes, I started looking to theater and decided to major in, in theater and they had two choices.  You could direct or--three actually, direct, technical theater or acting.  And I chose acting.
Speaker 1: What did your parents [Juanita Williams and Hosea Williams] think?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess they were just glad I was staying out of trouble.  They didn't really--they always kind of supported me.  You know, I don't ever remember them saying anything you know because they had this philosophy if you say too much to children about the choices that they make, then they can blame you when they grow up if it's the wrong choice.  So that was their theory.  Well, we'll just watch her.  Make sure she's you know don't you know do anything really crazy because she kind of freaked out on us at Wasatch Academy [Mount Pleasant, Utah].  So she seems pretty stable right now.  So we'll just let her keep going, see what happens.
Story_ID: 111726
Speaker 1: So what happened after they [Omilami's parents, Juanita Williams and Hosea Williams] finish the tour in Africa for six months?
Speaker 2: Well, when my father went to China, he met with Mao Tse-tung and observed how Mao was using theater and the arts to propagandize to people.  And found it to be a powerful tool for educating the people and, and about the--whatever philosophy it was that you want to educate them about.  So when I graduated from Hampton [Institute, now Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and came back to Atlanta [Georgia], well, well when he got--you ask me what happened when he got back from Africa?  He started several organizations.  One of them was the Poor People's Union [of America] here in Atlanta where he was organizing workers who had at that time had no union to do--to, to help them with their employee rights.  Another one, when he back to SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] at first, that didn't work out and it was a national organization so he started the metro Atlanta chapter of SCLC and he was the president of that.  He started investigating, running for politics because he always felt that black people should vote.  So he ran my mother for office and he ran for office.
Speaker 1: What year did he run with your mother?
Speaker 2: Now that's what we have to go back and find out because I graduated from college in '73 [1973] and so when I graduated and, and I know I was here until at least '81 [1981] when I left for New York.  I got married in '75 [1975] so she must--she must have run for office in the early '70s [1970s] again because she ran a first--the first time back in the '60s [1960s] when I say she was the first black woman elected, okay, so I have to track all that down.  I'm not sure about that.  But I know that when I got back from college he was at metro Atlanta chapter of SCLC and then I don't know when he started getting--he first got elected he was a city councilman and then he was a state legislator and then he was a DeKalb County Commissioner before he left the, the suites for the streets.  Now in 1971, though he started Hosea Feed the Hungry.
Story_ID: 111727
Speaker 1: So 1971.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your father [Hosea Williams] meets Mao Tse-tung.  He sees what the Chinese were doing--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with theater?
Speaker 2: Yes, and he's very impressed what by seeing all those little Chinese people all thinking one thought.  And so he--I graduate from Hampton [Institute, now Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] in '73 [1973] in theater.  Come home and so he says you know what I'm gonna sponsor a theater company for you.  And I want you to use that theater company to educate the people about current events and to, to about getting their freedom 'cause remember we're still trying to get our freedom, which he thought we would have already had but it didn't happen.  So we start SCLC People['s] Survival Theater, me and my dad over at David T. Howard High School [Atlanta, Georgia].  The first thing we do is create lunch time series where actors come together and they have a skeletal characterization and they act and discuss current events every day at lunch time.  So whatever was in the newspaper, we'd read the newspaper in the morning and then we'd get together and we would have a, a lunch time where people would come and bring their lunch and sit and eat.  And these actors would discuss the current events in the newspaper.
Speaker 1: Can you name some of those actors in the People's Survival Theater?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Byron Saunders who's still here in Atlanta [Atlanta], Don Bryan who's, who's here in Atlanta, Carol Mitchell-Leon still here, she's the chairman of the theater department at Clark [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], worked with us also Bill Nunn [ph.] worked with us then.  I hadn't met my husband [Afemo Omilami] yet so and, and those are a few of the people that were with us then.
Speaker 1: So tell--take--talk to me about one of those lunch time events.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, we for example, there was at that time, which is a time that I got a--I start get arrested again as soon as I got out of Hampton [laughter].  So we were trying to--we were marching for [A.] Reginald Eaves to become the Chief of Police of the City of Atlanta and they had a, a--my father felt like that they had rigged the elections and you know I mean so we, we had actors that were discussing why Reginald Eaves ought to be the, the, the Police Chief of the City of Atlanta.  Got arrested marching for against employee rights for Church's Chicken, and Sears and Roebuck [Sears, Robeuck & Company] and Rich's Department Store because my father was running the Poor People's Union then.  So all of these political activities we would roll up into scripts and discuss 'em during lunch time and we were also doing a season of shows.  We did Derek Walcott, 'Ti-Jean and his Brothers.'  We did Tom--'Contributions' [sic, 'Contribution'] by Ted Shine, which is where I met, met my husband in '75 [1975].  You know we did, we did professional seasonal--season of shows along with the lunch time theater.
Speaker 1: Where was the theater located, the address?
Speaker 2: David T. Howard High School which is still there here in Atlanta, Georgia in a little--now this is before my father padlocked the door, but in, in a little brick building there on the campus of David T. Howard High School and we're going along just fine because see I brought two people that graduated from Hampton University home with me to Atlanta to start this theater company, but they didn't have the philosophy for the purpose of the theater that my Dad had.  He hired both of them.  Gave them jobs right out of college to work on his staff and we would do theater and we would do his newspaper because he had a newspaper called the People's Crusader.  So we would lay it out and type it up and write the articles and we were responsible for that.  But the conflict came when he felt that the theater should be doing social action theater.  And there needed to be some--he needed to be able to dictate to us the kinds of theater that we did whereas Byron just wanted to do theater just for theater sake.  Didn't have to have a purpose, didn't have to have meaning.  So we get to the theater one morning and the theater doors are padlocked shut and that was the end of that particular phase of "People's Survival Theater" but it went on because we just got some actors together and moved it to another space called, called the [Royal] Peacock on--in the space that's now the--not the Purple Peacock, but on Auburn Avenue.  It still exists and we started doing theater up there for a while.
Story_ID: 111728
Speaker 1: But then I had fallen in love so I--by that time.
Speaker 2: Before you fall in love, we're gonna rewind a little bit.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I wanna go back because--to Hampton University [then Hampton Institute, Hampton, Virginia] in particular, and I wanna talk about your training as an actress.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You were trained using what method?  Like [simultaneous] [Konstantin] Stanislavsky [Stanislavski's system]?
Speaker 1: Stanislavski, absolutely the method.  We were trained at Hampton to, to--
Speaker 2: [I'm sorry; can you just pull your dress up?]
Speaker 1: [Oops yes.]  We were--
Speaker 2: There you go.  Start with Stanslavski['s system] again.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were--[HM] Marjorie [Moon] believed in the method so that the actor had to be broken down to her, her least common denominator to be able to be honest enough to reveal the character.  So we did everything from running and exercising until we pass out.  There were therapy light sessions where we wept and we cried.  There was all--you know you just worked deep into the night until you were exhausted.  Emotional memory where you had to go back in your childhood and back in your life and pull up a real event that broke your heart and then hold it close enough to your sleeve to be able to put the character's heartbreak on top of that and use that emotion in the scene.  So you were constantly pulling up these things that either hurt you or what was your most horrible event, what was your most wonderful event and you had to be very transparent and, and we were.  And we were like being married to each other.  We were just that close.
Speaker 2: Well, did people know that you were an activist?
Speaker 1: No.  It came out in the discussions, but--
Speaker 2: But no one knew who your father [Hosea Williams] was?  Was he not as well-known now as he was--he was not as well-known then as he is now?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Oka,y so no one knew that you were a product of this?
Speaker 1: They--yes they did but they didn't treat me any differently.  I wasn't a celebrity.  All she wanted to know was was I willing to give--what I had to give for her to turn us into good actors.  So we were all the same.  We were all just after that honest moment after, after that catharsis, that emotional catharsis which is right up my alley because I need passion in my lifem see.  I need extremes.  I'm not used to living sort of in the lukewarm life.  I need extremes.  I need great pain, great passion, great, great sexuality in my life so this is what I get from the theater so I play these roles where I can emote and I can just you know just live out that passion on the stage.
Speaker 2: What roles were you allowed to play at Hampton University?
Speaker 1: Well we did roles like--I was you know like '[A] Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry].  We did some [HM] Melvin Van Peebles stuff.  We did Ted Shine, Derek Walcott.  We did Richard, Richard-not Richard Wright, but the black playwrights at that--[HM] Sonia Sanchez, the 'for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enough' [Ntozake Shange], the, the things that, that reflected and then we also did some classics and some [Anton] Chekhov and, and didn't really do a lot of [William] Shakespeare at Hampton so I didn't know anything about Shakespeare when I graduated.  Britt [ph.] and, and, and--
Speaker 2: Nixon and them.
Speaker 1: --yes, yes.  So we, we, we just kind of flowed with the typical college fair.  But Marjorie had these connections with these playwrights in New York like from the Frank Silvera Writers' Workshop and so we would get some of the new, new scripts in as well.
Speaker 2: So at that time once you started to pursue--well start to--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --train as an actress, were you--the goal was to do what you're doing now just to become an actress?
Speaker 1: I didn't understand what that meant.  No, that was one of the faults I think of the program is that it didn't teach us how to be professional actors.  I was acting for free (laughter) you know.  I, I when--of course I had my own theater company when I first came here but then nobody told us now you go to theater companies and you get an agent so you can do movies and you--we didn't have the business part of the arts at all.  So I was completely ignorant as to what to do with all of this.  Thank God I did have People's Survival Theater Company because it gave me a vehicle after I left Hampton and somewhere to go and something to do for those three, three years that--four years that I was in it.
Story_ID: 111729
Speaker 1: Were there--had you ever seen any professional black actors at this point like on stage?  A black play on Broadway or a black any black theater that was--
Speaker 2: No, no. I mean, my father [Hosea Williams] took us to New York to see Sammy Davis, Jr. in 'Golden Boy' when I was a little girl and that's when I was smitten with acting.  And you know but at Hampton [Institute, now Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] we didn't really know we didn't.  We were doing it for academic reasons and they didn't--weren't able to take us much further than that.  And we would see of course you know people on movies blaxploitation films were out at that time but didn't ever think about doing that.
Speaker 1: Did you know of any like you were doing 'A Raisin in the Sun,"  you knew the play had been on Broadway?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes we did.  But none, none of us left that program saying I'm gonna go to New York and be an actor because it, it was, it was not--it was kind of left out of the equation.--
Speaker 1: Well what--
Speaker 2: --Because see we were supposed to go get a MFA [master of fine arts].  That's the track that we were on and then become another [HM] Marjorie Moon, not become a professional actor.  I think that was the mindset of the school that we were supposed to go get an MFA and then we would work at the University which is what we all did.  That's everybody in that program started going down that track and, and so many of them are working at universities today.  But because we had "People Survival Theater" to come home to, me and Byron [Saunders] and, and, and, and Don [Bryan], three of us left Hampton and came--moved to Atlanta [Georgia].  That's how we got involved with professional theater and found out you could get paid doing it.  Because there was some money available then called CETA [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act] money.  And my Dad made sure we got some of it and that's how we were paid to act.
Speaker 1: What does that acronym stand for CETA money?
Speaker 2: City Employment Training Act [sic].  There was money from Washington that was supposed to train young people just out of college, pay them to continue to train and work in the community.  So that's what we used and we paid ourselves and I did "People Survival Theater" along with helping my dad in various--
Story_ID: 111730
Speaker 1: He ran for [U.S.] Congress, he ran for this and out to get that.
Speaker 2: What did you do on the campaigns when he ran for Congress?  And what year was it, if you can remember.
Speaker 1: I don't remember the years that he ran for office but my function was usually to like when we were growing up we would--when we were growing up we had to get up at six o'clock in the morning and we would get put out on the street corner with a can to beg for money.  And we would stand on that street corner from six a.m. until such and such a time, at the bus stations and at Marta [Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority] and that's how he got money to you know to do--and that's how he would raise money in a grassroots way.  So I did mailings, I did layout and paste up for newspaper.  I did commun--I did media, made sure he got interviews and got on TV and made phone calls to, to the media so those--that was kind of like my area, the, the, the newspaper, media relations and the mailing, mass mailings.
Story_ID: 111731
Speaker 1: So in 1970--when do you come back to Atlanta [Georgia]?  1970--
Speaker 2: '73 [1973], '74 [1974] is when I come back and, and, and I meet my husband in '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: And how do you meet your husband [Afemo Omilami]?
Speaker 2: In a play.  We're doing Ted Shines' 'Contributions' [sic, 'Contribution'] where I'm playing a grandmother and he's playing the son and the son is a radical and he doesn't understand his grandmother in the play and all the while she's putting--grinding up a glass and putting it in her master's cornbread and killing off white folk left and right so that's the kind of the theme of the play and he's just coming back now from the African village, remember the Oyotunji [African Village, Sheldon, South Carolina].  So he comes back from the African village as Bohemian as you can get because he's walking up and down over there at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] with no shoes on, singing in an African language at the top of his voice.  He wanders into People's Survival Theater and auditions for the son in this play and we're like and he's the most fabulous actor you have ever met.  Because he has been trained at Morehouse under the tutelage of those--of the people over there that were just like [HM] Marjorie Moon before he leaves the, the--and I have to get the names of those professors for you.  And so that's where we meet and, and, and I fall in love first sight.  I don't know about him, but for me it was.  And that was in '75 [1975].  And he--'75 [1975] we start doing People's Survival Theater together and he joins the theater company and when we're doing plays '75 [1975], '76 [1976] we get married in '77 [1977] and I, I, I have my son [Awodele Omilami] '78 [1978], '77 [1977] we move to New York.

Speaker 1: Before you moved to New York in 1971, your father [Hosea Williams] has the impetus to start the food program?  How (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Hosea Feed the Hungry [and Homeless].
Speaker 1: --Why did he do that?
Speaker 2: He's working for- at SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], Metro of Atlanta [Georgia] SCLC and he comes down the street and he still has a relationship with the national office.  He's on Auburn Avenue and sees a man in the gutter, you know, asking him for money.  So he goes--the fish market is still there.  He goes in the fish market and gets him a sandwich and the man eats through the paper, he's so hungry.  He's eating the waxed paper and the fish sandwich and everything all at the same time.  And my dad is always been a man of action, you know.  And as you do research about him, you'll hear all kinds of things.  He was crazy.  He was a drunk.  He couldn't drive.  He was, you know, he was this wild man.  But one thing about him he was--when he saw a need, he would meet it immediately.  So he walked right across the street, met with Reverend Williams Holmes Boarders.  They got the educational building and he started feeding 100 men every Sunday and my mom [Juanita Williams] would make the soup and the cornbread 'cause he pulled her into everything he did and she was very obedient wife--for a while.  (Laughter) But guess we'll talk about that later because they, they did separate later on in life.  But and they start feeding 100 homeless men and that was in 1971.  So that was only on Sunday though.
Speaker 1: But that was even prior to the People's Survival Theater (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's correct.
Speaker 1: So how was he getting the money to feed the people on Sundays?
Speaker 2: He was paying for it out of his pocket.  He's paying for it.  And he never had great income.  I mean he only had his pension from the [U.S.] Army, some check coming in from the army and something coming in from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  But he would, he would go and raise the money and he was determined from that day on that he was gonna feed the hungry every Sunday and he did until the day he died.  And it not- became not just every Sunday of course.  So this whole idea that, that there must be purpose in life and that your life is nothing compared to the overall need for freedom is still a theme.
Story_ID: 111733
Speaker 1: So did he [Omilami's father, Hosea Williams] stop doing civil rights?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And start more feeding people?
Speaker 2: Did it all at once.
Speaker 1: All at once.  So what civil rights issues did he tackle like in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Employment rights.  Because you had all these big department stores and none of these people had any kind of wage laws.  They were not under the maids and the janitors and the people that worked for these companies so he was very much trying to organize them and then he had scope, which I hope you will talk to my sister Barbara [Emerson] about, because every summer all these white kids would come down from the North and they would have these freedom schools and all these rural cities and they would teach people how to pass the voter registration test so that he was very much into voter registration and empowering black people to register to vote, employee rights and then politics.  He knew that he would be an elected official of some kind one day.  So all of that--and then he always had a business because he had a chemical company because he was a chemist.  So he had Southeastern Chemical Company [Southeast Chemical Manufacturing and Distributing Company] and he developed these formulas for biodegradable janitorial chemicals and so he would sell the chemicals to get the money to put into the movement [Civil Rights Movement].  And so he always had a business that was sustainable income going on as well as his movement activities.  So Southeastern Chemical Company was going on too at that same time.  So he was doing all this stuff at the same time which is why everybody in my family is a workaholic.  We never took a family vacation.  We don't know how to relax.  I still work sixteen, seventeen-hour days and I have to force myself to go to sleep at two a.m. because all my life I was woken up at five or six a.m. and I--and if you were caught sitting down and resting you were a lazy slaggard and you got a tongue lashing.  So all of us are, we're just workaholics and he was too.
Speaker 1: So did he [Hosea Williams] ever take any time during the early days of the movies to--were there ever any moments when he or your mom [Juanita Williams] felt like oh, we have accomplished something?  We've done it or did they ever feel a sense of accomplishment?  Like did anything happen?
Speaker 2: They did; it didn't last long.  'Cause there's always something else.  There were successes yes, like Church's Chicken for example, they ended up having a employee contract as a result of, of, of Sears and Roebuck [Sears, Roebuck & Company] negotiated with him and did better things for their employees.  There was this bank C&S Bank [Community & Southern Bank] you know.  So--
Speaker 1: What was the issue with C&S Bank?
Speaker 2: --It was, it was discrimination and employment and hiring and in wages because the whites were making more per hour than the blacks.  So all these movements resulted in positive effects as well as his eventual election to public office, but there was always a drive.  There's never enough.  There's never a time to sit and relax because you gotta be crisis driven, you gotta be living at the extreme you know.  I think about him when I think about these drinks they have out today that are these, these energy drinks--
Speaker 1: Red Bull.
Speaker 2: --yes, yes.  He was the bull in the china cabinet.  So that's, that's kind of how you know I--that's how I got to be that way.  One day I woke up and I realize you don't have to fight everyday of your life.  You can have a day where you just sit and you know but that was like forty by the time I figured that out.
Story_ID: 111734
Speaker 1: So did he [Hosea Williams] ever like in the latter years like in the '70s [1970s] and like after King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died, then you had [HM] Jesse Jackson come on the scene, [HM] Al Sharpton came on the scene, was there ever any national camaraderie between those guys?  Or everyone stayed pretty much local to their own towns?  Like did he ever engage with Jesse Jackson or with Al Sharpton?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What about when the in like '78 [1978] when those children were being murdered in Atlanta [Atlanta Child Murders, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Un-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: What role did your father play in, in, in that, in that black lead?
Speaker 2: Never, never believed that, that, that guy that they arrested--
Speaker 1: Wayne Williams.
Speaker 2: --Wayne Williams was the one what killed those children.  He actually went and visited Wayne Williams in prison and talked with him and always believed that he was the scapegoat as does [HM] Dick Gregory and many others that he was not--that he was set up for the crime.  So you know always felt that it was the [Ku Klux] Klan that was very much involved in the Atlanta Child Murders and spoke out to that effect.  He would always say what he thought, which is why he really didn't have a good relationship with the black elite in Atlanta.  You know Atlanta was the only city that Martin Luther King could never have a movement in because Atlanta has always been a city of negotiation not direct action.  The black elite in Atlanta don't march, they don't make a fuss and they don't rock the boat.  They negotiate.  Hosea Williams was a direct action individual that's what he lived for.  So there was always a conflict in a, in a, and a rough relationship between he and, and the black elite in Atlanta and intelligentsia from the University and so forth as was with him and other national leaders so yeah.
Speaker 1: Well what, what would he say to you guys at home about Wayne Williams?  Like when all of this was happening even before they arrested Wayne--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --I mean there was a lot of attention in Atlanta between--[simultaneous]
Speaker 2: Yeah, he always felt it was the Klan from the very beginning.  He always felt like they were killing black children.  There was a wave of killing of black children and that it was the Ku Klux Klan doing it.  Now that, that's, that's how he felt.  Dick Gregory felt like there was some scientific experiment going on where they needed the, the sperm and stuff from these children.  But my dad just always felt it was Ku Klux Klan just decided they were gonna kill a bunch of black, black children.  So he never felt like Wayne Williams.  But Wayne Williams was somehow able--they were able to set him up for it because of, of the relationships that he had with some of the people who died, who were killed, who were murdered.
Speaker 1: Were you in Atlanta at the time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What were your feelings?
Speaker 2: I felt that I agree with my dad.  That it was the Klan you know and, and we ran into you know in 19-- with the Forsyth County march some of those same people.  I feel, I feel as though it could have been also some of our skinhead-kind of radical groups but I think it was a decision made by this group of people that, that we're gonna do this now and, and I don't know why, but I don't know why.
Speaker 1: What were the reactions of other black like--because you had a black police chief at the time?
Speaker 2: Un-huh.
Speaker 1: What was his--was it Les Brown?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: Ooh no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Was it Reggie Eaves [A. Reginald Eaves]?
Speaker 1: That could be verified [Public Safety Commissioner Lee P. Brown].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you did have a black police--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --chief at the time?
Speaker 2: Everybody I think the entire community was very surprised when they arrested Wayne Williams; one individual to kill all these children?  There's no way.  No one here believes that that one individual did all those murders.  Now you'll find various degrees of, of, of who it was, but I don't think anybody if you look under the covers would say, oh yeah, he killed all those children.
Speaker 1: So that ended like in the late '70s [1970s] I guess, 1979 or '80 [1980] [sic, 1981] Wayne Williams was arrested.
Speaker 2: Un-huh, un-huh--
Story_ID: 111735
Speaker 1: --And you at that time was happily married and moved to?
Speaker 2: We moved to New York in 1970--let me see wait a minute.  My husband [Afemo Omilami], let me see we were married in '75 [1975] so I moved to New York in '76 [1976] and I was there you know country bumpkin leaving Atlanta, Georgia going to the big city, had never been to New York before in my life.  Start looking for apartments at Lenox [Avenue] and 116th Street.  Never seen junkies standing outside on the sidewalk like statues before.  And I was completely out of my element and New York chewed me up and spit me out, because they saw me coming.  I was wide-eyed and bushy-tailed.  And I was I was taken advantage of by many in the big city.
Speaker 1: Well I hate to leave on a down note because we only have one minute on this tape [laughter] so do you have any good stories about New York that we could end with?
Speaker 2: I do, I love the city.  I miss the energy.  The artistic stimulation is just incredible there.  You know, when I say it spit me up and chewed me out, I meant in terms of me just not being able to manipulate my way through the place.
Speaker 1: But you went there to pursue theater?
Speaker 2: I went there to follow my husband.  Yeah.  And I ended up working at all the black theaters in the city as an administrator.  I worked for Rosetta LeNoire.  I worked for [HM] Woodie King [Jr.].  I worked at Frank Silvera.  So I mean I got to meet all these great folks while I was there and I worked for [HM] Melvin Van Peebles for several years.
Speaker 1: Well, when we come back we can pick it up with the New York theater scene.  Can you feel me in on what the theater scene was like--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the late '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 111736
Speaker 1: Thank you.  We are continuing with Elizabeth [now Elisabeth Omilami] on day two--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of our interview.  Today is April?
Speaker 2: 13th.
Speaker 1: April 13th.
Speaker 2: Un-huh.
Story_ID: 111737
Speaker 1: Why did you move to New York to begin with?  I don't know if I asked you that question.
Speaker 2: Well my husband [Afemo Omilami] actually was acting here in New York--in Atlanta [Georgia] and some scouts came here from NYU [New York University, New York City, New York] and they went around and saw several plays and after they saw him, they offered him a full scholarship to study with actually, actually study with [Constantin] Stanislavski because he was still alive at that time.  And we thought it was just a great opportunity to be in New York, have your expenses paid and study and perhaps you know get a career--kickoff your career so, so he left and he was there for a year and then I joined him after that.  That was '76 [1976], '77 [1977] somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: So had you at that time dispersed the, People's Survival Theater was no more?
Speaker 2: I turned it over to a friend of mine, Eddie Billups [ph.] who then started doing plays under that name at the [Royal] Peacock on Auburn Avenue.  So it continued for several years after, after my, after my departure until he, he got ill and it, it stopped then.
Speaker 1: So it's, excuse me, 1976, '77 [1977]--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --you moved to New York City?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you start to work within the theater scene?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people you worked with?
Speaker 2: When I first got there I worked for Rosetta LeNoire at her theater and actually that was when 'Mama, I Want to Sing' was created there.  So I was working there then--working in arts administration always wanting to act but never saying anything because I had to be the breadwinner for a while.  And I went from there and worked for--at New Heritage Theater for about a year and then I went to New Federal Theatre with [HM] Woodie King [Jr.].  And I was working there when I met [HM] Melvin Van Peebles and he needed a personal assistant and so I was referred to him and I became his personal assistant '78 [1978], '79 [1979].  That was the year that I worked for him at Y-E-A-H, Yeah Incorporated on, on I think it was 46th Street and that was kind of exciting time because that was when he did his Broadway show 'Waltz of the Stork' and he--and I watched him turn his son Mario [Van Peebles], into a Hollywood star sort of very strategically.  I mean he was, he, he had a, a seat on Wall Street at that time and then a very, very wealthy friend of his donated him to help him to--as an angel to help him support his writing.  He was an icon for me because during my college years you know we did his plays and so I really felt like I was in the right place to, to learn some things.  But then I had to make a choice because I was given ultimatum you know.  Do you, do you--because I kept talking about acting.  And one day he said, well you know you need to let me know do you want to be an actress or do you wanna be my personal assistant.  I will make sure you are taken care of.  I will give you a very good salary and I will be traveling all over the place and so forth, but you can't act.  You can't do both.  And so I decided that I, I didn't wanna be his administrative assistant, I wanted to act so I, I left there and then I, I didn't work anywhere for a while and then I got pregnant with my daughter Juanita and decided that I, I was afraid to raise her in New York.  I was still very, very much a country girl.  You know I mean I had, had manipulated the snow and put my baby on my back and took him to the social, black social workers' daycare center and I figured out you know how to manipulate myself around New York but I, there was something about the street that we lived on and also my son, we came home to visit my mother [Juanita Williams] and he looked at her house and he said, why does big mama live in a park?  And I said, what do you mean?  Said her house is in the middle of the park.  So he had never seen a house with a yard and I realized that then.  I said oh my goodness because we were living on the 8th floor on Edgecombe Avenue you know and 145th Street in St. Nicholas area.  So I, I told my husband I say I need to, I need to go home with these children.  I wanna raise them in the South.  And he stayed in New York for a year.  But his loyalty was so much so to his family that after that year, I left everything up there, furniture, everything.  Just packed my children up and came home.  He, he came home about a year and a half later.
Story_ID: 111738
Speaker 1: Can you go back to Melvin's [HM Melvin Van Peebles] Broadway show?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Because I'm not that familiar with [simultaneous]
Speaker 2: 'Waltz of the Stork.'
Speaker 1: What, what was it called?
Speaker 2: 'Waltz of the Stork.'  He was actually--it was--it actually bombed pretty badly [laughter] but he was actually in a stork suit with feet and, and feathers and the whole nine yards and he had the backers though to pay to produce the play and it was about New York.  I know one of the songs 'Broke and All Alone in New York City, "the heat was bad and my TV was going on the blink.  I pulled up, up a friend and we were going to a party one where they were giving out free drinks and I was sipping Gin and Tonic when I first saw your face, you had a smile that lit the whole room and a pair of big bow legs, mm, mm, mm.' And that was you know I just love the way he would write.  But it, it, it didn't stay, it didn't stay on long.
Speaker 1: What was the scene like, behind the scenes like were people fanatic about him like the scene creating--him creating a Broadway show in New York City in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He had a lot of support from--
Speaker 1: Blacks and whites?
Speaker 2: --blacks and whites who would come and, and he had a piano in the office and they would just sit there and write everyday all day, just sit there and write songs.  He was working on a new play and they--it was sort of a group of artists and businessmen.  It was interesting because it was more about the business than it was that I realized that it was about sort of this kind of poor artist.  It wasn't, it wasn't like that.  And then he decided that his son [HM Mario Van Peebles] was gonna be a star.  His son was gonna go to Hollywood.  So he brought him in and you know they would strip him down and put oil--baby oil on his body and take these pictures and make him look real sexy and I mean strategically knew how to create a star.  And before I knew it Mario was doing movies.  So it was just--that was all just very interesting to watch and observe as to how that process takes place.
Story_ID: 111739
Speaker 1: What was happening with your father [Hosea Williams] in Atlanta [Georgia] when you were in New York?  Because you, you were daddy's girl.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  But I had found another daddy.  [Laughter]  You know once, once I met Afemo [Omilami] I just transferred a lot of that passion to him and, and I just fell head over heels in love with him.  My father actually married us on the front yard of our home on East Lake here in Atlanta and it was an African wedding and--but I--so I didn't, so I didn't feel a sense of separation at that time from my family.  I was determined that we were gonna be a success in New York and--but that I think that was the time that my father's political career was taking off in terms of the city council and he served on city council for several terms and was a state legislator that was during that season and my mother [Juanita Williams] was of course working in his campaigns.
Speaker 1: So your father became a politician during the time you were in New York City?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: So when you were pregnant and decided to come back to New York City, what was he doing?
Speaker 2: He was an elected official.  He was a State Legislator, actually he was in his last term as City Council when I came home and then a state--but in still marching though because the year after I came home was the Forsyth County [Civil Rights] March where we're attacked by 300 Ku Klux Klan right ten minutes outside of Atlanta.
Speaker 1: That was 1981 [sic, 1987]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Let's go--let's talk about that event.  How did it come about?  Let's talk about the set up for it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  He was he was contacted by a group of nice white people at a church in Forsyth County.  They wanted to do a Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] celebration and they invited him to come and speak.  And they were gonna do a short little march about you know maybe half a mile from one point to the courthouse and then he was gonna speak and, and talk to them about Martin Luther King.  And so we got a bus and there were about sixteen to eighteen of us on the bus and we came--went to the King Center.  My son was seven years old.  He was with me.  And my husband was in, in New York, not with us then.  And we got on the bus and took off down the highway to Lake Lanier just about ten minutes but when we got to the exit for Lake Lanier, we saw this one white man waving his arms like go back, go back, go back.  We said what is he doing?  He was just was standing there waving no, no and the bus pulled off the exit anyway.  And he said man y'all gotta go back.  There's 300 Klansmen down there and four regalia and they are waiting for you all.  The word got that y'all were gonna do this and you know the story of Forsyth County is that seventy-five years ago they had a white woman accuse a black man of raping her.  They went through the town and packed up every--took people out of their houses, packed up every black person on the trucks and drove them to Alabama and dropped them off.  I mean they left stoves burning, food cooking, they left all their belongings, they left everything.  And there hadn't been a black person living in Forsyth County in seventy-five years.  So that's the history of this place.  But my father decided to go on.  And so when we got further on down the road, we had to get off the bus and the bus had to shield us from the Klansmen that were throwing everything at us from manure to feces to urine, the bricks.  They beat that--they broke every window in that luxury passenger bus with broom handles, with--I didn't hear any gunshots or anything like that and I saw little babies in Klan, that's the first time in a long time I'd seen like five years olds with the cap and the thing in the cross and everything.  Just you know starch whites.  So we had to get back on the bus and come back to Atlanta and in two weeks but it got on the news that people were beat.  It got on the news that again here's Hosea Williams getting beat, blood being shed and the reaction causing a change in society.  Here again he's playing that same role we talked about before and two weeks after that 35,000 people just swarmed on the city of Atlanta and we marched again.  And we finished the march that day.  So I, I just felt like I had stepped back in time.  I couldn't believe this was still happening.
Story_ID: 111740
Speaker 1: Well, what made Oprah Winfrey come?  Because she came to that same town during the same time correct?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  I think someone called her because it became a national story then said, this is not Forsyth County.  We're good white people.  Come down here, bring your show you know and so she said okay.  I'm gonna bring my show and I wanna prove to the world that there's nice white people in Forsyth County.  Well we thought that was completely an antiphrasis to what should have been happening.  So we marched against her.  We were picketing her show as it was going on.  And of course we were arrested and I was the first black woman to spend the night in a Forsyth County jail in seventy-five years.  But she--some Klansman snuck on her show and if you could get--if we could get a copy of that show I would love it because he told her you know but you're not a regular nigger.  You can stay here.  But she got out of town before dark.  So that, that's kind of--and then after that you know my father just never did quite know how to catapult that though.  Catapult himself into a national leader.  Because he was so tied to the people here that he never really got the recognition that he that he deserved.
Story_ID: 111741
Speaker 1: So do you think that had anything to do with the deal he [Hosea Williams] made with [President] Ronald Reagan during Ronald Reagan's--?
Speaker 2: No, I mean when, when he went to meet with Ronald Reagan, he actually was invited to the White House while he was in jail in DeKalb County and flew up to meet with Ronald Reagan and made a deal that if Ronald Reagan said if you would campaign for me throughout the South, I will make sure that Martin Luther King's birthday becomes a national holiday.  Now this is political suicide for Hosea Williams because he's a Democrat.  And for him to come back and start campaigning for Ronald Reagan everybody had thought he was crazy and but he never told anybody about the deal.  He only told the family so that we would understand what he was doing.  He idolized Dr. King and he was not so tied to any one party.  He went the way that his convictions led him and he did campaign for Ronald Reagan and Ronald Reagan won and made Dr. King's holiday--birthday a national holiday.  So it wasn't about a particular party or a particular group of people or anything, it was about what do I believe is right at any given time for him.
Speaker 1: Did he ask you guys to vote for Ronald Reagan in the family?
Speaker 2: No.  No, he didn't.  He left all that up to us you know and for us it was always you know the lesser of two evils.  What, what, what you know you have to vote because I mean the, the Voting Rights Act came about as a result of his Selma to Montgomery March so here again he's a catalyst for major change without getting the credit for it and never really wanted the credit.  But he never told us how to vote.  Just wanted to make sure we voted.
Story_ID: 111742
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know if I got the story, but I'm gonna ask again.  When did he [Hosea Williams] himself become an ordained minister?
Speaker 2: He was ordained by Ralph Abernathy.  But he, he didn't--he wasn't--he didn't agree with the way that organized church was run because in his mind many preachers lived well.  They drove big cars, they lived in nice houses while their congregations couldn't catch the bus and didn't have money for food.  So he saw that as a contradiction.  So we--he, he was not going to church on a regular basis and, and neither was I when I was in New York.  I didn't start going to church until I got back to Atlanta [Georgia] and my husband [Afemo Omilami] went to do a show at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago [Illinois].  And the Five Blind Boys of Alabama were--it was Oedipus with, with the Five Blind Boys from Alabama.  And they ministered to him to such an extent that when he came home he said you know what we just going after God, we're going after God.  No more beer, no more reefer, just everything clean.  It's like what happened to you?  (Laughter) But you know we were, we were, we cleaned our lives up.  This is, this is '82 [1982], '83 [1983] and we start going to church very--and it wasn't about church, it was about where is God, who is God?  What is--and you know even in the Civil Rights Movement, many of the black churches didn't let [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] preach there.  So there was always that contradiction for my dad and they would say he's a troublemaker, we don't want him preaching at our church.  So it was more about relationship for me than it was about church.
Story_ID: 111743
Speaker 1: So you're back in New York, you have two children.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's 1982.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How does your film career start to co- to come about, because let me just look, I think your first film role--
Speaker 2: Here in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: --'cause--
Speaker 2: Yeah I started doing plays again oh and I was like, thank god in heaven I'm on the stage again.  I wasn't doing very many films.  My husband [Afemo Omilami] was--started doing films first.  My first non-stage experience was '[In the] Heat of the Night' and 'I'll Fly Away.'  And I did little bit parts in films, nothing, nothing to mention a- during those years.  I just had to get my, you know, training had to kick back in again so I could get back on stage.
Speaker 1: Well you to get, to get yourself back on stage--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) what did you do?
Speaker 2: I was--we started out with 7 Stages Theatre here in Atlanta and 'Black Cat Bones for Seven Sons' and then after that I did you know '[A] Raisin in the Sun' and 'Indiana' and, and then I start doing some regional theaters Spunk and Jomandi was very strong here then and, and so I started working with Jomandi and it was difficult to get on the Alliance Theatre stage here.
Speaker 1: Because?
Speaker 2: Because somehow Atlanta has the idea that if you're any good you don't live here.  You know, if you live here you couldn't be anybody.  You couldn't have any talent because you'd be out in the New York or you'd be in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  So they import actors you know.  Even the Alliance Theatre would hire people from New York and bring 'em here and wouldn't let us audition sometimes.  And that's kind of how Atlanta thinks about not just in the theater world, but in many other areas of business.  So I did the sort of community theater circuit here and you know that's how I got back into the theater.
Speaker 1: So when did you take on your first TV role 'I'll Fly Away,' how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Auditioning here.  Not knowing what I was doing and it was just a blessing because I was just awful in the beginning because I was acting for the theater in front of the camera which it makes you look like a buffoon, but thank goodness I had kind directors and I worked with actresses like Regina Taylor who became a model, models for me.  I did 'In the Heat of the Night,' which was filming here.  We had several TV series running here at that time in the, in the, in the late '80s [1980s].  In the--we had--'Matlock' was here, the TV series 'Savannah' was here and but what happened was that Georgia is a right to work state so that means that you don't have to be--you don't have to hire a union here and once the producers got wind of that, once the union, AFL-CIO, got wind of that, they squelched the film and TV industry in Georgia, and it disappeared completely.  So I start doing things like I worked for Eastern Airlines for a while.  I sold Avon [cosmetics].
Story_ID: 111744
Speaker 1: I did what I had to do.  I worked for my dad [Hosea Williams], but I was--our relationship had changed.
Speaker 2: How so?
Speaker 1: Changed in the sense that I didn't sort of fit in any more.  The movement [Civil Rights Movement], the focus of the movement had changed too.  So he was really focused on the chemical company [Southeast Chemical Manufacturing and Distributing Company] and his political career.  So there wasn't a lot of this direct action going on in the early '90s [1990s] as there had been and, and not as many marches and so forth.  So he had the administrators that he needed, but I always could go back there and work if I, if I desire but I wanted to make it on my own, you know.  And then Eastern Airlines closed down too.  So I was like okay what am I gonna do now.  So we did what we had to do.  Worked temp jobs and but always doing theater whenever we could.
Speaker 2: What was your mother [Juanita Williams] doing at the time?
Speaker 1: She was, she was finding her own identity apart from my dad then.
Speaker 2: Well when did they divorce?
Speaker 1: They never divorced.  They never divorced.  She--they didn't believe in divorce, but she bought herself a house and moved into it.  (Laughter)  So you know she, she decided that you know I wanna live out here by myself.  And I think that was in '95 [1995] she decided that and so they separated is what happened but they never, they never divorced.
Speaker 2: So she began to live on her own?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: What was your relationship like with her at the time?  (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: It was, it was a good relationship.  Now between--before they separated she served three terms in the [Georgia] State Legislature, that was, was the time that I was telling you that she never went to the well for anything.  But she was supported bills that had to with the rights of women and children.  She would sign those bills, but she would never speak publicly.  We used to say she was so honest you never want my mama to go to court with you.  Because she would tell the truth and you would end up in trouble.  So she, she, she did her stint at the State Legislature and she moved out, moved into her own home and that's where my sister lives today over on Toneburge [ph.] Court.  And my mom passed in August of 2000, two months before my dad passed.
Story_ID: 111745
Speaker 1: Well, what led you to take on writing?
Speaker 2: Because I, I had so much to tell and I couldn't figure out how to tell it and I thought well maybe if I start writing I can get some of this--I just always walk around so full of all these memories and all these thoughts and, and I knew I thought maybe I had an important story because of what my life had been like.  So I wrote a play 'There Is a River in My Soul' and it was all about my life and civil rights and, and, and St. Benedict [Catholic School, Savannah, Georgia] and, and growing up in the red Cadillac and the Civil Rights Movement and, and New York and all of that to the best of my ability.  I am--I was not a, a, a polished playwright, but the stories were told with such passion by the actresses that, that it was well-received locally and I probably revisit it with a rewrite if I can ever get back to it.
Speaker 1: Why do you think you didn't do it in one-woman format?
Speaker 2: Because there's so many voices I, I--
Speaker 1: But they're all you right?  You're telling all these stories?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: So many voices going?
Speaker 2: Un-huh, that I wanted my, my--I have--see there's no outlet for African American actors in Atlanta [Georgia].  And they're just sitting around frustrated.  So I wanted also--I always wanted to provide jobs for actors.  That was something that I always wanted to do so I got you know had some girlfriends that I knew that whose talent I respected and we wanted to give them an opportunity to, to support me as the lead in this production and so that's why I added, I added them into it.
Story_ID: 111746
Speaker 1: Now you said off-camera to me that there are fifteen white theaters, companies in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Fifteen white theater companies and right now not one African American company even though [HM] Kenny Leon's company, True Colors [Theatre] does do a season here but they're pretty much based in Washington [D.C.] and Atlanta.  And I, I think that, that is very--that is a challenge for the African American community here because I don't think we understand the value of the arts and the value of telling our own stories yet.  We just not interested because there's enough black money here in Atlanta to do whatever we wanna do.  If we were interested in theater, we'd, we'd do theater, we'd have a theater company.  So I can only assume and the rule is don't make assumptions, but I can only assume that, that, that the black intelligentsia is not really interested in, in, in developing a world class African American theater here.  Although they will support it if someone else does it.  Because you know Jomandi had wonderful income.  Income was not the problem.  So, so I think there's--it's ripe for something to happen here now.
Speaker 1: Well when you were working with Jomandi--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --what was what was the problem from the inside?  Talk about it from the inside.
Speaker 2: I, I think that artists should not do business management.  It should be one or the other.  You know because it's just too much for one person.  I don't think that artistic directors should be business managers and, and I don't think that if they wanna act, they should be an artistic director and business manager and then they're directing all their own plays and you're not letting anybody else direct and you're in them, and you're the business manager you know that's a recipe for a catastrophe and I kind of think that, that, that that's what happened there.
Story_ID: 109463
Speaker 1: We'll try to put a neat little bowtie on--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --on the theater part of your life, but--
Speaker 2: Un-huh.
Speaker 1: --talked about the--but to wrap it up it's in--
Speaker 2: It's in the, it's in the '90s [1990s] and I'm basically doing the local theater and regional theater.  I do a season at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival.  I go to Indiana Rep [Indiana Repertory Theatre] and do a show.  I'm still--I'm not doing anything in New York.  I go up there and audition but it, it--just not, not able to, to hook into it.  And I'm, I'm a avid Christian now.  I'm going to Gospel Tabernacle and learning to do my holy ghost dance and got the holy ghost and, and, and learning all about Jesus Christ that, that my grandmama told me at three years old was black with wooly hair and legs of bronze and I'm loving it.  And but I'm not being taught the word of God, so I changed churches.  My husband [Afemo Omilami] and I decide that you know the emotionalism of the, of the Pentecostal holiness movement is--took--got us into the church and got us saved and got us understanding that there's something other than ourselves in the world, but we needed--we, we, we didn't get the--taught the word there in the way that we wanted to and we you know take when--once we decided to do something we go in 110 percent.  So we join Abundant Life Church [now Cross Culture Church] and Pastor Woodrow Walker there is very mission-minded.  So we start traveling the world.  I go to Kenya and do mission work.  I go to Uganda.  I'm, I'm going to the Saint Vincent and Jamaica and I'm, I'm learning about the world for the first time in my life.  I've never traveled before.  I've never been anywhere but you know right around in the United States and a little bit before.  And then I take a trip to the Philippines and there I find a group of people who had a prophesy that many, many, many years ago that them brown people would come from the East and that there would be a baby born that would interact with these brown people from the East and that they would be the salvation of the blonde tribe.  Now I don't know anything about this prophesy.  I just know I'm drawn to these people for some reason.  They live up in a mountain.  There's no road, no electricity, no running water.  And I'm just; I'm just driven to get there.  My health is not that good.  I'm struggling with rheumatoid arthritis to this day and but I go on this journey and they're cutting down the bush as we go up this mountain because there's no road and I'm just, you know, out of breath and just I say well, Lord if I die on this mountain, I just will.  Because I got to get to the top and I see what is there.  And we get there and we find these Indians of the blonde tribe standing around and they have never seen black people before.  It is National Geographic in 1997, '96 [1996] and they're looking and the children are running from us because they're afraid of us and they don't speak English but I have--I meet this young man at Abundant Life Church, and this is why I end up in the Philippines in the first place.  He has come to the church, he's talking about his people and I see him in a dream and I hear "help him" in the dream.  And I wake up in a fit.  So I go on a Philippines missions trip and here's the baby that is born that will bring the brown people from the East and we all go up there and we meet with them and he's interpreting for them and we're talking to them about where we come from and I say to them, you know, we're not much different than you.  You love your husband don't you?  I love mine.  You love your children, don't you?  I love mine.  You want the best for your family?  I do too.  You eat, we drink.  We're basically the same.  And they're just about this tall and they're looking at me saying oh, she's so fat.  Oooh, and they're just honest you know.  And they sleep all together in the same beds.  So when we go to bed that night I'm, I'm laying there and I'm feeling company and like five of them get in the bed with me and snuggle up.  And I'm like oh, hell, what is going on up here.  But this is their culture.  This is how they live.  And, and, and, and they just love so deeply.  They are, they are descendants of the Pygmies.
Story_ID: 109464
Speaker 1: Now that's an interesting point.  And so we, I say where, where are the children?  Where do the children go to school?  "They don't go to school".  "We don't want any schools up here".  I said well why, "the, the school steal the children".  And he's interpreting, well what happened was the Catholics had, had tried to educate their children and would steal them and take them away to the convent and keep them.  And so we go down to Manila [Philippines] and we spend about $800 US money and we get fourteen boxes of school supplies and we take it back up to the mountain.  Okay we find out that there is some college students at a university nearby who are willing to come to the mountain who speak their language and teach the children.  But they have to be paid.  So we come back, we raise the money at Hosea Feed the Hungry [and Homeless] which, which I'm head of at that time by now because when my father [Hosea Williams] died in 2000, my husband [Afemo Omilami]and I took over the organization.  And we start paying the teachers' salaries and so we do it every year to the tune of about $35,000 and the school is still there today.  We're still paying the teachers' salaries and they graduated 300 students this year.  So you just you know, you just never know where life will lead you but I'm open to everything.  I'm open to going to wherever it is I can help change a situation for, for people that is in negative and make it, make it more positive.
Story_ID: 109465
Speaker 1: Did your father [Hosea Williams] ever have the opportunity to either see you as an actress or?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes he did.  And every time he kept thinking that I wasn't gonna make it as an actress, I kept getting another job.  So he said, well she must you know she really gonna be an actress then.  He's--and he and my mother [Juanita Williams] supported my career 100 percent, but I think he also always knew that I would be the one to take over Hosea Feed the Hungry [and Homeless].  Because I was an actress, I was unemployed a lot.  So I had to hang out at the office.  I knew how to do, I knew Feed the Hungry these dinners we feed 15,000 people and not only do they get food, but they get hot showers.  They get new clothing.  They get barber and beauty supply--hair, hair done and, and so forth.  They get--we have a medical clinic that does blood pressure, HIV, sugar diabetes, all kinds of screens.  Doctors from there and they refer them.  They get free long distance phone calls anywhere in the country and if their families say come home, we give them a free bus ticket to go, all the food you can eat.  So I knew how to put this big event together, so that's how I, I think he knew that acting--he's used to always tell me I couldn't do both, but I never believed that.  I think you can do, I think you can do it all with a little help.
Story_ID: 109466
Speaker 1: Well, what did he [Hosea Williams], what did he think about you accepting Christ in such a vigorous way?  I mean you've become Pentecostal.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: What is it, is it--is that it's called?  That holy ghost that's--
Speaker 2: That's, that charismatic Pentecostal (simultaneous) although we're nondenominational.
Speaker 1: Sanctified?
Speaker 2: Sanctified.  He, he you know had to get over the fact that he would gamble with the preachers on Saturday, and then they would go to church on Sunday morning.  He had to get over the fact that the congregations were so poor in many of these churches and they weren't being helped the say he thought they should.  But when he met the pastor of the church that I'm at [Abundant Life Church, now Cross Culture Church]--that I eventually ended up the missions-minded, Woodrow Walker.  He said that's a real preacher.  He said that's a real man of God.  And so I think at the end of his life, he found that the church could be viable in the community and the church could be real people without judgments and without all condemnation and that, that it could be valuable and that there is such thing as a real preacher as he put it, who just lives in the community just like he did.  People kept trying to get him to leave the community.  Move into a condo out there where Oprah [Winfrey] bought Coretta [Scott King] that condo.  But he would never leave the community.  He used to wear his overalls and red shirt on purpose with his $300 shoes so that if a poor person saw him in the street he could talk to them.  He wore those same overalls to meet with [President Bill] Clinton at the White House.  So he, he decided that he was gonna leave the suites and go back to the streets and that's where he, that's where he died, with the people.
Speaker 1: Did he reconcile with your mother [Juanita Williams] before his death?
Speaker 2: They loved each other 'til they both died, they just didn't like.  She said I love him but I don't like him sometimes.  And you know, they taught us that, you know, you don't always have to get a divorce just because things aren't going right.  My husband [Afemo Omilami] and I have had times when things were not going right, but we decided to stay married and now we're running this organization and since we took over it went from a budget of $144,000 to a $1.2 million in just since 2000, so I mean together we've been able to do so much more.  The whole is so much bigger than its parts and it's the sacrifice that you make but it's all so worth it.  And this Easter we'll be feeding 8,000 people just a few days from now at, at City Hall East and we're dedicating this Sunday's service to, to my parents.  So it's come full circle for me you know.  I'm--got four, four movies out.  I'm doing [Hosea] Feed the Hungry [and Homeless] and I'm kind of happy yeah, yeah I'm happy.
Story_ID: 109467
Speaker 1: So before we talk about the movies, I wanna ask do you still shout.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  Now, Woodrow Walker is a teacher so sometimes I have to leave that church and go somewhere where I can get my shout on.  But I, I have, I, I, I'm up for ordination in a few weeks and I feel so unworthy of that because I don't know God the way I should.  I really don't know--you know he's unknowable anyway.  Christ is unknowable, but if I can't--poverty is a spiritual issue.  If I can't preach Christ to the poor people that we serve, and we serve 'em by the thousands, I'm not doing them any good by giving them a box of food and sending them home.  How will you be delivered from crack?  I've seen people delivered from crack through the holy ghost.  How are you gonna be delivered from beating your wife?  From hopelessness?  It's a spiritual issue.  Many of, many people just need to be encouraged and they--if they, if they, if they get to believe in that, they can make it.  Poverty won't, won't be such a problem, but you can't solve it with dollars from Washington [D.C.].  It has to be through a one-on-one loving on a person, loving them back to believing that they can make it.  So that's why it's important that the ordination for me is not for me but it's for the people that I serve so that they can see a loving God who is saying you're forgiven come, come on back you know let's live out the rest of your life with value.  So.
Speaker 1: So you said it's come full circle.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you feel that you are wearing your father's [Hosea Williams] $300 shoes?
Speaker 2: I keep those shoes in a box in my office and when I think I'm gonna give up I open up that box and I look at those shoes, worn and tattered as they are, I know, I can't wear those shoes.  But I'm beginning to actually believe that I can make a difference in the world.  I'm, I'm beginning to actually believe that I'm, I'm being used by God to serve the poor.  He used to always tell me there's power in the poor and I didn't understand it.  How could there be power in poor people?  But there is.  As long as you serve the poor you will never be poor because the lord will make sure that you have the resources to do that work because they're in the center of his heart.  The bible tells us that real religion is taking care of the widows and the orphans, and those that are without.  And that's where I spend all day every day doing.  So that's the power and it does so much more for me than it can ever do for any of the people that we meet.  So he was trying to teach me something and I finally am beginning to understand it.  So no, I don't, I don't wanna step over in those shoes but I'm just sort of got my heel made and my shoes are starting to come together.
Story_ID: 109468
Speaker 1: So let's talk about those four movies.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, I--'Ray,' my husband [Afemo Omilami] and I are both in 'Ray.'  We're the couple that come into the nightclub and tell all 'em, all are going to hell 'cause Ray is singing that gospel music in the nightclub.  The next one is 'Glory Road,' which is a Jerry Bruckheimer film and I'm the woman that says, "my son Harry did it" and they used that in the trailer, so I got a lot of visibility out of that.  I also got to sit at the table with Cicely Tyson and [HM] Maya Angelou in Tyler Perry's Madea Goes--'Madea's Family Reunion,' which was fascinating and, and, and, and they took my, my bowl of peas.  You know every actress has to have some business to do and I knew with Cicely Tyson and Maya Angelou sitting there I was not gonna gave a lot of lines.  So I got some snap beans so I'd have something to do.  When the two divas get to the table and they're like looking at me and I'm looking at them like this and they're like well, we don't have--and they raised their hand and Maya Angelou says Tyler Perry, I don't have any snap beans.  So he reaches over in front of me and gets my snap beans and gives 'em to her and there I have nothing to do.  But that, that was just powerful for being there with them and then I finished--just finished shooting 'The List' which is a Christian film, a Gary Wheeler production about a--the, the, the book 'The List' is also out about a group of men who have been holding on to power since way before slavery time and money.  And they just been passing it on generation to generation and it finally gets to this young man and he has to make a decision as to whether he'll go with the evil that they've created or, or he'll just release it.  And it's about the power of prayer.  And, and then I just got cast in another movie so I--it's interesting what's happening in my life right now.  I, I, I don't remember the name of it though I only have two days on it.  So--
Speaker 1: You did 'The Altar.'
Speaker 2: --'The Altar' with Cassandra Hollis which is I actually have the CD here.  I'm gonna give it to you and you can watch it and send it back to me where I play a homeless woman again--life meets art--who becomes a preacher and it's very interesting and, and it's actually the first time I've actually been the lead in a, it's a short, it's a twenty minute short.  And she'll be submitting it to, to, to different festivals around the country.
Story_ID: 109469
Speaker 1: So how do you rate yourself as a--well how do you rate your speaking abilities as a minister?  Do you feel comfortable writing your sermons for Sunday?  How does that, how does that all develop?
Speaker 2: I'm going to school because I need, I need to.  But you know what when I preach I turn into those old civil rights leader preachers that I grew up listening to and I try to hold myself back and, and get--and be proper and politically correct, but I just--the passion in my father [Hosea Williams] just comes through me in such a powerful way and I cannot contain it.  So I have to back that up with knowledge of the word or I'm just gonna be preaching nonsense.  But I--it--you never know what's in you.  Sitting at the feet of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and down at Ebenezer [Baptist] Church [Atlanta, Georgia] running up and down the steps and getting in trouble and listening to them for all those years, it comes out when I step behind the pulpit and that's the only time you really see it.  So I, I need to do--I have a lot of studying to do but I do know that what's in me is for a reason.  My history is redemptive you know it's all gonna be used for some reason I, I just don't exactly know what reason and my husband [Afemo Omilami] as well.  He's there.  I've told him when they talked to me about ordination that we minister as a team.  But he's not wanting to be ordained.  He's not feeling like that's what he's called to do.  But he's constantly praying and constantly teaching and preaching at Hosea Feed the Hungry [and Homeless] because that's what people do.  I used to get made with my dad.  I say why you let these poor people come in your office and just waste your time all day every day.  That's the way I used to be.  And now I'm doing the same thing (laughing), doing the same thing.
Story_ID: 109470
Speaker 1: So if you look back over your life, not your father's [Hosea Williams] or your mother's [Juanita Williams] but yours, as you know from, from birth to this moment you've lived to us sitting here talking, what stands out most for you?
Speaker 2: Passion.  Passion.  Being so excited about something that you would die for it.  I'm so glad I had that experience.  I'm so glad that I know what it's like to step across the line and face death in the face and say if I'm--if I die, I die.  If I'm slayed, I'm slayed, but I believe in what I'm doing and I'm gonna go straight in the face of disdain and, and I wanna live a passionate life.  I don't wanna be in a rocking chair.  I wanna be, I wanna be just so involved and so driven and so you know, just not lukewarm, but on fire for whatever it is I'm, I'm involved in and, and I think that's the best way to, to just get, get--make something happen because that fire, that spark is what you know, yeah it's what creates something out of nothing.
Speaker 1: Do you think you've gotten that freedom that that little girl in you got arrested so many times for?
Speaker 2: No.  Un-un.  Un-un.  It's--there's too much suffering in the world and I see it every day so, un-un.  So I have to keep on trying, I have to keep on searching for the answer.  What is the answer and a lot of people say well the poor will always be with us.  Well that doesn't mean you don't help 'em.  'Cause the Bible says the poor will always be with you.  You know it may be a reflection on the heart of humanity to say that the poor will always be here because we're so heartless you know.  We're not free.  Not yet.
Story_ID: 109471
Speaker 1: Well the last question before we do the pictures is what are you most proud of?
Speaker 2: My marriage.  I'm most proud of how I've been able to love that man [Afemo Omilami] all these years through all his mess and I still love him just as if it was the first day.  And I look at him and I just--and I'm most proud of the fact that we're still together these twenty-eight years later and things like that are what's important.  See it's not the movies or the TV or the, you know, we never really been money people, we live very modestly.  My marriage and my family I think is what I'd be most proud of.
Speaker 1: Well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
