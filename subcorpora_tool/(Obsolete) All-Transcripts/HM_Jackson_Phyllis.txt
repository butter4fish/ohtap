Story_ID: 155825
Speaker 1: Okay. Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask as sort of a warm-up, and they only require a short answer.  First question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh, my favorite food?  Right now I'm really susceptible to sweets, but I can't think of a favorite food--favorite food.  I'd say shrimp, but I can't tell you how to prepare it.  But I really enjoy shrimp, and I really enjoy chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is yellow.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer in South Africa is my favorite time of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I'd say South Africa, but South Africa is home.  It's not really a vacation for me.  It's going home.
Speaker 1: Okay and the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh, no I really don't.
Speaker 1: Okay; I mean, if you think of one later--
Speaker 2: I will.
Speaker 1: --we can add it, but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that's fine.  Now--
Speaker 2: The one that comes to mind is: tomorrow's not promised, so live now. Oh, I know what it would be, and it's one--one of the things I do lately is enjoy mentoring women based on my life experience, and that is: tell yourself the truth.
Story_ID: 155826
Speaker 1: Give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Vivian Scott Middleton, V-I-V-I-A-N, Scott, S-C-O-T-T, Middleton, M-I-D-D-L-E-T-O-N and she's from Neeses, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay and what's her date of birth and place of birth--and--well, her, her date of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is February 1, 1920, and she's still living.
Speaker 1: Okay and what do you know about her side of the family, and how far back can you trace 'em, and what were they doing basically?
Speaker 2: We know a lot of about our family on both sides 'cause my family was very interested in family history on both sides.  My mother's family is from the--a farm in Orangeburg [South Carolina].  Her father is mixed race.  His father is white and his mother was white, and he had a farm in Orangeburg, South Carolina.  He was a gentleman who married one woman, Hattie, had four children; she passed, and then he married her younger sister and had five more.  So my mother has eight siblings, and they are her cousins and her sis--stepsisters and brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a story that I've heard.  We've heard that kind of story before--
Speaker 2: Really.
Speaker 1: You know, in the sou--you know, in a rural area like that where you got a similar kind of thing.  Did--so, so they were farmers basically.
Speaker 2: My moth--fa--mother grew up on a farm.  But one of the things that was really important is all the girls were educa--everybody was educated.  Everybody had an education, and the last five girls all became teachers.  So my mot--
Speaker 1: That was your--
Speaker 2: My mother's side.  All the girls are teachers.
Speaker 1: Was your mother's generation the first generation to get an education?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: We're talkin' the 1920--1930s, but they all went to school.  All the younger, all the youn--all the sisters became teachers.  All the girls are her sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay and, and your grandfather owned his own--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He owned his own farm.
Speaker 1: Now, now that--that's an advantage too, you know, in, in days when there wasn't much black ownership of land, you know (unclear).  It was--it--actually, more then than it is now, but you know to own your own land means you can get--
Speaker 2: And we've actually been to the farm.  It's on the road to Orangeburg, and we're a family that likes to--my parents, even though we grew up--I grew up in Los Angeles [California], they always took us to Orangeburg.  Every few years we'd drive across country to see the family, so we know our family.  And we know where we're from, and we've been to the farm, and we've seen the original farmhouse.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know we've interviewed people that talk about the tremendous civil rights struggle in Orangeburg in the, you know, in, in, the '60s [1960s].  What did your mother say about growing up in Orangeburg in, in, in that area, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, they didn't talk much about that.  They talked more about living on the farm.  And if-- they civil rights era was later.  We were living out here in Los Angeles by then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they didn't talk about--much about that.  I mean, they talked a little bit about some of the racism, but they went into town; they went to Claflin [College, later Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  And at that time, Claflin was a high school and a college.  And they grew--you know, moved to Orangeburg, and all of them were educated at Claflin. In fact, that's where she met my father [Philip Middleton]--
Story_ID: 155827
Speaker 1: --because my father, Philip Govan Middleton, is from Orangeburg [South Carolina].  And his name is spelled Philip, P-H-I-L-I-P, Govan, G-O-V-A-N, Middleton, M-I-D-D-L-E-T-O-N.
Speaker 2: Okay and what is date of birth?
Speaker 1: His date of birth is October 13th, 1916.  And we know a lot about his family also.  Because we traced our family back to the Middleton [Place] Plantation in Orangeburg, South--in Charleston, South Carolina.  And actually, my uncle first and then now my cousin serves on the board of the Middleton [Place] Plantation Foundation.  And our family has had reunion in Charleston [South Carolina].  We have--this is really unusual--we have gone to the plantation.  We have a picture of us all at the Middleton--one of the old slave houses.  And we got to know the Middleton side.  As a result, we now have a joint family union with the white Middleton family once every five years, which was an unusual experience.  I haven't experienced it.  My cousins have told me it was very warm.  But, going back to my father's side of family for a minute, my great-great-great-grandfather traveled to Oxford, England, with one of the Middleton sons and sat in our his classes at Oxford [University, Oxford, England].  So that side of the family has a very strong history of going to college and education.  So the great-grandfather went through college--it's probably one great--went through college as a student--not as a student, but as a valet, or something like that, with his master, if you will.  And after that, our family really supports and goes to college on both sides of my family.
Speaker 2: So, so he, your great-great--(unclear) your ancestor grandfather--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --was the valet for a college professor--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --is that what you're saying?
Speaker 1: He was a college student.  This Middleton--the Middletons are from--the white Middletons are from England.  So they own the plantation in Charleston.  And when one of the young men was ready to go to the university, they sent him back to Oxford--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and they sent his slave with him basically.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, so his master was a student--
Speaker 1: His master was a student.
Speaker 2: --sent to Oxford.  So he was--he accompanied him and was--
Speaker 1: He accompanied him--
Speaker 2: --in college too--
Speaker 1: --and attended college.
Speaker 2: --basically.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, he--
Speaker 1: He wasn't--
Speaker 2: He--
Speaker 1: a registered student--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but he went to his classes, and that--we've--that came out through our oral history of our family.  So when we started having reunions in Charleston and this oral history and shared it with the descendants of that Middleton family at the plantation, they embraced us and that history.  There's actually been two books written about that side of the family.  And as a result, first my uncle and now my cousin are on that board at the Middleton Place Plantation in Charleston.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: And that--the evolution of that is that we have a family reunion with them, and there's an exchange of dialogue; you know, they're the privileged white family.  And they're proud of the fact that the descendants of one of their slaves has this very educated, well-achieved family.
Speaker 2: Now did--are, are you related to the white Middletons or--
Speaker 1: No, we're not related.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: We just lived there.  We were their slaves.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but ah--ah--often people in the house end up being related.
Speaker 1: No, we didn't have any relations, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We're not--we don't have any direct descendants.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: That we know of (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, I'm saying--
Speaker 1: We haven't discovered that--
Speaker 2: --that's why--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --in our family.  But no, we don't.
Speaker 2: So, so it's, it's your regular thing in those days during slavery.
Speaker 1: Right, exactly; but no, that's not anything that we know of--we're aware of.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, now did--now this ancestor who was a slave, now this is how far back?  I mean, was he alive when emancipation took place?  Was he emancipated?
Speaker 1: I'm not really sure about that.  I don't know the details well enough.  My cousin Kenny [ph.] or my cousin Anita [ph.] probably do.  I just don't really know.  I don't remember the details.  I've heard the details, but I couldn't really give you an (cough), an accurate accountabilit--account of that.
Speaker 2: Okay, well anybody that's interested in following up on this, it'll probably be a lot of information available online.
Speaker 1: There's a book called 'Lemon Swamp [and Other Places: A Carolina Memoir]' by Mamie [Garvin] Fields, and it's documented in that book.
Story_ID: 155828
Speaker 1: So now when did--is there a tradition on that side of the family then like I take it of, of Middletons--the black Middletons going to--going to college?
Speaker 2: Yes, many of them went to--all of our parents went to Claflin College [later Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  All the Middleton--my father's [Philip Govan Middleton] generation.  My father was born, as I said, in 1916.  He grew up in Orangeburg [South Carolina].  Their house is actually one block from the Claflin College Campus.  And my grandfather, Samuel Middleton, actually worked as a carpenter and did some teaching at the college--at Claflin College.
Story_ID: 155829
Speaker 1: I was asking about what your mother [Vivian Scott Middleton] said about growing up there [Neeses, South Carolina].  If she--you know, did she have any stories or reflections about growing up in you know near--
Speaker 2: They have stories--
Speaker 1: --Orangeburg--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --about the farm.  They have stories about their father [Jackson's grandfather, Asbury Edie] letting them drive the tractors when they were young.  They don't have any stories that really speak--they never really--I don't think have any bitterness, or they've never told us any really bad stores about racism and things like that.  I think they were kind of really kept contained.  And my grandfather apparently was a very strong person and kind of seen as--he had this mean, stern look about him, so I don't think people messed with him really, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, well they don't have to be stories just about racism.  I mean, just stories about growing up.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What, what, what, what it was like growing--
Speaker 2: They just--you know, they worked the farm, they picked cotton, and they went to school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so cotton was the primary crop?
Speaker 2: Cotton was the primary crop.
Story_ID: 155830
Speaker 1: Okay and, and about your father [Philip Govan Middleton], did your--what kind of things did he say about growing up?  Did he have--did they grow up on a big place too?
Speaker 2: No, they--their--they have a--they had a beautiful house.  In fact, it's still there in Orangeburg [South Carolina].  And they were--the, the train in Orangeburg goes right behind their house.  So they have stories about all their best friends hanging out on the railroad corner, going to Claflin [College, later Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  They knew all the people in the town.  They just seemed to have--and they all played together.  And they played tricks on each other, and--but really I can't really--they just always told stories.  And I remember anytime our families got together--two brothers actually came out here, my father and my uncle.  And they just always told stories and laughed; there was a lot of laughter.  And their family--their mother was very stern; their grandmother was very stern; and they went--all went to college and got their college educa--my father went and served in World War II, as his other brother; in fact, three of them did.  One--my uncle, Earl [Middleton], was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen.  He went to Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and was part of that.  But I can't really recall stories specifically.  There were just lots of stories.  And right now, if you talk to my father, he could tell you stories.  He has a very good memory.
Speaker 1: Okay, but, but they grew up in town.  They were basically--
Speaker 2: They--he grew up in town.
Speaker 1: --in, in, in Orangeburg.
Speaker 2: In Orangeburg--
Story_ID: 155831
Speaker 1: --grew up outside of Orangeburg [South Carolina] in the rural (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: And my mother [Vivian Scott Middleton] grew up outside of Orangeburg in the rural.  But because she came to Claflin [College, later Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], and Claflin was a boarding college--I mean boarding school--first a high school and then the college--that's how they became connected and got to meet each other.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how they met or how they fell in love?
Speaker 2: They haven't actually told that story.  It's really funny.  I'll have to ask them when I go for Thanksgiving.  They haven't told the story.
Speaker 1: Okay, but Claflin's a small school so you know.
Speaker 2: It's a small school.  It was smaller then.
Speaker 1: So pretty--sooner or later you're gone meet everybody there.
Speaker 2: Right, right, they wanted me to go to Claflin, but I didn't want--and I did.  I went for one summer to a summer program--a Methodist summer program for a week.  And I thought I wanted to go there, but then later on I decided I just wanted to stay locally and go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so--
Speaker 2: And my son actually went to school there.  I have a son that graduated from there.
Story_ID: 155832
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so when did they [Jackson's parents, Vivian Scott Middleton and Philip Govan Middleton] get married?
Speaker 2: They got married here.  After the war [World War II, WWII], my father came to Los Angeles [California], and they got married in August 20th, 1947.
Speaker 1: Well, this is a key question here.  How did they wind up in Los Angeles?  I mean, what was the--what was the motivation for moving the Los Angeles--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Opportunity after the war.  My father actually became a student at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] and went to school out here.  And I think he was here for almost a year, and then he--you know, he and my mother kept corresponding.  And then my mother came out and they got married.
Speaker 1: So he was going to school on a G.I. Bill after the war?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, after, after the war.  My mother worked in New York.  You know, they have stories about she worked as a housekeeper and you know nanny for children and you know with the intention of teaching.  And she came out here in 1947.  I have a--she has a picture of her working in a factory as a seamstress first.  And then she taught at Tracy [sic, Deuel Vocational Institution, San Joaquin County, California (near Tracy, California)], which is a delinquent boys institution up--not far from San Francisco [California], until she was able to become a teacher for the Los Angeles Unified School District.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she went to--did she go to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los, Angeles, California] or, or--
Speaker 2: No, she had her college credentials.  She just needed to get hired--
Speaker 1: Oh, she had--
Speaker 2: --as a teacher.
Speaker 1: --her credentials from Claflin [College, later Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Right, from Claflin, right.
Speaker 1: So she had to work to get certified here.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Story_ID: 155833
Speaker 1: So, now when you think about your parents' [Vivian Scott Middleton and Philip Govan Middleton] personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, how they walk, how they talk, what they look like, what they were interested in, their talents, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: A combination of the two.  My father is very--was very aspirational, so, you know, they--my mother's a teacher; my father was a carpenter and eventually started his own con--const--contracting company, so he did a lot of remodeling.  He was very creative, and he'd read magazines and renovate people's home.  We lived in very nice homes.  He'd buy--you know, he bought us a small house and then renovated it and made it probably one of the most beautiful houses in the neighborhood.  And he renovated quite a few homes in our neighborhood.  But they were very aspirational.  My mother was one of the founding members of the South Los Angeles [California] chapter of Jack and Jill [of America].  In fact, that's also one of the reasons I know Karen [HM Karen Hill-Scott].  'Cause Jack and Jill kids become your lifelong friends.  There's that connection later when you meet each other.  And education was stressed.  Daddy worked hard.  He worked long hours.  Mother was a teacher--a highly regarded teacher by her principals.  I remember them speaking glowingly of her, of her being a really strong teacher.  In fact, she--as my aunt--as her sisters were, and that was my role model.  My original goal was to be a teacher.  There was no doubt in my mind that I was gonna be--teach school.  But I must say, growing up in an African American community in the '50s [1950s], it never occurred to me, because African Americans weren't even on television and news and media, that that was something that we could aspire to.  So that kind of really evolved later.  I'd planned to be a teacher like my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So mother is the homemaker but also gets out and, you know, earns--and teachers are well paid; brought home a good check; and so we had a middle-class upbringing.
Story_ID: 155834
Speaker 1: Tell me about your brothers and sisters.  Can you name them from the--in the or--order of their birth and put yourself in the order?
Speaker 2: Sure, I'm first, Phyllis G. Middleton is first, then my sister Dorothy Rossi Middleton--now Taylor--is second.  She was born in 1949.  And my brother, Myron Scott Middleton, was born in 1953.  I only have three.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's only three of us.
Story_ID: 155835
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: One of my earliest childhood memory, when we lived in Lancaster [California], my mother [Vivian Scott Middleton] was teaching at Tracy [sic, Deuel Vocational Institution, San Joaquin County, California (near Tracy, California)], which is a--the delinquent boys school--you know, four or five hours away from home, so she only came home on some weekends or once a month or something.  I was in kindergarten.  So we were in Lancaster, and we lived at the end of a dirt road in Lancaster.  In that time, Lancaster was a very rural town.  It is--I don't even remember if then it was military town.  I'm not even sure there was a military base there, as it is now, and it's called the [Santa] Clarita Valley [California] here--predominantly white town.  And I remember being the only African American child in the school that I can remember.  And if you look at my first grade picture you can see.  I'm the only one in the picture.  And day--a school bus used to pick us up at the end of the dirt road.  I was five years old and I missed the school bus, and I guess I was afraid to go home.  I remember hiding in the bushes all day long, waiting for the kids to come back and following them home.  So then my parents--my father [Philip Govan Middleton] or whoever--the nanny who was keeping us never knew that I went to school.  I just never forget that.  I'm--think of myself as a five year old, you know, hiding in the bushes all day.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that takes a lot of discipline.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Discipline, courage.
Story_ID: 155836
Speaker 1: Now what was the, the neighborhood you lived in in Los Angeles [California]--since you were in Lancaster [California] first--
Speaker 2: We're in Lancaster first and then when my mother [Vivian Scott Middleton] was hired by the Los Angeles School District, we moved down to Los Angeles.  We moved into the area that's 116th Place, and we attended 116th Street [Elementary] School [Los Angeles, California].  And it was a very close middle-class neighborhood in South Los Angeles.  Most families, the father was a minister.  Or, there was a couple that lived down the street the father was one of the first black firemen in Los Angeles; mothers were teachers.  But it was a working-class community, very nice homes, very well maintained.  We played out in sidewalks and the streets.  There was no crime or anything like that.  Everybod--you know, people had dogs.  And we all went together.  It was just a very nice neighborhood.  Somebody was looking at my school pictures the other day, and I really hadn't thought about it much since then.  But it was an African American community, and the school most of the teachers were white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But if you think about it, it was the 1950s in Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: So, so black teachers were still--
Speaker 2: In Los Angeles they were still pretty rare.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And out of that community a lot of the--it was a very nurturing school.  That's one of the pros I think of, of our children going to schools where they are nurtured by the people who were there and the community that's there.  A lot of the people that came out of the school very successful.  As I told you--Jheryl Busby, who used to be president of Motown at one time; [HM] Yvonne Jackson was a per--came out of that neighborhood--eventually.  I mean, she came there later as an eighth grader; Sandra Woods [ph.], who was involved in mortgage banking.  I don't why but, you know, the kids have done pretty well.  We were very--we didn't attend that church in that community 'cause--it's called Bellevue Community Church.  We didn't attend that church, but we attended a lot of the activities there.  I belong to the Girl Scouts in that community.  A lot of our Jack and Jill [of America] activities were held at that church.  It was a very close-knit, supportive community.  Clay Jack [ph.] was a very prominent attorney--his wife.  You know, all the mothers were very involved in raising us.  You know, Irma Brown [Dillon] who's now a judge grew up in that neighborhood.  There were just--I don't know why (laughter).  I, I don't know.  I think our parents all had the same goals, aspirational goals.  You know, we did well in school, get a college education; we were self-motivated.
Speaker 1: Other than Jack and Jill, what, what organizations were your parents [Vivian Scott Middleton and Philip Govan Middleton] involved in?
Speaker 2: My father is a Sigma [Gamma Rho fraternity].  My mother was a Zeta [Phi Beta sorority], so we were--you know, because of their involvement in their fraternities and sororities, we did go to their dances.  A lot of their friends that came out here from South Af--South Carolina they socialized with and were--you know, we (unclear)--spent holidays with those various families.  But that's pretty much it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, all right--so what was the major commercial strip for this area of town--this part of town?
Speaker 2: They were only small businesses at that time.  What--at that time, there were no community shopping malls--shopping centers.  Everybody went downtown.  So you went downtown to--we'd go downtown to ro--shop at Robinson's or Bullocks or wherever we did our shopping.  There was no community department store, if you will.  So it was all small stores.  Then, the first community was the Baldwin Hills [Los Angeles, California] where they built a May [Department Stores] Company over there.  And that was--I don't remember what year that was.  But at that point, Los Angeles --if you were shopping in Los Angeles, you went downtown.  Everybody went downtown.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so there wasn't like a black business strip business part of town?
Speaker 2: No, there were just little community stories.  I mean, we didn't think of them like that.  Like the neighborhood store was owned by the Asian family, you know, that owned the little supermarket where we'd walk--where we'd go to.  And there was a record store, and there was--Irma Brown actually.  Irma Brown's family owned the cleaners, who was a friend that lived in the community.  There was a lil--there was a business strip.  You know, the peanut man had a peanut truck, and he sold roasted peanuts out of the back of his truck.  So there were those little small businesses.  And at that time, you know, you'd leave the community.  There was no grocery store in the community.  You had to go a little ways.
Speaker 1: So wa--was 116th Street [Los Angeles, California] itself a focus of the, the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It was just all part of the community.  It was just all--it was more--we were bound by Avalon [Street, Los Angeles, California] and Imperial [Street, Los Angeles, California], Central [Avenue, Los Angeles, California] on the east side and 120th [Street, Los Angeles, California].  So it was just a very nice little community.  In fact, Connie Van Brunt, who started Ebony Jr!--she also grew up in that neighborhood.  She was a friend of my sister's [Dorothy Middleton Taylor].
Story_ID: 155837
Speaker 1: As a little kid, what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: Probably I'd say--I was in--I was definitely interested in boys (laughter), and I wanted to be a teacher.  That was the--you know, that was my aspiration, is to be a teacher like my mother [Vivian Scott Middleton] and like my aunts and like my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you started at 116th Street [Elementary] School [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, 116th Street School.  It's still there.  And it was a very nurturing environment.
Speaker 1: Are, are there any special teachers at that level that you remember that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mrs. Caldwell [ph.], Mrs. Scott [ph.].  I remember the first day of school in fifth grade I rolled my eyes at Mrs. Caldwell, and I had to stay after school.  My mother had to come and get me.  Now can you imagine now today?  I rolled my eyes at the teacher and I had to stay after school.  My--
Speaker 1: You didn't hit her with a chair or anything like that.
Speaker 2: Nothing like--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: All I did was roll my eyes the first day of school, and my mother eventually had to come up there and get me, you know, and ta--and she turned out to be my favorite teacher, 'cause, you know, they demanded respect.  I mean, today there's such--I mean--okay, it was fifth grade so it had to be 1959.  I had to stay after school for rolling my eyes at the teacher.
Story_ID: 155838
Speaker 1: Di-- did you have a favorite subject at school at that level [at 116th Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Not that I remember.  I just--I loved writing, like, physically writing.  I liked handwriting.  I was very proud of my handwriting and practiced it.  Have--to have good handwriting was really important.  Now I'm lucky if I can read my children's handwriting (laughter).  That's kind of deteriorated.  And I think I liked English.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--you know, as we started this conversation about school a lot of comparisons about, you know, what, what, what was then and what is today, you know, in terms of what--what's acceptable and what isn't, and handwriting you know--you role your eyes then that's a you know.  Nowadays, you know, it seems as though you gotta do a lot more to be in trouble.  So do, do you have any other thoughts about what, what school was like then compared to now?
Speaker 2: Well, I've had two experiences with school. First of all, we moved to South Africa in 1998.  And that to me was what the United States was in the '50s [1950s].  And that's the school experience my children had over there.  It was discipline; it was respect; it was greeting adults; it was--handwriting was really important.  It was like rolling back the clock on education, and as a result, my children got a really good--the last three--the last four got a really good education.  And it just reminded me--I kept saying, "This is like the United States in the '50s [1950s]."  And children were polite; they spoke to adults; schools were quiet; children, you know, they had to study.  They were required to study and pass every year.  So I haven't had the typical recent experience of education in the United States because my children went to school in-were schooled in South Africa.

Speaker 1: When you grew up, would the average student have a intact family at home with mother and father?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely, absolutely.  I was a young married mother and I ended up getting divorced say, a few of the years later.  And it wa--I remember it was a bit of an embarrassment; in fact, when I joined Jack and Jill [of America] my son [Nye Tucker] was two, so it was probably 19--he was born in '68 [1968]; it was probably 1971.  I did not disclose that I was divorced because it was a stigma.  And actually, I've actually met someone as an adult who was in the Jack and Jill chapter in Northern California, and they were put out of the chapter 'cause the parents got a divorce.  Because at that time, you know, being a married woman and--you know family was intact, and I guess that was kind of what was expected.  And, and I remember not disclosing the fact that I was not with--on my application--not that I was divorced or separating, or whatever it was.  I, I had to be separated, but I was--I don't remember whether I was officially divorced, but I did not disclose it.  And my mother [Vivian Scott Middleton] said don't disclose it.
Story_ID: 155840
Speaker 1: Was church a major factor in growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, we went to Holman United Methodist Church [Los Angeles, California].  My parents [Vivian Scott Middleton and Philip Govan Middleton] were the--one of the founding members of the church.  It was Reverend White [Lanneau L. White], and we went to church every Sunday.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you think--I mean, what role did the church play in forming your values?  Do you think that, that church played a major role?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a major role in, in forming your values and what was important.  And it was a more--it was the old tradition of church, not the church that I experience now, the Christian Bible studying church.  I mean, the my--Methodist church wasn't like that.  I mean, you read passages every day, but--I mean, every Sunday, but we weren't a family that read the Bible.  I didn't develop that until later as an adult.  But it definitely that--you know, we went to Bible study; we went to--even though it's still--it was different than it is now.  Maybe I was listening different or hearing it different.  I was a--I was a monitor in the Sunday School.  We went to Sunday School every Sunday and then we would go to church.  So we grew up in South Los Angeles [California], but Holman was on Adams [Boulevard, Los Angeles, California], which was a thirty minute drive from our home.  So we kind of drove out of our community over to the Adams district, which was another very middle-class African American community, a little more upscale.  More of the professional doctors and lawyers lived in that community, and those were kind of the members of that church.  The more upper--not upper class, but upper middle-class African American families belong to that church.
Story_ID: 155841
Speaker 1: The values that you were developing growing up were coming from the home, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Primarily.
Speaker 2: The values came from my mother [Vivian Scott Middleton] and my father [Philip Govan Middleton].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which stemmed from the values of their upbringing in South Carolina.  I think those were carried through in the high school and the community that we lived in as well as the organizations that we belonged to--Jack and Jill [of America], Bellevue Church, Girl Scouts, my brother [Myron Scott Middleton]--Boy Scouts.  It was very, you know, respect and, you know, what you consider good, positive values--respect, integrity, truth, being aspirational, getting an education.  And I know now as a mother that those things are important.   Because you can teach certain things at home, but your children have to be associated in outside organizations that also reinforce the same values that you have.
Story_ID: 155842
Speaker 1: What was television like when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Television was pretty white when we were growing up.  I don't remember the year now, but I remember how excited everybody got about 'Julia' or--well, even before 'Julia,' 'The Nat King Cole Show.'  'Cause Nat King Cole had his own show.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'd been like '62 [1962] or '61 [1961], '62 [1962] ['The Nat King Cole Show' premiered in 1956 and aired through 1965]?
Speaker 2: It was very, very early.  And now I know after being in television that they couldn't get sponsors for that show, that a lot of people that he knew personally came in as guest stars on that show to support it.  But eventually it was taken off the air because there was no advertising for it, 'cause people would not advertise for an African American man singing.  There seemed to be some concern about, you know, white advertising executives and people having this African American man sing to their families, their wives, so there was no sponsorship; so the show was canceled.
Speaker 1: So you, you were born in '48 [1948].  This is the, the very early--the infancy of television.  So, did, did, did, did your family always have a television?
Speaker 2: We have a tel--we had a television as long as I can remember.  I remember my favorite television show was 'Howdy Doody' if you can believe that.  (Laughter) I look at 'Howdy Doody' now and I go like, "Wow!"  You know, this freckled face, white puppet was my favorite--and 'Beany and Cecil.'  In fact, it tied--late--ber-'Beany and Cecil' I remember was one of my favorite television shows.  And I met Bob Clampett later, and I said that.  So he ended up sending me a Beany and Cecil puppet--I mean poster--for my office, you know, autographed, 'cause that was--that was the only thing that we had.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and did you watch a lot of TV growing up?
Speaker 2: We probably watched a lot of television.  We always had a television.  My father [Philip Govan Middleton] liked news.  My sister [Dorothy Middleton Taylor] really liked to watch television.  We, we, we probably watched a lot of television.  I remember when we first got our first color television what a big deal it was in 1964 to get a color television.  And then later on we had a television that was on a stand that you could move around.  So there was the family television and then we had this portable television that my sister and I could put in our room, or my brother [Myron Scott Middleton] could put it in his room.  It primarily stayed in my sister and my room.  My parents [Vivian Scott Middleton and Philip Govan Middleton] never had a television in their room.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so and then, you know, everything was coming in through the antennas, you know, you had--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, everything was coming through the antenna.  There was only the networks and a few local stations.
Speaker 1: So in Los Angeles [California] growing up, how many stations do you think there was (unclear) you had access to?
Speaker 2: I can't tell you how many, but I remember it was KTLA, KTTV--really those are the two that I remember.  And then there was, you know, Channel 4, Channel 2--Channel 4 was NBC [National Broadcasting Company], CBS [Columbia Broadcasting System] was Channel 2, and then ABC [American Broadcasting Company].  Those are the ones that I really remember.  I can't--so that's what?  Five or six, seven?
Story_ID: 155843
Speaker 1: Now, now did you--did you have any influx of African American history or culture in any of the or--organizations or activities you were involved in?
Speaker 2: We did a little bit in the Girl Scouts, but for Jack and Jill [of America] there was a real influence on that, especially during Black History Week, because it was originally a week.  We had an intense exposure to black history.  There was a woman in Jack and Jill who had a lot of knowledge--Mrs. Scott [ph.], who had a lot of knowledge, and they would plan activities.  And we also would have a dinner and a culmination where we would have, you know, bring food like soul food, if you will.  And later on, as I was a Jack and Jill mother, you know, we kind of inte--immigrated--immigrated and integrated the African aspect of our upbringing and would incru--clude African dishes and things like that.  But it was always in that--within that organization a high regard for African American history or African history or black history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But not in the schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--because you were saying most of your teachers were white--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They were white but it also wasn't done.  We probably did something.  I remember something about say Ralph Bunche or Marion Anderson probably in elementary school [116th Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California].  I remember something about Brazil but never really understanding, you know, what that all meant at that age.  So we got a sprinkling of it in elementary school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Probably for Black History Week.
Story_ID: 155844
Speaker 1: Now living in Los Angeles [California] and being around the black middle class, did--were you exposed to any of the black personalities from the movies or, or TV?
Speaker 2: No, not really, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so--
Speaker 2: Because I grew up in South Los Angeles.  Now--oh, actually, I take that back.  Through Holman [United Methodist Church]--I can't remember who they were, but we probably had a few people at Holman, but I just can't remember who it was off the top.  But that was the church that they would have gone to, to Holman.  Later on Tommy Davidson [ph.], when he was playing for the Lakers, he joined that church.  And I remember there was a woman who was an actress.  Yeah, so there were a few people, but I can't even remember their names.
Story_ID: 155845
Speaker 1: So now high school; now you, you went to George Washington [Preparatory] High School [Los Angeles, California], right?
Speaker 2: I went to George Washington High School in South Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Okay and well were you involved in high school activities a lot or were you, you very active?
Speaker 2: I was--I wasn't involved in a lot of high school activities.  I belong to the drum and bugle corps, which I was extremely proud of.  But I went to--before going to [George] Washington [Preparatory High School, Los Angeles, California], I went to a predominantly white high school, Henry Clay Ju--Junior High School [later Henry Clay Middle School, Los Angeles, California]--excuse me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Junior high school.  So my transition to Washington I'll never forget was--it was a white high school that was starting to turn black, and init--I do remember a couple of race riots where they were really some fights, as the school began to transition.  And a lot of the organizations, especially the higher echelon organizations were still pretty white.  So I, in eleventh grade, was a part of a group of girls who formed our own organization called Dispresions [ph.].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what was it called?
Speaker 2: Dispresions.  I can't--I don't--no.  I ca--I got to tell you the name later.  I can't remember the name.  Dispresions was our class name.  Delescote' [ph.] or something like that was our name of our social organization that we created.  And it really was an off-campus organization, but we, we would have meetings; we had parties; you know, we've have like what they call a waistline party where you pay one cents according to the size of your waist.  And that was your entry into the party.  We'd have a little fundraiser.  We'd serve--we'd sell See's candy [See's Candies] where you buy--I think from See's candy you'd get three suckers for ten dollars and then we'd sell 'em for a dollar each or something like that.  So we'd have little fundraisers for our dances, and we did a little charity work.  So we created our own.
Story_ID: 155846
Speaker 1: So were you a good--a good student in high school [at George Washington Preparatory High School, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: I was an okay student.  I wasn't an exceptional student.  I was more--I'm more social.  My sister [Dorothy Middleton Taylor] was the one who got the really good grades.  I didn't get serious about education until high school (laughter)--I mean until college.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had the drum and bugle corps; you had the--your, your girls organization--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That girls organization.  But Jack and Jill [of America] really took up a lot of my social life.  That was my social life.  I grew up in a pretty strict home, and we had to be well supervised.  It's--to go to someone's home it's like, "Who are their parents?" you know that question.  You know, "Like what's their background?  Who are they?  Oh, I don't know them.  You can't go there."  You know, that kind of stuff--very strict background.  And so we were very--I was very well-supervised growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so--
Speaker 2: We had--my parents [Vivian Scoot Middleton and Philip Govan Middleton] had to know the parents and who they were for us to go.  So Jack and Jill had a lot--was my lot of my socialization.
Story_ID: 155847
Speaker 1: Who were some of your heroes in high school [at George Washington Preparatory High School, Los Angeles, California]?  I mean, who--I mean, did you have like--were there people that you looked up to and aspired to be like when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Actually, I saw her yesterday at the grocery story.  Martha Tucker, who was Walter Tucker--Walter was a dentist.  He was Dr. Walter Tucker [Jr.], but he was the mayor of Compton [California].  So she was a writer and a homemaker.  She was one of my role models.  My mother [Vivian Scott Middleton] was one of my role models.  But we didn't have--because we weren't exposed to black history, I didn't have those kinds of role models, because we just didn't know who they were.  So they were more local role models.
Speaker 1: And did you have any idea what you wanted to do when you finished high school?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a teacher.  That's, that's as far as I saw was being a teacher.
Speaker 1: And what, what, what kind of counseling did you get in high school?
Speaker 2: Actually, I talked to a writer about this that I met when I was working with Bill Cosby [William "Bill" Cosby, Jr.] on a project that we were working on.  I was really discouraged from going to college.  Because I was an average student, I was really discouraged from going to college.  And I ended up going to a junior college as a result of it.
Speaker 1: Did the counselors act--actually discourage you to--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, and we were actually discouraged--I was actually discouraged.
Speaker 1: What did they tell you?
Speaker 2: They just didn't think I had the grades to go.  They just thought oh, I should just go out and get a job.  And I'm like, "No, not with the family I have; I'm going to college."  And I didn't even apply for four-year colleges 'cause they just told me I just sh--shouldn't go.
Speaker 1: All right, so did--okay, so were your parents [Vivian Scott Middleton and Philip Govan Middleton] telling you you should be going to--go to--
Speaker 2: It was expected.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was expected.  They didn't even have to tell you.  It was expected.  But after high school, you were going--you know, it was just expected.  It's like the DNA was in the drinking water.  You go from high school to college.  And you know, I never even went home and shared with them that I was discouraged from going to college.
Speaker 1: So did you take the college prep course in high school?
Speaker 2: I did.  I did, but you know, we weren't prepared like kids prepare now.  I remember when I took the SAT [Scholastic Assessment Test].  We probably did the college prep course, but we had no--I mean, that was the biggest shock when I took the S--the, the SAT.  We just didn't study like, like, like the kids do now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a recent phenomenon.  I think--well, no--well, it's probably been around for a long time, but I, I remember--were, were pretty much the same age, but I remember there was no studying for SAT then.  Par--parents just kind of--
Speaker 2: You just took it.
Speaker 1: --you just took the test, yeah.
Speaker 2: You just went and took it.  And I realize in hindsight, once I got to NBC [National Broadcasting Company], I wish I'd have been a better student.  I wish I'd have taken education more seriously.  And now I do read with a different interest, you know.
Story_ID: 155848
Speaker 1: Now be--you graduated [from George Washington Preparatory High School, Los Angeles, California] in '66 [1966], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: But before you graduated, in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] there's, there's the big riot of '65 [1965] in Watts [California].  Now--you know, now that I'm not--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Actually, I have a funny--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --story about that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --actually.  We weren't living--ooh, sorry, I touched the microphone.  We weren't living over there.  We had left that neighborhood, but that is actually where the riot started.  My parents [Vivian Scott Middleton and Philip Govan Middleton] owned some property right there where the riot started, with the policemen pulling over the guy.  And my dad--
Speaker 1: So (unclear) right there?
Speaker 2: Right there.  They--it was right next to the building that my parents owned.  They had income property, and my dad went over there 'cause he had heard there was a problem.  And he said, "these people have gone crazy."  You know, there were rocks in the streets.  And we actually drove over there, my mother and I, and I think one of my siblings.  We drove over there, and we pulled up to the curb, and daddy said, "get out of here."  We drove--had to drive away.  But we actually drove over there 'cause it started at our apartment building.  And we were going to Jack and Jill camp.  We left the next morning and drove to--there is this camp that we used to go to up in the Mendocino Woodlands [Mendocino, California], which is 150 miles north of San Francisco [California].  And that next day, we spent the entire day driving up there, 'cause that was our planned vacation.  And we could see the reserve troops driving down from Northern California on their way to Los Angeles, you know, to get involved in helping settling things down from the riots.  And we weren't here; we left, but it was a planned, scheduled vacation.
Speaker 1: So this is one of the first major urban riots in the '60s [1960s] and--or the first probably, you know, of the '60s [1960s].  And so you had no conception of what it was gonna be like, right?
Speaker 2: We had no conception and it never happened before.  And it was pra--it started in the neighborhood where I used to live, but it really went kind of around the neighborhood.  It went like Imperial [Street, Los Angeles, California] over to Watts, if you will, 'cause we lived very close to Watt--the Watts area.  And, and kind of really all was concentrated in that area.  [Dr.] Walter Tucker [Jr.], who I mentioned a minute ago--a little while ago, his office building over there in Watts--they had a medical building over there that was affected.  That whole, you know, burning down the stores and all that happened over in Watts so.  We weren't here though.  We just read about it in the newspaper like everybody else did.
Speaker 1: Now did you--did you perceive a, a change in people's attitudes after that in '65 [1965] go--going into your senior year in '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: Probably later; probably more in college.  As, as--act--actually, I take that back.  It had really already kind of happened.  Because remember, I just--well, I told you, when we first went to high school in tenth grade, which had to be '63 [1963]--no, I graduated in '63 [1963], so say '63 [1963], '64 [1964]--we had a little riot at [George] Washington [Preparatory] High School [Los Angeles, California] between the black kids that were coming in and the white kids who were previously established there.  So while this was on a larger scale in our community, the frictions had kind of already started, if you'd just think about it.  I never thought about it until you're mentioning it right now.  But I think black people were beginning to exert themselves and demanding more from society and not happy with the white establishment, if you will.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--
Story_ID: 155849
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963] was the March on Washington took place.  Did, did anybody in your family go you think?
Speaker 2: No, our minister went from the Holman [United Methodist] Church [Los Angeles, California].  Reverend White [Lanneau L. White] went and his sons went with him 'cause they were concerned about his, you know, well-being.  So a couple of his sons went with him and a couple of people that represented some of the local constituents in government went, but nobody from my family went.
Speaker 1: Okay, we had the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham [Alabama] that fall [1963]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as well as a--the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
Speaker 2: Right, so that--in fact, some of that's been on the news recently, and you just--that's just something you never forget.  I was in the eleventh grade, and we weren't supposed to have radios at school.  And I remember I was in my eleventh grade class, so say it was--probably remember it being eleven o'clock when it was announced.  And if you think about it, it's probably one o'clock in Dallas [Texas].  And the radios came out and then it just disrupted the whole day.  And that was a very solemn weekend.  You know, we were glued to the television watching everything that was going on.  I remember watching live [Jack Leon] Ruby getting shot [sic, Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald].  We watched it live on television.  The--that Monday was a holiday, the day of the funeral.  Everything was closed.  At church on Sunday, it had been very solemn.  And they asked people after the service just to be very quiet and not talk.  It was just something--it was like--it's like a snapshot.  It's like a little movie in your mind of what happened during that time.
Story_ID: 155850
Speaker 1: But, I must tell you that before the funeral [of President John F. Kennedy], maybe remember that Thursday, my cousin and I were supposed to go on a dance show called '[The] Lloyd Thaxton [Show].'  It was a local dance show like 'Soul Train' or something, but it was a primarily a white show.  And he and I went, even though it was Thanksgiving day, you know, we still had to go on the show.  So I had a little tastes of television before I actually got involved in television.  I guess because I was from Los Angeles [California].  But we went on the dance show anyway even though it was just a few days afterwards and danced and then, you know, went home.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, 'American Bandstand' was, was, was taped out here, wasn't it or, or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, it was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] first.  I can't remember when it moved out here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But it--I remember when it was in Philadelphia because I remember going to visit my cousins in Philadelphia and driving by and seeing it and knowing who the people were, who had kind of become little celebrities, and wanting to be on--not--didn't really know how to be on, but wanting to be on.  But it originally started in Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  Now there was a certain point they moved out here.
Speaker 1: No, they did.
Speaker 2: And they, they were doing--
Speaker 1: And actually I did--
Speaker 2: --(unclear) dance--
Speaker 1: I did work with Dick Clark on a couple of shows when I became a program executive when I was in variety programming.

Speaker 1: High school graduation was in what year (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-six [1966]--
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966], okay.
Speaker 2: --from George Washington [Preparatory] High School [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and, and so you're go on to, to community college.
Speaker 2: I left--I graduated and started at Harbor Community College [Los Angeles Harbor Community College, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I drove to schoo--my parents [Vivian Scott Middleton and Philip Govan Middleton] bought me a car, and I drove to school every day.  We had a little carpool.  Tell you how much gas--I don't even remember what gas was.  It had--probably be twenty-five cents a gallon or something like that--seventy cents a gallon.  Because the girl--three--four girls rode with me, and their share was two dollars and fifty cents a week.  So I collected--I had a little coin thing in the car--two dollars and fifty cents from the three or four girls that road with me.  And we carpooled and drove to community college.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, how was Harbor?  Did, did it--I mean, you know, did you get involved--were you exposed to--
Speaker 2: I didn't get really involved in anything.  I just went to school.
Speaker 1: Okay and were, were you majoring in any particular thing or just--
Speaker 2: You didn't have to declare a major.  I'm still geared toward education, so I probably, if I had to choose anything, it would have probably been education.  But remember it was general education, so you just took the classes that were required.  I took speech; I took history.
Story_ID: 155852
Speaker 1: I was there [at Los Angeles Harbor Community College, Los Angeles, California]--this is when my life took a turn (laughter).  I was there un--my first year, and I got pregnant in college so that really changed my life and changed my traject--trajectory.  And that's when my life changed a lot.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, so did you get married?
Speaker 1: I did get married to--you know, it was a guy that I met in college.  And that's what you did then.  You got married.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is Mr. Tucker then?
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is Mr. Tucker.
Speaker 2: All right, okay and so, so you got the child and you're going to--you know, you're married and now--
Speaker 1: The marriage didn't last long.  In fact, we were already separated by the time my son [Nye Tucker] was born.  He had gone to--he had signed up and gone into the [U.S.] Air Force.  So I was kind of back at home with my parents [Vivian Scott Middleton and Philip Govan Middleton], and I started working at the [Los Angeles] Police Department.  I--my son was born, I took a refresher typing class, and I got a job as a clerk typist at the Los Angeles Police Department.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Probably making not very much money.  And my parents at that time owned a duplex, so they allowed me to live in one of the duplexes.  I lived in the one bedroom with my son.  And I worked at night, and my son, you know, went to preschool.
Speaker 2: Any stories about wor--working for L-LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] at night?
Speaker 1: You know, sing--being a single mom--well, I was basically single by then 'cause I knew I wasn't gonna be--stay married to that person.  It was really hard.  It was really hard.  It was a time when being an unmarried woman was not, again, favorable.  You know, it was seen as a negative light.  It's--you know, I went from this very middle class, being presented by The Links [Incorporated], debutant life to like hard stop, single mom, you know, pregnant teenager--well, I'm an older teen--I was nineteen--to this whole different life that wasn't my parents' dream for me.  And as a parent, I understand now what a disappointment that was.  And I did, I felt a disappointment to my family, and I felt like that wasn't what they had planned for me.  So I started working at the police department and it was a whole different slice of life than I'd ever experienced before.  It was a whole different group of people that I'd not met before who weren't as aspirational, weren't necessarily interested in going to college.  It was more the working class.  And for the first time, I learned to appreciate a different group of people, because I'd led a pretty sheltered life, you know, people who were kind of like me, like my family, like our values.  It was kind of like a cocoon.  So I got to know a whole different group of people.  But one of the things that I saw was people that were working in an industry, and this was like their life,  you know, lower--not very many chances for advancement, people  been working ten, fifteen years, wanting to go back to school.  So I decided I was going back to school, plus my parents were really pressuring me to go back to school.  And that's when I decided I was going back to college, because I could see people who had been working in this industry as, you know, clerk typist--
Story_ID: 155853
Speaker 1: --'Kay. So what I was gonna say was working for the [Los Angeles] Police Department was very interesting.  I was not making much money as a clerk typist, but what was very--you know, at that point, as a single mother you're motivated to earn more money.  So police officers made a significantly more money than I did, so I decided I was gonna be a police officer, so I did.  I did the training, I filled out the application, and I was gonna police--be a police officer.  And I went through the interview, took the exam, went through the interview process, but I did not get chosen.  'Cause then, again, there were fewer police officers.  And that was one of the best things that ever happened to me, that that didn't go down that path.  And as a result of that, I decided I'm going back to school 'cause I need to earn more money.  I need to finish and get my college education.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you went through the whole training process and everything?
Speaker 1: No, no, I didn't.
Speaker 2: You didn't.
Speaker 1: I applied.
Speaker 2: Okay, you just applied.
Speaker 1: I did not get selected.  But I--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --did the physical training to get ready for the test, if you will, but I didn't pass the written test.  I didn't--the written test or the interview.  I didn't get selected to go to the academy--best thing that ever happened to me (laughter).  But I did it.  I was motivated by money.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because officers are paid well.  They have good pensions and all that, so that was my motivation.
Speaker 2: All right, so this is--we're about 19--what? '68 [1968] or '-9 [1969]?
Speaker 1: Probably '69 [1969].
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969], okay.
Speaker 1: Probably '69 [1969].
Story_ID: 155854
Speaker 1: Now there had been other I guess riots in '68 [1968] out here after [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed.  Was that, that true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember that, yeah.  That was right after my son [Nye Tucker] was born.  He was born in February [1968], and Dr. King was assassinated in April [1968], then and there were riots after that.
Speaker 1: But on, on the television front, 'Julia' was on television with [HM] Diahann Carroll.  I think that started in the fall of '67 [1967] I think.  I'm thinking--
Speaker 2: I can't remember either.
Speaker 1: --it was either, either the fall of '67 [1967] or '68 [1968] [sic, 'Julia' first aired in 1968].  It's in that period.  Did you take special note of that or?
Speaker 2: Of course, our whole community.  That was a really important television show for us, even though some people felt it was representative of the life they had.  But growing up middle class, while I didn't know any single mothers that were living like that, I was a single mother and probably identified with it a little bit.  But I was not in her what appeared to be so--social economic status.  I needed to get back to school and get myself together.
Speaker 1: Okay, but she was a nurse, and she had a little boy who was about five or six I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Corey [Baker].
Speaker 1: Right, right, so, so you had a son--you, you had a son as well, but he was a lot younger.
Speaker 2: No--oh, yeah, he was a lot younger.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But the reason I remember his name is I have a friend who also had a baby around that time, and she named her son Corey.  And it came from that television show.
Story_ID: 155855
Speaker 1: So now you're-- are you still in school while you working LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department]?
Speaker 2: I, I think that I--yes, I was actually.  I did do that.  Because I ended up trying to go to school and work for the police department, and it turned out to be too much.  Actually, I ended up getting terminated because I'd go to the lounge and sleep, or I'd just be so tired from being up all day and I'd put my head down.  I remember putting my head down on the ticker tape machine.  And I told the guy I was working with, "just wake me up in five minutes."  The next thing I know, my supervisor is tapping me on my shoulder.  'Cause I had just put my head down.  'Cause I was going to school and working, and I had my son [Nye Tucker].  And I ended up leaving the police department as a result of it.  And I was on--I went on welfare, so I had food stamps.
Speaker 1: So you were living on your own--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was liv--oh yeah, I was living on my own.  I didn't get money, but I did get food stamps, which was a big help.  And I had student loans, and I had student grants, and that's how I ended up going back to school.
Speaker 1: Okay and you went back to--
Speaker 2: I finished at Southwest College [Los Angeles Southwest Community College, Los Angeles, California], and I transferred to Cal State Los Angeles [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay that's the University Cal--California in Los Angeles, meaning--
Speaker 2: It's call--
Speaker 1: Cal State Los Angeles, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, Cal State University of Los Angeles.  It wasn't university then.  It was Cal State Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, now by this time, are there--I mean, were there any major influences there, in terms of teachers or mentors?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I was working at night at an insurance policy--an insurance company, assembling insurance policies from 11:30 at night until 5:30 in the morning.  I was going to school during the day while my son was in school, and I was sleeping between classes, or my classes would overlap.  So I wasn't involved in the social fabric of college at all, because I was totally focused.  I was a child development major, because I wan--again, wanted to teach school.  And they had created this new subject called child development, and it was perfect for me.  I planned to be a preschool teacher, and my ambition was to start my own preschool--to have my own preschool.
Speaker 1: That's interesting 'cause you've got a son who's a--who's at child development age--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as this is going on.  So were you able to try things out you--
Speaker 2: I did--
Speaker 1: --you learned in classes?
Speaker 2: --try things out on him.  I did test things out on him.  And there was another family, the Draper [ph.] family, who now lives in Atlanta [Georgia], I used to use their kids and try my little childcare experiments on them, you know, like measuring water to see whether they could tell the volume at different--difference because the shape of the dish had changed and things like that.  So I did those things with my son.  I also tried some of those child development techniques on my son.  And he also went to The Montessori Method, which turned out to be a little pro--problematic later.  Because you had kids with all these preschool ideas of oh, you can do whatever you wanna do.  And then they go to school and you can't.  Life is not like you can do what you wanna do.  So there were big--there was a group of kids that were going to school under this child development phase that ended up with some problems, because you cannot do what you wanna do.  It has to be a little bit more structured so.  I really bought into it then.  I changed later as a mother with my other children.  I, you know, went back to being a little more structured, 'cause I realized life is not like that.  It is more structured.  So it did have an influence.
Story_ID: 155856
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I always loved children.  And that's when I really began also to read children's literature and collecting children's literature.  I read books to my son [Nye Tucker], but I also loved children's literature.  And I started collecting children's books probably in 1969 when I was in Cal State L.A. [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], and I took a children's literature class.  And I saw--I see later that threading into my--what became my career.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a--did, did, did, did you have any favorite children's authors?
Speaker 2: Ezra Keats.  As--I really liked a lot of the African American writers.  I really looked for African American books for my children.  That was the beginning of some of the first black books for our children.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.  Right, that was a--that was a whole kind of a cultural revolution in children's books.
Speaker 2: [HM] Nikki Giovanni.
Speaker 1: Right, right, black illustrators get jobs in major publishing companies like the Pinkneys [Brian Pinkney and Jerry Pinkney] and, you know, so--
Story_ID: 155857
Speaker 1: There are no teachers really there to--really inspirational?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I was too focused on the cla--I was very focused on the classes and the knowledge in the classes.  I was studying.  My grades--I went--became like an "A" student.  It was mainly getting in college and getting out of there as fast as I could.  And I was working.  So I was also teaching preschool at that time.  There was a preschool that I taught at that was supported--that was a non-profit.  A woman in Beverly Hills [California] started it.  And it was a mobile preschool, where we had a truck that was all supplied.  It's like a little regular little van; not a minivan, but a van.  It had all the school supplies.  And we'd take it to a park over by El Camino College [Torrance, California]; and we'd take out the table and chairs every day; and have preschool in the park every day from nine until twelve.  So I was doing that while I was in school.
Story_ID: 155858
Speaker 1: You graduated [from California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] in '72 [1972] according to what I have here.  Is that, that true?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was I really finished in '71 [1971].  And I had that one class that I didn't finish up and didn't get back and finish, so I had to go back and take one more class to complete my degree in '72 [1972], but I really left college in '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so is there anything significant about graduation that you--that you?
Speaker 2: I just remember my son [Nye Tucker], who was probably four years old, being there for me graduating.  That was just--I'll never forget him being all dressed up and me and my parents [Vivian Scott Middleton and Philip Govan Middleton], you know, finally--me graduating.  I, I walked in 1971.  Even though I officially did not get my degree until (unclear), I just remember it being such a happy day that I could fi--I was so tired of being--struggling and not having any money and being a student.  I was just really excited about getting a job, being able to go get a job, and so I began looking for a job.  And I took the teaching test.  There weren't enough positions.  I didn't get hired.  I started out--I ended up finally getting a job at the Southern California Gas Company and started working there.  But I ended up not passing probation because I wasn't placid; I wasn't calm enough; I wasn't quiet enough; I was handling too many customers.  I think I was just too aggressive for them, and I didn't fit into their mold of who works for the Southern California Gas Company so I was terminated.  And I thought, "Oh no."  So in the meantime, I'd gone on the 'Dating Game,' and I won a trip to the Philippines and Hong Kong.  And, of course, at that point I a starving student, if you will, with no money.  And I had this opportunity, so I got a passport.  And friends gave me a little pocket money plus they gave me money to shop for things that they wanted, and that gave me the ability to shop on the trip.  Before I left, I interviewed for a position--oh, I'd gone to San Francisco [California] to see a friend and come back.  And on the way back, I met a guy named David Ochoa [ph.], and he said, you know, "Go see my friend Jay Rodriguez in personnel at NBC [National Broadcasting Company] and, and see if you he can set up an interview for you."  And I went to see Jay Rodriguez; they set up an interview for me; and I interviewed as a secretary in the research department, and left and went on my 'Dating Game' date to Manila [Philippines] and Hong Kong.  And when I come back--came back, my parents said NBC called; you have a job.  So that was November of 1971, and I started working in December at NBC.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 155859
Speaker 1: So this is, you know, is a decent paying job.  It's not what you were trying to--you were trying to become a teacher, but--but this is a job at NBC [National Broadcasting Company].  So were, were you excited?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I was very excited.  And I must say, I was excited.  I didn't know anything about the entertainment industry.  I had no aspiration.  I did think a little bit about modeling, but I decided that I did not want to--I'd been on a couple of interviews where someone else was making the decision about whether or not my son [Nye Tucker] could eat.  I remember saying--thinking that.  And I just couldn't do that.  I was a single mother with a little boy that needed to eat and so I said no, I can't do that, and that's when I ended up getting the regular job.  And it wasn't the same money that teachers were making.  It was less, but as I became more and more exposed to the entertainment industry, I really liked it.  I had--the original job I went to interview for, they had reorganizi--reorganized the department.  And I was working for the head of the department as his secretary, which was pretty amazing because at that point we're typing on the IBM Selectric Typewriter.  I had no idea what liquid paper was (laughter).  I had no idea what liquid paper was, and I wasn't an exceptional typist or anything so there was a lot of liquid paper used.  And nobody really ever got an original because I had to Xerox and tape and paste and liquid paper things out.  But this Richard Lindheim believed in me as a person, and he gave me my first opportunities to do things--other things in the department.
Speaker 1: What do you think impressed them about you--I mean, you know, why would they hire you of all--I mean, 'cause I, I guess they could have hired someone with super secretarial skills, but--wa--wa--was it your background in early childhood education, or, or, or what--
Speaker 2: I don't think it was my background in early childhood education.  I just think it was--I don't--I really don't know what it was.  First of all, it was the second floor of NBC, which was the programming department, which was a pretty--it wasn't the local station.  And I must tell you, on that floor, there was no other black people on that floor.
Speaker 1: So were you--you think--
Speaker 2: When I first started.
Speaker 1: --that you were the first one?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, proba--yeah--oh, I take that back.  There's a guy named [Stanley] Stan Robertson who was a program executive, but he was way down the hall close to the person who ran programming in California.  He had been there a number of years.  He was there, but there were no black women.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The only African Americans that they had started working in the industry at that time were working on KNBC, which was on the third floor.  There were a few African Americans up there.
Speaker 1: KNBC is a local station.
Speaker 2: Is the local station.  But on the second floor on the network working for NBC there weren't any.  So I would say it's probably my education.  It was probably my presentation, you know, of who I was as a person.  Maybe they say potential in me.  I'll have to ask Richard [Lindheim], 'cause I do stay in touch with him.  But they had focus group--what's are now are called focus groups.  They were called research groups then.  And Richard said to me one day, "Phyllis, do you think you could do a re--a focus group?"  And I said, "Sure," so I started doing focus groups.  And I observed how they did them, and eventually it's a position I moved into full time.  But he was willing at times to not have his assistant sitting at his desk, while I took three or four hours to oversee a focus group.  So, he just took a risk on me.  I had no idea.  It's just--it's God's blessing.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you think--in retrospect, you had the people skills I guess that, that--
Speaker 2: Probably--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Probably people skills; probably--I mean, what I found in that industry, when people were not accustomed to--when they had stereotypes--probably negative stereotypes of African Americans that you could speak well, that you could blend into that environment, I consider--because I grew up in a mixed--not grew up.  I went to school in mixed communities.  And also in my family you spoke--you know, you were corrected if you didn't speak correct English and this--you know, we--or raised to assimilate, if you will.  And I think all those skills worked for me.
Story_ID: 155860
Speaker 1: --So, this is 1971.  Now how did things pro--pro (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) nineteen seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 1: Seventy-two [1972], okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I started in December.  It was 1972 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did things progress at NBC [National Broadcasting Company]?  What was--what was it like there?
Speaker 2: First--I first started I'd deliver the ratings every morning.  I'd take the--you know, we had a huge copy machine.  The copy machine was huge.  I mean, you can't even imagine.  It was massive.  It was--I mean--and we'd get the ratings from New York [New York], and I'd duplicate them and take them down the hall and deliver them to people.  That was my first job.  Second job was working as assistant as answering phones, and then I started the group discussions.  But it was primarily white, male--white male, Jewish, and no women.  No women.  In fact, a few--a little while afterward, they hired the first female executive.  Her name was Lin Bolen.  And she's actually the character I think that the movie 'Network' was a parody of her, you know, this very aggressive woman.  But she was head of daytime programming.  And then a few more women were hired as, you know, network--as program executives.
Story_ID: 155861
Speaker 1: The, the focus groups, now what were they?  Were, were they to assess--
Speaker 2: Programs.
Speaker 1: Programs.
Speaker 2: It was program testing.  Research not only did the readings, but we also did program testing.  So at that point, God, the shows were: 'Quincy [M.E.],' the old medical show; '[The] Rockford Files.'  We also did an assessment of all the pilots when they were considering new pilots, where they would have the analytical questionnaires.  But then they also do the focus group to try to gain some insight into what potential viewers liked about the shows, whether or not they liked the characters.
Speaker 1: I think you, you were there about the time that 'Star Trek' started taking off in syndication.  This which had, had been an NBC [National Broadcasting Company] show--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --but it was canceled.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, was there any discussion about trying to bring it back as a full time--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --there was never any discussion.  I remember--I remember--and if I think about the shows that were in the studio--because I used to have to walk through the studio building to go get the focus groups and bring them in-'Midnight Special' was taping, okay.  What's the name of the show--the variety show?  What you (unclear)--God, what's the name of the variety show?  Rich--it was before Richard Pryor.  The African American that had the variety show that was on NBC--Flip Wilson.
Speaker 1: Right, Flip Wil--right.
Speaker 2: '[The] Flip Wilson [Show],'  'Johnny Carson' [sic, 'The Tonight Show, starring Johnny Carson']  Then later on 'Welcome Back, Kotter.'  Those shows were in the studios.  So that's how far back it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs was on 'Welcome Back, Kotter.'
Speaker 2: Exactly, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  And so--okay, so--
Speaker 2: And Redd Foxx [Jon Elroy Sanford] of--Redd Foxx's was on.  What was it called?
Speaker 1: 'Sanford and Son.'
Speaker 2: 'Sanford and Son' was on.  In fact, Redd Foxx and Desmond Wilson's parking space was right outside of our offices.  And eventually there production office moved like right down the hall, so that was the second African American on our floor, the secretary of that department.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's--
Speaker 2: So it was really pretty--and Redd Foxx would sometimes stop by and give us a laugh.
Speaker 1: Okay, were they--were they excited to see you in the office?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, that's why he stopped by the office.  He was flirtin' a bit (laughter).
Story_ID: 155862
Speaker 1: Now, when did you start to climb, you know, I guess?
Speaker 2: From that job I was offered manager--manager of variety programming by  [Duncan] Dick Ebersol, who had come over from producing--
Speaker 1: I remember his--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: 'Saturday Night Live.'
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: 'Saturday Night Live.'  He eventually became chairman of NBC [National Broadcasting Company] Sports, but he's the one who hired me into programming.  And that's when I moved down the hall and became a program executive.  So that was 1977.
Story_ID: 155863
Speaker 1: 'Cause 'The Richard Pryor Show' is '77 [1977], so you, you were promoted prior to the advent of 'The Richard Pryor--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Show.'
Speaker 2: It was about the same time within say, six, eight months.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is iconic show that had a short-- very short run.  The people still talk about it a lot, you know.  You can--you can buy episodes now--the four episodes (laughter) that were--
Speaker 2: 'The Richard Pryor Show.'
Speaker 1: 'The Richard Pryor Show,' right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What are your thoughts about Richard Pryor?
Speaker 2: 'The Richard Pryor Show' was--first of all, the show was not in the correct time period.  It was on at eight p.m., which is considered like family time.  And Richard Pryor is this brilliant man who was constantly being reined in.  And you know the nature of Richard Pryor's humor.  And it was--it was not programmed at the right time.  It should have been a ten o'clock show.  And if you'll remember--well, first of all, Richard felt emasculated by the constant creative pullback on his ideas.  And if you'll remember the opening scene of the first show, he had a statue of himself and he had a mold made where he was standing in this thing.  And you pull back on the camera, and he didn't have his male geniniti--genitalia--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's basically naked without his--
Speaker 2: He was cat--naked without--
Speaker 1: --without his--yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know what you say for the camera.  But anyway, he felt ema--and that represented the--his emasculation, if you will.  The first show that we taped the first night when all the celebrities and everybody was coming to the taping of the show, Richard Pryor did not come out of the dressing room.  He was so terrified.  The show would start taping at eight o'clock.  They could not get him out of the dressing room.  He would not come out.  We ended up staying there until eleven, twelve o'clock trying to coax him out of the dressing room, and finally they canceled the taping because he would not come out of the dressing room. He was so afraid of failure.
Speaker 1: This is odd too, 'cause I, I think in the first show there's this long sequence of him walking out of a dressing room talk--and bumping into people before he's suppo--he's supposed to be on stage and keeps being interrupted.  There's this long--you know.
Speaker 2: Well, that was scripted and part of the show, but that show was taped the next day.  It was not taped the original night it was supposed to tape.  And in those days, and I don't know if they do it now 'cause there's not that much variety, but you would tape variety shows at night.  And there was a live audience, and a lot of his friends were invited.  And it was--it wa--it was like a Richard Pryor performance, and he was absolutely terrified, and he did not come out of the dressing room.
Speaker 1: So that--okay, now this is something that, that occurs again--I mean, that, that--there are report--you know the stories about Richard Pryor disappearing from things, you know, like 'Blazing Saddles.'  He, he was supposed to play, play the lead role.  He wrote the script, but he didn't show up for, for the shooting.  That--so this--so he--so he had to be coaxed.  How, how did they--how they coax him out of the--
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't involved in that part.  The producers had to do that.  I was the program executive who was on the show, so I saw the result of him finally coming out.  But that night--I'll never forget that night, 'cause I didn't get home until two o'clock in the morning or something like that.  And my son [Nye Tucker] was with me.  I'd gone home to get my son for him to be in the studio with us, at that point I didn't have a babysitters at night or something or not that particular night.  And he just wouldn't come out.  He was terrified, so we ended up shooting the show the next day.
Story_ID: 155864
Speaker 1: And Richard [Pryor]--it was really a pleasure to work with him because he's so--he was just so brilliant.  I remember we did a sh--sh--sketch about clowns.  And the sketch itself, in terms of him being a sad clown, as I was sitting there and watching it in the bleachers, just moved you to tears.  He was such a brilliant actor.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, you know, it's been said many times that comedians are really sa--very sad people.  Did you find that to be true with him?
Speaker 1: No, what I said was I think they're brilliant.  After working with Richard Pryor and Robin Williams, they are brilliant.  You don't realize that the kit--it made me--because--maybe because I'm the child development and the mother, realize that--and, and Ed--Eddie Murphy the same thing.  They're brilliant.  And school situations contain them and constantly tell 'em no and sit down and things like that.  And they are actually brilliant.  They are brilliant observers of life, and they bring it to life through their observations of life.  And Robin Williams used to play with my son [Nye Tucker] like in the sta--in the--in the bleachers.  He'd do all those faces and, and voices and things like that and make him laugh.  He was eight (unclear) he's--he was eight years old, and he would just entertain him.  'Cause they--and they also keep busy, and they keep moving.  They can't be still.  That's what I found, in terms of being around them.  They have to--they're constantly on, they're constantly entertaining; they're constantly moving around; they're constantly telling jokes; they're constantly having the focus of the attention on them; but they're brilliant 'cause they just see things in life that you don't see.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you're saying when they're, they're in public they're actually being themselves.  They're engaging all the time.
Speaker 1: They're engaging.  They're on all the time.  And Richard was just--he would run and he would hide and not--I mean, Rocco Urbisci was the producer.  And Paul Mooney was a part of the team that got him to come out.
Speaker 2: So that's interesting.  That relationship--Paul Mooney I know did a lot of the writing for the 'Richard Pryor Show.'
Speaker 1: Um-hmm, he did.
Speaker 2: And so he had to actually persuade Richard to come out?
Speaker 1: Uh-hmm, 'cause he was a good--he was a--he was kind of a friend.  Rocco Urbisci--in fact, to me there needed to be a stronger authority on the show who could make Richard more--Richard needed to be more accountable.  If anything, those, those people to me, from my perspective--and I mean I was a young program executive--they were more friends with Richard.  They were more friendly with Richard, and it took--it just needed to be--there needed to be an authority figure as far as I was concerned.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, we know that the show ran four episodes, but--so what was--kind of give, give us a perspective I guess from--what happened, you know.
Speaker 1: It wasn't a ratings success.  It wasn't a ratings success, and I also think it was a combination.  It wasn't a ratings success--but any show that starts new, unless it's highly promoted, has to be given time.  Richard was not happy because of the restrictions, and it really was not programmed in the right time period.  It should have been a ten o'clock show.
Story_ID: 155865
Speaker 1: All right, we were just reflecting on 'The Richard Pryor Show,' the four episodes and what happened.  So, so basically, it just didn't have, have the ratings.
Speaker 2: It didn't have any ratings, and it was a combination.  Usually if a show doesn't have any ratings, they will leave it on and give it a try, but the combination that I said, it didn't have any ratings; Richard's [Richard Pryor's] creative direction being held back; and because of the time period; and his dissatisfaction with the show.  I just think on both sides they just decided not to go forward.
Speaker 1: Okay and, and what you--yeah, what you said, said about the time period.  It seems a lot like--it seems like a--you know, it seems obvious, you know, that that's--it's in the wrong timeslot, you know, to me.  You know, when you said that, it's oh, yeah, they--NBC [National Broadcasting Company] does the power to put, put it any time it wants it, right?
Speaker 2: Right, but I don't think the people at NBC who make the decisions really understood Richard Pryor.  They probably thought of him like they did Flip Wilson, which was a more general audience appeal comedian, and did not really understand who Richard Pryor was.  If you think about it, the people who were making the decisions at NBC really kind of didn't understand and just felt that you could--they didn't understand the brilliance and the depth of his ca--if--of his humor and his look at life or a slice of life.  If you think about if, if I'm a program executive and I'm gonna make a decision about doing Richard Pryor, I just think oh, I'm just gonna hold him back on the dirty jokes.  Well, if you're holdin' him back on the dirty jokes, and he did have the dirty jokes, then there was a depth in terms of the comedy and the slice of life that he wanted to do that they just wouldn't allow.
Speaker 1: What you just said raises another--I mean, a consistent question--a car--cardinal question for black people especially is the distance between TV production executives and, and advice about what--you know, what will work for black pe--people especially, you know, and in this case, just for an--anybody wa--watching 'The Richard Pryor Show.'  It's in a wrong time, you know, and, and nobody--did--what--did, did, did you really feel any frustration at that period of time in--around, you know, de--de--decisions being made that you felt were is not--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: First of all, the decisions were made above my level, first of all.  And something you just said caught my attention.  You said, for the black audience or black people watching.  Remember at that time, 1977, they weren't programming for a black audience.  They were programming for a white audience, and they weren't looking for anything black.  If you think about that compared to Flip Wilson.  Flip Wilson, other than a little minor cultural innuendo, it was general comedy.  That's what they're looking for.  They weren't looking for anything that was gonna be black, if you will.  They wanted him to be a general comedian.  So an African American audience, and I as a program executive, and even Richard as the creator, the subtleties are the things that they were taking away from him, the things that made him feel emasculated.  They didn't even understand unless they understand it subliminally, in terms of men-- you know, white men and black men--they didn't even--I don't know if it was an active participation of we're gonna emasculate Richard Pryor.  It was just--you know, all that stuff is innate, how you feel as an African American male, how people are making judgments about your creative decisions and deciding what you can do and what you can't do.  They didn't even understand what they were asking him to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, they're like swimming in the stream just doing what they normally do, and--
Speaker 2: And they weren't programming for a black audience then.  That whole idea of programming for a niche audience was much later in television.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably, you know, ten, fifteen years later of a more targeting African American audience.  And there's a little history to our company that, you know, kind of talked about later, but that was much later.
Speaker 1: Okay, did, did you kind of lament the demise of 'The Richard Pryor Show?'  I mean, in--
Speaker 2: I felt a relief, 'cause I just thought it was really unfair for Richard.  He was tortured.  He was really tortured.  It was really sad.  I remember sitting in the bleachers and crying when he did the (unclear)--the clown sequence because I felt it was--I was looking on the inside of what was going on in his head, that he was really just contractually tied, but being frustrated by the limitations of television.  So in a way for me it was a relief, even though it was brilliant comedy.  It was brilliant comedy.
Speaker 1: I remember one sequence he did with [HM] Maya Angelou, which, which I thought was something that I'd--I'd never seen anything like that on network television, yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, I haven't seen that show in so long.  If I sat down and watched episodes, it would probably bring back lots of memories.  But right now I just don't have any real memories of that.  If I looked at it, I'd--those memories would flood back, but I haven't really looked at that material in thirty years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 155866
Speaker 1: Well, during this period of time now you were involved in some other programs.  You were involved with 'Chico and the Man,' right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and what did you do in--
Speaker 2: Still at the same role, program executive, where you read the script and give notes.  Less involved in that show.  There was a show called 'C.P.O. Sharkey.'  God, what was the name of that doctor's name?  Can't even remember the name of the--Don Rickles, Don Rickles.
Speaker 1: Mr. Warmth.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Exactly.  And I--and, and working on this show has really real--made me realize that variety programming really wasn't for me.  Because one of the things that executives did, they laughed at the jokes and they weren't even really funny.  It just wasn't--that wasn't where, where--what my calling was.  It really wasn't what my calling was.
Story_ID: 155867
Speaker 1: Now you're--in, in '77 [1977], you're also going back to school.  Are, are, are you taking graduate--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --court--courses?
Speaker 2: I was at Pacific Oaks College [Pasadena, California], which is a school in--a u--a college in Pasadena, California, that focuses on human--human development and child development.  And I was going for a master's degree.
Speaker 1: Now did you see--at that time, were you seeing this as facilitating a TV career or did you see it as, as a way to get back into education?
Speaker 2: Actually, the timing on that's probably a little bit--it's about the same time.  I probably started more toward a la--few years earlier.  And I was working on trying to better understand the research and, and what people wanted.  But then once I got started, I wanted to complete and get my master's degree in human development.  And it got to a point where it wou--because I had started, I wanted to get my degree.  And when I found out how much teachers were getting paid, I said there's no point in me getting a degree.  I need to focus on my career, so that's when I--only thing I had left to do was write my thesis, and I had a five-year window, and I've actually--I had professors in then that I'd see later, you know, in publicly.  And they'd say, "Phyllis, you gotta get your master's."  And I'm like--it was more beneficial for me to go on and focus on my career that--rather than making--getting my master's.  But now, in hindsight, that my career has changed and finished and sort of re--the retirement age, I kind of wish I had that degree so maybe I could teach.  But that's the only time I've ever felt like oh, I should have gone on and gotten that degree.  But for my career, I had the information; I had what I needed.  It really helped me in my career.  I think it was the ammunition or the substance that I was able to put in the children's programming and family programming that I was involved in.  So it was really helpful in terms of that.  I didn't need the degree in terms of--an advanced degree to be a program executive.  I just didn't need it.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 155868
Speaker 1: Okay, I moved from variety programming to dramatic programming.  As a result of some personnel issues and deciding to put somebody else in variety, variety really wasn't--variety and situation comedy wasn't where I really was comfortable, so I moved over to dramatic programming.  And my old boss, Richard Pryor--I mean, I'm sorry--Richard Lindheim, was in charge of dramatic programming in NBC [National Broadcast Company] at that point, and I went back to work for him.  And he put me, because of my child development and success in children's testing, put me in charge of all the family shows.  So that's when I was the program executive on 'The Wonderful World of Disney,' 'Little House on the Prairie,' 'CHiPs.'  There was a short miniseries that we did on 'Little Women,' and I used that child development knowledge and information and developed story lines in those primetime shows.  And they were the head of--they--the big ratings winners in primetime at that point.  NBC was not number one then.  We were number three, but my shows were doing well 'cause they were targeted to family; they were subjects that kids would be interested in and families could watch together; and they were successful in the ratings.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Little House on the Pra--Prairie' especially became like the iconic show--family show of that era.
Speaker 1: Yes, it was, and it was family stories.  I worked directly with Michael Landon.  In fact, the network and Michael Landon had a disagreement.  When the Mary character became very, very popular, we kind of felt that he was a little bit jealous of the fact that she became so popular and discouraged him from having her go blind.  And I must say it was probably the demise of the whole series.  Because she had developed as a character a big following of young girls, and even more so than the other character--the other daughter, the Laura Ingalls character, 'cause girls were really identifying with her as a teenager, etcetera.  I remember flying to location to meet with him and talk to him and--Fred Silverman, you gotta get him to not, you know, have this character go blind, but he was just so set on having her go blind.  And it really--
Speaker 2: He was right--Michael Landon was writing scripts?
Speaker 1: He writing and directing and very creatively involved in the series.
Speaker 2: So after blinding his--one of his principle characters of the show--
Speaker 1: The show really kind of went down from there.  A case of the ego overcoming what was really good for the show.
Speaker 2: Okay, so let's see.  Now 'CHiPs' was, you know, paired or had, had a Chicano highway patrolman with a, a white one.
Speaker 1: Right, a leading a character, yes.  He became--he just took off.  He had that mix of looks that girls liked and the show just really took off.  And he was actually the sidekick.  The Larry Wilcox character was supposed to be the lead, but then Ponch [Officer Frank Poncherello] took off as the romantic lead for, you know, the, the fans.  And he became the big star of the series.  And actually there was some tension behind the scenes.  When--I remember when they renegotiated his contract, the studio gave him a Rolls Royce, and then they had to give Larry a Rolls Royce 'cause they'd given, you know, Erik Estrada a Rolls Royce.  So, you know.
Story_ID: 155869
Speaker 1: In '79 [1979], you were promoted to director of children's programming.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now did you look forward to that or was that, that something--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That was a dream come true.  That was a dream come true, and it was actually the--it's just I really campaigned for that position, if you will.  Margaret Loesch, who had been director of children's programming, went to Hanna-Barbera to become vice president of their development and production.  And there was a woman there who was there manager of children's programming at NBC [National Broadcasting Company] that was in line to get the position.  And I was a manager of dramat--dramatic programming.  Now logically, she should have been the person that got the position, in fact said, if I don't get the position, I'm going to leave.  And I really campaigned for it.  And your brought up, middle class, you don't brag, you don't talk about yourself, you don't sell yourself.  You're not taught to do that.  You're taught to be more humble and, you know--but, I did, I campaigned for it and I got it.  And the woman left, so she left me with no department.  I started out--and it was the best thing that happened because I didn't have a manager who had been there before telling me how we used to do it or how we did it.  So I did the whole thing myself.  And we were a small department; I was director.  I hired a manager, a guy by the name of Sam Ewing, who was my second.  And I needed somebody with production background and the ability to edit.  I hired him actually from the local station.  He produced a show called The Saturday Show or something like that, and it was a local show.  The two of us started working, and at that point NBC's Saturday morning schedule was number three.  There were only three networks at that time.  It was before the others.  It was so far behind.  Were--the, the day part wasn't making any money at all.
Speaker 1: So they were last, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Like--rur--not last, but they were like super last.  They, they really should have been--if there were a third station, we'd be fourth.  We were so far behind the other networks.  And all it takes--what it takes in children's programming is one hit, and one hit can get you the momentum.  And after observing things that they had put on--like living with shows that had been put on before I got there and being guided to stay away from violence from the research side, I brought my experience in the 'Little House on the Prairie' and 'CHiPs' and 'Little Women' of--the morality tales and really spent a lot of time talking to the writers about developing strong characters.
Story_ID: 155870
Speaker 1: Talk about that for a moment, the pro--process of being a director of children's programming.  So you would--for instance, you--someone comes, comes up with an idea and then you, you review it I guess, and then you, you talk to writers--the, the writers about like what you want--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: What happens is--
Speaker 1: --what is the process?
Speaker 2: --children's programming is one of the great places to work espec--the network at that time.  Because not only do you develop and you supervise the creative direction, so it's--you do everything.  There's not separate like in primetime, which is developed one place and then it's handed over to currents.  You do development and you do current together.  So once you get your current schedule on the air, you begin to look and take pitches for new concepts.  And usually producers and writers come to you with new ideas of what they think would make a good television show.  And then based on what you feel with make a good television show for kids, you put it into development and you allocate so much money for a bible or a sample script.  No pilots in children's programming because there isn't money for it.  And then based on that you go to New York [New York] and pitch the idea to the head of the network, and you decide on a children's schedule, and then you go for it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And usually you spend the money.  At least that's where it was then.  It's not like that anymore.  You spend the money in one go, and whatever decision you make you have to live with it for a year 'cause there's no more--no money.
Story_ID: 155871
Speaker 1: After doing many of the Hanna-Barbera [Productions, Inc.] shows and kind of bringing them back, Fred Silverman was on vacation or something like that with--and found these little characters called the Smurfs as toys.  And they said I think that would make a good television show.  It was a belg--a property from Belgium based on books.  So Hanna-Barbera--because Fred Silverman had a lot of experience when he ran children's programming with Hanna-Barbera, they got all the books and we worked together on developing the series.  The two of us worked together.  And the beautiful thing about the 'Smurfs,' which really did change children's programming, is because we used the Seven Dwarfs as our--as our example of what we wanted to do with the 'Smurfs,' the different characters.  And also because the Smurfs looked so much alike, we had to really work hard to make sure that you could distinguish one character from the other, so we, we used many of the characters from the series, but we also created new ones.  Like, there was no female character.  There was like one story with the Smurfette, and we made Smurfette a regular character which the creator [Peyo] was kind of against.  He didn't want that to be a full-time character, but we convinced him it was a really good idea in terms of having balance in the series and appealing to both boys and girls.  And the Smurfette became one of the most popular characters.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so, yeah, in, in, in Belgium, it was--it was a comic strip drawn out--
Speaker 1: It was a com--in, in Europe if you seen those big books that they have that are fully drawn out cartoon characters and they're a complete books.  So there was probably twenty-five or thirty books, and we used those books to create the first stories.  And the first--the first hour--first time we put the show on it was an hour--(unclear).  It went on in 1981, and I remember that because I was expecting my daughter [Amani Vinson Pettis] (laughter) when I flew to New York [City, New York] to do the meetings.  So we put it on in 1981.  It became a hit like immediately.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was it big hit.  It know little --
Speaker 1: It was a huge hit.
Speaker 2: --kids at the time that (unclear).
Speaker 1: It was a huge hit.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the first show was an hour, and it was such a big hit then we made it ninety minutes later on.  But you and I were talking about Winifred Weinman [ph.] (unclear).  I remember she named one of the characters, Winnie where this is--the character whose gift was music, we were trying to come up with a name for him, and she named him Harmony.  By then our department had expanded and it was myself, Sam Ewing, and we hired a woman by the name of Winifred White [HM Winifred Neisser] as manager of children's programming.  And after that show was on, we went from a day part that was making say two million dollars within that first year.  The second year we made like thirty million dollars.  The pra--the advertising went up.  It was so significant because of the audience that we were getting, and we were getting like thirty-six and forty shares.  There's not a kid who was growing up then who doesn't know the 'Smurfs.'
Speaker 2: Okay and this is a show that doesn't have like a lot of gratuitous violence or--
Speaker 1: No, it was--
Speaker 2: --any--you know.
Speaker 1: --comedy, character, and Gargamel, the evil villain who was always after the Smurfs.  It was a lot of comedy.
Story_ID: 155872
Speaker 1: Now, there was a big toy tying in with the 'Smurfs,' and what role did the toy manufacturers have in the development of children pro--chill--chill--children's programming?
Speaker 2: It really didn't have any development.  It was inspired by the toys, and as we went back and did the research, we went back to the books, the original source.  So the toys--the toys benefitted because then everybody wanted to, to license it.  That was the beginning when the toy industry was really startin' to license properties, when they'd pay the company that had the rights in the United States a certain amount of money to put the Smurfs on their lunchbox, to put their shirts--the name--the Smurfs on their t-shirts.  It was licensing, but they didn't have anything to do with the creative direction.  We knew who they were, but nothing to do with the creative direction at all.
Speaker 1: Now things change these days 'cause I think it, it appears sometimes in recent years that the toy is leading the show in some way.
Speaker 2: Well, the act--FCC [Federal Communications Commission] actually has laws about that.  And it's a fine line, but people do understand the importance of the toys supporting the creative efforts, if you will, and they two go hand in hand now.  But you can't just put on something that is jus--it has to have a story and character.  The stories have to stand on their own.  It can't just be about the toy.
Story_ID: 155873
Speaker 1: The 'Smurfs' had a lot of success in, in ways that--I think we, we were discussing before we started the interview the old--you know, the wo--the Warner Bros. cartoons being used a lot in the--you know, with the Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck being smashed and thrown off of cliffs, you know, and all that sort of thing.  Is that--so the, the idea of creating the 'Smurfs' was the--to minimize that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Well, the idea--first of all, the old Warner Bros. cartoons, the ones ca--con--by Friz Freleng like 'The Pink Panther,' even the Hanna-Barbera cartoons, those were really created for adults.  The idea of creating original product for children, 'Smurfs' was a part of that, which is we were actually creating the programs for kids.  I mean, 'Rough and Ready' was probably created for kids, but the early stuff was really created for adults, and it was repurposed for children's programming because of its animation nature.  And then they begin to find out that children were imitating things that they were seeing on television, and some of those things were dangerous.  I mean, if you remember the '50s [1950s] back to 'Superman,' kids were jumping off the roof 'cause they were trying to fly; things like that.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah they were several stories about that.  Even going into the '90s [1990s], I know of kids who put--wrap a towel around his ankle and jumping off the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --garage or something.  Yeah, so, so, so what were some of the I guess guiding principles of a show like 'Smurfs?'  You know, what would--I mean, what were you--did, did, did you have a set of rules of what the Smurfs could do or not do, or how they were gonna inter--interact and, and solve a problem in a given episode?
Speaker 2: We probably did (laughter).  Not real rules, but a character would--could act out of character.  So if a--but see, before it came to us at the network, the story editors know how a character--based on the development we do and the way they develop the character, they know how the characters are supposed to act.  So we wouldn't see anything--you know, we'd say oh, that--we would say occasionally, "Oh, that's out of character; that character wouldn't do that."  So there are bibles established to establish who the character is, and the kinds of things that they do, and the sound of their voice.  And that's all part of the development process.
Speaker 1: And that's what you call that kind of a template or the, the bible.
Speaker 2: It's a bible.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's based on the bible, and there's time spent developing each character, developing the concept, and then you write to that.  I mean, even today all of the shows are like that.  All of the shows are developed and, and have bibles of how they would act and what they would do.
Speaker 1: I think I--just as a viewer, I think sometimes it feels like the writing has changed in the series over a number of years.  It just feels--the whole show kind of feels different for some--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, that happens.  I actually had--it happens.  Because what happens is the people involved--the characters are evolving, and sometimes--you know, if it--if something stays the same, you'll eventually lose the audience.  You'll get tired of seeing the same thing over and over again, so they have to--if a series is gonna stay on the air a long period of time, there has to be a driving force and something that attracts the audience and brings it back every week.  And you can see that in the decline of the ratings.  You can see how writers shake up a show, if you will, and take it in a different direction.  And sometimes it's good, but sometimes it's not bad--not good.  And when it's not good then the show doesn't work.  It--you know, it's too far off concept.
Story_ID: 155874
Speaker 1: So in 1982, you were promoted to vice president of both children's and family programs and project--and Project Peacock at NBC [National Broadcasting Company].  Now what's Project Peacock?
Speaker 2: Project Peacock was a series of primetime specials that we did for family programming.  We did a few projects with Jim Henson, 'Big Bird Goes to China.'  Big Bird went to China.  We did something--a series of--called 'The Storyteller' with Jim Henson where he went to London [England] and filmed in a studio with a--one of his puppet characters as a storyteller.  It was a mixture of live action and puppets where the dog talked.  He's called 'The Storytellers' and he would tell stories.  So it was varied, huge family productions, and the idea was that the whole family would sit down and watch these together.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, you were also involved in--you supervised the creation of 'Alvin and the Chipmunks,' right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was one of my--that was my baby.
Speaker 1: Okay, so well explain why (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' as a kid was a huge success in terms of the record, which came out what, in the '50s [1950s]?  And there were a couple of specials.  And when Ross and Janice Bagdasarian [sic, Ross Bagdasarian, Jr. and Janice Karman] came to my office, they had been to a number of different places and people weren't interested.  They thought it was old-fashioned, but I loved it from the very beginning.  And as with many of my projects--you know, by then I think I had two children.  And they had released a record just before they came into my office.  It was like a re-release of the Christmas song or something like that.  So I happened to mention it to my son, who was probably about thirteen or fourteen years old at the time.  He said, "Oh yeah, everybody's talking about the Chipmunk song."  So when you hear that kind of confirmation, that's when you know you're on to something.  And I really had to fight for it to get on the air, because people really believed that it was old-fashioned and they didn't want it on the air.  And at that time, I was working with Brandon Tartikoff, and he was more interested in--you know, 'The A-Team' was a big hit in primetime, so he wanted to do a show with Mr. T on Saturday morning.  So the compromise was he put on 'Mister T,' but I got to put on 'Alvin and the Chipmunks.'  And initially, 'Mister T' was the big hit 'cause it, you know, came off of primetime in the audience.  But in the long run, 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' is the one that lasted because it had cartoon characters; the creative team of Ross and Janice Bagdasarian; I put together with Ruby-Spears [Productions, Inc.], the production company who I knew could produce it and get it delivered; and they were brilliant in terms of understanding their characters and what they could do.  And as you can see, the franchise now is--even now a big hit in terms of feature films, so that was my baby.  I considered myself like the godmother of the Chipmunks.
Story_ID: 155875
Speaker 1: All right the godmother of 'the Chipmunks' ['Alvin and the Chipmunks].
Speaker 2: When the--they released the first feature, Steve Waterman was the agent who I had working with them and I guess he was involved when they sold the first feature.  So I sent him an email.  I was living in South Africa.  I sent him an email.  I said, "Oh, congratulations on the hit."  You know, the Chipmunks is this big hit now.  He said, "Phyllis, if it weren't for you, it would have never gotten on the air; we wouldn't be here now."  So some people still remember the role I played for, you know, 'the Chipmunks'--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --being the inception of where they are now.
Story_ID: 155876
Speaker 1: Now what about 'Saved by the Bell?'  Now this is a live action show.  And, and before we talk, talk about it, maybe you can tell us a little bit about the, the I guess the, the factors that be weighed in determining whether a show--you gonna go with a cartoon or a live action show in those days.
Speaker 2: 'Saved by the Bell' is an interesting story.  And 'Saved by the Bell' was originally a show called 'Good Morning Ms. Bliss,' and it was a property that was owned by Disney.  And I guess I, Michael Eisner and Brandon Tartikoff, who was president of NBC [National Broadcasting Company], talked about this series, 'Good Morning Ms. Bliss,' starring Hayley Mills--if you remember her from the original 'Parent Trap'--was going to be the teacher.  I actually flew down to Disney World [Orlando, Florida], to the MGM Studio [Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios] on the Disney--at the Disney Studio--to look at the studio because the show was gonna be produced on that lot.  In fact, the first thirteen shows were produced on that lot.  And after Disney produced the first thirteen episodes, I don't remember exactly what happened on their side, whether it was Hayley Mills decided she didn't wanna do it, but Disney decided not to go forward.  So Brandon [Tartikoff] called me into a meeting and said, "Phyllis, you know, Disney doesn't wanna do this show.  And he said, do you wanna do it?"  And I said, "Yeah, I think we should do it; I think it's a good idea."  So we bought the rights from Disney, and it became--Brandon named it-'Saved by the Bell.'  And we produced it as an NBC Productions, because at that time, networks had started production companies.  And the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] laws had changed and could now own some of the product.  Whereas, before they couldn't own any of the product.  So it was one of the first NBC series in-house.  And we developed it and made changes, brought in--Hayley Mills dropped out.  We kept most of the original cast of characters.  I wanted a more--a Latino character, so we cast Mario--was his name Lopez--Mario Lopez--not Mario Lopez--was it Mario Lopez?--Mario Lopez as the kid, who was kind of a weightlifter kind of character, and the principal.  And the other thing I wanted was--to me 'Saved by the Bell' was an opportunity to be--to speak to the audience and speak to the kids in the same way 'The Cosby Show' did, that I wanted each show to have some morality lesson.  And when you think about that, it's like, whose morals are they?  Writers write from their own experience, so I wanted my [HM Dr.] Alvin Poussaint, if you will, who was the consultant on 'The Cosby Show.'  And that person became [HM] Dr. Karen Hill-Scott, who was a friend of mine who I'd brought into the industry to work as a consultant.  So Karen Scott from the very beginning read every script, and in terms of morality lesson and direction of the stories, she talked to the writers and gave them options of some of the things that could happen with the kids.  And they, from that information, wrote the scripts.  And Karen, I'm pretty sure, looked at every single episode the entire time the seven or eight years that the series was on the air.  But I attribute that to a lot of the success, in that the audience could really identify with these kids.  I mean, there were things at the very beginning like my morality, right?  Where Zack crawls into the bedroom window upstairs and they're sitting on the bed.  My way I grew up, you couldn't have a boy in your bedroom.  The producer, they didn't have a problem with that.  I said, "Well, in an African American home this is a problem, to be entertaining a boy in your bedroom, that can't happen."  So I had to compromise on some of those things, and Karen helped me with those compromises.  But it was those kinds of things, where my culture and the way I was brought up versus, you know, they wanted something a little more broader and peel--appeal.  And I said, "Well, that couldn't happen in my community--"little things like that.  That's the one of the ones I remember.
Speaker 1: That, that, that is something that wouldn't happen in--I mean, it's white mid--middle class and black middle class and the difference between a historical black college and a white college, in terms of what you can do on campus--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --those are--there's a difference.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so those are some of the early struggles that we had with things like that 'cause I was just really uncomfortable.  I said, "We're broadcasting to America.  How can we have this boy climbing into this girl's bedroom?"  And based on the way I was brought up, you know, you couldn't have a boy in your room.  In fact, I have a daughter who's now staying with my mother [Vivian Scott Middleton].  That's a problem.  She can't do that my--'cause my mother is ninety-three years old, and you don't entertain boys in your rooms, even though she knows she's a twenty-five year old woman.  You cannot do that.

Speaker 1: Now, did you have anything to do with the development of 'Cosby' ['The Cosby Show'] at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So that was already rolling when you--
Speaker 2: That was already rolling.  Bill Cosby and I did work on developing a children's series that I actually went over to NBC Productions to produce.  It was called 'The Little People.'  But then the person who came in and replaced me decided not to go forward with that series.  So that was the extent of our--we worked together for about, say, four or five months, had various meetings to work on the development of this project.
Story_ID: 155878
Speaker 1: Okay, but 'Saved by the Bell' now that was a popular TV series.  I think it's still being syndicated and run--
Speaker 2: It's still--
Speaker 1: --even now.
Speaker 2: --and it's syndicated all over the world.  I actually, when I moved to South Africa, came up with the idea of doing a 'Saved by the Bell' kind of show for South Africa.  And I was working with a group of South African actresses who wanted to be involved in developing this show, and they knew all the characters.  They were doing imitating of Screech, and it blew my mind that a show that I conceived of so many years ago, I could actually see how it touched teenagers around the world.  And that's--that, that is still mind blowing, the fact that what I considered 'cause--because I was a child development major, and I wanted to be a teacher, I considered the six million, seven million children who were watching Saturday morning--I considered it like my classroom and my opportunity to teach and learn and have, you know, positive role models and things like that, and I considered, at that time, the six, seven million children in the United States.  Well, this was material that went worldwide, so those lessons and the stories that we told really touched children all over the world.  And that was very satisfying and mind blowing at the same time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I--just sitting here talking to you and knowing that the decisions you made reached so many people is staggering to, to think of, you know.  And to think that you--you know, that what you decided to do one way or another would--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But you don't think about it when you're doing it.  I think people now understand that they're programming more for the world 'cause it's more about syndicating all over the world.  But I'm, I'm actually really proud of it.  I'm proud of the work that I did.  I, I really felt as if I was, you know, setting a path for our community and holding up the community, and it was really important for me to do my job well and--
Story_ID: 155879
Speaker 1: I was really proud to have Winifred White [HM Winifred Neisser] on my team.  And I also had hired--had a quite a few--not quite a few--a number of African American interns from Howard University [Washington, D.C.] who worked for me, people that I brought into the industry at a time when there weren't a lot of us.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you actually, you know, brought these--brought pe--people from Howard?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Because I, I know you, you, you would have had to been the one (laughter) to think of it, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, there were the three of us.  These later years, [HM] Hamilton Cloud [II] was a program executive at NBC [National Broadcasting Company] by that time, but--and, and, and I'll tell you honestly, I heard things that--nobody ever said anything directly, but I do know that, for example, my director of children's programming, you know, he had shared with me years later--your sitting around having a glass of wine--how people challenged him on working for an African American woman.  You know, he didn't share that with me then.  I was his boss, but he said, you know, people challenged him.  Or Deidre Dix [Hunt], who was my intern who had gone to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], said, "You know, why do you have all this black experience?  You know, why'd you go to a black university [HBCU]?  Why did you work for a black woman in the (unclear)--you know, industry?"  So there was that stuff, but it wasn't in your face.  You know, people were polite.
Story_ID: 155880
Speaker 1: Now you hosted--I don't know what, what time period.  The date isn't here, but you put together a conference of African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, women, the physically disabled people to discuss program content.  Is this--well, what was the name of this?
Speaker 2: It didn't have a name really.  It started out as a meeting that we organized with the research department from NBC [National Broadcasting Company], and we brought in consultants from those various communities, and had a meeting actually at the Universal Sheraton.  Be--the rea--the impetus for the meeting was this: All the writers, you know, the Joe Bar--Joe Barbera, Friz Freleng, and the writers at the studio who were trying to create these content, did not have any--much exper--it's mostly men, no women at that time, and no people of color, and there was no diversity.  So you're trying to get them to be more diverse and more open to having African-American characters, to having Latino characters, to dealing with let--you know, disabled stories.  So what we decided--what I decided to do was--and I talked to our research department about organizing a meeting and having someone come in.  Karen [HM Hill-Scott] from the African American community, Dr. Scott [ph.] from Latin American community, a woman from UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], Asian--some--a Chinese--either--it was Asian.  I can't remember what community it was from, but we met and talked about what it was like to come from all these diverse communities as a group--as a research group first.  The information was so enlightening, we decided to share it with the creative community.  And I will never forget we, we had a bigger meeting where we invited the studios in, the writers, everybody that we knew.  It was probably fifty, one hundred people.  It was so successful, we ended up doing it in New York [New York] as well and talked about what it was like being a person of color and how you wanted to see yourself on television.  And one of the statistics that came out was--and this probably was in, say, '81 [1981], '82 [1982]--that in twenty years, the population in Los Angeles [California] would be--I don't know--forty percent Latino.  And there was a gasp in the room; it was like (gasp sound) (laughter), and it's here.  You know, it was like--because people were looking at numbers and making projections--they saying things like the white community is on--only having 1.2--these numbers are not accurate--1.2 children; the African-American family is having 2.5 children; you know, the Latino community is having 4.5.  Well, they thought based on those numbers, they were gonna grow in population.  So it was--and we were saying that to say how important it was to embrace these other cultures and portray them on television.  Because I would give writers notes to say why don't we make this character--I'll never forget, a writer on 'Spiderman.' There was a manager of a upscale hotel in a 'Spiderman' cartoon.  And I said, "Why don't we make this role African American?"  And he said, "That would never happen, have an African American manager of an upscale hotel."  And from his experience, that's what his experience was.  And just tying it to my own life, I remember going and staying at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Buckhead in Los An--in Atlanta [Georgia] thinking--and there was an African American manager.  I'm like see (laughter), but it wasn't his experience.  So that's what we were up against.  It's like, the writers who were actually writing material could not even imagine having people of color in other roles.  And in their mind it was just a block.  So it was educating that community.  We educated that community and the larger community, and then we did it in New York.  And as a result of what we did and understanding that people of color wanted to see themselves on television--and at that time, NBC was number three--Brandon Tartikoff took that information, and as a result, in 'Miami Vice,' cast--what was the African American brother's name [sic, Philip Michael Thomas] who was in--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know Don Johnson and the other was--God, what was--
Speaker 2: Mario Van Peebles?  Was it--
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't Mario.  It was--yeah, this is tel--I hope he doesn't see this.
Speaker 2: Well, we'll stop--
Speaker 1: We can't think of his name.
Speaker 2: --right and we'll go back and--
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: --say that, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but--
Speaker 2: --as a result of that information, he put him in that role to attract our community, and more people beginning to understand the importance of that.  All right God, what is his name?
Speaker 1: Let's not dwell on that--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll, we'll, we'll get to that.
Speaker 2: But anyway--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --we'll go--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Anyway--and we'll go back and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --they can edit it--but anyway, yeah.  But as a result of that information, they be--NBC began to thoughtfully consider populating their television shows with people of color.  So not only did it affect children's programming, but it affected other areas as well.
Story_ID: 155881
Speaker 1: Oh here's a, there's, there's a story here about this series where a character is named after your daughter, 'The New Archies,' right?
Speaker 2: 'The New Archies'--I mean--
Speaker 1: Is that, that--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Is this true?
Speaker 2: 'Power Rangers?'
Speaker 1: Is it 'Power Rangers' then where, where a character is named after your daughter Amani, is it?
Speaker 2: Gosh I don't remember that story.
Speaker 1: Yeah (unclear).
Speaker 2: Was it?  Really?  I guess so.  I don't remember--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what it--
Speaker 2: --the story.
Speaker 1: Oh, this was--says that--
Speaker 2: It probably was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in one of the articles that they read.  I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are characters in the new--
Speaker 2: Yes, you're right--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --for 'Archies' episode.  The African American girl's name was Amani.  You're right, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is a name that I would guess that most white people wouldn't think of because there--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They wouldn't think of a--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of a black child--
Speaker 2: Actually, there--
Speaker 1: --in Africa.
Speaker 2: --have been several characters that were named after--Amani in the 'Archies,' my son--we did a series of the Smurfs traveling around the world.  And we did a story on Africa, and there was a little African boy.  He was named Bakari after my son.  And then Aisha, the--one of the first black Power Ranger was named Aisha after Aisha.  So when people don't have those cultural experiences, they don't know what to answer their--you know, name their children so you use names that are familiar.
Story_ID: 155882
Speaker 1: Now there's also--is there a story around something called 'The Black Snowman?'
Speaker 2: Oh, Phil Mendez.  There is a book and it's produced by Scholastic Productions.  This very talented artist.  His name is--he's so creative.  He actually worked for Disney.  He's this fabulous artist--had written a book called 'The Black Snowman' [Phil Mendez].  And it's a story about a boy who creates a snowman with dirty snow--with snow that's like been sitting in its dirt, and it becomes the black snowman.  So we did it as a special.
Speaker 1: Okay, the story, story has a message about self-esteem.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You know.  Okay, this is the age of--were going to the late '80s [1980s], the edge of--age of the Cabbage Patch Dolls and--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's another story, Cabbage Patch Dolls.  Roger Schlaifer introduced the Cabbage Patch Dolls to me and the entire children's creative community.  He sent a doll to every studio-Filmation [Associates], Hanna-Barbera [Productions], Ruby-Spears [Productions, Inc.], NBC [National Broadcasting Company], ABC [American Broadcasting Company], CBS [Columbia Broadcast Systems]--and I loved the doll, because I'm a doll person.  I loved the doll, so I set up a meeting and had a meeting with him.  He came into my office with a tape--with this baby in a basket and a tape recording of the--of a doll crying.  And he brings it out and this beautiful baby, and I absolutely fell in love with it.  And at that time, NBC Production was, was interested in owning properties.  You know, we wanna own and license our own properties.  So I tried to get NBC to fly me down to Cleveland, Georgia, because part of the creative process is going and experiencing the experience.  But they run a tight budget, and I couldn't--and I couldn't go that--so I had to wait until the next quarter, which was August.  Hanna-Barbera also had been sent a doll, didn't see what I saw in it, but they decide--we do--got together and said if we're going forward with this, they were gonna be the production company that was gonna do it.  So Margaret Loesch sent Sidney Iwanta [ph.] with me, Amani [Pettis], my daughter--'cause I always took my children with me.  Amani was ten months old.  We get on a red-eye, got to New York--got to wok--got to Atlanta [Georgia]--excuse me--fly to Atlanta.  And we get off the plane and there's a little girl with a Cabbage Patch Doll.  So that's like--okay.  Now this is--nobody knew about these dolls.  This doll came from Cleveland, Georgia.  The creator had created (unclear)--bought an old pediatrician's office and created what he called a cabbage patch and set up this whole world.  It was a--are you familiar with the American Girl concept?  But it was like that for the Cabbage Patch girls.  So they sent a car--I went to my hotel; we showered; changed; they sent a limo to pick me up, me and Sidney; we get off--we--Sidney said to me, "Phyllis, I don't know what we're doing here in Georgia."  I said, "Sidney, just--I just have a really strong instinct about this doll."  I think it's--in fact, I sent an in, in--a memo to NBC to say this is going to be bigger than Strawberry Shortcake.  This is gonna be huge.  I couldn't get anybody to believe me--went--met--by then Calico was involved.  NBC could no longer have the same role, but I wanted to do the television show.  And I tried to convince Brandon, and I tried to convince Grant Tinker that this was gonna be a huge success.  And over about a year period while they developing the doll, and then it came out for Christmas and was a huge hit.  And Brandon Tartikoff wrote it in his book, "The Last Great Ride."  He wrote a book about his 10 mistakes that he made, and that was one of them, that, you know, we could have owned Cabbage Kids.  But I couldn't convince anybody that it was a great idea.  And, as you know, the rest is history.
Speaker 1: Right, and big, big--
Speaker 2: Huge merchandising--
Speaker 1: --sensational--
Speaker 2: --success.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But it was--I was all a part--it's another one of those godmother--godmother things for me.  Because I remember going to [American International] Toy Fair, coming back to my hotel--I used to stay at the Park Meridian [Le Parker Meridien New York, New York City, New York]--and I had one of the dolls with me.  And I remember two women stopping me in the lobby of the hotel.  "Where did you get that doll?  I'd like to get that doll for my dau--" and that was before they were--they came out.  So as you know, toys are--you know, the February Toy Fair don't come out until the following Christmas, so to me it was just gonna be huge hit.  And it was--it was big.
Story_ID: 155883
Speaker 1: When my husband moved out to Los Angeles [California]--well, when Eugene Jackson moved out to Los Angeles, he was from radio.  And he thought that there should be a African American network that was different than BET [Black Enterprise Television].
Speaker 2: Now were you all married at this point?
Speaker 1: No, we're not--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --married then.
Speaker 2: All right, all right.
Speaker 1: That should address more of the interest of the African American community--a little more balance.  At that point, BET had a lot of music videos, so we wanted to--the concept of the World African Network was to develop a library of movies, and films, and documentaries, and sporting events that were older archived material that we would put together on a network that our, our community would watch.  And we basically looked at material from all over the world to acquire it to put on this twenty-four hour network.  And Gene [Eugene Jackson] invested his own money, and we were not able to get on the air, 'cause we were kind of caught in the fact that the cable operators said well, there's already one black channel.  Number one, they didn't understand that that wasn't meeting all of our needs, that it was basically music videos.  In fact, TV One now is closer to what our model is--was then.  If anything, we were a little bit ahead of our time, because cable at that time was--I don't know what the technical term was but we were getting ready to switch to digital, so there were gonna be a lot more capacity.  And they asked--actually, consultants suggested that my husband wait, and he didn't wanna wait.  In hindsight, we probably should have waited.  We, if anything, we were a little bit ahead of our time.  But we couldn't get enough cable operators to buy into the concept that there could be more than one African American channel.  And that's--we didn't get on the air.  And the partners were [HM] Clarence Avant, [HM] Dick Gregory was involved, Eugene Jackson, my--and myself--and also Percy Sutton out of New York [City, New York].
Speaker 2: Right, right, so--and--yeah, Sidney Small, was he--
Speaker 1: And Sidney [L.] Small, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Who was his part--who was Eugene's partner in World African--in National Black Network.
Speaker 2: Okay, so the kind of pro--programming you were gonna do--now this is always a--you know, videos, you know, all black folks--or a lot black people were watching videos.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they were cheap to produ--to put on the air 'cause they're already made--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --by the record companies and here they were.  So your programming was gonna be content that already existed you say--
Speaker 1: That already existed.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was all acquisition, 'cause that's a lot of money.  It's a lot of money to--we weren't producing any new product--maybe some wraparounds and things like that.  But it was from all over the world, though.  We--when--I remember one of the most memorable specials that I ever saw was produced out of I think it was Russia or Germany, which was a profile of Curtis Mayfield that was moving.  Somebody who really enjoyed his music did a documentary on him that I think if people watched, they'd have really loved it.  And there were movies from Africa, from the whole Diaspora.  We were gonna bring these all together.  And then based on the success--because it was gonna be a pay network, pushing--moving it forward--then we were gonna begin to produce original product.
Story_ID: 155884
Speaker 1: So it'd be like a premium channel or, or--
Speaker 2: A premium channel, wasn't a basic channel.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: It was gonna be a premium channel--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to get it started.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.
Speaker 2: But our pockets weren't deep enough.
Speaker 1: Okay and tell me would it be like a pay per view channel or, or, or, or, or--
Speaker 2: No, it was like--
Speaker 1: --a premium--
Speaker 2: --a monthly--a premium--
Speaker 1: Like a HB[O] [Home Box Office]--
Speaker 2: --a monthly--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A monthly, say, a $4.95 or what it costs at that time to put it on.  And I think what happened was we became too ambitious.  We actually started at the same time E! TV [E! Entertainment Television] started, so it was like 1990, '90 [1990], '91 [1991], something like that.  And we probably should have started small.  Instead of twenty-four hours, we probably should have started, say, a four-hour block and just repeated it four times.  But coming out of programming, you didn't really understand that that would really work, so it kept kind of getting larger and larger and requiring more programming.  And we stayed in development too long and really didn't get it launched.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, it sounds like a great idea.
Speaker 2: We ran out of money.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay, but it sounds like a wonderful idea.  You know, I--and what were--okay.  See, you gave us some examples, but, but what's surprising to me is, is the, the amount of material about Africans and African Americans and black people in the Caribbean that's available worldwide.  Anyway, it's a lot of material.
Speaker 2: It's a lot of material, and that was the idea of the concept.  That was the concept to put that material on so people could watch it.  And I think at that time, if anything, we were early.  I think people would be more open to watching it now.  Television has really changed.  That was coming right off a time where people were accustomed to original product produced for television.  They really weren't used to o--like, the History Channel hadn't even started at that point where people were looking at old product that had been produced previously and put together in a different context.  It was bright--really a brand new concept.  And we really couldn't get around the program managers, even the program managers who were buying for the individual networks.  That's really what we couldn't get around, the fact that they couldn't believe that the number of subscribers out there could support two African American channels.  That was our biggest hurdle.
Story_ID: 155885
Speaker 1: All right, now so you, you left NBC [National Broadcasting Company] in '91 [1991] then?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay and--
Speaker 2: Actually, I went--I left NBC to go over to NBC Productions to do the show with Bill Cosby and be a producer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And after that show didn't go off the ground--
Speaker 1: That's the children's pro--show?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was called 'Little People,' which stayed in development about six months, and then my replacement decided he didn't wanna go forward with the show.  Then I worked with Jheryl Busby over at Motown to do a show--a variety show with--I almost said the name of the group--the music group--Men in Black [sic, Boyz II Men] --not Men in Black--something men.  What's the name of that group?
Speaker 1: Boyz II Men.
Speaker 2: Boyz II Men.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Thank you--God, the memory, right.  I worked with Jheryl Busby at Mo--Motown to develop a special with Boyz II Men and several other Motown properties and then some movies.  And then my husband [Eugene Jackson] asked me to get more involved in World African Network and the launch of that network, so I left NBC Productions and we started out--I started working with him on working on World African Network.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so was it--did you have any regrets about leaving the position at NBC or was it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I probably did.  I wish I--I probably wish I'd have stayed a little bit longer.  Because NBC Productions, it was hard to get on the kinds of shows I was interested in.  I remember being told once that my development slate was too black 'cause I had too many black properties on my development slate.  But then, you know, the African American community came to me.  And they were ideas at NBC that I liked, that I thought had value, but they weren't perceived as having value for the general audience, if you will.  So I was told at one point my production slate was too black when I was in NBC Productions.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is something that I know black people here and different, you know, when the (unclear) that what you do is too black.  I've heard say that.
Speaker 2: So you've heard that before?
Speaker 1: Yeah, people have heard it and I've heard it before in all different, you know, aspects of, you know, the pro--professional (unclear).  And told at some point what they're doing is too black or they're bringing in too many black people--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or too many black employees or something.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So that means, you know, the--I'll call it paranoia--the paranoia we feel has been reinforced some place in our life, you know, where you--all of a sudden your company becomes like too black.  And it's perceived as less than in some cases, unless you're like a Tyler Perry who can--you know, has the money and the--that he can do what he wants to do.  But if you work in this mainstream, and they look at you, and they, you know, say.  It's the underlying--I mean, I was told directly my, my development slate was too black.
Speaker 1: And this was--this was--this wasn't an assessment based on the success of the product, but it's the fact that it's too black.
Speaker 2: Yes, and as a result, it didn't get on.  I mean, the Motown special didn't get on.  I, I think they did one of the specials.  I think they did the Boyz II Men after I left, but it just was perceived that there wasn't an audience for it.

Speaker 1: After your activities with the World African Network, now you--the next thing I have is that you produced a show called 'Scout Safari in South Africa' ['Scout's Safari']. Is that--
Speaker 2: Actually before that.  As a part--one of the things that the World African Network did was we did a show called 'Miss Collegiate African American Pageant.'  That's probably not on there.  The 'Miss Collegiate African American Pageant' was a beauty contest, not really a mes--but a contest where we bought--brought the queens from the historically black colleges together for an overall competition.  It was a show that we financed--or my husband [Eugene Jackson] financed--and from--and it was a very rewarding experience.  Many of the girls had not traveled before.  Many of the girls had not flown before or been very far away from home, though--even though they were at historically black colleges.  I guess their families would drive them to college.  And they'd come and stay for a week, and we'd organize a competition.  And they'd perform in questions and performance, and we hired a--someone to help them with their--create presentations, their dance or whatever their--poetry.  You know, we heard--we hurt my--a lot of [HM] Maya Angelou.  It was a very, very inspirational experience to bring these girls.  And we'd usually have thirty, forty queens from the historically black colleges.  The first show that we televised Ms. Spelman [College] was the queen.  And then they'd get a trip to Africa, which my husband financed and the sponsor financed, where they'd get to go to Africa.  And a whole contingent of them would go to Africa and have their experience in Africa.  And it had a very African, African American overtone.  The robe was African, the crown was African.  And then after we did--we did it out here in Hollywood [California] for a couple of years, and then we did it at Disney World [sic, Disneyland, Anaheim, California] for about three years, where [HM] Hamilton Cloud [II] and Dick Bullet produced it for us at Disney World.  And while we were down there, we did another show called 'Stomp,' which was a step show, where we had step teams come in and produce--and produce their own step sequence--step routines, and choose a winner.  So those are the two shows that we did.  My children got to benefit, 'cause we'd spend weeks at Disney World [Orlando, Florida](laughter).  It was home for about three weeks, but it was--you know, it was a--it was a good experience.  And these things that were self-financed that were sold into syndication probably didn't make much money on them.  And [HM] Comer [Joseph] Cottrell was a big sponsor.
Speaker 1: Right, of Pro-Line [Corporation].
Speaker 2: Pro-Line--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --was a big sponsor.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I remember--now I'm, I'm starting to--you know, I'm gettin' old too, and I'm, I'm starting to remember some of this now.  You know, I do, do remember seeing 'Stomp' especially.  And the pageant, I, I probably saw it too, you know.  But, you know, (unclear) somebody looks for that kind of thing on television, you know.  But that's--so the, the trip to Africa they won, would they go to South Africa?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't go to South Africa.  They went to Ghana and they went to Senegal, more west Africa.  There was a--an African arts festival that they participated in.
Story_ID: 155887
Speaker 1: My sister actually, Dorothy Middleton Taylor, was the writer on the show ['Miss Collegiate African American Pageant'], and I remember she went on one of the trips with them.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, does she work in television regularly or?
Speaker 1: She did.  She worked in children's programming.  She was a writer in children's programming thanks to--no, she was--actually one of the first African American women, if not the first African American woman, to write in television.  I didn't know anybody else, and I knew she was a writer so.  She worked for Ruby-Spears [Productions].
Story_ID: 155888
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your association with South Africa.  This starts around this time in early 2000 or so.
Speaker 2: We first traveled to South Africa in 1992.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My husband, Eugene Jackson, was a--owned radio stations and a company called the National Black Network, which was a radio network--news network.  And I, with my programming experience, was asked to come over and work with a group who were interested in getting the license to start a television network in South Africa.  And this was the--right after Nelson Mandela had been freed from jail, and the company--and the country was beginning to open up.  We were invited over, and we traveled over there 1992 to meet the group and begin to conceive and come up with the idea of a television show and put together a bid for the television network.  And we did not win the bid.  A company won it, and it became what is very now a prominent station over there called e.tv.  Because before that it was only South African broadcasting stations one, two, and three, so this was gonna be the fourth television network over there.  But it was our entree into South Africa.  Before going to South Africa, we were talking about--thinking about going to Zimbabwe, so we, we had traveled to Zimbabwe first and were interested in settling in Zimbabwe.  Because at that point, because of apartheid, we weren't going into South Africa.  So, say, in '89 [1989], we traveled to Zimbabwe and were--and bought--land in Zimbabwe actually and were gonna live there.  And then when South--the South African opportunity came a few years later--in fact, Dali Tambo, Oliver Tambo's son, came to our house and met with my husband [Eugene Jackson] to encourage us to come to South Africa.  You know, 'cause at that point, the Anti-Apartheid Movement was going on--TransAfrica--we'd been to several dinners.  Our interests in South Africa and the end of apartheid was growing.  Winnie Mandela was traveling here encouraging people to support anti-apartheid and the sanctions against South Africa.  And so the seeds for that, what happened in '92 [1992], were already growing from the late '80s [1980s] through the early '90s [1990s] for us to begin to really think about that actively.  And I'm a--
Speaker 1: And [HM Ronald] Ron Dellum's in Congress?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Ron Dellum was in Congress.  I remember going to Washington [D.C.] and demonstrating in front of the South African embassy.  And at that time, I couldn't even imagine living in South Africa.  I mean, we're talking late, late '80s [1980s]; that wasn't even an idea.  Although I must say, even in my early career, for some reason I always saw that my television experience--I was open to sharing my experience in Africa.  I really thought more of west Africa at that time.  One of the unit managers at KNBC was from maybe kit--from west Africa.  Maybe he was from Ghana or Nigeria.  I can't remember exactly where.  But in my mind, I remember having an image of doing some work in South Africa in the entertainment industry.
Story_ID: 155889
Speaker 1: Is there any link between American television and Nollywood now, the big--big film industry in Nigeria, and, and Gollywood in Ghana?
Speaker 2: I don't--I don't--I don't know of any.  I'm not the per--I, I, I know of none.  I know when I was living in South Africa, the Nigerian soap operas--dramas--were really big there.  And there was a channel that was airing them, and they were growing.  And the stories were actually relatable.  There was that family drama, and it really caught on and translated.  And I actually think it would translate here.  I really do.  It was interesting.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know people that watch it all the time here.  They, they watch 'em on the Internet.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: And, and--
Speaker 2: See, I ain't--
Speaker 1: --get the DVDs.
Speaker 2: --even thought about looking for them here--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --on the Internet, but I--they were at a big following there.
Speaker 1: Well, this is--Nigeria is now the second largest film producer behind India in the world.  So I just--I just--
Speaker 2: And see--and then--
Speaker 1: --wondered if there as any connection.
Speaker 2: --and if--then if you think about it, that was the whole basis of the World African Network; that culturally these stories rang true; that even, even news, which was one aspect that we thought we'd focus on, even though it wasn't current news, we caught--we had this little thing we called 'News To Me.'  Because it was news to us, it was new news; so, it was news but wasn't current news, but it was news.  And we just thought our, our community--and I just think World African Network, that was an idea that was ahead of its time; and we just didn't have the pockets to sustain it.
Story_ID: 155890
Speaker 1: So Nelson Mandela is out of jail; the South African--I mean, he's president of South Africa in the mid '90s [1990s], elect-- elected in '95 [1995] [sic, 1994]--
Speaker 2: Well, I need to--I--our story--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --leading up to that is--going back a little bit, we decided--in fact, we were already--I was already thinking about moving to Zimbabwe when South Africa opened up and we went over.  My husband [Eugene Jackson] and I went over for the meeting, and we stayed--this had to be, gosh, maybe '90 [1990], '91 [1991].  We went for about ten days.  And he was like staying and staying, he was loving it so much.  And I'm like I've got to go home; I've got kids at home. You know, I've gotta go home, so I left him there and came back.  And I get calls from him days later.  He says--and I remember it was October.  He's like, I wanna come back for Christmas.  I'm like, what?  I can't come back for Christmas.  I said, "I have to be with my family."  He said, well, we'll bring everybody with me--with us.  We brought all the kids, we brought a nanny to help with the kids 'cause I had four kids at home then, we brought my parents [Vivian Scott Middleton and Philip Govan Middleton], and us, and we all came for Christmas.  And he wanted us to fall in love with South Africa, because he had this vision that the whole family: his parents, his brother, my sister [Dorothy Middleton Taylor], my brother [Myron Scott Middleton], everybody would move to South Africa and be a part of the building of South Africa.  So that was our first trip over.  We stayed for--the first Christmas was probably--I can't remember the years now--probably '91 [1991] or '92 [1992].  We stayed for three weeks, traveled the country, and came home.  And then he was going back and forth then.  He was there for the election.  And then the whole family, his parents, my parents, and the kids all went back.  And we had bought a home, and--fact, our--going back for a minute--our first trip there we started looking for houses.  Our first trip--when we came back, we went to Nelson Mandela's daughter's wedding.  That was one thing that was very interesting about being in South Africa and being American.  You had access to ministers and the president.  And we went to--we would go--we went to Oliver Tambo's home.  We went to Nelson Mandela's home.  You know, we had access.  They were there.  I mean, it was like spending time with these historical figures--you were in their kitchen (laughter) talking to their wives and their children socially.  It was quite an experience in those days.  So our first Christmas was probably in 1992.  We brought the whole family and toured the country and began, you know, showing the family homes of where we'd live and trying to get the parents to come.  And then we came back, and my husband was kind of going back and forth.  He was there for the election, and then he decided he wanted to come and be there for when Nelson Mandela was sworn in, so we all went back.  It was Mother's Day of--his parent--
Speaker 1: Was that '95 [1995] or, or--
Speaker 2: No, no, it was like--
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--
Speaker 2: --probably in '92 [1992], '93 [1993].  I don't think it was '95 [1995].
Speaker 1: Yeah, the election didn't take place until about--well, okay, well, I don't--
Speaker 2: We'll have to look (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But anyway, we were there.  It was--they were up on the mountain.  We were down among the masses, and went for the day.  Had--there was a party at the American Embassy in the evening, and [HM Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson was there, and Hillary Clinton was there, and all these people that came over at the American delegation.  I would bet [HM Ronald] Ron Dellums was probably there--were at the American Embassy.  My children were little.  They have little memory of all this, but--and so then--we--our home was established.  And we kind of had this come all--'cause Winnie Mandela, when she would come over, she was like, "Come back to Africa, we want you to come back, help us get started."  So that's kind of how our house was.  We had this house that was there with a full-time housekeeper and gardeners and things.  And people would stay at our home.  It was like the landing pad where people could come, stay, have a place to stay, and kind of get their feet.  And then branch out and see what contribution they could make to South Africa, as African Americans coming in with certain skills.  And my husband and I kinda both believe in that philosophy.  And we had several people come over and work for us and lived in the house until they got established and moved out into their own houses-- so a number of people.
Story_ID: 155891
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is all in the--in the '90s [1990s].  And, and you're working on--are you--are you working on the television--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --network?
Speaker 2: --the American part has had kinda like--we'd kind of run out of steam.  Going back again on our timeline.  We took a different direction.  And probably about--this is really going back a little--probably about--we moved to Atlanta [Georgia] in '98 [1998]--so about--no, we moved to Atlanta in '94 [1994]--so maybe about '96 [1996] when we realized that the network wasn't going forward.  The Internet was picking up so then my husband took an interest in the Internet.  And we started working on a company--well, it was called World African Network Online or something like that--an Internet company where we focused the direction and the concept of the network to an online version of it--of a place where you would come and find African American material.  And again, we were--we spent time--we decided that the African American colleges should be online, so we spent time going to the president of the colleges' meetings to convince them that the needed to give their students access to the Internet and create infrastructure for that.  So we did that for a few campuses later on--convinced a few of the presidents that we should do that.  Clark Atlanta [University, Atlanta, Georgia] was one of our first colleges.  So we had the online--creating infrastructures for the colleges; the online website, which we started email addresses.  But, again, we're early because, you know, we were late adopters, and a lot of us weren't online.  And our pockets were deep enough to keep going.  I remember the day we went to CNN [Cable News Network] to kinda look at their infrastructure, to see their foray into the Internet--CNN.com.  And we took this tour, and I'll never forget, it was the day of the Oklahoma [City] bombing [1995].  'Cause I remember me walking in somebody's office and it was on.  We're like, "where is this?"  It looked like a foreign country.  They're like, "that's Oklahoma."  And that's why I remember this day.  So we took a tour of their facility--their online--and they told us they had spent $100 million and they still had made any money.  And I told my husband [Eugene Jackson], I said, "we can't do this; we can't keep doing this."  You know, you can't keep spending that kind of money and not have any income.  We just couldn't do it, so we ended up--the online we kind of stopped or slowed down, at least my participation, and we started focusing on South Africa at that point--moving and transitioning to South Africa.  The company--there was a portion of the company that was still working on Internet and the--creating the infrastructures at the universities, but we had began to really focus on South Africa as a family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And (unclear) other people, you know, working on that part of the business.
Speaker 1: All right, so, so this is in the mid '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was probably, say, '96 [1996], '97 [1997], something like that.
Story_ID: 155892
Speaker 1: So, now what other African Americans--I know--was, was, was  [HM] Charlayne Hunter-Gault there at, at that point--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Charlayne was already there.  She was the bureau chief for CNN [Cable News Network].  I met her on that site.  My husband [Eugene Jackson] already knew her because of his New York [New York] connection (unclear).  I met her there.  I think her husband, [HM] Ron [Ronald T. Gault], was working at IBM at the time.  But, again, we were in and out of the country, so I'd go take the kids for the summer.  We'd go at Christmas time, but the kids were in school. I didn't go over there full time.  He--his first business there was a company called Afrotel, which was a cellular telephone company, which is how we started.  And as that business began to take off more, then we decided to make the transition to full time in South Africa.
Story_ID: 155893
Speaker 1: All right, we're in like 1997 or so?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-seven [1997], what I decided to do as a mother when we started doing this new Internet company [World African Network Online], I said, "I don't need to learn a new business (laughter).  I'm gonna be less involved in business and really start focusing on the children and our transition to South Africa."  So I really started getting more involved in their schools, because I thought, "I'm gonna go over there and I'm not gonna be working, so let me get some skills and--you know, and take some ideas and also spend some more time with my children to take that with me to South Africa."  'Cause at that point, I knew we were gonna eventually move to South Africa.  So the World African Network online was kind of going; I wasn't involved.  And I just became more involved as a PTA [Parent Teacher Association] mom and, you know, my kids involved in--we had moved to Atlanta [Georgia] by the way.  By then we were living in Atlanta.  And I just got more involved in what was going on with my children and pro--and started ramping up in preparation for moving to South Africa.  We moved to South Africa in April of 1998.  I wanted my children to be emerged in South African culture.  On the trips over there, we had looked at the American school, and that to me was an oxymoron.  It's like why move to South Africa and put your children in the American school.  So, we put the kids in South African schools, which was the best decision we ever made.  We also--we had a home in Johannesburg [South Africa] at that time.  In the meantime, my husband [Eugene Jackson] bought a farm, so that was the other decision we made.  We moved from--instead of the suburbs of Bryanston [South Africa], which is this very upscale community, we moved to a farm in Pretoria [South Africa].  And I was a little bit afraid of that, because Pretoria is more Afrikaners, and it was unexpected.  I didn't know what to expect, so I was a little bit scared, if you will but willing to take the risk.  And the farm is very isolated.  It was thirty minutes outside of town, nine hundred acres (laughter).  Moving from head of children's programming, executive vice president of World African Network to being--working on a--living on a farm, not working, but living on a farm.  And by then my husband had bought a herd of dairy cows, so we had like a real serious farm with smells of the cows and everything.
Speaker 1: And so this--this is near Ba-Basotho [South Africa] or, or, or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, it's Pretoria [South Africa].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't near Botswana.  Are you thinking Botswana?
Speaker 1: Botswana, yeah.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't near Botswana.  It's just a farm outside of--beautiful farm, beautiful farm with infrastructure and a lake and some game.  And my--turns out my children loved growing up there.  We were very isolated.  It's--you had to buy--make sure there was milk for the weekend.  Otherwise, you had to drive back into town to get milk and stuff.
Speaker 1: How old were your children?
Speaker 2: Aisha [Jackson] was the in sixth grade; Bakari [Jackson] was probably fourth grade; Shasha [Jackson] was probably second grade; Amani [Pettis] was fifteen, sixteen.  And one of the things I re--required them to do is they had to milk (laughter) twice a weekend.  Because we lived outside of town, I said if I'm gonna drive, you guys are gonna milk.  So they had to milk the cows twice a weekend.
Speaker 1: Wow, so it was really farm life--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it was real farm life for city kids, yeah.  They wouldn't drink the milk.  It was funny.  Everybody on the farm got an allocation of milk every day.  My kid--and people that came to the house wanted the milk or they wanted the rich milk for their coffee.  My kids, 'cause they milk the cows, I had to buy the milk (laughter).  They, they couldn't handle milking the cows and drinking the milk, so I had to buy milk for them.
Story_ID: 155894
Speaker 1: Now did you get involved in, in television event--eventually in South--South Africa?
Speaker 2: I actually talked to a lot of people in South Africa about being involved in television and they were interested in my skills.  But when it came right down to making the decisions, what I found out is that they would--they wanted black empowerment, and they wanted black South Africans in those jobs.  So I basically never worked in the industry other than when it--a U.S. production came in and did a show years later--a couple of years later, but for working for South African, I didn't.  I got involved with a friend of mine who produced events.  We produced some events in South Africa.  A woman named Tyna Onwudiwe, who was a Nigerian living in South Africa, and a woman by the name of Carol Chawanny [ph.], we organized some even--big events where I worked with them.  It was their events.  They were producing them, but I was helping them produce some of their events.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Not for television, just events where the minister or president would be there, and there were big dinners or luncheons or, you know, World AIDS Day.  And you know how African Americans had--this was really a surprise.  Winnie Mandela, because she would come here dressed in African clothes, there wasn't any of that in South Africa; there wasn't.  We had this impression that that was going on; it wasn't.  South Africa was very Western.  So when we first went over there--oh, backing up a minute.  One of the things that World African Network--we did is on Friday everybody dressed in African dress on Friday.  That was one of our company things that we did, because we were try--we were embracing our Africanity, if you will.  And I was interested in African fashion, so I had followed a few of the designers and purchased designer clothes from Africa that I would wear to events and things like that.  So when we went to South Africa and we started doing these events, one of the things we did was start working and decorating with African decorations and dressing in African clothes and encouraging people.  So it's beginning to modernize, if you will, African dress in South Africa and started organizing these events, and we helped create the tide that, that began to embrace that.
Speaker 1: Okay, inside Africa itself.
Speaker 2: In South Africa itself.
Speaker 1: Okay, did, did Winnie Mandela dress in African clothes in South Africa herself?
Speaker 2: She did sometimes, especially on special occasions, but on other times she was just in regular clothes.  Like at her daughter's wedding, she had a suit on.  She was dressed Western, and that was a real shock to see that, you know, that here I had the impression before-in fact, my husband [Eugene Jackson] and I took African--it was clothes from Ghana to wear to the wedding.  We didn't wear them.  We ended up--ended up wearing Western clothes to the wedding 'cause that's how everybody else was dressed.
Story_ID: 155895
Speaker 1: We were talking about your role as vice president of both children's and family programs for NBC [National Broadcasting Company] and Project Peacock too.  And we discussed I think pretty fully 'Alvin and the Chipmunks.'  And so 'Saved by the Bell' I think we, we, wanted to go back over again.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, 'Saved by the Bell' actually was a show that was produced by Disney under the original name of 'Good Morning Ms. Bliss.'  And it was a Disney project for one of their stars.  The woman--God--her name escapes me right now.  I'll think of her name in a minute--Hayley Mills, the wo--the girl who starred in 'Parent Trap.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: As an adult, they were trying to create a series for her.  And they shot the pilot and they shot thirteen episodes, and they were gonna shoot it at Disney World, at the new Disney Studio down at MGM that hadn't even opened.  So I traveled down there to look at the facility and say that it was a great facility for us to shoot in, and then Disney decided to back away from the project.  So Disney--so Brandon Tartikoff, who was president of entertainment said to me, "Phyllis, should we pick up this series?"  I said, "yeah, we could pick it up under NBC Productions," and I had a great idea of how to do it.  We did some recasting.  I wanted more teams of color.  We ended up looking for an af--for a Latino, where Mario Lopez was cast, and I also wanted to follow the Disney model.  Because child development was a part of my background, and I think that the stories would have a value to the audience.  It wouldn't be writers writing about their own storylines.  So we hired a consultant by the name of [HM] Dr. Karen Hill-Scott, who was my equivalent to [HM Dr.] Alvin Poussaint, who, who I introduced to the producers and had her come on as our consultant to work with the writers to give it the same kind of flavor as 'The Cosby Show' from a team perspective.
Speaker 1: What is Dr. Scott's background?
Speaker 2: Dr. Sulz--Dr. [Hill-] Scott has a interesting background.  She was an urban planner; she taught at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]; and she had started consulting for television for children.  And I began to get her more and more of what I was involved in at NBC, so she became a consultant at NBC in the children's programming area.  Because Karen [Hill-Scott] has a mixture of the academia as well as the practical life experience of, of, of applying the child development concepts, and she's a mother of four children and a--and a--and a wife.  So I thought the combination of all those things would make it touch kids and touch families, so that's why I wanted her to be my consultant.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so 'Saved by the Bell' was launched in '82 [1982].  Is that, that right?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 1: Nine--
Story_ID: 155896
Speaker 1: Around the same time--or was it 1981 that you called the diversity con--I don't know what the name of it was, but what was the name, name of the conference you called again?
Speaker 2: I--it was a diver--what happened was--first of all, writer--most of the writers that were writing for children's programs were white males.  So when you wanted to write a story with an Af--with a person of color or females, they had trouble writing those roles because of their own stereotypes.  And we'd end up with stereotypical characters and sometimes negative stereotypical characters.  I remember a writer on--and we would suggest that maybe they change some of the characters to people of color.  And I remember a writer told me that--it was a 'Spiderman' episode, and it was a manager of a very upscale hotel.  And I suggested that we change that character to an African American, and the writer said to me, "That would never happen."  This was a very upscale hotel, and the manager of that hotel could never be African American.  And, and it just dawned on me how people write from their own experience and their own knowledge.  So I asked our research department if we could have a conference where we had women and, and representatives of people of color to talk about, in a very normal way, what it was like to be a person of color.  And we had somebody representing the Asian community, the African American community, women, and maybe Native American--I'm not sure--and talked about it for a couple of days.  The conference was so successful and there was so much good information, I wanted to share it with the greater child develop--greater write--all the writers.  And one of the significant things that came out of that conference that I will never forget is when we presented it to the creative community, and they talked about these statistics and what was gonna happen, and how the population of America was gonna change, and the fact that--say, white families were having 1.2 kids; African American families were having 2.5 kids--I'm throwing these numbers out; just examples--and that the Latino community was having, say, four kids, and how over twenty years it was gonna affect the population of America.  And I remember the room gasped.  They went [gasp sound], because the said Los Angeles [California] in twenty years was going to have this greater number of Latino com--you know, the population was gonna smu--significantly more.  And I remember in the room there was a gasp, and now here it is--we--here we are, what thirty years later--almost thirty years later, and it, it has happened.  So once we presented the conference to the writers here, the research department thought it was such a significant conference that we should present it to New York [City, New York] and the executives in New York and give them this information.
Story_ID: 155897
Speaker 1: By the time that was done, 'Saved by the Bell' was already on the air, right?
Speaker 2: 'Saved by the Bell' was on the air--
Speaker 1: --and it was kind of a model--
Speaker 2: It was a risk putting it on, and it became the model, and it was a hit.  It was a hit from the very beginning.  Children really identified with it; and it was a big hit; and it's been syndicated all over the world; and it's a hit all over the world; and all characters are very well known all over the world.  Actually, the lauch--
Speaker 1: Talk about the charac--the charac--the characters, who, who they were and what--
Speaker 2: There was an African American girl [Lisa Turtle]; there was Zack [Morris], the lead; a white female teenage girl [Kelly Kapowksi]; and the Mario Lopez; and then a funny character by the name of Cheech [sic, Samuel "Screech" Powers].  Those were the five core characters.  And they kind of represented the, you know, the geeky kid in, in, in middle school or high school.  And the African American who was this very attractive young lady who, who came from a middle class family, 'cause we didn't want--we wanted the diversity in terms of ethnicity and social economic background.  And Mario Lopez was a more physical character.  He was a boxer but he was very cool, and there was always a little conflict between he and Zack.  And Zack was like the good looking, you know--he was like the Archie, if you will, from the comics, you know.  He was the--you know, all-American, you know, jock--wore letterman jacket.  And then the characters grew, because the charac--the show was on the air a number of years, and they went all the way to--through high school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I think the show was on more years than high school lasts I believe, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They even went through there early college years or something like that.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: But at the time, it was a very big risk.  It had never been done on Saturday morning before, and it was a really big risk.  And we didn't know whether it was gonna work, and it worked, you know, very well.  We were the number one network for seven years, and that show contributed to our being number one.  And the amazing part for me is that later on, when I was I South Africa, to see the significance that even kids that grew up in townships in la--in South Africa were familiar with 'Saved by the Bell.'  That was just--that just blew my mind.  They knew the characters, they were imitating them, they were talking about them the way our kids would here--you know, like, "Oh, Cheech [sic, Screech]," you know, things, things that they used to do--Screech I mean; I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Screech, right, right.
Speaker 2: Screech.
Speaker 1: I was doing a--I was gonna correct it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Screech.
Speaker 1: --but I said don't, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah--no, Screech, the things he would do.  And I just was fascinated that they--it was--had such a significant impact for kids all over the world.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so--
Speaker 2: And later on--I mean if you look at the Disney Channel and what they're doing now--it's-'Saved by the Bell' was the model.  They've kind of perfected it and introduced music and things like that, but it was the trailblazer.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, did--I'm tryin' to remember if the parents of any of the kids showed up on the show or they just kind of there--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The principal--it was mostly--parents were mostly in the school.  I don't ever remember parents at home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If they--if there was, it was later years after I'd let--left NBC [National Broadcasting Company].  But it was mainly the principal who was cast to replace the Hayley Mills character--was a man.  And there probably was some other less significant adults, say, in the soda shop or something like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the principal seemed to be the dupe of a lot of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the dupe of the lot--
Speaker 1: --plots.
Speaker 2: --of the humor, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear) a good natured kind of--kind of a--
Speaker 2: Yes.  I see you know the show.
Speaker 1: I--you know, it just came on at like 11:30 or something.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: My kids at the time--
Speaker 2: It was the end of the sche--
Speaker 1: --my son would have been in middle school, and my daughter was three or four and she would watch it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a big hit.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's one--I'm really proud of that show in terms of, you know, it's significance and what we accomplished in terms of introducing kids of color in positive, you know, roles.  And I'm really proud of that show.
Story_ID: 155898
Speaker 1: You think the black character [Lisa Turtle] on the show ['Saved by the Bell']--you provided some kind of alternative model to kids--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, you know, just as 'The Cosby Show' provided a different model of what an African American household looked like.  We did it in that show as well.
Speaker 1: All right, so we had just passed an era where [HM] Tim Reid was telling us that he was always told that he wasn't black enough, even playing pimps and such.  You know, on--in movies and on television they'd tell him--say--no, you say it like this, you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, again, that's the whole reason we did the minority--the diversity conference, so people could understand.  The--I remember one of the--one of the Asian--I think he was Chinese.  One of the points he made was he has Chinese rel--relatives that live in Mississippi that speak with a Southern twang and a Southern accent.  Because socially they are in Mississippi, and even though they are Chinese, they speak with a Mississippi twang because of--they're socialized to their--so we were just trying to show them that there are all sorts of people--all sorts of people of color, and we're not all the same, and we're not all negative stereotypes.
Speaker 1: Now did--how did the African American community react to it in terms of criticism and so forth?  Was there--
Speaker 2: There was no criticism from the African American community.  I had lots of discussion with parents where even producers in the industry would get together in a group and they'd want positive shows for their kids.  They didn't want the negative stereotypes.  They wanted shows that would be aspirational for your--for their children.  And all of us want that when we're in those positions, to choose those kind of role models for our children.  There was no criticism of the show at all, because there wasn't anything present.  It was a very positive show.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Everything gets criticized you would think, but all right.
Speaker 2: It wasn't criticized though.
Speaker 1: Now, now the second meeting in New York City [New York], we were talking about that.  And, and this, this meeting included the primetime writers--
Speaker 2: The primetime writers--
Speaker 1: --and producers, right?
Speaker 2: --the primetime executives, including like Brandon Tartikoff, who was president of the entertainment industry at that, and our legal team.  It recr--it included all of the executives in New York.  And based on that decision and based on the research we did, they began to look into the research numbers, and the numbers began to say things like African Americans were more inclined to watch shows that they had a character that they could identify with--see an African American character.  And it led to Brandon considering 'The Bill Cosby Show' ['The Cosby Show'] and also 'Miami Vice,' that character getting cast as an African American.
Speaker 1: Now there were already--I think there were black characters in 'St. Elsewhere,' you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and 'ER,' I think it was.
Speaker 2: 'ER' wasn't on that time.
Speaker 1: It wasn't on, okay.
Speaker 2: It was--I can't remember if it was hospital show at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a Stephen Cannell or MTN Productions [sic], but they already--had already--were casting, but it led to NBC [National Broadcasting Company] doing more of that.
Speaker 1: 'Miami Vice' with Philip Michael Thomas as--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: We were trying to think of his name last time.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, Philip Michael Thomas--
Speaker 1: Philip Michael Thomas.
Speaker 2: --was definitely cast in 'Miami Vice' because of that research.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and this, this--he would have been--there weren't very many roles similar to his when he was cast, right--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --on television at that time?
Speaker 2: Probably not since Bill Cosby did 'I Spy.'
Story_ID: 155899
Speaker 1: Speaking of [Bill] Cosby now--so did, did you think that the Bill--Bill Cosby--that Bill Cosby and his pro--production team heard the message of this conference and, and, and--
Speaker 2: I, I doubt it.  I really doubt it.  I think 'The Cosby Show' reflects what Bill Cosby wanted to accomplish.  I think that--if I remember correctly, during that time he was going to school and studying education.  And, you know, it was probably his own--as other parents that I talked to-[HM] Reuben Cannon--we wanted that for our children.  So it was probably his own idea of what he wanted to accomplish in the show, he had the opportunity to do.  And Bill Cosby happened because Brandon [Tartikoff] saw him doing standup on the 'Tonight Show'--or hosting the 'Tonight Show' talking about his family.  And that's when Brandon Tartikoff had the meeting with Bill Cosby to talk about "The Bill Cosby Show."
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: About 'The Cosby Show,' if you will.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it would have been I guess Brandon Tartikoff that was influenced by the conference to think more about diversity.
Speaker 2: A little bit.
Speaker 1: And be a little bit--
Speaker 2: A little bit.
Speaker 1: --more open to--
Speaker 2: Yes, but I'm sure it had more to do with Bill Cosby--it's, it's like you put those things together when you're making those decisions.  You know, who knows which came first?  When you're getting little bits of information, and you're thinking something's a good idea, or the time is the good idea, that's how you--that's how you put it together.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that was the atmosphere at that--at that time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: People thinking about trying to do something diverse.  So, now--so did you have any role in 'The Cosby Show' at all?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Bill Cosby and I worked on a project together, developed a show for Saturday morning, which did get picked up and was supposed to be on when I left.  But then my predecessor [sic, successor] decided not to put the show on, so he didn't have any--I worked with him on another show.
Speaker 1: What, what, what was the show--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was called 'Little People' but it never got on the air.
Speaker 1: Oh, right, right.
Speaker 2: It never got on the air.
Story_ID: 155900
Speaker 1: Speaking of putting together little together little bits and pieces.  There was a producer who came to me with a doll called Little People [later, Cabbage Patch Kids], and I've always loved baby dolls.  And apparently he sent this baby doll to all the animation studios in town.  He had borrowed a hundred thousand dollars on his home because he so believed in this doll.  And just instinctively, because I like dolls, I decided to go to Cleveland, Georgia, to check out this doll.  And when I got off the plane in Atlanta [Georgia], I saw a little girl with the doll.  Brandon Tartikoff and Grant Tinker, everybody thought I was crazy 'cause I thought this doll was just so magic.  I said, "This doll is going to be bigger than Strawberry Shortcake."  The doll was--became Cabbage Patch Kids.  So it's like you put together little bitty pieces of information.  I love the doll; it was a very unusual doll.  They had these incredible plants for the doll.  I got off the plane in Atlanta; I could see little girls with the doll.  I went to cabit--I went to little--to Cleveland, Georgia.  I got caught up in the story at Xavier Roberts and got really excited.  I said there is something here.  So Calico was there.  And NBC could have owned it, but I couldn't convince NBC [National Broadcasting Company]--anybody at NBC that it was going to be significant.  Because Brandon's mother-in-law looked at the doll and said she was ugly.  A lot of people thought the doll was ugly.  His mother-in-law--and it's written in his book--his twelve mistakes that he made when he was head of programming, and that was one of them.  We could have owned--NBC could have owned Cabbage Patch Kids.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had--they had birth certificates--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I mean, the whole thing.  When you went down there you--they were born in a cabbage patch; you got a birth certificate.  And I'll tell you that was thirty-one years ago, 'cause I had my ten month-old daughter [Amani Pettis] with me when I went down there.  And I just was so excited, but I couldn't convince anybody at NBC that it was a great idea.
Story_ID: 155901
Speaker 1: Tell us about the 'Black Snowman' [Phil Mendez].
Speaker 2: The blacks--there was a animator by the name of Phil Mendez, a very creative guy.  He had written a book called the 'The Black Snowman.'  And again, my own interests in developing positive stories or stories that were significant and had meaning for the general population, but also for kids of af--of kids of color and African American kids.  And it was a story that he wrote, and we--excuse me--tried to develop it for television.  I couldn't get it sold, but a book was produced by Scholastic Productions called 'The Black Snowman.'
Speaker 1: Right, I remember seeing the book, yeah.
Speaker 2: But I led to--I, I kind of got him started and introduced him to Scholastic, and Scholastic did the book, and it's a very nice book.  We ended up, to my disappointment, not being able to do the special, but we--he got the book produced.  But he's a very, very, very creative artist.
Story_ID: 155902
Speaker 1: During this period of time there was also a project called Project Peacock.  Right?  Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Project Peacock was a family special.  Under my title as vice president of children's and family special, we produced some primetime specials.  And one of them--under the name Project Peacock; they were big specials.  One was called 'Big Bird--in--Goes to China' where Big Bird was a--produced by the Sesame Street Workshop, and Big Bird actually went to China.  It was at the very begin--of--beginning of China opening up.  There was another one called 'The Storyteller' where Jim Henson did six one-hour specials.  We produced them in London [England] in 1986.  And it was a combination of puppetry and live action.  And they were just big family productions for primetime--very special--special specials, if you will, and we produce them all over the world.  One was in--you know, produced some of them in London; we produced in China, so they were significant specials.
Story_ID: 155903
Speaker 1: Let--let's go back and talk, talk about the 'Gummi Bears.'  Now--
Speaker 2: The Gummi Bears was a special project.  By that time, the Gummi Bears were introduced in the broader sense to the American population, if you will--and it's the com--candy that comes from--comes from Europe.  And Disney had the idea that they would create a television series called the 'Gummi Bears.'  In fact, Michael Eisner came in and pitched the series himself to Brandon Tartikoff, myself, [HM] Winifred [Neisser]--I can't remember if Winifred was still there or not, but--called the 'Gummi Bears.'  And interesting enough, I just heard Alicia Keys sing that song, the 'Gummi Bears.'  So I know, as kids, this had an influence on her even knowing the song.  In fact, one of the characters was named after Brandon's daughter.  Her name was Calla, the lead, and it was kind of based a little bit on the Seven Dwarfs in that all the Gummi Bears had different names and different colors and things like that.  But it was a Disney series.  I think it was on one or two years.
Speaker 1: Now was there--was there an issue I think with your daughter around the--about Princess Calla being a blond I believe it was?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened--it, it came out at the whole diversity thing actually that--one of the things that came out of that cons--con--conference was all the girl heroes were blonds.  In fact, that's still going on today.  Because I remember reading something about Selena Gomez, who is this beautiful Latina girl who was a star at Disney.  Even as a little girl for her, the kid they want it to be blonds, and we tried to convince Disney to make some of the heroes not be blonds, based on that diversity conference.  And it was something that they held onto.  I guess it was kind of old school--other than maybe Snow White, who had dark hair.  All the Disney heroines had blond hair, and we tried to get them to consider giving characters other hair colors, whether it was red or brunette or something, so that we wouldn't have all these little girls that wanna be blond.  And, of course, I had little girls at that point, and they wanted to be princesses and be Cinderella, things like that.  So as a mother--you can't do that job and be a mother and thinking about the consequences and the consequences on your children.  So we did ask them to not have, have her a blond.
Story_ID: 155904
Speaker 1: Anything else, else from children's programming before--'cause you were--
Speaker 2: I was there in until '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: Were, were you in children's programming that whole time?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Until 1991.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: The World African Network I was startin' to do on the side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the World African Network date--see, World African Network started in '85 [1985], but I didn't join them until '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ninety [1990], ninety-one [1991].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's the problem with the information.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: The--what happens with--during that time I was working on developing 'Little People' with Bill Cosby, which was a show about little people.  It was an idea that Bill Cosby had, and it was just about these little characters called the Little People.  And when you're--at that time, children's programming you develop and produce, so from--every season is like you have a current season, where you get the shows on the air; and then you have a developing season.  So for the next three or four years we kept developing projects to put on.  But our series and our shows were so successful, we really didn't have a lot of new time periods.
Speaker 1: What's a lead time on development.  I mean, how soon--how, how far ahead of the show--
Speaker 2: We probably developed--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --in--started developing in January, and we pitched--we'd have to pitch to Brandon Tartikoff, or in previous years, Fred Silverman in New York [New York].  And then we'd have a pickup about April, announce it to the affiliates in May, and it would start on the air in September.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the production time actually for the show--I mean--okay, so if you have a good idea and it's accepted in the spring, it's got to be ready for--you have to have shows ready for--
Speaker 2: For--
Speaker 1: --September.
Speaker 2: --for September.
Speaker 1: So summer is really--
Speaker 2: Summer is our busy--
Speaker 1: Somebody is really working hard.
Speaker 2: --Some of these--summer is our busiest time.  Summer was our busiest time.  And now that I'm back in the industry as vice president of children programs--I mean vice president of broadcast standards, the development cycle is continuous now.  There is no big fall launch anymore in children's programming.  It's--they're buying and selling shows all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know it used to be a special TV Guide and issue.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: You know, fall preview of children's--
Speaker 2: And it still is the fall preview--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in primetime, but in children's programming what's evident to me, it's not based on that same schedule anymore--
Story_ID: 155905
Speaker 1: The one thing I remember about those later years at NBC [National Broadcasting Company] is that Nickelodeon was this little network that was starting up, and no one could have ever imagined what Nickelodeon has become today.
Speaker 2: What--do you have any thoughts about why Nickelodeon became so successful, I mean, as, as opposed to what the net--you know, what, what Nickelodeon does as opposed to what the networks do.
Speaker 1: First of all, the ratings are different.  When I--when NBC's ratings-'The Smurfs'--we got thirty-six shares.  We got forty-two shares in the audience.  Now the shares are like two and three shares, or four share, or five share.  The audience has really broken up to, to be served by all these different channels--Nickelodeon, Disney, The Hub, Vortex, NBC, CBS, ABC--children all over the place.  Nickelodeon is very concentrated, so the success of Nickelodeon is that it's a twenty-four hour channel.  And a lot of the advertising dollars followed the twenty-four hour channel.  So the advertising and the networks deciding not to make that significant investment in Saturday morning, in terms of the kind of money that we used to spend for Saturday morning, that money kind of went over to the new cable networks, and that's really what happened.  The Saturday morning schedules for the networks are very small now.  It's only a few hours.  And at some point, the network made the decision to not continually make that huge investment.  One of the things that happened even when I was still there was, there was a belief that nurturing children on Saturday morning creating a loyalty to NBC that would pay off in primetime later.  And I guess later there was the discovery that that wasn't necessarily worth the investment, if you will, and that they could market or promote and get them to watch NBC later.  And they just--the dollar commitment to the network significantly reduced for Saturday morning.  I was really there at the best time I think.
Story_ID: 155906
Speaker 1: Is, is there any--is there any--I was thinking about continuity in a network.  I mean, I know I've, I've been disturbed wa--watching some television pro--programs when I think--and I don't know--that the writing has changed, you know, and familiar characters change.  But a network's identity over the course of years has got to really change--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, it has changed.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There was a time, for example, in the years that I'm talking about, that CBS [Columbia Broadcast Systems] was considered the old network.  It was for the mature audience.  It was for the fifty plus audience, and now look at CBS.  CBS is the number one network.  But what makes the difference is who is there, who's running the network, who's developing the shows, who's putting on the shows.  CBS has gone from the old folks--like the senior network in the '90s [1990s] and the '80s [1980s] to the number one network in 2013.
Speaker 1: Yeah, things do change.  I think the public has a perception of maybe image of what NBC [National Broadcasting Company] is and what CBS is and what ABC [American Broadcasting Company] is --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But it changes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It changes.  To me, coming back, of course, living in South Africa we had a sampling of programs.  What's significant to me now is that the writing is just amazing.  The writing has really, really improved.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have any ideas why it's improved?
Speaker 2: I just--I think people are more--young people that went to college and majored in film or entertainment and literature learned how to write.  If you--what you have to remember--and Suzanne de Passe and I talked about it when I saw her the last time.  We were doing it by the seat of our pants.  We didn't know what we were doing.  We were just doing what we thought worked.  I mean, I don't remember what her original training was.  I was a child development major.  I didn't have any film or writing experience.  I just happened to luck into being in the entertainment industry.  Lawyers were running the industry at that point.  People who were interested--but none of us had any experience in writing.  It was like a lot of gut instinct of what was going on.  You know, you--a lot of the executives that ran it were in television because they loved it or they grew up on it as a child.  They weren't in it because they had gone to school; they'd learned how to write; they were producers.  We were all learning, so that--the, the, the (unclear) the '80s [1980s] and the '90s [1990s].  We were learning.  We were doing it by the seat of our pants.  We were--now there's a whole ratings analysis of what worked before and the history of ratings and things like that.  We put our schedule--Saturday morning schedule according to the guide of what we thought would work.  I used my child development in terms of how kids worked, how kids--you know, their social development and their, you know, demographic development.  I'd put a schedule together based on that, but it wasn't based on any previous ratings or anything like that.
Story_ID: 155907
Speaker 1: Who did you have to battle with [at NBC, National Broadcasting Company] I guess in meetings in terms of--or what kind of ideas would you have to fight against, or, or, or, or as you were fighting for you know child development and diversity--
Speaker 2: Well, there were sev--there were many battles.  Gosh, and the--and it changed according to the--according to who my management was.  But first of all, the writers had to sell to me.  The writers and the producers had to sell to me based on what I thought would work.  And I thought would work, based on my child development ex--expectations, my own experience in television, what I saw currently happening in, in the marketplace, if you will, what was--what I thought was going on with children, what was working in terms of commercials, what was her--at--working in terms of toys.  So it was all gut.  Then after we--and I'd put certain things in development; like, they'd come to me now and they'd, they'd spend weeks developing a project.  And I'd say I'm sorry; it doesn't work.  I remember I was pitched a concept for Michael Jordan, a famous hockey player, and a baseball star as a children's Saturday morning concept.  And at that point, those guys were not the superstars that they are now, but I thought it was too boy.  I didn't think a sports series could work.  So it's totally my gut instinct.  Now years later Michael Jordan is a household name.  When this concept was pitched to me in the '80s [1980s], Michael Jordan was not a household name.  He was a--you know, back--in the--in the sports world he was well known, but he isn't the celebrity that he is today.  And what I see the difference is now is that athletes--there's--everybody is a celebrity now.  Everything's gotten bigger.  Every--because of the E! channel [E! Entertainment Television] and the--and the red carpets.  All the celebrity has gotten bigger.  My battle would have been to convince my superior which would have been a Brandon Tartikoff or a Fred Silverman that these were good ideas and children would watch them.  The example that I just gas gave I didn't think would work, so I didn't even do all of it.  So, first of all, the writers and the producers had to come to me and sell to me.  And just like the idea I gave you about Roger Schlaifer and the Cabbage Patch, which was Little People [later, Cabbage Patch], I thought it would work.  I knew it was girls.  I--we'd have to struggle to make sure it was something boys could watch, but I knew the toy would be a--I felt instinctively that the toy would be a big hit, and it was.  The, the challenge is how do you make it appeal to both boys and girls?  Now the difference today is that things are much more niche.  They develop programs for boys.  They develop programs for girls.  We were try--I was trying to develop for the broader audience so that it appealed to boys and girls.  And my feeling was that you couldn't get the kind of ratings that I was getting or expecting appealing just to a niche audience.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I--it's my impression from those days and even the earlier days, that a lot of programming was developed to appeal to boys basically to--
Speaker 2: Well, if you look at the programs that I put on like the Chipmunks ['Alvin and the Chipmunks'], like 'Saved by the Bell,' like the 'Smurfs,' 'The Gary Coleman Show,' 'Punky Brewster,' those were shows that appealed to both.  Earlier in my career, we did the like 'Pebbles and Bam Bam,' which was still boys and girls.  I was still--I liked the softer, cuddly characters.  We did do 'Spiderman,' but then we made sure that there--you know, he had a--an aunt, and it had a family feel to it, but that's just the kind of programs that I liked.  And what--going back to your question a minute ago about the reflection of the network, my network schedule reflected my taste--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and what I thought would work, me and my team.  But then Brandon [Tartikoff], and before him, Fred Silverman, would have their say.  We'd have to convince them and sell the schedule.  For my battle was to sell them the shows that I thought would work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my battle was--and I remember 'cause sometimes going to church on Sunday trying to get the, the energy to go back and fight that battle, you know, on Monday to convince them what I--that what I thought would work.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember those days of, of boys programming centered around shows like 'He-Man [and the Masters of the Universe]' and 'G.I. Joe.'
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Those shows did not appear on, you know, my network.  There's one show that we did not get that I would have been interested in and that's the Turtles.
Speaker 1: The Ninja Turtles, right.
Speaker 2: 'The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.'  I thought that was a good idea.  I also thought, even though it wasn't on my network and it was after me, the company that I work for Power Rangers.  I had gone to Japan on a trip, and I saw those robots and I thought, "Oh, this is a great idea."  So when Saban [Entertainment] sold Power Rangers to Fox [Broadcasting Company], my feeling was that it was gonna be a hit, because it's a combination of robots and kids.  And I just thought it would be a hit.  It was a bigger hit than I could have imagined, in terms of dollars.  I mean, it was beyond my imagination of what it could earn, but I do feel that I felt at that time it was gonna be a hit.
Story_ID: 155908
Speaker 1: Well, I did that.  I had an older son [Nye Tucker] and then I had kids later, and I went through that, the Transformers, the Gobots.  So it's the same kind of appeal, and one of the things, you know, in child development is that kids, especially when they're little, they go through the same development stages.  Now what's happening today, because of exposure medium--in the medium--they are going through those stages earlier, but they still go through that sequence of development.  They just go through it earlier and faster because they're exposed to it now earlier and faster.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Like boys always go through the dinosaur stage.  I don't care--I, I mean, I can't imagine--there's a very small percentage of boys that don't like dinosaurs; they do.
Speaker 2: Now, now did, did the video game enter into the picture when you were at NBC [National Broadcasting Company]?
Speaker 1: Video games--
Speaker 2: Like Super Mario Bros. and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Those things were just beginning, Pac-Man and things like that.  Pac Man I think was on ABC [American Broadcasting Company] or CBS [Columbia Broadcasting Systems].  I can't remember.  I had less interest in those because I--you know, I had my 'Chipmunks' ['Alvin and the Chipmunks']; I had my 'Smurfs;' I had things that I thought were character.  And I remember there was a time where Brandon Tartikoff wanted to put on Mr. T, because 'The A-Team' was such a big hit.  I wanted to put on 'the Chipmunks,' so the compromise was I got to put on 'the Chipmunks' and we put on 'Mister T.'  The im--the thought at the time was that 'Mister T' was the bigger hit, and I believed in the intrinsic strength of 'the Chipmunks.'  So 'Mister T.' did get a bigger rating initially, but in the long run, because of the characters, because of the personalities and stories, 'the Chipmunks' eclipsed 'Mister T.;' in fact, it went off the air like, say, a year or two later.  And that's 'cause the intrinsic characters are stronger than, say, a, a phenomenon like a 'Mister T.'
Speaker 2: "I pity the fool."
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Exactly.
Speaker 2: So--yeah, yeah, he was--he was a--I know my son had, had a Mr. T and a G.I. Joe, you know, all the He-Men and all that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: And just think right now, there was another--there was a movie done in the last few years about Mr. T.  What's, what's the biggest hit of all those?  You know, my favorite, 'the Chipmunks.'
Speaker 2: Chipmunks--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: There's--it's--there's an intrinsic strength.
Speaker 2: 'The Smurfs' had--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And 'The Smurfs.'
Story_ID: 155909
Speaker 1: Now, you started working with World African Network in--I mean, the--in '85 [1985].  I mean, you, you were doing some, some part-time work or something.
Speaker 2: I wasn't working with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Eugene Jackson was working on the World African Network while I was still at NBC [National Broadcasting Company].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was still kind of--kind of consulting, but still maintaining my job at NBC.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I really didn't go over and start working with the World African Network until probably '89 [1989]--probably about 1990.  We produced a show called the 'Miss Collegiate African American Pageant,' which was a show that was done locally at first out of Miami [Florida], and then decided to put up the financing and get sponsorship to create a television show that was syndicated.  And the show was to take queens of the historically African American college and create a pageant around them and to choose the queen of all the historically black colleges.  So that was the first thing we did, was 'Miss Collegiate African American Pageant.'
Speaker 1: And, and this is 1991?
Speaker 2: Ninety [1990]--eighty-nine [1989], ninety [1990], something like that, because in 1990, we did shoot out here.  And eventually we went--ended up going to Disney World [sic, Disneyland, Anaheim, California] and doing it in Disney World for a few years at the same studio that I had gone to see for 'Saved by the Bell.'  We actually did it down at the Disney Studio for a few years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you, you left NBC in '91 [1991], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Ye--ye--yet, what were your thoughts, as you were getting ready to leave NBC I mean?
Speaker 2: First of all, I went over to the production side.  I went to NBC Productions to produce.  And I worked with Motown on a special for Boyz II Men, and I did some other variety specials, and I did music.  But I decided I'd rather--if I was gonna produce, I'd rather produce for the company that Eugene and I were doing--gonna do together called the World African Network.  So I decided to leave NBC Productions and go full time to World African Network.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so some people would, would probably say--they probably did say, you're gonna leave NBC?  You know?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: What are you doing?  What are you--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Especially the family.
Speaker 1: --thinking about?  You know, don't you know how--what good a job that is?
Speaker 2: You sound exactly like my uncle: you're gonna leave your good job (laughter)?  That's exactly what the family said.  That's exactly what the family said, but--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you--you're in magazines.  People are calling you--you were in the--called--you were one of the top 100 business and professional women--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, cover of Black Enterprise, all that.  And that's what they said.  You--I mean, what you just said--my uncle said, "you're gonna leave your good job at NBC and go out and do the World African Network?"  So, yes.
Speaker 1: What did he--I mean, I can imagine that they said World African Network what?  You know?  Probably a lot of head scratching is what--
Speaker 2: Head scratching, you know.  As--about that time [HM Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson had kind of talked to us about calling ourselves African Americans, so there was that whole conflict--you know, I'm not African American; I'm black-- that whole thing.  I remember sitting at NBC the morning that was on the 'Today Show,' and one of the producers said to me, "What are you, black or African American?" (Laughter)  'Cause people were curious.  You know, like, what are you gonna call yourself?  So yes, that was a bit of a shock for the family and friends to go out and take that risk, to leave that job.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but now on the other side, what, what did you see as a promise of World African Network?
Speaker 2: The promise of World African Network was to create a network that was positive for the African American community.  The concept of the network was to source produce from the Diaspora, from the continent, from where we could ever find product.  And put it on a cable network that was dedicated to the African American community.  And we saw ourselves as different from BET, because at that point, BET [Black Entertainment Television] was pretty much music videos and maybe a few other programs.  And while I--
Speaker 1: And it was criticized by a lot of people.
Speaker 2: It was criticized.  And I felt as if our community was loyal to BET, because we are loyal to a company like that that's taking a risk and being the first.  But I didn't feel as if a significant number of people in our community were actually watching BET, and this was an opportunity for our community to see themselves in positive imagery.  And we sourced material from all over the world that we were gonna put on this network.
Story_ID: 155910
Speaker 1: It's interesting to me when I think about that, that the black colleges [historically black colleges and universities, HBCUs] emerge at this time as being--as--they have a higher profile in the general black community than ever before it seems to me.  With 'The Cosby Show,' he comes out with a sweatshirt on with a different black co--college on it every week.  You see--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --you know, kids in that neighborhood wearing black college sweatshirts that never been to black college--I mean, they were really thinking about it more and more.
Speaker 2: Well, that just speaks to the influence of media.  You know, be--if Bill Cosby hadn't wearing them-- he'd made them aware.  It's just like 'Boyz 'N the Hood' made people aware of Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] based on that storyline.  If you remember, that main character ended up going to I think Morehouse, and the girlfriend was going to Spelman.  And then 'The Cosby Show' created the--what was the show that would--that took place at--
Speaker 1: 'A Different World.'
Speaker 2: 'A Different World.'  I thought it was a differ--'A Different World' was like a Spelman kind of campus.  And I think a lot of the African African American parent--parents, especially those who had gone to historically black colleges, wanted their children to go to have that experience.  Here was another resource that began to plant that seed in our kids' minds, if you will, and I think the pageant did that by highlighting, you know, these women that were, you know, bright, intelligent, well spoken, talented, beautiful, all those things.  Media influences young people, and when they see it and they're exposed to it, it gives them a different idea and it gives them a different view.
Story_ID: 155911
Speaker 1: This time period was one that I--a friend and I--of my mine and I were saying it was almost like the--a new black convention movement, almost like the 19--early 1900s where there were all these conventions.  Black people were convening about everything.  Ninety-one [1991], ninety-two [1992], ninety-three [1993]--(unclear)--you know (unclear).  African fashions became en vogue, the 'Malcolm X' movie came out.  It was just a--just a big focusing on, you know, identity during this period of time.  Even--almost more so than the--it may be more so than the--in the late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, those--I guess those experiences became attractive to us.  We start participating in them.  You know, I just--I know from our perspective-- that's always been the perspective of what I wanted to do in the long run.  One of the things I even felt, maybe even before I got involved in children's programming, is that I wanted to take my skills and contribute them in Africa, if you will--the experience that I had for the media over there.  I mean, even before children's programming I remember feeling that.  'Cause there was a unit manager at KNBC that was from Nigeria.  I think he was from Nigeria.  And I thought I--somehow I had that vision of going there and getting involved in their media, you know, as someone coming with experience.  So it--I just think it was a part of me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Anyway, that seems to be a wave of the--of things happening in early '90s [1990s].  But--so, so World African Network was headquartered in Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No, we were headquartered here [Los Angeles, California] initially.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It started out here.  In fact, it started out right down the street off of Slauson [Ave, Los Angeles, California] and Green Valley Circle.  And we started going to the cable convention and setting up our booth and trying to get cable operators to allow World African Network to be on their cable network.  And our timing was bad because at that point, there were--there was the capacity for seventy-five networks, and the cable operators and general managers felt well, we had BET [Black Entertainment Television].  Why do we need another black network?  And we tried to explain that the difference we were gonna have--movies, we were gonna have women's programs, children's programming, the international programming, news.  Even though it was going to be potentially old news, that it might have been more historical in nature, we used to say it was news to me because it was new information.  And they couldn't quite understand why there should be two networks.  We couldn't convince them that there should be two.  Even for me and you, it would seem obvious why they're two, because it's two different--clearly different types of programming.  In fact, TV One today has become--is a little bit of the model of what World African Network was twenty-three years ago.  The other thing that happened that was not in our favor is that it was just before the crossover to digital where there were more channels.  So if anything, we were a little bit early and our pockets weren't deep enough to sustain us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To jump the divide, if you will.
Story_ID: 155912
Speaker 1: In addition to the Ms. African American college pageant [sic, 'Miss Collegiate African American Pageant'], you produced 'Stomp.'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Stomp' was a step show that we, again, focused on the African American college campuses and had step teams come down to Walt Disney World to the MGM Studio [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios]--the Walt Disney World Studio/MGM Studio and--but there was a step competition.  So we produced the pageant first, and then shut down and--not shut down, but transitioned into the step show, so it was a step competition.  And stepping kind of came to the national awareness through--I'm pretty sure--I remember there was a step show--a step something on 'The Cosby Show' or either 'A Different World'--something like that--and then we did it in our show.  And there might have been--you know, and then later there were movies that people-
Speaker 1: Yes. --learned about stepping--
Speaker 2: --'School Daze' with--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Spike Lee had--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --a good step scene--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --too, you know.  I think they're, they're other movies that had--has a similar type scene--a step scene--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --black dancers in the movies (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --days in the mid--in the late '80s [1980s] and early '90s [1990s]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So, yeah.
Story_ID: 155913
Speaker 1: So World African Network survives how long in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, we--the reason we moved to Atlanta [Georgia] was because--at that point, we knew we were gonna move to South Africa, and Atlanta was a better hub, if you will.  Because the African American community, other than is more in the South and the Eastern ca--East Coast.  So we figured our sales representative would be flying to affiliates, so Atlanta was a better hub for the network, and that's why we moved to Atlanta.
Speaker 1: So when did you move to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: We moved to Atlanta in 1994.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We moved the whole company.  We moved twenty people, including my parents [Vivian Scott Middleton and Philip Govan Middleton], to Atlanta.  We moved the whole company to Atlanta.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, so you and Eugene Jackson are married by this point, right?  Are, are you married at this point?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and you got a family, so.  Is it--was it difficult working with some--you were doing like some real--was it difficult working with your spouse on these--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: A loaded question.  It had its challenges, because I'm a person who family is really significant, and Gene [Eugene Jackson] is a person who works really long hours.  So sometimes I'd struggle to get out of the office to get home to the family.  But philosophically, we agreed on the network and how it was run.  I also worked with Sidney Small.  [HM] Clarence Avant was a part of this and Percy Sutton.  So they were like the founding members.  It was myself, Eugene, Clarence Avant, Sidney Small, and Percy Sutton.  And the reason Gene asked tho--them to get involved was because of Percy Sutton and cable and influence, Clarence Avant with the music, and, you know, the grandfather in the music industry and then myself in programming--
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: --were the influencers, if you will, to try to be a part of the team that convinced people that this was a good idea.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, but, but at this point, World African Network has a channel--a cable channel, right?
Speaker 2: No, we never got--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --on the air.
Speaker 1: So you never got--
Speaker 2: We never got on the air.
Speaker 1: So--but some of the programs were seen.  I know that--
Speaker 2: What happened--
Speaker 1: (Unclear), what, what--when they were--
Speaker 2: --the Miss--the 'Collegiate African American Pageant' and 'Stomp' were syndicated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The World African Network, after squint--spending quite a bit of money I development, did not get on the air.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We did not get picked up.
Speaker 1: All right, 'cause I, I know I saw some of the, the programming, but it would--it would have been like--
Speaker 2: It was (unclear) programming--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --that was syndicated--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but the network itself never got launched.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  So, so-- so you moved to Atlanta in '94 [1994], but how, how long did the--
Speaker 2: We--
Speaker 1: --network--
Speaker 2: --went on--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --another two years, from '94 [1994] to '96 [1996] and just could not put that final financing in place to get on the air.
Story_ID: 155914
Speaker 1: Any last thoughts or lessons about World African Network?
Speaker 2: My thought on World African Network is--because what happened was our original idea was to get out on a on with four hours of programming.  And we started working on the World African Network as the same time that E! TV [E! Entertainment Television] started, when it was still a little small network.  And my feeling in hindsight is even though--and that was in a time when people didn't understand that you could repeat programming, and me coming out of primetime couldn't imagine repeating programming, if you will.  You know, on cable they reshow shows like three hours later.  I'm coming out of primetime; you don't do that.  And even networks today, they'll show a show on Wednesday, and then they'll turn around and repeat it on Wednesday night.  Those things weren't done in those days.  In hindsight, I wish we'd have gotten on with four to six solid hours of programming, and just repeated it three times and just gotten on the air and built from there.  Because originally, our original concept where we were gonna be four hours or six hours and then Gene wanted to go to twenty-four hours, and I just think it was too big a leap; it was too much.  So I think we should have gotten on small and built from there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in those days, at the-be--where cable was, we could have done that I think, but that's, you know, hindsight.  And who knows?  Hindsight's twenty/twenty.
Story_ID: 155915
Speaker 1: Now at the same time in I guess the last--I mean during World African Network days you're traveling to South Africa.  And, and I, I, I think--I know we talked about it last time.  First was a visit, then--you know, then it kind of grew.
Speaker 2: Well, what happened--I think that's also what happened to World African Network is we became a little bit divided, because we were still working on World African Network, and the staff was working on World African Network, but Gene [Eugene Jackson] also was having interests in South Africa.  And the idea was that we were gonna move to South Africa, so if anything, we weren't--we were kind of divided and started traveling to South Africa.  What happened is Dali Tambo, who is Oliver Tambo's son, and--came for one visit to talk about the future or the potential--in fact, he was the one who told us, you know, that Sun City [Resort] was opening up, and [Nelson] Mandela was moving around, and began to really paint a different picture of what was going on in South Africa that we had no idea--from over here what was going on and how it was really beginning to open up.
Speaker 1: Now, now did Dali Ta--Tambo pick you all out especially to, to--
Speaker 2: He came and--
Speaker 1: --make this pitch--
Speaker 2: --he sat in our living room--
Speaker 1: or did--or did he--okay.
Speaker 2: --right down the street on Ladera.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Was--so was he here in this country just trying to--
Speaker 2: No, he came--
Speaker 1: --to get people--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he came to try to motivate people to begin to think about doing business in South Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember him sitting in my living room before we went over there and saying, South Africa's opening up; we really want people to come and help.  Gene had it owned radio stations and the National Black Network, I in programming-- beginning of the idea of selling and beginning to think about coming to South Africa.
Story_ID: 155916
Speaker 1: Your family moved to South Africa in '98 [1998], right?  But, but you were there, you know.
Speaker 2: The--we started going back and forth.  We were invited by Dali Tambo and then another group who wanted us to come and consult.  Because they wanted to apply for the license to have a new television network that was starting in South Africa.  So that began in 1992.  We liked it so much we went back for Christmas in 1992 and--to give the family the opportunity to see the country.  We took my parents [Vivian Scott Middleton and Philip Govan Middleton], Eugene's parents, a couple of other people with us, and traveled around the country.  And one of the most significant moments of that trip that I was reminded of this week with Nelson Mandela's passing [on December 5, 2013] is that we went--when we were in Umtata [later Mthatha, South Africa], it was Christmas Eve of 1992.  We went to Nelson Mandela's home and visited with him and had coffee or tea for about an hour.  And I have a picture, which I really cherish, and the children cherish now, of him.  And they're two and four and six in front of his home with Nelson Mandela and my parents.
Story_ID: 155917
Speaker 1: Christmas Eve [1992] we're in Umtata [later Mthatha, South Africa]. We're on our way to Port Elizabeth [South Africa], and we were invited to come to Nelson Mandela's home.  And for an hour--we visited him for like an hour or two and took a picture.  And for my children now, looking at his passing this week [on December 5, 2013], they understand pictorially what a significant role that has in their lives now.  Because two of them are still working in South Africa, and it just changed the direction of their lives.  We ended up moving there in 1998 full time.  But before that, we were kind of going back and forth looking--
Speaker 2: Okay, I just wanna focus on that Christmas Eve for a minute.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, especially since, you know, Madiba Nelson Mandela passed away last week, what was he like?  What was your impression of him?
Speaker 1: He was very--he was like a regular person.  He--as people have talked about a little bit--he was very animated with the children.  He was really interested in them, very welcoming to them.  Our parents who were in their seventies at that time, which is how old he is--my father [Philip Govan Middleton] is ninety-seven; Nelson Mandela was ninety-five.  My parents--our parents were there.  He was very welcoming to them and talked to them, talked a little bit about where he was and how a good--you know, it was kind of just a regular visit.  It wasn't politics.  It was just going to someone's house and having a cup of tea and sitting and saying hello, and taking pictures.  Of course, all of us wanted pictures.  He was just a regular--like a grandfather, just really kind of relaxing.  His red Mercedes was out in front of the house that the factory workers built for him for when he came out of--
Speaker 2: Now I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: --out of prison.
Speaker 2: This is a story we don't know.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, the, the Mercedes dealer there--the Mercedes factory there built a special car for Mandela.  It was red, and it was parked in front of the house; it was there.  So it was interesting to see that there.  And it was just a really, really nice visit, one that I'll never forget.  And my children, who had seen the picture years before we moved to South Africa, had posted it on Facebook this week.  And for them, they saw what a turning point that was for them in their lives.  And both Nelson Mandela and Winnie Mandela really--and, and Dali Tambo and Oliver Tambo and the team that invited us over to work on the television station were all the ingredients that worked together for us to eventually move to South Africa.  Because Nelson Mandela, Winnie Mandela were saying come home, we need you--
Story_ID: 155918
Speaker 1: --We need you, we need you to help us with all the opportunities that there gonna be, and help us get organized.
Speaker 2: Okay, now at this time, Nelson Man--Mandela had, had been re--out of Robben Island for a year or so maybe.
Speaker 1: It was actually two--probably two years.  And I remember because when he first got out, my daughter [Shasha Jackson] was a newborn, and she was two.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: At this time, so it'd been two years.
Speaker 2: But at this junction he was not the president of South Africa.
Speaker 1: No, no, he was not the president.  It was before he was even running for president.  It was that in-between time.  It was before the first elections.
Speaker 2: But he was considered I guess the fuel that--
Speaker 1: The icon that he was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, of--
Speaker 1: And he was peacefully just sitting in his house in Umtata [later Mthatha, South Africa].  And when, when we went back in--for Christmas, and then we went, say in '93 [1993].  We actually went to his home.  We went to Oliver Tambo's home.  They were like regular--they were--they were planning.  I mean, and we weren't included on these inside meetings or anything like that, but they were very accessible.  They were like--we'd just go to their homes, and they'd be there, and you'd talk, and no secure--I mean, security was with them, but they didn't keep you away.
Story_ID: 155919
Speaker 1: Were other African Americans around?
Speaker 2: Not really.  We were probably some of the first that were going over there and actually moving over there.
Speaker 1: I know [HM] Charlayne Hunter-Gault at some point--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure when they--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--was she there?
Speaker 2: --when they went ov--I didn't meet her until after I moved over there.  She probably was there.  She might have been working for CNN [Cable News Network] at that time.  She probably was living there, but at the way we were moving around I didn't see Charlayne at that time.  Oliver Tambo's family had just moved back.  He had just moved back with his family and his kids.  They had all moved back from the UK [United Kingdom].  So Dali [Tambo] was there.  His sisters were there.  I remember when we went to their house, Dali was there and the sisters were there.  And it was just like we went there for dinner.
Speaker 1: So, so it--was the relationship basically forged with the conversations with Dali Tambo?
Speaker 2: That was the first conversation that I remember.  There was another guy who actually invited us to be a part of the E of what--the new television station that was really the impetus for us going in October [1992], to work with this group of business people who were coming together to do a television station.
Story_ID: 155920
Speaker 1: Well, well tell us about the development of the station and, and how--and your role I guess in that.
Speaker 2: In World African Network?
Speaker 1: And what, what, what, what role you, you played in it.
Speaker 2: My role in the--in the development of the World African Network was programming, was looking at--working with the team--the sales team who was--who was overseeing the acquisitions of programming.  Because we were licensing programs at very low fees because we didn't have a lot of money to show programs that, say, may have been in--seen in--seen in Germany or seen France or seen in the DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo].  We were looking at things that have been (unclear) every year.  I mean, one of the most I remember moving programs that I ever saw was a special that was produced about Curtis Mayfield.  And it was produced in German by Germans who were probably mixed with African.  You know, they were of African descent, but mixed with German.  And it was the most moving piece of Curtis Mayfield--about his--piece about--a documentary about Curtis Mayfield--I mean moving to tears.  And the idea of bringing something like that--who had been produced from this other perspective--to--for us, for African Americans to see it, was just amazing to me.  Because it just showed how you--we were all connected.  We were all connected.  And the diaspora is where we were focusing--wherever we were, whether it was the Dominican Republic or Haiti, we felt that there was just something there, a connectedness--Nigeria--that all of us.  If we put on this cable network, that African Americans--we could influence African Americans to begin to watch, to begin to learn their history, to see how we were all connected.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a--a few years ago--it was about ten years ago, a friend of my alerted me to a conference that was being held--it was--it was a--the chair was Maria Dietrich of, of one of the universities in Germany, who was an American studies professor, who teaches part time at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], you know--I mean--at--I'm sorry--at, at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]--in the--in Henry (unclear) Gates' [HM Henry Louis 'Skip' Gates, Jr.] department.  And this conference was being held in Sardinia.  It was a solid week of European and Asian scholars discussing African Americans, you know.  I mean, so--I mean, this is what, what you're tell--I mean, so we--did, did--well, did you--when you begin to understand the--I guess the impact that African Americans are having on the rest of the world during this period of time
Speaker 2: We understood that--
Speaker 1: with looking at this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(Unclear) is based on, you know, Eugene [Jackson], his perspective, Andre Hayes, who worked with us.  We understood that we were all connected.  And as we began to peel back the leaves, we even saw it more and more about how we were connected.  And there isn't a network on the air now that's even doing what was our vision.  But it was just--we just thought there just be that inkling of connection that would draw you into the story.  Even an old news story.  Say think about, you know, the "Thriller in Manila," our children now looking at that, where it took place, the significance of that fight.  You know, it's old news, but in a way it's documentary; it's information; it's something that a little boy--a little African American boy would look at and get inspiration from, not looking at the Will Smith version, but the real version of looking at footage of, you know, Muhammad Ali preparing for the fight, the things that he said.  And just, just a feeling that if we brought that all together in one place, that people would begin to watch it and grow and think about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is programming then that would increase I guess the sense of African American impact on the world or our importance in the rest of the world--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --which is something we don't really--
Speaker 2: We don't have and unfortunately, couldn't get the financing--you know, the final financing to get it on the air, and we didn't get on the air.  It's still a good idea.  I think it's still a great idea.
Story_ID: 155921
Speaker 1: And there's still programming--like, like that being--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it's all over the world.
Speaker 1: --produced around the world.
Speaker 2: It's all over the world.  And, and as you know, cable networks--it--it's like the beginning of the idea of repurposing that footage, that's what the World African Wor--African Network was in 1990 and 1991 and 1992, taking that footage and repurposing it on the World African Network.  And now that's commonplace, on the History Channel, on the Military Channel, all those channels.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But that was the idea of the network.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm reminded of this documentary about Motown I saw about the band that played behind the musicians, going to London [England] in '64 [1964].  And there are placards that--they, they know the names of the musicians (unclear) music.
Speaker 2: They know the names of the musicians.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I mean, look at the film that's out now--what, '20 Feet from Stardom' or something--the feature film that was just produced about Darlene Love and, and the background singers and the--you know, how they--you know, that kind of movie would be on, you know, this network that we had conceived.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the world having a different perspective on what we're actually doing.
Speaker 2: And the idea was not only to inform our children but inform all people--people of col--not only just people of color but other people, to see ourselves as we should be seen or could--you know, in a new way.
Story_ID: 155922
Speaker 1: As the World African Network really just kind of hits a wall here, it's not able to really get started the way it should, you, you decide at a certain point I guess to move to South Africa, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, what happened was by then we decided to go over for the--Nelson Mandela's inauguration, again, took the family--it was the first time we stayed at our home in Johannesburg [South Africa]--and went over for Nelson Mandela's swearing in.
Speaker 1: Now this is in ninety--
Speaker 2: Ninety-four [1994].
Speaker 1: --four, okay.
Speaker 2: It's '94 [1994], right, when he was sworn in as president?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.  I'm--I know it's '94 [1994], '95 [1995] or--
Speaker 2: It was not '95 [1995].
Speaker 1: --the election--
Speaker 2: It had to be '94 [1994].
Speaker 1: Okay, had to be '94 [1994], okay.
Speaker 2: It was '94 [1994].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we went to the park.  We, we, we had our own little family delegation, drove to the union buildings, if you will.  We were part of the masses down in the park, and we spent the day there with the kids watching Nelson Mandela be sworn in.  Our parents went.  Both of our parents went.  I'll never forget it was Mother's Day, so it was a great Mother's Day.  Our mother's were there.  We're--you know, Nelson Mandela's inauguration.  It was just an amazing time.
Story_ID: 155923
Speaker 1: What are you feeling about South African society in, in those days?  I mean, a-about the--you know, it must, must have been exciting being there.
Speaker 2: It was very exciting, but I wasn't a person who had studied African history.  I never took an African American history class, so I didn't know a lot.  To me it was like all new.  At that point, people were very cautious because people were still afraid, especially whites, were still afraid to like be out at night.  Like, when I first went, I remember strange women saying to me, you know you shouldn't be wearing your jewelry, you know, 'cause somebody will take it.  You know, they started making you self-conscious and aware of the crime.  And there was.  So there was the fear of not knowing what was gonna happen.  In our first trip in '92 [1992], we went looking for homes, and there were a lot of people moving.  And we said, well, why are people moving, and it was like a--kind of like a little bit of white flight, where white people (unclear) whites--South Africans were moving down to Cape Town [South Africa] 'cause they were a little unsure what was gonna happen in Johannesburg [South Africa].  And you can see the evolution of the country over time.  You know, there were things like: one of the security issues was at night, to not stop at a light, like a red light.  If you'd stop at a red light, you'd only stop to go through the light.  You wouldn't sit at a red light for fear that something was gonna happen.  So there was an underlying of fear that people had at that time.  South Africa was a little bit sleepy.  It was very isolated from the rest of the world, and it protected even the children.  One of the things I learned as a mother: once we put our children in school--was a lot of things that had happened to kids here in the United States like drugs or--hadn't really had an opportunity to go into South African youth society, if you will.  Because of apartheid it was isolated, which was really interesting, to realize that, that it was like that--
Story_ID: 155924
Speaker 1: But anyway, back to 1994, we were kind of still going back and forth consulting with the team who was trying to put together the television station.  We didn't win the bid, but in the meantime Gene [Eugene Jackson] started another company called Afrotel, which was a cellular telephone company.  And then in 1998, we decided to move over full time, and put the children in school.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this was the beginning of the cell--cell phone.
Speaker 1: That was the beginning of the cell--
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --phone business in South Africa, and that was his first business, because he had been involved at a cell phone company in Detroit [Michigan] here in the U.S. [United States]
Speaker 2: Now this is the first cell phone--one of the first cell phone company owned by someone of African descent in South Africa, right?
Speaker 1: Probably.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Probably.
Speaker 2: All right (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm thinking (laughter).  Probably--I mean, he'd have to confirm that.  Somebody else would have to confirm that, but probably.  Because his partner was South African, and the partner--Mark Headbush was his partner and got to know us.  He was one of the businessmen that was involved in the--trying to get the television (unclear).  And Gene gave--he said, "try to get a cell phone license; we should be in the cell phone business because that's the business that's gonna take off."
Speaker 2: Now this is Mark--what's his last--
Speaker 1: Mark Headbush; he's South African.
Speaker 2: Headbush, okay--H-E-A-D--
Speaker 1: B-U-S-H.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In fact, his picture is in the picture with Nelson Mandela.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he was on that trip with us in 1992.  So the first company they started together was a company called Afrotel, which was an African American cell phone company or black cell phone company.  In fact, Hugh Masekela--I mean, a lot of the black people in South Africa got their phones from us because it was the black cellular telephone company.  I remember seeing Hugh Masekela and coming into the office to get his phone, 'cause it was black owned.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, and he had spent many years in exile, and he, he was back.
Speaker 1: He was back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause a lot of people came back.  Letta M'Bulu came back with her husband.  You know, people came back.
Speaker 2: Caiphus Semenya.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know.  So, all right, so you got--so South Africa's revving up and so, so you move there in '98 [1998].  Was, was Afrotel started be--before '98 [1998]?
Speaker 1: Nah, Afrotel was started probably in '94 [1994].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so you got business when you still--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The business--it was--the idea was to get the business going and then go over.  So Afrotel was probably started in '94 [1994], '95 [1995], something like that.
Speaker 2: Okay. What, what were--I know you said ear--I think when--in a pre--the previous interview or during one of the breaks preparing for the interview--
Speaker 1: I wanna correct that.  It was probably '96 [1996].
Story_ID: 155925
Speaker 1: You were saying that there were business opportunities that African Americans had thought they were gonna be a part of but were not once they got there.
Speaker 2: After we began to move and spend more time in South Africa, the first South Africans that really came over were ones--well, first of all  [HM] Charlayne [Hunter-Gault] and her husband [HM Ronald T. Gault]--but people that came to work for other companies.   Like, Georgia Powell sent over people to work for ESCOM [Electricity Supply Company of Malawi].  McDonald's sent people over to work for--to start McDonald's in South Africa.  And all of those people worked for the company.  They were working as--I don't know the proper business term for it, but they were--they went and they took their families.  And their families--the children went to the American school.  So they were kind of--the idea was that they'd work there for a certain (unclear) of time, and then they were gonna leave.  Our family did not go over to work for a corporation.  We went over there to start our own businesses.  And my idea was to put my children in South African schools.  If I was going to go live in South Africa, I wanted my children ensconced in South African culture so we put them in South African schools, which was an adjustment for them.  And the reason it was an adjustment is because education in South Africa is highly regarded, and there's a different expectation in terms of study and study habits.  The--they had to study for exams.  For example, over here they'd study for exams.  Over there you have to really study for exams, because exams are not multiple choice, if you will; they are written exams.  So instead of asking you what the capital of Nigeria is, and giving you multiple choice, you had to say what the capital was.  And that requires more studying than multiple choice, when something kind of looks familiar and you kind of guess.  And it was a big, big difference.  They had to become students, and as a result, they have--they are very knowledgeable.  They had to learn information, and they were actually pretty good students.
Speaker 1: Okay, I never thought about the student that gets a multiple choice until now (laughter).
Speaker 2: It's a big, big difference.  I mean, they'd have exams that were like two hours, and points get bid--get graded according to the fact being there in the essay.  It's like not that multiple choice and then one essay question.  The whole exam is essay.
Speaker 1: So all the facts had to be in that--
Speaker 2: All the facts--
Speaker 1: --in that text.
Speaker 2: --have to be in the question.
Speaker 1: And it has to be well written.
Speaker 2: And it has to be well written, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was an adjustment for them.
Speaker 1: So how, how did they adjust to it?
Speaker 2: They adjusted well.  They appreciated the education.  I appreciated the education that they got.  And one of the greatest things was the difference in cost.  For a highly priced education in South African terms was one-fifth of what it would have cost here.  For example, the American school in South Africa was eighteen thousand dollars a year.  The private education that my children had while in [South African] Rand terms it was thirty thousand grand a year; it was probably four or five thousand dollars a year.  It was that significant a difference.
Speaker 1: So what you're saying is that they got a better education for less money.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And also an acculturation in the South African culture--
Speaker 2: Yes, my children--
Speaker 1: --you just--
Speaker 2: --were highly, highly submerged in South African culture.  I purposely did not bring them to the United States for two years--two or three years, because I wanted that to be home.  I didn't want them to have this feeling of going back to America, becoming reacquainted with their friends, and being torn.  That I purposely did not--I mean, they didn't leave until '92 [1992].  We went there in '90 [1990]--well, no, that's not right.  They didn't leave--we didn't come on a vacation until '90--probably 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they went in '98 [1998]--2000, 2001, something like that.
Speaker 1: And by this time you have like, how many children?
Speaker 2: We had four living there full time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 155926
Speaker 1: What was the business story?
Speaker 2: The business story is, is mixed.  We actually had friends that went over and worked for us--with us.  A friend of mine, Betty LaMarr, went to work for us and had that international experience.  The business--the way business is done in South Africa is different.  There are things that we didn't expect and weren't prepared for.  There are cultural differences.  There's much more security required, if you will.  Because of the difference in the economics, there's much more theft, if you will.  Cell phones were stolen out of stock, you know, things that we just totally were not prepared for.  I remember taking--I had an IBM computer, and I remember taking it IBM to be repaired.  And I had to go through like three screenings to take my own computer in and get my own computer out.  We didn't have those kinds of systems in place, because we didn't understand that whether it's somebody that works for the company or even security, people--there's a culture.  Hugh Masekela told me about it years later that I didn't understand when we first went over there.  He said that because black South Africans were so lowly paid, people looked for jobs where they could enrich themselves from the job, if you will.  So there was a lot of concern about petty theft.  I mean, I feel as if I'm, I'm, I'm telling things that aren't really good about South Africa.
Speaker 1: This is true--
Speaker 2: There's a lot of good--
Speaker 1: --for this country too, you know, I--people that have jobs in department stores or anywhere where there's a--resources.  I mean, I know it from growing up that there was a--you know, a lot of times pe--people would--in fact, it was thought that employers, somehow they knew that a certain amount of material is gonna taken.
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's funny you would say that because one of the things that I remember from the World African Network days was, you know, people padded there expense accounts.  Well, I didn't want our employees to pad their expense accounts, so I was very careful monitoring the expense account.  But if I think about the corporate side and NBC [National Broadcasting Company] side, those ex--I--it was like commonly understood that people padded their expense accounts.  But for me, on the World African Network side, you know, we're a small company and I didn't expect to pad their expense accounts.  As an example--and I don't think our people did because we watched it carefully.  Going over to South Africa, we didn't understand that people padded their income, if you will, especially--and it's, it's just some--it's really something that caught us off guard, in terms of owning a company in South Africa.  We just weren't careful in that way.  We weren't accustomed to operating like that, and it really caught us off guard and hurt the company.  And there were several companies.  We owned dairy cows, we had a milk cows, we had farms, and across the board, there were little ways that things were missing.  We just weren't ready for that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there--there's a cultural way of operating, and I, I guess--this is also I guess a way of the oppressed relating to the oppressor, I guess like if we read, read slave narratives and (unclear) read the same kind of thing.
Speaker 2: And what happens with South Africa, it looks like that.  It looks like the United States, but it is culturally in many ways a third world country.  So what happened, as the Americans began to go home and the corporations and some of them wanted to stay, what they found was that they couldn't get jobs.  And the reasons they couldn't get jobs is because South Africans wanted to employ South Africans.  That to them was black empowerment.  They felt that African Americans had had their opportunity and done well over here.  And if there was a job, black empowerment to them was giving that job to a black South African.  They were empowering the black South African.  So for many of them that even wanted to stay, they ended up coming home.  The way to stay in South Africa was you had to own your own business.  The people who started a--say a bed and breakfast--there's a woman who started teaching at Wits [University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa], which is the university there.  You had to figure out a way that you were going to--you had to figure out the system, how to survive.  There are some families that are still left, but not compared to the ones that were there before.  There was at least three or four hundred families back in the early '90s [1990s] and, you know, 2000.  I don't know how many families there are, but a lot of people have left--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --come back.
Story_ID: 155927
Speaker 1: Now, why do African American men like South Africa so much?
Speaker 2: First of all, African Americans like South Africa.  It--it's an amazing feeling to be in the majority.  It's an amazing feeling to have that level of access.  And what I observed as a woman or person was how much African American men like that environment.  Like, I heard--especially in the first group--where their wives were more tied to, "We wanna get back to our family," you know, taking-- sending their kids home for the summer to be connected over here.  And the men really loved and enjoyed the access that they had in South Africa to ministers, to heads of organizations, even to the president, and to the vice president.  It's just a level of access over there that we don't experience here.  It's a smaller environment to move around in.  And business is done more leisurely; it's done socially, and then everybody plays golf (laughter), so--and also the business hours.  The business hours are nine to five.  You know, the play golf a couple of times a week.  It's just a lifestyle and a life that is very appealing and very empowering.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause the model here is like work until you can't work any longer.
Speaker 2: The model there is not that.  The model there is: weekends with your family, time with your family, holidays with your family.  Right now today is December 16th [2013].  Probably starting last week, the country is shut down, and it will not go back to work until the middle to the end of January.  You cannot get any work done.  A friend of mine recently went over.  In fact, he's somebody that you [The HistoryMakers] should interview.  His name is Tim Scott.  He's head of IBM, and he was going over two years ago to head IBM Africa and the Middle East.  And he was going over, and I said, "Well Tim, you should plan to take your children on--your family on vacation for Christmas"--like, "Oh no, it's the end of the year; we have to make our numbers."  I'm like, "Tim, I'm telling you, there's nobody gonna be working the last three weeks of December."  He had to ultimately take his family on vacation 'cause there's nobody for you to even do business with.  Everybody's on holiday.  I am so thankful for the amount of time that I got to spend with my children and family time during that time there.  It just makes you look at life differently, in terms of how significant your time is with your family and friends.  And everybody is leisuring.
Story_ID: 155928
Speaker 1: You gotta deal with institout--almost some endemic kind of petty corruption, you know, that kind of erodes what you're doing businesswise.  Do you think that's the most significant factor in the businesses really not doing what they, they could have done.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, I do.  Because it's not just petty; it goes all the way up; it goes all the way up.  It really does.  It's, it's challenging to do business in South Africa.  You have to understand culturally how it works.  And everything is not as it seems.
Speaker 1: For example?
Speaker 2: Well, the way they applied laws for example, things that you wouldn't even consider doing in the United States.  You know, you hear on the--on the news now, the--you know, they talk about corruption and the challenges their having, and the fact that money is not filtering down to the masses and; you know, their disappointed with the infrastructure and the people that are still living in poverty with no running water and things like that.  And there have been, you know, government officials who have been involved deals quietly and favored certain deals because they were a silent partner and things like that.  All of that is stuff--are, are not what we ex--you expect going into a country.  You just--because you're accustomed to how business is done in the United States, so anybody who's considering going and doing business out--it's like you should go there, you should work in the environment, you should study the environment before you invest; you really should.
Speaker 1: Now there's--you know, coming from Chicago [Illinois], I've been here so long that we know that, you know, corruption exists in America--politics and bis--businesses too, but what is the difference? Is it--is it a difference that, that pe--people are not prosecuting these things?  Is--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's less--
Speaker 1: --is, is it the prosecution--
Speaker 2: --there's much less prosecution.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Much less prosecution.  And also there's tribalism.  There's tribalism.  I think there was some of that spoken about even in terms of, you know, Nelson Mandela's family, that some tribes felt they were slighted, that it should have been more--elements should have been more embracing the multu--multicultural--you know, there's a tribalism.  And us, African Americans, we're all African Americans; we're all in the same tribe.  Well, over there, there's, you know, different tribes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's a, a different level of, of distinction, even amongst--
Speaker 2: Even among--
Speaker 1: --black South Africans.
Speaker 2: --the Afri--even among the black South Africans--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and even among the Afrikaners and the British and the--you know, it's, it's all these different things that you just don't even understand how it all works.
Speaker 1: So South African society hasn't really fully integrated itself, in terms of the different--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --elements.
Speaker 2: --even the question that you're asking, you're asking from an American perspective, okay?  That's their perspective; that's how they operate.  And what we take is our American perspective and expect it to operate the way we're accustomed to.  What you have to do is go there and understand how it operates and to begin to do business in the way you want to and the way your business interacts with the culture at large.  There was another organization that I was involved with called the Links.  The Links wanted a chapter established in South Africa.  We established a [The] Links [Incorporated] chapter in South Africa.  There was a chapter in Durbin [South Africa], there was a chapter in Los Angeles [California]--I mean in Johannesburg [South Africa], and I--there was going to be a, a group in Cape Town [South Africa], but I can't remember exactly how far along they got.  And culturally, over time--even though twenty-seven of us were sworn in as Links in South Africa and a significant--say ten Americans that were living there, ten African American women that were living there with their husbands doing business there who were coming back--culturally it didn't work, because South African said--you know, we met on Sundays--I can't justify to my husband why I'm not with my family today, as opposed to sitting in a meeting with the Links.  And over time, the organization kind of disappeared.  One by one the members lost.  I was the last member to resign, and we closed the chapter.  Because, again, it was the American culture of the Links and the expectation of how we would operate as an organization.  The Links went over there and built schools.  We interacted with the schools; in fact, there's a school that I--that I still support that's over there.  And they had this wonderful experience of building schools in South Africa.  But once they built them, then you don't have anything to do with them.  You just leave them.  But the organization itself, it just didn't work.  Culturally, it just was a bad fit.  So it's, it's not only business; it's social; it's different.
Story_ID: 155929
Speaker 1: Some of these sultural--these cultural distinctions you're describing, are they--do you--did--do you have a sense that they're indigenous African social mores or are they from the Boers and the British?
Speaker 2: No, it's just culture.  It's just culture.  We live an African American culture.  We live an Afri--we live in white culture.  We live an American culture.  And as you know, you understand the differences of all of those different cultures.  If you talk about the general culture of America and then you talk about the African American culture, if you talk about the Chinese culture--okay, so here we go as African Americans to South Africa and trying to figure out their culture.  And there's just subtleties of culture.  Another example is my children, because they were residents of South Africa, had to take an African language.  And when they first started taking the language, they took the language from a white teacher at school.  But as you learn more of the language, there are subtleties of the culture and the language that the white teacher, who had learned how to speak the language, couldn't teach my children.  I had to find a black South African teacher to begin to take over their studies, because they were just intonations and words that this white teacher didn't even understand to teach my children.  That's what--kind of what I'm talk--that's an example of what I'm talking about.  There's just subtleties in culture that can't be taught.
Story_ID: 155930
Speaker 1: What group were you the closest to, in terms of the indigenous African groups?  Or could you--can you say?
Speaker 2: You know, my friends are diverse.  My friends are diverse.  At--my, my--it's more social economic education.  The same way I would--same way I would become more comfortable with, like, women.  Like, I'd find a woman like [HM] Karen Hill-Scott in South Africa.  You know, she's educated; she's traveled all over the world; she's interested in children.  It has more to do to that.  Now whether she's Xhosa or Zulu or--you know, it doesn't make any difference.  It's those kind of things that are the basis.  So I have friends that are, you know, Zulu; I have friends that are Coloured; I have friends--you know, I'm not even sure what their heritage is.

Speaker 1: Well but from 2003 to 2004, you served as a producer for 'Scout's Safari,' right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  What happened is that I had been invited by the SABC [South African Broadcasting Association] to come and work with them.  You know, you meet the chairman of the SABC and they hear your background.  They say, "Come work for us; we need your skills."  But then you go for the interview, and everybody knows your skills, and you don't get called back, right?  So that happened several times, where you see--you know, from a higher level they want you involved, but then there are these roadblocks that no one ever really gets back to you on that prevents you from going and getting a job.  So what I began to do was small projects.  I did eve--I started doing events, working with a woman from Nigeria and a woman from South Africa, and we did cultural events.  We did--
Speaker 1: Now, now is this af--af--after the demise of, of the activities, I mean, your, your business activities?  Or, or were they still--
Speaker 2: Yes.  I really wasn't directly involved in Afrotel--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because that's the other thing, the other challenge of living in South Africa.  At that time--again, because of its isolation, South Africa was more like the '50s [1950s] in South Africa.  There were no childcare facilities for working mothers, so most of the mothers that I worked with--I mean, my children went to school with, most of those mothers didn't work.  And the ones that did, their kids kind of just hung around school until their parents picked them up.  So my primary responsibility was overseeing the household and the children, driving the driven back and forth to school.  I really wasn't working.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And because we were living on a farm--which is another whole story.  We were living on a farm outside of Pretoria [South Africa].  It was a thirty, forty minute drive from the farm into town taking the children--you know, going to their activities.  And the schools are set up differently.  Schools in South Africa are half-day, if you will.  Their education is from eight o'clock in the morning until one; the kids have lunch; and then they're expected to participate in two sports and a club.  So I had four kids that were participating each in two different sports; you know, tutoring in African languages; and I was just all over the place with these kids, so I really didn't have time to work.  So I wasn't really, really working at that point.  I wasn't directly involved in, in Afrotel.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, so you started at I guess around 2003 or so you--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Before that I was doing events.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, 'cause I could do events.  And then 'Scout's Safari' was going to be on NBC.  Again, [HM] Karen Hill-Scott had made me aware of the show.  [Thomas W.] Tommy Lynch was a producer, who I had not met, who came into the industry after I'd left.  And I called my friend, Haim Saban, who actually I now work for, and said, "I'd like to work on that show.  Do you know Tommy Lynch?  Would you recommend me?"  And I started working as a producer, and the reason I worked as a producer, we were looking for South African writers who were familiar with the culture.  Because the concept of the show was a white female girl had gone to South Africa to live, and that was the basically the story.  She went to live with her mother in South Africa, so it was the mixture of the white American culture living in South Africa, and, and the adjustment of living in a foreign country and getting to know the culture.  So there was that cultural piece of 'Scout's Safari.'
Speaker 1: Okay, now I don't know if you remember this show, but I, I saw a show [sic, movie, 'The Color of Friendship'] produced for Disney about [HM Ronald] Ron Dellum's family hosting a South African exchange student.
Speaker 2: I never saw that.
Speaker 1: I think it was a white, white exchange student from South, South Africa, but it, it remind--it was around that late '90s [1990s] period--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I never saw that.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, all right, all right, well--
Speaker 2: No, but that was the concept, so I was more--and it was interesting.  The white--the black South African actors relied on me to make sure that they were getting treated in a way that wasn't stereotypical, if you will.  Because, again, these are producers from the United States who are going to South Africa with a stereotype of what black South African actors is like, life is like, et cetera.  So I was the one who's--who had been there a significant amount of time to understand where South Africa was in terms of culture and how even I, with my own sensibilities, would like to see it portrayed on sha--on a network show that was going to be shown around the world.  So things like costuming and, and behavior and how they speak and then recommending writers; so that was my role.  We did it for two seasons and got nominated for an Emmy.
Story_ID: 155932
Speaker 1: So what did you do next in South Africa?
Speaker 2: Probably did--I did some more events, and we did--one event was the first World AIDS Day [the first World AIDS Day was celebrated in 1988], which was a very--we did that, though that's a little bit back, probably in 19--either '99 [1999] or--probably '99 [1999] or 2000, where we had an event with President [Thabo] Mbeki celebrating the first World AIDS Day.  We did a big event.  And there was a organization that we were involved in called Zenzele [Development Organization].  And Zenzele was an organization that started on a trip when my cousin, Darryl--Dr. Darryl Scott [ph.], traveled with us to South Africa and met another black South African doctor, and they talked about getting together and having African American doctors travel to South Africa to teach and study and treat patients.  And those doctors came over to talk about AIDS and our--came over for our World AIDS Day, our first South African tribute to AIDS for--you know, December, December 1st is World AIDS Day, so we did a big event for that day.  So basically I spent the rest of the time working at some events and then trying to get a production company started.  I made a few attempts at working with Lebo M [Lebohang Morake], who is the writer who worked with Hans Zimmer on music for the 'Lion King.'  We talked about a production company that kind of really didn't work out.  I thought about going to work for SABC [South African Broadcasting Company] but ran into those roadblocks where, you know, they wanted to hire a South African.  So then in 2010--well, what--my children started going to college; my household was getting smaller; and I began to think about returning to the U.S. [United States] and working just so I could work.
Story_ID: 155933
Speaker 1: It says here that you began serving as special projects consultant executive at the Hub in Burbank [California].
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Hub was a brand new network, and a friend of mine, Margaret Leosch, she was the new chairman.  It was a new cable network that hadn't launched, and I spoke to her and I said, "Margaret, I'm thinking about coming back, and with your new network, is there a role I can play?"  And after we talked, she said, "yeah, I think there is," so I came back in July [2010].  And I remember it very significantly, 'cause the World Cup was going on at that time and I had to leave 'cause I wouldn't have been able to get out of the country 'cause there were no seats.  And I came back for a three-month--I took the risk for three months--came to Los Angeles [California] for three months to get back, and three months led to another six months--led to another nine months.  And what was fascinating is how the industry had changed.  Now everything's done on computer.  Luckily, I had kept my computer skills current.  Everything's digitized; everything's dittal--digital.  All the assets were housed in--on servers in Silver Spring, Maryland.  And it was just so different.  I mean, I was accustomed to an office with, you know, a VCR machines and television monitors, and now everybody is looking at a computer.  I mean, it was the biggest--I mean, the attorneys--everybody--business affairs.  There was no television in anybody's office.  Everybody was looking at the computer, and I just remember thinking wow, things have really, really changed.  Plus downloading--downloading assets and things like that, it was just a whirlwind of new information and technology.
Speaker 1: So was it--was business being conducted differently than in South Africa when you left it?  I mean, was, was South Africa still doing what was going on here when you left?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure I understand the question.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, things were different when you got back, but were they--
Speaker 2: Got back to sou--got back to the U.S. [United States]?
Speaker 1: The--yes, we're they vastly different from what was going on in South Africa when you left--when you left--the time you left, in terms of computers and other--
Speaker 2: I can't--I really can't say for South Afr--I really don't think South Africa is operating with the same technology based on what I was exposed to.  It's probably still a little bit behind.  This is the most advanced.  This is cutting edge.  South Africa's probably on its way.  I didn't have a lot of exposure to that in the more recent years.  I don't really know for sure, but I do know that when I was at the SABC [South African Broadcasting Company] they were working on computers, but it's just different.  It's just not quite the same.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Just based on the fact that I worked for the Hub.  The Hub is owned by Discovery.  Discovery was in Maryland, so their company model is that all those assets are held in Maryland.  SABC is not big enough to do that.  It would all be held at SABC, so it's like comparing apples and oranges, really.
Story_ID: 155934
Speaker 1: Now you were program executive for a program called the 'Secret Mill--Millionaires Club?'
Speaker 2: Yes, that's a show that--Warren Buffett wanted to go--want--was interested in a show that was pitched to him about teaching kids about personal finance, and I was interested in that.  So Warren Buffett had name and, you know, creates the buzz about the show.  But the idea is to teach children about business and finance, and Warren Buffett is the character in animated form, and he did the voice recordings actually for the first few shows about finance.  And the cameos were like Jay-Z and Beyonce and Alicia Keys I think and Shaq [Shaquille O'Neal] as a ca--as a--as--they did cameos for the show.  But Warren Buffett--the show is really built about Warren Buffett.
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear).  So this is an animated--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's animated.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It's animated.  And again, the technology.  Warren Buffett is sitting in a studio in Omaha [Nebraska]--Omaha, right--yeah, Omaha--and we're recording in Burbank [California], and he's saying his line, doing a good job.
Speaker 1: I'm gone have to look this up (laughter).  It just seems the--this, this unique, you know, Warren Buffett and Shaq, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: --financial responsibility for kids being taught--
Speaker 2: Yep--
Speaker 1: --secret--
Speaker 2: --it's on the air now.
Speaker 1: --'Secret Millionaire's Club.'
Speaker 2: It's called the se-'Secret Millionaires Club.'
Speaker 1: Now what's the significance of the name, in terms of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, Warren Buffett is the secret millionaire.  You know, it's teaching children about money and, and investing and being careful.  We--I was at--involved at the--at the stage when it was ser--when it was a special and it was beginning to evolve into a series.  And after we did about the first, say, six episodes, that's when I transitioned and began working at Saban Brands.
Story_ID: 155935
Speaker 1: 'Secret Millionaires Club' kept, kept you busy through 2011?
Speaker 2: It kept me busy plus I was also working with broadcast standards.  That was another thing that had significantly changed.  The children--Children's Television Act had significantly changed, in terms of the requirements by the F.C.C. [Federal Communications Commission].  Before I left children's programming, I remember going to Washington [D.C.] to testify about 'Saved by the Bell' and having it as an example of positive role models for children, positive storytelling for children, stories with a message, if you will.  After I left in 19--I left the children's programming industry, if you will, and while I was still working at World African Network, there was something called the Children's Television Act that was pay--pay--passed in 1990 that said televisions stations should have educational informational programs for kids for three hours.  And again, I--when I was at the Hub, I was working with broadcast standards getting up to speed on the new laws and how things had changed and broadcast standards, which is something I had never been involved in before.  But be--when I was working at the Hub, I began working with broadcast standards and learning all the new laws and how they were applied to children's programming, which gave me the background, if you will, to make the transition to Saban Brands as vice president of broadcast standards and practices.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: So you can see, this is like--it's almost like a God plan.  'Cause that was an area that I had a department that did that for us.  I was involved in programming, so a part of working with Margaret [Loesch] at the Hub was getting involved in broadcast standards and applying these new rules, and then a job came two years later.  So I'm really just a very lucky woman.
Speaker 1: You, you--do you have any thoughts about the changes in broadcast standards as, as opposed to when you were, you know, producing for NBC [National Broadcasting Company] back in the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't have the educational requirements.  We didn't have the edu--the--in fact, the educational requirement is something that--as a person who majored in child development--I think it's positive.  And I think the reason they created the law was that people wanted to apply things or get credit for shows that really were applicable.  So they made the laws a little more strict, and that's why shows like the 'The Secret Millionaires Club' and those things get done.  I think television can have a very significant contribution to children in terms information.  The challenge is how to present it in a way that's entertaining and can hold their, their attention.  And if creative producers and writers are serious about it, they can figure out a way to do it.  At--but it's much more challenging than just, you know, an entertainment show.
Story_ID: 155936
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's talk about Saban Brands.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, what were your responsibilities there?
Speaker 2: I am responsible for broadcast standards, which is the legal--all shows have to be reviewed for broadcast standards to make sure that they are--they have diversity, the characters aren't presented in a negative stereotype, that characters are not presenting violence, that they're not using certain words, that they don't frighten children, that they don't promote a product for example.  Because, as you know, showing a product to a child could influence him wanting to buy a cereal.  Like, you couldn't have a character sitting and having breakfast and showing a box of Wheaties.  That has to be taken out, because it can be seen as a commercial.  So that's what my responsibility is, and now that segwayed a little bit into the Internet, to commercials.  So someone is always looking to make sure that the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] rules and the Federal Trade Commission rules are followed for children's programming.  And there're different rules for children's programming, because children can be influenced to do certain things than they are when they're above children--so for adult programming.
Story_ID: 155937
Speaker 1: Are there, there, there any stories about your work at Saban Brands and--I mean, in terms of a for instance?
Speaker 2: Well, it was my first time working with the 'Power Rangers.'  I hadn't worked with the 'Power Rangers' before because the 'Power Rangers' were at Fox.  So this is my first time dealing directly with the 'Power Rangers.'  And because I've known Haim Saban thirty years, it just brought back memories for me because I remember the day he called me and said, "What's Aisha's name?  How do you spell it?"  She became a Power Ranger (laughter).  The first African American Power Ranger is named after my daughter Aisha [Jackson].  So working with Saban [Brands], I have all these memories that are coming back about things that I did.  It's just lots of very fond memories about children's programming.  A lot of the people that I work with now, you know, grew up on programs that I did that they loved, like the 'Gummi Bears' or the 'Snorks' or the 'Smurfs' or the 'Chipmunks' ['Alvin and the Chipmunks'].  You know, it's shows that for them, as kids, they just absolutely love.  So that's--it's heartwarming for me to see that programs that I was responsible for and had the responsibility of getting on the air, that there was a significance in their lives.  That's to me really, really rewarding.
Story_ID: 155938
Speaker 1: Now is there anything today that you are working on beyond the job, you know, I mean some, some, some project that you envisioned that you--some goal that you have--that you wanna, you know, accomplish, you know, in the future?
Speaker 2: You know, it's always been my dream--and I haven't accomplished it yet, and I'm not even saying it's a goal if I haven't given up on the dream, but I'm hoping maybe somebody take sit up--the dream of having a children's programming, per--probably animated, that incorporates African and African American and African from diaspora culture, whether it's taking those stories and creating a show that appeals to all the children in the world that takes advantage of many of those cultural stories.  That would be my dream--and it's been my dream for a number of--you know, since I was in my twenties probably--is to create that show.  I did it in many shows.  I did it with the 'Smurfs;' I did it with the 'Chipmunks' ['Alvin and the Chipmunks']; I did it with 'Saved by the Bell.'  But to do that for an--for an African perspective, from something from the diaspora, that would--if I'd achieve that, I would just feel like I've done after that.  But I--now I have this vision.  My daughter's [Shasha Jackson] involved in film.  I said, "Maybe the next generation will do it, but to me that would just be the dream."
Speaker 1: Okay, something that would, would nip together the different--
Speaker 2: Take from culture--
Speaker 1: --diverse--
Speaker 2: --not necessarily even from a specific culture.  And I actually had a collection of folktales.  I've always--I've been collecting children's books since the '70s [1970s], but I started collecting folktales in hope that someday down the line and--or African tales or, or myths, if you will, that some way this material will be the impetus for this dream that I have.
Speaker 1: Stories like 'Anansi the Spider'.  Would that--
Speaker 2: Right, 'Anansi the Spider'--
Speaker 1: --that be the kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, and there's all--you know, every culture has them probably.  You know, 'Anansi the Spider' is from, you know, West Africa, but South Africa has their own stories.  To, to find those stories--and even when we traveled, whether it was Senegal or Ghana or Nigeria, I would go and look for those children's books to see what was there, because I believed that that is something that could be significant.  And if I could find somebody who'd be willing to invest in that, I would be--I would do it in a minute.
Story_ID: 155939
Speaker 1: Do you think it's likely in this--in this climate today, with a number of cable outlets now and the--you know, the individual productions--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I think it would be harder.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it would be harder.  It would have to be probably launched in the diaspora.  And there are obviously people with money and wealth who could do it on--in the diaspora.  You know, just like you know--I know you're familiar with the Nigerian soap operas that are done, that are showing in various countries around Africa.  I mean, the way to get it done, we might be able to do it that way first and then bring it back to a larger stage.  And once it's produced--but I can't im--there's no cable network that I could imagine putting up the money for the concept that I'm talking about now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause they could see it as two niche programming.
Speaker 1: And as we speak here today, Nigerian productions are--I mean, I think they're second only to India--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --producing fresh--
Speaker 2: What--
Speaker 1: --television kind--
Speaker 2: Right, but that's--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) films.
Speaker 2: --much less money--costs involved to produce than say animation that I'm talking about.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's Nollywood, there's Gollywood.  Is there anything comparable in the Caribbean that you know of?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  I actually thought you were gone tell me South Africa but, you know, South Africa does have a film industry.  It's a small industry, and the--some of them have won awards, but there's not very many films coming out of South Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay, they were back in the--was in, in the early '90s [1990s].  I think it was produced in the late '80s [1980s] or the-'Shaka Zulu' in South Africa it was like--it was like a magnum opus of a movie [sic, television series] of nine, ten hours.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it came on here in 1986.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It came on in 1986.
Story_ID: 155940
Speaker 1: 'Shaka Zulu' came on the air.  It was broadcast here in 1986.  I'm not sure how old it was or how long before it was on the air here it was produced.  I would imagine at least three years--three to five years.  But for here it was a significant miniseries.
Story_ID: 155941
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could?  'Cause you kind of got in and involved in this business like a lot of people that we've interviewed, you know, kind of a serendipitous way.
Speaker 2: Was there anything I'd do differently?  No, not really, not really.  I think my background and my child development background lent itself to the industry.  I think based on where NBC [National Broadcasting Company] was when I started, like number three--significant number three.  We used to say if there were four networks, we'd have been number four, we were so far behind.  And I believe that my child development background really contributed to what became a very, you know, a hit daypart.  As Grant Tinker said--Brandon [Tartikoff] too--I was the flagship of the company.  I was number one before they were number one.  So I was the first daypart to turn around and be number one.  So I wouldn't change any of it.  Even, even the primetime experience I had as a network allowed me to bring that experience to children's programming.  I did children's programming differently than anybody else had ever done it before.  It changed the industry.  It changed the storytelling.  When they said no more violence; we can't have violence in children's television, we had to replace it.  Writers had to learn to write differently.  It is that primetime experience working on 'CHiPs' and 'Little House on the Prairie' that changed my thinking and guidance of the writers and the animation industry to do more storytelling and character and morality tales.  Even my experience with 'Chico and the Man' and just I brought that experience, and it changed the industry.
Story_ID: 155942
Speaker 1: What do you consider right now to be your legacy professionally and you, you just--that's basically--
Speaker 2: That's my leg--my legacy is the 'Chipmunks' ['Alvin and the Chipmunks'], the 'Smurfs,' 'Saved by the Bell,' NBC [National Broadcasting Company] number one network, children's programming.  I, of course, am very proud of the fact that I was on the cover of Black Enterprise.  At that time, they didn't have women on the cover of Black Enterprise. I didn't--in fact, I didn't believe it.  I didn't wanna believe it until I saw it.  I was a trailblazer in the industry; I was the first African American program executive female in the industry--in the entire industry; and that I was the first vice president.  Because then, the perspective is there weren't many women, so I was the first African American woman.  And to look at what the industry has become--I'll, I'll tell you honestly, I feel like they're, they're standing on my shoulders.  I feel--and my--and myself and [HM] Winifred White [Neisser] and Suzanne De Passe--there were only a few of us at that time.  And I remember feeling it's very important to do my job and do my job well for the women that were coming after me.  I couldn't really fail.  I had to do it right, and I had to do it responsibly and just consider it's a legacy.
Speaker 1: Okay, because there's a gap between the first interview and this follow-up to finish, I told people in my hometown about you, and they were astonished that--
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: --a black woman had anything to do with the 'Smurfs'--
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--you know--I mean, it--on--and, and the 'Chipmunks' and you know.  They, they were--they were--they were astonished, and they were like--in a--in a good way, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, what's happened is it's been such a long time that I've (unclear) the industry, everybody who's come after us has forgotten about us.  I remember even Margaret Loesch, who's now heading Hub, when she went on her own and became a producer and then came back and started selling, because the industry--the height--most people when they're at the height of their career, you're in your mid thirties--thirties--forties--thirties--mid thirties.  And that's where we were at the height of our career.  So she was meeting and pitching people who didn't even know who she was, so it's like there's a whole new group of people have grown up, and they have no idea who you were and what you did and what you contributed.  And when I was at the Hub, people had no idea.  Over time you kind of talk about what you do and then they learned, and then they're astonished, and you know, they're like looking at you.  "How could you be old enough to do that?" and you know.  That's, that's, that's my professional legacy.  My personal legacy is my children.
Story_ID: 155943
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today-- (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: My biggest--my--I have lots of concerns for the African American community today.  And in fact, it's the American society period and that is education, that education has been--it's so--it's not important.  It's not as important as it should be.  Right now in South Africa, for example, it's the end of the school year.  Parents will ask each other, "Did your child pass?"  People are really concerned about education and their children doing well.  It's the topic of conversation.  "Did your child pass?"  People here kind of just expect that their children are just gonna pass on to the next level.  I'm really concerned about our community in terms of our role models, you know; what's happened to our communities with so many of us who have attained success moved away from our communities; and our children not seeing our success and seeing us as role models I think it's a problem for our communities; I think the level of unemployment in our communities; and I think there has been a disregard of education and the importance of education, and the importance of going to school and learning, and sitting still, and learning, and understanding that that is your future of who you're gonna become and how you're gonna be able to, to succeed and become employed and take care of your family and taking care of your responsibility as an individual.  That's, that's one of my biggest concerns about our community, is that education is not important.  It's just something that you do and that parents really don't seem to really understand--understand that.
Story_ID: 155944
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.  Te--tell us about your children and what they're doing.
Speaker 2: My children?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I have five children, two boys, three girls.  And I--I'm, I'm--it was a struggle having so many, but I'm really glad I have all of them now, because I feel as if they're everywhere.  I have three that are living in Atlanta [Georgia], and I have two that are living in South Africa.  The last three that grew up in South Africa, South Africa is home for them.  I feel as if the worldwide opportunities are open to them.  They do not hesitate to get on the plane and go anywhere for business opportunities or for pleasure. And if we hadn't made that transition to South Africa, I think they would be contained in their thinking, if you will.  There--the move and growing up in South Africa has opened up their minds.  South Africans go everywhere.  They just move around the world.  My daughter has friends--a friend studying in Canada, one's studying in the UK [United Kingdom], and they just move around.  Our community here in the United States does not think like that.  Maybe the, the kids who are more privileged, going to private schools, they might think about--you know, if they have parents who are encouraging them to think about China or thinking about, you know, more globally.  But the econ--economy--the growth of the economy is global, so our children have to think that way.  And you have to be educated to do that.  So I'm just extremely proud of my children, thankful for the time that I had with them in South Africa.  Because with the busy schedule that I had, my children benefited from me slowing down.  As [HM] Karen [Hill-Scott]--Karen has a saying called: "You can have it all, but you cannot have it all at the same time."  And by the time I had my third child--I, I, considered myself superwoman before then 'cause I was able to do it all.  For fifteen years I lived on four hours sleep, 'cause that's all the time I had.  'Cause I had to do reading and scripts, and meetings, and children, and diapers.  And then the time in South Africa just really slowed down.  It's the quality of life.  People take time off with their families.  People take vacation with their families.  I spent more time with my children than I ever had before, and there should be more of that balance here in the United States.  We work ourselves to death.  Our children get weekends and some crumbs.  The pair--I, I hear some of the young women at the office feeling guilty about it.  We need to change a little bit and understand.  That's one of the reasons I stopped working in the business, was Gene [Jackson's husband, Eugene Jackson] and I were busy--so busy working, and I had like a secretary and two nannies and my parents [Vivian Scott Middleton and Philip Govan Middleton] taking care of my children.  And I'm like, if these children are gonna come out the way I want them to come out, one of us needs to stop--and it was me--working in the business to spend time with the children, 'cause if not, they start--they look like the nanny, they look like your parents.  I had to slow down, and that's why I really stopped working in the business and really started focusing on the children 'cause I had so many.

Speaker 1: Now is there anything that we haven't talked about that we need to discuss or raise before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I feel very lucky to have been with a partner who had the vision of moving to South Africa and taking my children.  My children were the greatest beneficiary of that move.  It just opened up the whole world for them that they could not have even had, even with--with the influence and the conversations we had at home, if they hadn't gone over there and lived that life.  I'm very thankful for that, even though it was rough and, you know, the family didn't make it as a whole family, the children made it.  So me as the mother, I see myself as the glue to kind of hold everything together.  To be very honest with you, I don't know if this will end up in the interview or not, but even though Gene [Eugene Jackson] and I are not together--as a family we're divorced--I feel it's important for me to be supportive of him and him to be supportive of me, because the two of us support our children.  The idea of, you know, me being mad or disappointed because the marriage didn't work, and you don't speak to the husband and whatever, I think now with families not being together that families need to get that together.  I remember having a conversation with [HM] Malcolm-Jamal Warner's mother.  I can't remember what special we were doing, but she said that's what she and her hus--she and Malcolm's father did.  They worked together to raise him, and that had a significant impact on me.  This was, you know, years ago.  Maybe--I think I was on the Cosby ['The Cosby Show'] set.  And she said, "even though we are not together, we work together to raise him.  You know, you don't fight among each other because the greater good is for the children."  And if I had anything to say to any mother or father, get over the disappointment and the marriage not working, and the relationship not married.  The most important thing you can do together is both of you--because there was good that you saw in this person at some point in your life.  Take that good and raise the chil--work together to raise the children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my children appreciate that.  They really appreciate the sacrifices that were made to give them time to grow up.
Story_ID: 155946
Speaker 1: The last question is the--similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Ma'am, how, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a mother, as a woman who love life, love children, as a giver.  My mother [Vivian Scott Middleton] is actually my role model, and family is very important, so family more than anything is important.  And if anything, my professional life, the children of America, and eventually the world, became my family.  I was in a way the matriarch of the programs that I created.  So that same sense of family and caring and nurturing, I put it into my children, but I also put it into my work.  So (unclear), I would say that's why my legacy is, and that's how I'd like to be remembered, as that same love, that same understanding of characters interacting with each other and forgiving and learning lessons.  It's the same kind of things for my children, and it's the same kind of storylines and why I have a woman like Ka--[HM] Karen Hill-Scott working as a consultant who I say, what should be the message of this storyline?  Because I can give the message I have from upbringing, and the writer would have the message, but what is the correct storyline.  Like, whose story should we be telling?  Like, one of the things that I was very uncomfortable with, and I think we talked about it in the earlier interview was the writer would have the characters coming into the girl's bedroom, and they're up there unsupervised.  And that for me, as a mother and my upbringing, just felt so uncomfortable.  But from the white culture that the writer was writing from, it was like no big deal.  In their families they did that.  I'm like, "Okay, Karen, whose style should we deal with this?"  Because that really felt uncomfortable.  Now I'm set--must say, you know, years later, five children later, I wouldn't be as uncomfortable with that because even me, as a woman, I've evolved.  My mother would be very uncomfortable with that.  But me, I've evolved.  I've learned to trust my children, trust their experiences, and they've also matured.  But for little kids, and holding that up as a role model of inpro--you know, what's appropriate, that's one of the reasons I had to have a Karen to come in and say, "Okay, how should we handle this situation?  'Cause this is making me really uncomfortable and I don't think it's appropriate."
Story_ID: 155947
Speaker 1: Okay, that is 1972, and that is me on the left my--and my mother [Vivian Scott Middleton].  My graduation from college [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Okay, what's your mother's name?
Speaker 1: Vivian Middleton.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me with Winnie Mandela, who--it was taken at [HM] Dionne Warwick's house, where she was saying, come home sister; we need you.  And that was probably in--gosh--1990--90--it was before men--[Nelson] Mandela got out, so it was probably 1990--1989 or '90 [1990].
Speaker 1: Same picture, same setting.  Luckily my mother kept these pictures.
Speaker 2: This is 1977, and this is when I became manager of variety programming.  This is when I first--this is when I was the first African American program executive.  That was 1977.
Speaker 1: What's the publication?
Speaker 2: This is an Inside NBC publication that's--that circulated to the employees.  It's an internal news line, but as you can see, that's when I manager of variety programming.  And before that, it was in research.  Tells my background.  I started as a secretary.
Story_ID: 155948
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so that's the cover.  That's when I was on the cover of Black Enterprise for their sixteenth anniversary issue.
Speaker 2: This is--was it 1986--July--August 1986.  That's myself and Joseph Barbera from the Hanna-Barbera Studios.  And we're going over the artwork for the 'Smurfs.' That's why there's Gargamel and myself and Joe--I worked very closely with Joe Barbera on the creation of the series.
Speaker 1: Is that your office?
Speaker 2: No, this is Joe Barbera's office.
Speaker 1: Okay, I noticed he got a little African sculptor back there.
Speaker 2: That's Joe Barbera's office.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: At Hanna-Barbera.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ooh-ooh--whatever.  This is a picture that was taken with the same article, the Black Enterprise article.  It's taken in NBC [National Broadcasting Company]--in the NBC Studios.  And as you can see, the 'Chipmunks' ['Alvin and the Chipmunks'] and whatever, and this is the rest of the article.  I don't know if you want that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you have--if you have any copies of the articles you can give us--see, that's a copy there.
Speaker 2: You can take this.
Speaker 1: Okay, thanks.
Speaker 2: This is--cause it's just I printed it.  My sister [Dorothy Middleton Taylor] sent it to me.  This is Essence magazine in 1985, which was before the Black Enterprise where they--actually, they shot the cover for me as well, but they didn't use the cover.
Speaker 1: This is an event here in Los Angeles [California].  The L.A. NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] honored twenty-two women of achievement, and myself and [HM] Yvonne Braithwaite Burke were the primary honorees.  And this was in 1987.
Speaker 2: This is kindergarten at 116th Street [Elementary] School [Los Angeles, California].  I don't know.  Oh, good.  This is myself, the second from the right.  And this is 116th Street School in Los Angeles--wow.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  Could you slide over there.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: In front of the camera here.
Speaker 2: Oh.  This is first grade, right?  First grade, 116th Street School.  116th Street was an interesting neighborhood.  It was a neighborhood that is just adjacent to Watts [California], but it was a middle-class neighborhood--a bit of anomaly.  The neighborhood has kind of been destroyed now, 'cause the freeway went through it.
Speaker 1: This is fifth grade at 116th Street School.  What's interesting about this school is that myself-
Speaker 2: Oh, which one is you?
Speaker 1: I am--God, where am I?  Oh, there I am at the bottom.  The--that's me down at the lower--the lower left.
Speaker 2: Third from the left, second row up.
Speaker 1: Third from the left, second row up, sorry.
Speaker 2: And this is sixth grade at 116th Street School.  And I think in hindsight, what's interesting about this neighborhood is that myself, Jheryl Busby, who was president of Motown at one time, and also [HM] Yvonne Jackson, who is one of the highest ranking women in HR [human resources] whose I'm gonna give Angel her name from Comcast.  We all grew up in the same neigh--we were all in the same neighborhood.
Speaker 1: I guess that's out of order.  That is
Speaker 2: It all gets captured in Photoshop.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: These pictures fight back.
Speaker 1: That stuff is old.  Okay, this is third grade at 116th School.  I am one, two, three, four, five, six from the left.
Speaker 2: In the top row?
Speaker 1: In the top row.  Right here, yes.
Speaker 2: This is 116th Street School--second grade.  And the interesting part about this, this still that same neighborhood, but this neigh--
Speaker 1: I am--oh yes--I am--God, where am I?  Where am I?  There I am right there in the middle.  I'm right there in the middle and, this is really funny.  Now I'm going down memory lane here.  This is 116th Street School.  A lot of our mothers were the founding members of the South Los Angeles chapter of Jack and Jill.  And right now this neighborhood kind of became that neighborhood as adults.  This woman right here, Irma [J.] Brown, she's a judge.  She lives three door--three or four doors down.  [HM] Karen [Hill-Scott] was also in that organization.  And this woman right here lives two block--two doors away--two or three blocks away.  So it's almost like the same neighborhood.  We've all grown up, had, you know, reasonable amount of success.
Speaker 2: This is my second promotion at NBC [National Broadcasting Company], when I went to primetime programming when I was manager of primetime programming--probably 1978 or '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: Wow, that is 1986, when I became vice president under children's programming--pretty sure.
Speaker 2: This is--oh, maybe that was director of children's programming.  This is the announcement--the internal announcement at NBC when I became director of children's and Project Peacock programs.  And there's [HM] Winifred White [Neisser]'s name.  Did you see it?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: You saw it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Here's Winifred's name too, or did--maybe she had one herself.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: This is a document that was circulated in the (unclear).  This is from the Hollywood Reporter when they would announce appointments.  And this was when I was Phyllis Tucker still, so that's me highlighted.  They would circu--they would do--they would do a special announcement of who was in what position in all the networks.  And it was a lot of pride for me to be on that list, actually.
Speaker 2: This is nineteen eighty cents--six [1986] when I was NBC film programming.  This is when I was doing --yes, when I was doing film--when I was doing primetime products.  This is when I was a program executive on 'CHiPs,' 'Little House on the Prairie,' 'Little Women,' and shows like that.  That's after I'd left research.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) This is 1971.  I was on 'The Dating Game.'  And I was the person who was doing the picking.  So we went to Manila [Phillipines] and Hong Kong.
Speaker 2: Again, that's the article from--God, this should have a date on it--when I was director of children's programming.  Oh, okay, that other picture I was wrong.  It was when I was director of children's programming.  This is when I first became children's programming.  That glossy that we looked at a little while ago, that's that one, so I was wrong.
Speaker 1: This is an article that probably revolves around the diversity, when we were starting to look into diversity and the importance of diversity, and talks about the conference that we had.
Story_ID: 155949
Speaker 1: I was in college trying to do a little modeling part time.  At that point, I just had one child.
Speaker 2: This is obviously a picture in the White House with President [William 'Bill'] Clinton.  I think that's during the time that we came for the state dinner for President [Nelson] Mandela.
Speaker 1: Oh, my God, this is nineteen nine--1966.  I was a debutante with the Links.  I didn't wear makeup then either, no lipstick, nothing.
Speaker 2: This is the newspaper announcement of my appointment as director of children's programming, and I was--no, it's actually not; I take that back.  This is the Jack and Jill conference for the Far West region, and I was one of the speakers, and I was also a member of Jack and Jill.  But I was a speaker at their conference.
Speaker 1: Again, this is in college.  I was modeling.  God, did that come out?
Speaker 2: The modeling career actually kind of led me to NBC [National Broadcasting Company] because I had--remember, I had been on an interview, and I got turned down for the interview 'cause they said I was too short.  And I said you know, I cannot feed my son-
Speaker 1: You look tall enough (laughter).
Speaker 2: I cannot fee--no, you had to be 5'9".  I was only like 5'5".  I said I cannot feed my son getting turned down on interviews, so that's when I went to NBC.
Speaker 1: This is Joann Curley-Kerner's children.  Joann was the producer on 'The Cosby Show,' and we were good friends, so those are her children.
Speaker 2: This is two of my children.  My--Aisha's [Jackson] on the left; this is the one that's now living in South Africa, another friend, niece Vivian, and that's Bakari [Jackson], who--you'll see when I send you the picture of President Mandela.  That's the one President Mandela's holding onto.
Speaker 1: Oh, God, that's Nye [Tucker] my son--that's my older son Nye when he was attending Claflin College in Orangeburg, South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Claflin, yeah.
Speaker 1: He went to Claflin.
Story_ID: 155950
Speaker 1: This is Lancaster, California, and my first experience in kindergarten.  And at that time, kindergarten was half-day, and there was an A.M. kindergarten and there was a P.M. kindergarten.  But when I look at this picture, and it's taken in 1953, I just wondered what happened to me in school that I would take--I'm the one who cut myself off that picture.  My mother ended up reattaching it--that what was happening to me in school psychologically that I would cut myself off the picture.  I'm the only African American in the class.  There weren't a lot in the school.  But it just made me wonder when I look at it.  Like, as a, you know, five-year-old, what was going on?
Speaker 2: Who knows when that was.  That's me.
Speaker 1: That's a nice picture.
Speaker 2: Thanks.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's my high school graduation, 1966, when I graduated from high school [George Washington Preparatory High School, Los Angeles, California].  Again, plain, no makeup (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's me as a baby.  I'm probably six months old, 1948--wow.
Speaker 1: Again, I had to be, what, a couple of months old.  That's me in 1948.
Speaker 2: That is junior high school, Henry Clay Junior High School [Los Angeles, California] here in Los Angeles [California].  That's eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Henry Clay.
Speaker 2: Henry Clay.
Speaker 1: Horrible guy.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Really?
Speaker 1: He was.
Speaker 2: That's Los Angeles, 1948--a baby with a neighbor.  I didn't--I really should have gone through these pictures.
Speaker 1: Again, that's that kindergarten picture.  You can see--I just really wonder, you know.  You don't ever know what circumstances you're putting your children in, but now, in hindsight--
Speaker 2: That's me again as a debutante with the Links, making my bow.
Speaker 1: This is Norman.  He's actually in those school pictures that I saw, you know, growing up.  He's a neighborhood friend, and he was a member of the [J.] R.O.T.C. [Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps] so we were friends.  He asked me to go to his ROTC dance.
Speaker 2: Me learning how to ride a bike in 19--probably '54 [1954].  See the cars?
Speaker 1: This is seventh grade, Henry Clay Junior High School.  Actually, that other one was probably high, now that I look at it.
Speaker 2: Again, my senior year, eleventh grade, [George] Washington [Preparatory] High School [Los Angles, California].
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-six [1966] graduation from Washington High School.
Speaker 2: Oh, this is like seventh grade, Henry Clay Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Fast and the furious right here.
Speaker 2: Yep, riding a tricycle with my friend, Michelle Moore, who actually ended up working for BET [Black Entertainment Television] as a lawyer.  I mean, this connections of us growing up.  It's like amazing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.
Speaker 2: That's me, again, that same--you see the cars?  Isn't that amazing?
Speaker 1: Look at the wheel on it.
Speaker 2: Again, that's a baby, 1948.
Speaker 1: Got that nice natural--
Speaker 2: Yep, my grandson actually looks like that now with his hair.
Speaker 1: Gosh, when is this?  This is probably, probably '82 [1982], '83 [1983]--no.
Speaker 2: I think it's a (unclear).  Is there some, some significance to this button over here?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I don't know.  No, don't use that.
Speaker 2: I can't remember what the significance is.  I can't remember when that picture was taken.
Speaker 1: Again, this is when I was manager of variety programming--tell by that look.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Did you take this one (unclear).  I can't remember when that was.
Speaker 1: That's probably tenth grade, 1964.  God, there's a lot, huh?
Speaker 2: This is when I was director of children's programming.  What happened is a lot of the African American--you know, NBC make the announcement and send the stories out over the wire services.  And then a lot of the African American newspapers around the country would pick them up.  So these are from various papers across the country.
Speaker 1: This is an article talking about me as vice president of children's programming.  It was in the New Haven Register, which is (unclear).
Speaker 2: This is the Mister T. announcement in the Santa Anna Register.
Story_ID: 155951
Speaker 1: The reason this is significant and now, it's talking about the reason we're putting on 'Bullwinkle' so adults will watch it.  That's a strategy right now behind a lot of bringing back characters like Thor and Spiderman and Superman.
Speaker 2: Or so (unclear) dialogue--in the generational dialogue.
Speaker 1: And generational dialogue but also the, the television audience or the ama--the, the movie-going audience grew up on this product.
