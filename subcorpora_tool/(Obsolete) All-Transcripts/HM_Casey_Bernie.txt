Story_ID: 475287
Speaker 1: Where we're going to start with the interview is going back as far as you can, that you have knowledge of, on your mother's side and then on your father's [Frank Casey] side, and you know, you can take us back as far as you can. First of all, let me get your date of birth and place of birth.

Speaker 1: And your place of birth?

Speaker 2: Logan, West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Logan, okay.  And how far back do you have knowledge of her family, her father, grandfather?  How far back do you have knowledge of?
Speaker 2: I wish I had a lot more knowledge, but I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I cannot go back beyond her parents, which would be my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I don't know where they're from.  I know that I would go visit them, and they were in Logan, West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, as best I understand I think my mother's mother was from Tennessee--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Let's start with your grandp- mother's grandparent, your grandparents on your--maternal grandparents.  First of all, your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Granddad [Charles Coleman] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Certainly, should have known that.
Speaker 2: You know, what I'm trying to think, my goodness.  You're asking these questions and you know what, it's a difficult bit of information to bring forth 'cause he was granddad--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --or papa, you know all those names you have.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Clearly his name is Coleman, but I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --I don't know what--
Speaker 1: Why don't we just put down Granddad Coleman--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you know later--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --you can add that.
Speaker 2: That's terrible. isn't it?
Speaker 1: And how about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Pera Lee [ph.].
Speaker 1: Pera Lee.
Speaker 2: Pera Lee Coleman.
Speaker 1: P-E-R-R--
Speaker 2: Pera Lee.
Speaker 1: Okay, one word.
Speaker 2: No, it's actually two words I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Two, two.
Speaker 2: --that they ran together all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her name was Pera Lee, and it came out Perrlee.
Speaker 1: I gotcha.
Speaker 2: You know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and on your grandfather's--
Speaker 2: That's my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes your grandmother.
Speaker 2: Now what her maiden name, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you know the date of birth or place of birth for either one (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh goodness no, no.
Story_ID: 475288
Speaker 1: Let's go to your father's side.  What was your father's name?
Speaker 2: Frank.
Speaker 1: Frank.
Speaker 2: Frank Leslie Casey [Frank Casey].
Speaker 1: And date of birth for him, or place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was from Homestead, Pennsylvania, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I would imagine he was born somewhere like in 1919 or something.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  What are your earliest--well let me ask you this, do you have any knowledge of when and how your mother [Flossie Coleman Casey] and father met?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I wish I did, but I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have any early knowledge of them growing up, either one of them?
Speaker 2: No, well--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my mother, let me think just a minute.  My mother was raised in Logan, West Virginia, and the irony of it is that my mother's sister [Blanche Coleman] married my father's brother--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and they married first, and my mother met my father through that happenstance.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, then my mother married his brother, you know what I mean, so we had two sisters who married two brothers.
Speaker 1: Two brothers, right.
Speaker 2: So, that makes us actually double cousins.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And that's why we all have the same name and people think the family, they think that we're sister and brother because we're Caseys, we're all Caseys--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but there are two Casey men--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so that's why the name is Casey, but they actually are my cousins.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You understand?
Speaker 1: Yes I do, I do.
Story_ID: 475289
Speaker 1: You grew up in Wyco, West Virginia.
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was there--my father [Frank Casey] was a coal miner, and back in those days there are a lot of small towns in West Virginia where the town is almost owned and run by the coal company--
Speaker 1: The company store.
Speaker 2: Yes, and not, they weren't very big towns, five or ten thousand people and almost all the persons worked for the mine in some capacity.  And yes, there was a company store, and I can recall very faintly that we had what we called scrip, which is a money you could go, not me, my father could go and get against his paycheck, and little coins, they call scrip, and you could spend it before he got paid, so always by the end of the week he had no money because we were forever going to get scrip and had to spend it for to live.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, and of course they charged you for that scrip.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's not like kind of a plantation circumstance.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.  What was, guessing, what do you think the population of Wyco was then?
Speaker 2: Ten thousand people or something, not a very big town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mind you we left when I was about three and moved to Columbus, Ohio--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and my father went to work in a steel mill, Buckeye Steel [Buckeye Steel Castings Company; Columbus Castings, Columbus, Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so my memories of West Virginia, we would go back sometimes in the summer, but they're somewhat faulty because I was so young--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --when we left and I could not retain a lot of those memories because I was a small kid.
Speaker 1: Let's get a sense of what the family was like.  Your siblings, did you, how many--
Speaker 2: Two, myself and my sister.  My sister is two years older than me.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your sister's name?
Speaker 2: Frankie, actually it's Franketta [Franketta Casey], named after my father.  My father's name was Frank, and they named my sister Franketta--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but everybody called her Frankie.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Franketta because--
Speaker 2: Frank with an E-T-T-A on there.
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough.
Speaker 2: Franketta.
Speaker 1: All right, and she was older than you?
Speaker 2: Two, two and a half years.
Speaker 1: Two and a half?  Around two and a half years, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) First born.
Story_ID: 475290
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories before moving to Columbus [Ohio] in Wyco [West Virginia]?
Speaker 2: I can recall we had what they call then, and they still do, a shotgun house.  You know what that is yes?
Speaker 1: Yes I do.
Speaker 2: We lived in a shotgun house, I think we were renting it from the coal company, and I recall outside toilets, outhouses.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I recall we lived up on a hill that they called Hunk Hill, and that was a bastardization of Hungarian, and they called them Hunkys.  And not a lot, but some of the Hungarians had come to that little town, and they were also coal miners, they worked in the mines.  But, in this one little settlement as the best of my recollection, we lived on Hunk Hill around these Hungarians.
Speaker 1: So, it was a mixed community.
Speaker 2: In a sense, yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In there, but--
Speaker 2: And everybody was poor.
Speaker 1: Every, everybody was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And worked for the mines, yeah.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Story_ID: 475291
Speaker 1: Do you have any sense of your mother [Flossie Coleman Casey] and father's [Frank Casey] education level?  I mean, how far did they go in school?
Speaker 2: My father, I think, went to about the eighth grade or something, and he at fourteen or thereabouts was working in the mines like a man.  My mother went to the eleventh grade, met my father, and got married.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But, she wasn't pregnant, she just wanted a better life.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so she married him and moved away from Logan [West Virginia] to Wyco [West Virginia]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --both being in West Virginia.  My father, she said he proposed to her in a letter (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: --and then she said he drove to Logan to meet her parents and he asked for her hand--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --and her father [Charles Coleman] said yes, but her mother [Pera Lee Coleman (ph.)] was not that sure of my daddy.  She went, "Well, now you gonna take care of my baby?"  You know.  My mother's family I think there were eight of them, and my father's family I think there were nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Back in those days they had a lot of kids.
Speaker 1: Absolutely, had to.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so my mother was I think in the middle somewhere, but she was very poor.  She wanted out of there, and so she married my father, and as they say, the frailty of that is she went from her father's house to my father's house.  So, she never really had a life of her own, if you understand--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --a time to be on her own.
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea of how old your mother and your father were when they got married?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother I think was eighteen and my father was twenty-seven.
Speaker 1: Okay, that frequently happened.
Story_ID: 475292
Speaker 1: During that period, you--at the age of three for you, your family picked up and decided to move to Columbus [Ohio] to make a better life?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Most certainly a different life.
Speaker 1: A different life.
Speaker 2: Seemingly, hopefully, a better one.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: In pursuit of that.  Coal mines were a tough thing to do.
Speaker 1: And the long gases and so forth.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, my father [Frank Casey] sustained--I remember this day he was using the pick to break up big pieces of coal and as he--in this repeated action he came back and the pick head went into his back.  I remember he came home and there was quite of concern about how he would fare.  And mind you all that coal dust and stuff had gone into his body.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But he was a sturdy fellow and he was back to work very soon.
Speaker 1: He survived that.
Speaker 2: Oh easily, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And you remember that because this is prior to your moving to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Columbus so that means you were like--
Speaker 2: But I don't recall it well, it's fuzzy--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --'cause I was so young.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But it's so traumatic you can sort of bring forth pieces of that memory without having a great amount of fidelity involved in it, but I remember an incident where we lived up on this hill, and one day it was raining, and the raindrops would fall off the roof, and I can recall fuzzily sticking my tongue out to catch the raindrops, and fell over the banister and fell down the hill into some brush.  And this white lady, one of the Hungarians, happened to be watching and saw it, and came running up the hill saying, "Ms. Casey [Flossie Coleman Casey], Ms. Casey, your son fell off the porch," 'cause my mother was in the back of the house, and they went down, rushed down to the bottom of, it wasn't on stilts, but it was a house, to level it out you had to have it up off the hill, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --it's on kind of a stilted front to make it level--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and, but I was okay--
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: --they tell me after that.  I had sustained no injuries or I didn't break anything and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But it was very traumatic I'm sure.
Speaker 2: Very, yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause you were three years old, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes and I fell over and tumbled over the edge of the porch.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: I remember there was a creek very near the front of our house.  Little fractured memories like that because I was so young there was no cohesiveness in the remembering process.
Speaker 1: Right, right, but--
Speaker 2: So, you recall certain instances or instant things that happen, but you can't recall a lot.
Speaker 1: Exactly, but those are the little fragments that we are trying to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Usually of trauma.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You don't forget trauma.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Story_ID: 475293
Speaker 1: I can remember when it came to hog killing time, and many of the people had hogs.
Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: And so I can remember that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They would keep them in the backyard and front yard, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, chickens.  And I can remember that at certain times of the year, I don't remember how many times, but it was hog killing time and the community would come together and they would have people do different chores.  There was a guy that would shoot the hog in the head, boom, and then there were the people would boil this huge vat of water, boiling water, and there was a guy who would hook the hog up under his chin and pull up on a pulley and raise the hog up and dip the hog in these huge tubs of water--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which made all the hair fall off the hog 'cause of the boiling water.  So, the hair fell off the hog--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then there was a guy, I assume he was a butcher of some sort, that would gut the hog and all of its entrails would fall out--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and they would take them, and they would take the hog intestines, which we called chitlins--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that we all ate.  They'd walk down to the stream and clean the feces and fat out of and off of the intestines to make them edible, so all that initial trash and waste is taken away from--and then they would, the women would take these little knives and clean the fat off and pull the fat off the entrails--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then you take them and you would soak them and soak them and they really knew how to clean those things up and then they would cut them up and then you'd have a dinner of chitlins.
Speaker 2: Exactly, that was a feast.
Speaker 1: Yes, it was something we all did and ate.  They called, they called the hog testicles, mountain oysters--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and so they would eat--my father [Frank Casey] said we ate everything on the hog but the squeal (laughter).  And it's true because I can remember they call it sow's meat, but it came out souse meat.  And what it was was, you take the hog's head and boil and boil and boil it until it would break down and just almost boil, almost become a soup--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then you'd pull the bones out, and as you know that residual is a gelatin--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and they put flavoring and vinegar and spices and stuff in it and it'd set, and it would set like Jello.  I don't know if you've ever seen that?
Speaker 2: I have seen it.
Speaker 1: You can still go to some markets in certain areas of big cities and still buy it, souse meat--
Speaker 2: Souse.
Speaker 1: They call it souse meat.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you would cut it like little strips 'cause it had a very gelatin feel to it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And my father would put some vinegar on it and eat it with crackers.  I remember that.
Speaker 2: The--it's interesting that souse meat used to be very, very, very inexpensive--
Speaker 1: Very.
Speaker 2: --and now it's up there with the same price (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is it?
Speaker 2: --as roast beef.
Speaker 1: I never see it now--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --but I can recall my father would make it, souse meat.
Speaker 2: There's a--it's up in the embassy section of Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Goodness, amazing.
Story_ID: 475294
Speaker 1: What I wanted to ask was, since you were integrated with the people from Hungary, whites and blacks, did they have the same menu that they ate from, in other words (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I can't recall their presence--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause I was so young.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And we really didn't socialize together--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but their--they were obviously there, you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So you see them at the company store [in Wyco, West Virginia] when they're all there to buy and spend their scrip or something, but I cannot say that there were a lot of them--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and much of my remembrances are of what my mother [Flossie Coleman Casey] and father [Frank Casey] told me much later in my life (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I would ask them about, when you worked in the mines, daddy, and stuff like that, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, what and why and so forth and so on.
Speaker 2: Sure, but so much of it I cannot remember very clearly.  I can remember they would smoke the meat though.  You take the hog meat because we didn't have refrigeration.  We had what we call ice boxes right, remember those?
Speaker 1: I sure do.
Speaker 2: You see we're telling our age now.  Iceboxes, which is--and that's why you had an ice man.  He would come by every day or every other day with this, and you said what you wanted and he'd take this huge thing and cut this chunk of ice--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and he'd put it in your icebox--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --and it would stay a certain, a day or two and then it would slowly melt down and that's what kept thing cool or hopefully from spoiling, but it was a dreadful method because things would spoil, and it always had a rather wretched smell to me in the icebox.
Speaker 1: Right as they were spoiling, you know it was a matter (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of a race as do we eat it first before it spoils?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes so that they learned to spoke the meat, which will last a long time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, we have a shed, a smoke shed and they would quarter and, a person who was good at butchering, some guys could, they were butchers.  They know how to cut the flanks into this and that, and they would put them together and smoke the meat and hang it--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so when you get to the winter because it wouldn't spoil, all the smoke and the salt kept it from spoiling.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Those big sides of bacon, where they would cut those big slices of bacon off you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and it's interesting that at that time, you see the meat was pretty fresh in its instance as it was, and the eggs came right out of the chicken when it's fresh, I'm talking about fresh eggs--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --right out of the chicken you know what I mean.  And so you had bacon and eggs and, and grits with fresh stuff.  Mom would make the biscuits right there from scratch, not from Bisquick, from scratch, you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Right, right, so--
Speaker 2: It's a different time, different life.
Speaker 1: Different time and sometimes people wonder I guess how do we get back to those times?  But now you saw this, your father dealt at the company store--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and the company store was in business to make sure you didn't get too far ahead of them (laughter) and--
Speaker 2: Right, life was too hard to get too far ahead you just--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: It was almost a subsistence existence.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: And that song ['Sixteen Tons'], "I owe my soul to the company store."
Speaker 1: It was true.  It was true.
Story_ID: 475295
Speaker 1: Your father [Frank Casey] managed to get his family up to Columbus, Ohio.
Speaker 2: Yes because he had siblings that had moved there, and they said, "Come up," and I can remember we stayed with our, with my father's sister--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who, uncle, we called him Unc, we didn't say uncle then.  Unc Ellick [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not Uncle Ellick, Unc Ellick.  But, so we stayed there with them for not a long time, it didn't seem to be a long time, as my father looked for a house to rent or buy and pursued employment.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, he went and he got this job at a steel mill, Buckeye Steel [Buckeye Steel Castings Company; Columbus Castings, Columbus, Ohio], and he bought a house.  He bought a duplex.
Speaker 1: Wow, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, worked like a dog.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well he could rent half of it out, you know, to help pay--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --his monthly commitment, and there we were in Columbus, Ohio.  I was about four.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you hadn't quite started elementary school yet--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --but your father was able to buy this house--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: Right next to an elementary school [Garfield Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio], I mean just across the alley.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I would walk there in thirty seconds.  By happenstance, it was like that, I mean, he saw that house and he fixed it up.  They call it pointing, if I can recall.  What it meant was, it's a brick house, which is a big deal, you know a brick house--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and they would take this mortar and they would put it between the brick.  They would point, it's called pointing--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so we knew that the adhesive texture of the mortar makes the bricks adhere--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and look more sturdy.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I, that's the best I can explain it, but I can remember him doing it with his brother and some other people.
Speaker 1: With this first house that he bought?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, okay, and he was renting out the other side, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was--
Speaker 1: --your family was moving up and becoming landlords.
Speaker 2: It was five rooms, yeah two bedrooms, one, two, actually three bedrooms and, three rooms, three rooms up, two rooms down.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One bath upstairs.
Speaker 1: And your mother [Flossie Coleman Casey], was she just a housewife?
Speaker 2: Just a housewife.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she stayed home with the children--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and took care of the house.
Speaker 2: During those early years she did, and then she began to clean white folks' houses.
Speaker 1: Okay added income.
Speaker 2: She was a housekeeper, for added income yes.
Speaker 1: The--obviously Columbus was what we called a northern town, supposedly no segregation and so forth, but there really was--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and where you lived in that first house, was it an all-black neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was called the East Side.
Speaker 1: The East Side, so that's where blacks lived there in Columbus.
Speaker 2: In great profusion.  There were other areas where blacks lived, but there was a lot of blacks on the East Side.
Speaker 1: Right, that, that was the main, that was the Harlem of Columbus.
Speaker 2: Kind of yeah, and it was a street called Mount Vernon [Avenue] that was, it went sort of up a long street.  These two streets sort of went right through the black neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, good enough.  I do remember that area.
Speaker 2: And, and yes and the high school I went to eventually was called East High [East High School, Columbus, Ohio] because it was in the east part of the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was West High [West High School, Columbus, Ohio], North High [North High School; Columbus North International School, Columbus, Ohio], South High [South High School, Columbus, Ohio], East High--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and Central, which was kind of downtown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was the Central High School [Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Exactly okay.
Speaker 2: Geographically appointed.
Speaker 1: So, this I guess would have been considered a low income area of the city?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 475296
Speaker 1: So, you lived next door to the elementary school where you were, you would enroll?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was the name of that elementary school, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Garfield.
Speaker 1: Garfield, okay.
Speaker 2: Garfield Elementary School [Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you enroll into kindergarten or first grade?
Speaker 2: First grade.  You know it's interesting, it was a very old edifice building, built in 1882, and it had an old fire escape method.  I'd never seen one like it where you, if there, if the alarm went off, the kids jumped in this little hole door and then in a circular fashion went spinning down this huge tube-like thing, and whoop, and came out on the street.
Speaker 1: Wow, I've never seen that one (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's how old it was.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Garfield Elementary.  But, no, I did not go to kindergarten, so I enrolled in the first grade at five (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --which is why I was in college at seventeen--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'cause I never went to--
Speaker 1: Kindergarten.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Never did, okay.  Now what are your memories of the teachers there at Garfield Elementary, some of the teachers that made an impact on you, some of the student body?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Some are very, very good teachers, I remember them, and the principal was Mr. Blackburn [ph.]; I remember his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a very tall and dignified man who looked like he was white, but he wasn't, very fair skinned, and later when I went into education and became an educator myself, I used to wonder where he had gone to school.  I didn't know anything about him.  He was just the principal.  That's Mr. Blackburn, and if you mess up he's gonna come and get you.  There was Ms. Cooper [ph.].  There was one lady, I can't recall her name 'cause this was a long time ago.  I think I was in the second grade, and I'm left-handed, and we have to endure such ignorance sometimes.  She was gonna make me right-handed.  They would combat the possibility of left-handedness.  It was like a sin or something--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and they would try to change you, which caused a lot of problems you know.
Speaker 1: And this was Ms. Cooper?
Speaker 2: No, this was not Ms. Cooper.
Speaker 1: Oh, some, another teacher.
Speaker 2: A lady I can't recall her name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very tall, sort of dignified with gray hair, and she would say, "Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernie Casey]," they all called me Bernard, "Bernard, now try to write with your right hand."  Well you write with the hand that it comes naturally to you--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and when you try to change that folks begin to stutter, all kinds of things begin to manifest because it was against your natural inclination.
Speaker 1: Right, and they had attached a stigma to it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but she couldn't break me, I mean, and she didn't try a lot.  She just said, "Okay you're fine."  But, some way, in some curious methodology, as teachers someone had told them to do that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to break those kids of being left-handed.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That, and I was ever mindful that back in those days all the desks were made for right-handed people.  The way you enter into the desk--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and all that stuff.  The inkwell, I mean where the inkwell was--they really discouraged left-handedness.
Speaker 1: Right, absolutely.
Speaker 2: And there's a whole industry where you can buy certain things made for left-handed people.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: But then it was like a curse, and they said, "You're writing upside down" because left-handed people write with turning their hand around.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: You see one of the reasons left-handed people have a difficult time using an ink pen is because they write into the pen.  Right-handed people write in front of the pen, so they're pulling the pen along--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so you don't smear your words.  When you're left-handed and you do that turned wrist thing, you're writing against yourself (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right, and the teachers were trying to discourage you from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and if you were mindful and pay attention you can look at someone's writing, they have a left-handed slant or a right-handed slant--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and you are mindful and have enough knowledge you can say, "This person is left-handed," just by the way the letters slant.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So, I learned to sort of write straight up and down, and it had no slant.
Speaker 1: Because you did not want to be identified (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --or stigmatized.  That's very interesting--
Story_ID: 475297
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, we're talking about 1943, now going into 1944.  There's a war [World War II, WWII] going on, and how did this impact your neighborhood where you were, I mean were--well first of all, let me ask you, the teachers there at Garfield [Garfield Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio] were most of them black or white or--
Speaker 2: All black, all black teachers--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --all black students--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --all black community.
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We never saw white people until you went to the stores.  The, back in those days there was a proliferation of mom and pop stores, I mean those huge conglomerates didn't exist then--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and so there was a great sense of community.  You knew the people who live on your street.  You knew the person who ran the store, they knew you--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --they knew your parents, they would call you name.  "Aren't you that Casey boy [HistoryMaker Bernie Casey], I'm a tell your daddy [Frank Casey]," you know, so there was kind of a familiarity, and kind of a safety in that--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --because they would look out for each other.
Speaker 1: Right, now were most of those stores though owned by blacks or were they owned--
Speaker 2: Owned by whites.
Speaker 1: All, always owned by whites.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and, and a lot of Jews.  There was like a shoe store called Mr. Rosenberg's.  There was a market, and I can't think of his name, but he was a Jewish man.  It wasn't a bad thing, they weren't mean or anything,--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but I didn't understand when you're a small black person, people are either white or they're black.  We were colored in those days--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --white and colored.  So, you didn't know who was a Jew and who wasn't or who was Italian.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You didn't have the sense that, that's Mr. Boccanelli, he's Italian.  We didn't have that kind of, he's a white guy, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, white or black.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so there were Italian vegetable farmers and fruit sellers in the neighborhood, and they would come by on a truck maybe three times a week or something, and all the mothers, of course the daddies were gone to work, would come out and he'd stop at a certain place in the block and they'd say, "I want some tomatoes, and I want six apples, and are those bananas good?"  "Oh yes ma'am they're fresh," and so he would, and he had a scale right there--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and he would take the onions and weigh them and give you what you want and the women would sort of have this conversation around the truck, "So how you doing Millie?"  "Oh, fine.  How's that boy of yours?"  It was this little communal thing happening (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Around the truck.
Speaker 2: --around the fruit truck.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: And so then you would, they would buy what they wanted and pay the man and go back in their house, and he'd drive another two blocks down the road and stop again--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, so they can do this process, and they had very fresh fruit and vegetables.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I remember that for some reason they were Italian, the men who did it, and our parents knew it, and they would make references, not necessarily negative, but they, we knew they were Italian.  Now maybe they knew the name sounded Italian or something, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Like they knew that Mr. Rosenberg was Jewish who owned the shoe store.

Speaker 1: You are in elementary school, things are, you know, your mind is just beginning to wake up to certain things at this time.  What were your student friends like there at the school [Garfield Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio]?  I mean how was it, anybody overly smart, overly dumb, overly mean?
Speaker 2: There is always that element no matter what the circumstance, if it's all black, all white, all Asian.  You have some students that were very smart--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --they're quick on the uptake, they got it.  You have those who are very slow, they don't quite, they labor,--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and then you have, excuse me, you have those that are kind of in the middle.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And when I became an educator I began to understand that it is not a good thing necessarily to gear your lessons, if you will, to the middle, the average, I mean the approach to education has changed a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because what you would do is you would punish the very bright kids 'cause they got bored.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They would get it just like that and then they start to mess around because they got bored and they didn't know what to do and then the ones who are slower are laboring trying to keep up and they don't quite get it, so why should we adjust ourselves to the median, to the middle, to the average, to the common.  All the phrases you want to use, we since have learned that we must have elevated and escalated classes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, put all of the smart ones together.  They shouldn't be punished because they're smart.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and the ones who are a little bit slow, not stupid, just a little slower you can address yourself to their particular predicament and not have them get discouraged because they'll get discouraged if they'll always behind.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: So, you have to understand how to integrate your classes for the people so that they all can benefit and get better.
Speaker 1: We call these tracking systems--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Are there any particular friends or peers that stood out or you remember for one reason or another there during your years in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Not in elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We're all so the same, and stupid, little kids running around.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: All poor people.  Shoes at that--I remember the shoe sole would flap (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah.  I remember that.
Speaker 2: --remember that when the glue would come loose and you're going flap, flap, flap, flap, and everybody would laugh at you and, and give you a difficult time, but we were all just the offspring of laborers.
Story_ID: 475299
Speaker 1: Came a time when you were ready to move on to, what, junior high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in those days, now it's called middle school (laughter).
Speaker 1: Middle school, right, right, and what junior high did you go to?
Speaker 2: A school called Champion [Champion Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Champion.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Champion Junior High.
Speaker 1: Okay and--
Speaker 2: It was a further walk.  Now mind you, my elementary school [Garfield Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio] was just across the alley--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I could be there in thirty seconds, but the junior high I had to walk--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --maybe twenty minutes or something.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was it like going on to this upper grade, I mean the teachers, were they harder, or more or not (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The whole experience escalated--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as it is wont to do.  We've all gotten older, you're like thirteen, something like that, twelve or thirteen--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and I was out of my neighborhood.  I had to walk several neighborhoods to get to the junior high school, so the people are different.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a little more dicey.
Speaker 1: Was it more integrated?
Speaker 2: No totally black.
Speaker 1: Totally black even at Champion?
Speaker 2: Yes, junior high school was totally black.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I didn't realize (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Students and faculty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had a principal named Mr. Mitchell [J. Arnett Mitchell].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when you're twelve or thirteen you know, these people are bigger than life.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: As I grew up and became an educator myself, I used to laugh at all the things that terrified me as a kid as it pertained to the teachers and educators.  I became one, so I thought, what a joke this is, you know, because when you were ten you go, oh my God here comes Mrs. Johnson, you're in trouble now, so Mr. Mitchell had this way of speaking and whenever we were, quote, acting up in class, and there were always some classes and some teachers that you could run over.  There always were.  They were nicer or something.  I don't know what it was.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We always knew as students, certain teachers you don't mess with because they'll get you.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Others you can, they just, you just run roughshod over them.  They had no discipline.  They couldn't keep you quiet.  They couldn't teach you.  They couldn't--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: So, whenever we were in a classroom--Mrs. Smith [ph.] was one of those teachers.  For some reason, we just would not pay attention to her.  She was very nice too, 'cause I remember doing some yard work for her at her house, but so if we were acting up as kids do and we weren't paying attention and she said, "Now I said be quiet now, and learn what I'm, watch me," dah, dah, and so if it got real quiet you knew that Mr. Mitchell stepped in the room.  And someone saw him and it's like telepathy (laughter) we knew we were in trouble.  And he would step in and we'd look around and everybody got just quiet as a mouse, and he'd say, "You boy, you in the red shirt, come here.  What's your name?"  "Willie Johnson."  "Go down to the office, I'm gonna whip you, gonna whip you."  He was always gonna whip somebody.  Today they would never do that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but then they would paddle you.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We're gonna whip you because you'd be messing up and they'd be loud and.
Speaker 1: You've touched on something else also in those days, and I don't know this is true in Columbus [Ohio], but in those days a lot of the teachers, especially if you had a lot of--large black faculty lived in the neighborhood--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --where you lived.  You may live in a poor neighborhood, but they were right around the corner.
Speaker 2: Sure, they weren't far away.
Speaker 1: Was that the same way in Columbus?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why Mrs. Cooper [ph.] lived down the street from us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now sometimes when I took a walk I'd see her standing in her front lawn, a little better house than we had--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and grass was cut and everything--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --standing in her front lawn smoking a cigarette and she would never speak.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Just like there was a trespass, and you saw Mrs. Cooper and we didn't speak either.  Like you can't do this because--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --we're students and she's a teacher and never the worlds shall meet, I don't know what it was, it was very weird (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's interesting I went through the same, same experience.
Story_ID: 475300
Speaker 1: Any outstanding memories that we should know about that you may have had in junior high, I mean, you have a multi-track career as an athlete, as an artist, and so forth.  Did any of those things begin to peek its head out there in junior high school?
Speaker 2: In elementary school [Garfield Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was in elementary school, we were much more prone to having theme experiences, meaning as Thanksgiving approached there'd be a colored chalk drawing on the board of this turkey and the pilgrim and the Indian [Native American] and the, you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: As Christmas approached, they'd be Santa Claus and the reindeer, and at Halloween it'd be the jack-o'-lantern and they always asked me because I could draw and had a feeling for it, would I do the Thanksgiving scene on the board.
Speaker 1: Ah, okay.
Speaker 2: "Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernie Casey], will you do that?"  "Yes ma'am."  She would give me all these colored chalks, and I'd go back there and I'd look at some little photograph or something to get an idea and then I would do the turkey with the pilgrims and the pumpkins and the squash and the food.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, or if they wanted a map drawn.  "We're gonna study some geography, and would you draw the map of Africa?"  "Yes ma'am."  So, I'd draw them.  So, I began to understand that possibly I had a little more talent than the other students--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because they asked me repeatedly would you do the theme, whatever the theme was.  And so I liked it.  I enjoyed the reinforcement and the substantiation that you got from that accomplishment--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --when your teachers say, "That was very good Bernard, that's wonderful."
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So, you begin to get a sense of something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --and--
Speaker 1: That you're a little special.
Speaker 2: Yes, not like the other ones.  So, when I went to junior high school, middle school that whole thing lessened because they don't do any of that, they don't do drawings and that.  That's more elementary school stuff when you're always drawing and putting around and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so when I went to junior high school it was a little more confrontational.  I got into a few fights.  The guys were older.  There's much more, it's much more territorial.
Speaker 1: Right.  But, you're not a small person, so were they foolish enough to pick a fight with you?
Speaker 2: I was, I had a big growth spurt between the eighth and ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Like you could almost hear me growing.  And in the ninth grade was when I began to play basketball.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I went out for the team, and I made the team, and we were really quite good.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And I was taller than the other kids.  It has changed so much, today I'd be a guard.  But, back in those days you played in the paint because I was tall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was 6'1" you know, but--so I got hooked on basketball and loved sport, and it wasn't bad.  So, I played pivot for the team, and we won the championship.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: We were good.  We had a lot of little fast guys (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now you say you won the championship, was this in junior high school?
Speaker 2: Junior high.
Speaker 1: Right, okay, citywide championship.
Speaker 2: You, sure.  You, you were in a sort of league, you played certain schools and we beat them all, we won.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you got recognition for that.  So, then mind you, ninth grade was not in high school in those days.  It was still in junior high.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You remember?
Speaker 1: Right, yep.
Speaker 2: Now middle school, ninth grade is high school.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: I wanna speak about that in a minute too (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Because as an educator I have a point of view about that.  The ninth grade, I was a pretty good basketball player, and that's all we had.  We had track, but I didn't run track then.  The school was in a depressed area, had no facilities, had no track, had no, had a gym, but the gym had no seating capacity.  It just--
Speaker 1: This was at Champion [Champion Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio]?  It had no facilities?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, just very basic kind of stuff, and you didn't know any better because you had no comparison.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: You only know what you know, and that's how it looked, so that's the way you thought it was going to be and that the way it was.  You began to--as in junior high school, travel around to the other schools to play their basketball teams, when you got to the white schools they had an auditorium--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --where they could seat people, you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And their showers worked, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You could actually take a hot shower when you got through playing, and all the things you didn't have, quote, in those ghetto schools--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and you begin to understand the discrepancy.  You begin to understand the disparateness of your existence.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 475301
Speaker 1: All-black elementary school [Garfield Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio], all-black junior high school [Champion Junior High school, Columbus, Ohio] in the ghetto, in the hood.  All-black faculty.  And as I grew up I used to wonder, like, where did Ms. Cooper [ph.] go to school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Where did she get her teaching degree at?  Because mind you we're back in a time when there was not integration.  We were in legal apartheid--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the United States.  Legal apartheid.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, if you were to be a doctor, we knew then, if you were a physician and you were colored, a Negro, you either went to Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] or Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --that was it.
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: So, and there were more black hospitals because there was no integration--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --very minimal integration in medicine.  If someone is gonna die, they were gonna take them to the public hospital and try to help them, but primarily you had this little colored hospital with these African American physicians who had gone to Meharry or Howard.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: They didn't go to the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].  They didn't go to LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  They didn't go to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].  They didn't go to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --it was too hard.
Speaker 2: Now that brings up a point.  We're up to 1951, '52 [1952] now, and there's a period that black folks are beginning to awaken to what is going on around them, you're protected somewhat in that segregated neighborhood because you don't have to face a lot of things that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're protected because your exposure is so limited--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so your world is much more closeted.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, what you don't know, you don't know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We heard them saying, and we've all said it, that I did not know how poor I was because we were all the same poor--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --so, in comparison you felt, well, we got a TV now.  We got a radio that works, and so do the Wilsons and the Johnsons, and we're all the same, and they work with my daddy [Frank Casey] in the steel mill [Buckeye Steel Castings Company; Columbus Castings, Columbus, Ohio] or on the highway or you know I didn't live next to no physicians and dentist and, you know what I mean?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And Ph.D.'s who taught at universities, I didn't know them, so we all seemed to have the same poor.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: As we began to get exposed--
Speaker 2: You're beginning to see these better high schools now, better--
Speaker 1: Absolutely--
Speaker 2: --and I wanna know what your feelings were?  When did it start, wait a minute here.  When did that start to happen?  With a person that questions like you I imagine this didn't just start with you?
Speaker 1: No, in junior high school, which was, that school was circumstanced right in the midst of a huge development of public housing, so all the person who were around that school and went there were on limited income from public housing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then some of us who came from other neighborhoods was just as poor, but it wasn't in public housing.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So, we had to, they kept a little bus to go across to play the other schools, and whenever you went to play junior high school or middle school, that was--circumstances the same way, the same kind of poverty, it was the same issue, the showers didn't work when you got through, they couldn't get lunches because there was no cafeteria--
Speaker 2: Right.  Why (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but when you went to the white schools they had a cafeteria.  They had one, you could go buy lunch, and they could, you know what I mean, things were different and you begin to see, what is that?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Even though we beat the snot out of them athletically, you know what I mean--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --but you hardly ever saw an African American on the faculty.  They all worked and taught in the black schools.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And many of them, you learn later, didn't go to Ohio State or University of Michigan or Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana].  They went to Alcorn A&M [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi].  They went to Prairie View [Prairie View Agricultural & Mechanical College of Texas; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas].  They went to Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know what I mean?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they went to get a job as best they could.  They went to Central State [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which was a black school not far from Columbus [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They went to Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which was the first black school, black college in America for black people--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --which was church-based.  I mean, so they had to ferret out those kinds of exposures to pursue their education.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So when they taught us, they taught us things they don't teach today about black people, it was black people who went to a black university who taught black students about black people.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So, you had a greater sense of your knowledge and your history because they told you.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Today they don't do it.  It's a cursory passing thing, where slavery existed, now it doesn't and now we're okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Carter G. Woodson--
Speaker 1: That's all you're gonna talk about--
Speaker 2: --legacy.
Speaker 1: --that's how quick it is, a paragraph, come on.
Story_ID: 475302
Speaker 1: But now you're beginning to awake to these things--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and you're about to graduate from junior high school [Champion Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 2: And I went to East High School [Columbus, Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because we're the east part, east end of Columbus [Ohio].
Speaker 1: So, you're still over there in that Mount Vernon [Avenue] area?
Speaker 2: Yes, but, and East was probably 80 percent African American, but no black faculty.  Before I left, before I graduated from high school, there was one black teacher that came there, Mr. Wade [ph.].
Speaker 1: Wow.  The year that you would have gone to East--
Speaker 2: In the late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Late '50s [1950s] okay.
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --fifty-five [1955], somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '55 [1955] was we won the city championship.  We kicked everybody's behind in football.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you would have been there in '54 [1954]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the Brown decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --now has come down and blacks are really--
Speaker 2: Now mind you we're still in apartheid.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, if you went south--my mother's brother lived in Louisville [Kentucky], he's a preacher and his church was in Louisville and we went to see him when you got to Cincinnati [Ohio] you had to go to the back of the bus--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because you went past the Mason-Dixon Line.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: These are things; we don't remember this.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I remember it.  In the Greyhound bus, you had to go to the last five seats back against the wall-
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and sit there.
Speaker 1: I remember it.
Speaker 2: My mother [Flossie Coleman Casey] wept.  She had to go in the back and I didn't know what, I'm just a kid glad to be traveling--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --going anywhere.  We're going to see Uncle Thurman [Thurman Coleman, Sr.], oh boy.
Speaker 1: That's it.
Speaker 2: And she's sitting like this and her shoulders are, she's weeping.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I said, "Mama what's the matter?"  She says, "I can't explain, honey."
Speaker 1: Right.  There was an awareness or either not an awareness.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: If you had an awareness, you were suffering.
Speaker 2: Yes, and she didn't like it.
Story_ID: 475303
Speaker 1: You've graduated now, you're at Eastern High School.
Speaker 2: East High [East High School, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: East High, sorry, and the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now East High was about 80 percent black--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and in an integrated neighborhood, but it was gentrifying, changing, and we happen to have really good athletic teams, so we were many times the city champions.  So, when I came to East High School, I played basketball, football, and ran track--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I didn't take art.  I took mechanical drawing for Mr. Wade [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the single black faculty member.  I remember him.
Speaker 1: Now did you do that consciously?
Speaker 2: No, I just didn't have enough sense of my destiny to say, "I'm gonna take art courses and be an artist."  It was my dream in my heart--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I did not have enough manifestation of what was possible.  It was not encouraged in my home, and no one ever talked about it.  No one ever reinforced me that I was an artist, that I had the talent.  I only got it from the teachers, never from my family, my mother [Flossie Coleman Casey], my father [Frank Casey], nothing.  So, they were never look at a drawing and go, "This is quite good, son," never.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I took drafting and was quite good at it.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, now, but you were also an athlete.  Was anyone, did you ever dream that I could become a professional ath- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Never.
Speaker 1: Because it just--
Speaker 2: It was not my dream.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: I never had those dreams even when I was all pro.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never thought, well my goodness this is amazing (laughter).  It sort of happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I'm a disciplined person, and I am steadfast, and I can, as they say, keep my eye on the sparrow.  So, I was able to accomplish a lot in my life.  I've had four careers, and there all are viable and valuable--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --because I can do that.  I can separate myself.
Speaker 1: So, you're in high school, you're an acclaimed athlete there at East High, you are pursuing mechanical drawing instead of your art--
Speaker 2: Well just one of my pursuits I mean.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: A regular curriculum, but that was one of the things I liked doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What are your impressions of any particular teacher or student making a great impression on you while you were there in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Teachers, Mr. Wade--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --one because he was black and we never had a black teacher in that circumstance.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We were glad to see him there.  We kept wondering, why aren't there more black teachers?  There's all these black students, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And there was a teacher named Mr. Darzell [ph.].  He taught history.  He was funny and witty and clever.  He wore the same suit every day, and we used to laugh at that. But, I liked his class.  He was interesting.
Speaker 1: What did he teach?
Speaker 2: History.
Speaker 1: History, okay.
Speaker 2: There was Mr. Borsch [ph.] who taught, he taught metalsmithing, and I was pretty good at that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And another one, wood and metal, Borsch--Zip.  He had a Polish name, but we called him, we all called him Zip.  He said, "Just call me Zip," because nobody could pronounce his name.  It was not disrespectful to say, "Hi Zip," you know, and he said do this and do that, and he was memorable too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think, I think, okay, there was another lady named Mrs. Smith [ph.].  This is an interesting story here.  Mrs. Smith taught English, and she was tough, took no prisoners.  Nobody liked to take her class because she just would take no nonsense--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and she drove you very hard and we, as we were wont to be as young people always looking for the easy way out--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --take the easy course, take the easy teacher.  Well, what it means is you don't get a good education (laughter).
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: So, I happen to enter Mrs. Smith's class in English, and I did okay.  I think I took her maybe twice down the line for advanced things or whatever it is.  Years later, I had become famous, I got a letter from her.  She sent it to the Rams [Los Angeles Rams] or something, and she said, "I had you in my class when you were in the eleventh grade, you won't remember me, but I'm Mrs. Smith."  I knew exactly who she was, and she said, "I'm so proud of you.  I've watched your career.  I've watched you mature.  I've watched your journey.  You make me proud."  And that was very touching to me.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And did you ever get to see her again?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But, I knew who she was, and she didn't forget me.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 475304
Speaker 1: Your sister [Franketta Casey] and--did not provide you encouragement?  What did she think of her baby brother (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No she didn't.  She was really quite good at art herself.  She was very good at fashion design.  She was forever drawing these little models with dresses, and she would design the dresses--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and that, but that never got nurtured--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and she disbanded it and the notion that she could do that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now mind you, we're talking about a time when black folks couldn't do anything like that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They could (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They could be the greatest--
Speaker 2: They weren't allowed to.
Speaker 1: --in the world, but they couldn't get a job.
Speaker 2: Weren't allowed to do that.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: I remember sitting in middle school [Champion Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio] again, junior high school, and they would get these movies to show us in midday sometimes.  I don't how they would schedule that, but you're gonna go see a movie, and they may go to the auditorium, you know what I mean--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to us it was a gymnasium, they had seats in there, and they would show this little documentary about something, and they would show this documentary about the derby.  What you call that when kids make these little cars?
Speaker 1: Oh right, right, the soapbox.
Speaker 2: Soapbox derby.
Speaker 1: Derby, right.
Speaker 2: And I'd sit there 'cause I know about that kind of stuff, and I'd watch and get depressed 'cause you never saw a person of color anywhere--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, those little white kids would make these little carts, and then daddy would help them and they would have this little steering wheel and this little--and they'd go down the hill, whoop--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --who would go the fastest and all that stuff and I thought, God, I'd love to do that.  But, it seemed like out of a possibility because you never saw anybody.  It was in Akron, Ohio.  That was--the soapbox derby was in Akron, Ohio--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --which is only about an hour and half drive from Columbus [Ohio].  It seemed like, God we can do this, you know what I mean, but no.
Speaker 1: So much like the picture you used to see of the little black kid standing on the back of the commode seat looking in the mirror--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and he's got a towel around his neck, and in the mirror he sees a white Superman, you know,--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the, but you're in high school [East High School, Columbus, Ohio] and I see it just in what you're telling us that awakening process is beginning, you're beginning to ask questions (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you're becoming dangerous.
Story_ID: 475305
Speaker 1: You also are getting to the point where you're looking at, where do I go from here?  Do I go on to college?  Do I want to just find a job (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It didn't seem logical that I would go to college.  My father [Frank Casey] didn't.  He worked in a steel mill [Buckeye Steel Castings Company; Columbus Castings, Columbus, Ohio].  My mother [Flossie Coleman Casey] cleaned houses sometimes.  Then she became a nurse's aide.  So I excelled athletically.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was all-state in this and all-state in that, and as my high school journey was coming to an end I got terrified because that comfort zone and that sort of adulation was going to stop, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had nothing, I mean, I would get up every morning and look after myself, make my lunch, pack it in a brown bag with the wax paper.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: There was no aluminum foil in those days.
Speaker 1: I remember.
Speaker 2: Wax paper and two bologna sandwiches and an apple or something--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and that was my lunch and I would iron my shirts.  I knew how to take care of myself.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My parents were divorced when I was thirteen, so I stayed with my father--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --so I was always very able to do what I had to do.  I could make a bed.  We could bounce a quarter off my bed, and I could starch my shirts 'til the cuff and the collar was starched and all of that.  I learned all of that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I became very self-sufficient.  But, there was always my vent to be able to take care of yourself and not be very dependent on other people.  It was a self-protective mechanism--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --is what it was.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But, you don't know it then because people hurt you--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My mother left, she left us and that left a hole in my soul.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I just was gonna have to carry on without her.  So, I learned how to take care of myself, and so I was an athlete, scholar too.  I got good grades.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I won what they called the (unclear) award for the best athlete scholar, the athlete who gets good grades.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it seemed natural that I should think of college, but I didn't, and I was also what they called a mid-year graduate.  They don't do it now, but they did it then.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, if you start the school in the first grade in January you come out--
Speaker 1: In January (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) in January.
Speaker 1: That's what I did.
Speaker 2: Now they'll hold you.  They'll wait 'til the fall--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and then you go.  There's no more mid-year graduates.  So, I was gonna come out of high school [East High School, Columbus, Ohio] in January.
Speaker 1: So, are we in our last--you're in your last year of high school now, and you still are not thinking of college and--
Speaker 2: I'm thinking, I guess--my idea, this is, show you how exposures to things just are so needed, that I would grow up and probably have seen a third of the world by now. I've been a lot of places, but back then I would have never thought that I would ever see anything.  So, your concepts and the understanding of your possibilities is very limited--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and the people around you don't know how to encourage you to be anything else because they are nothing else.
Speaker 1: Let me just break in here.  There should have been counselors there in the school, and I always see them missing when they're all usually all white.
Speaker 2: I never saw a counselor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't even there were counselors in my high school.  I never saw one.  Maybe there was someone who was a counselor, but I never saw them.  No one ever counseled me about anything (laughter).  I didn't even know you could go get counseling, you know about--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --about your curricula and the pursuit of what you should do--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --as a student, take this and this and this because that's gonna stand you in good stead if you do that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We didn't get any of that advice.  It was just, shut up and be quiet and go shoot the basketball--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so I got to, I was an outstanding athlete and I was very good in shop stuff like metalsmithing and woodwork and all that.  And I took drafting which gave me discipline.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was a very disciplined exercise.  So, I was a pretty popular kid, kind of shy, not very aggressive socially, but popular because I was an athlete, so the athletes are liked--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and so now all of a sudden it's time to come out of school.  What am I going to do?  I thought if I could get a job working with khakis every day and not get dirty, that was fine with me, I'd be--
Speaker 1: You were ready to spend the rest of your life.
Speaker 2: In some kind of--there's a place called Timken's [Timken Roller Bearing Company; The Timken Company], which was, it made like nuts and bolts and stuff like that.  But, you could go in khakis and not get dirty.  See my father got dirty 'cause he went to a steel mill with all that soot and dirty 'cause he'd blow his nose and it would come out black--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because of all the stuff he inhaled, that soot and stuff.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I didn't like that possibility, but you're thinking along those lines, well, what will I do when I graduate (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: And I was only seventeen.
Story_ID: 475306
Speaker 1: By my senior year [at East High School, Columbus, Ohio] I got a few scholarships, offers to come to college--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --four or five of them, and so coming out in mid-year in January, my God that's wintertime, what are you gonna do?  Who gets a job in January, I mean it's like, it's almost crazy--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so I thought I'll go, I'll pick one of those scholarships.  So, I told my daddy that I was, I wanted to go to college.  He said, "I can't afford to send you to college."  I said, "No daddy, I'm gonna get a scholarship."  He said, "You will?"  I said, "Yeah they're gonna pay me for everything, but I have to have money to live on to spend and--,"
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --he said oh.  So, the recruiters came by the house, the football recruiters.  They said, "Mr. Casey [Frank Casey], we think your son is gonna be a great player and we'd like to have him at Bowling Green [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio]," Bowling Green University.  It's up there in Toledo [Ohio], it's about an hour and a half drive and he can get back home and we're gonna take good care of him.  And then he says okay.  He said, "You wanna do this?"  I said, "Yes sir."  He said, "Well what do you wanna study?"  I said, "I'm gonna be a painter."  He says to me, "You don't have to go to college to know how to paint houses."  I said, daddy--I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: Take your time.
Speaker 1: "I'm not that kind of painter."  He said, "You mean paint pictures?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "You can't make a living doing that."  I said, "That's no reason not to do it."
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: We were at different polarities totally.  He couldn't understand, so I took the scholarship, went away to college, and studied the fine arts, which is why today I have a bachelor of arts, a master of fine arts, and a Ph.D. in humanities.  He didn't understand.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  A lot of us, our parents were that way, wasn't their fault.
Speaker 1: Oh, he meant me no harm.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 475307
Speaker 1: He just didn't get it.  I think my success as a person stunned him, and he never knew how to respond to it.  All the folks in the neighborhood always watched and said, "Mr. Casey [Frank Casey] your boy, I saw him play against the Green Bay Packers, he just kicked their behind.  He was fabulous."  And he'd kind of go, "Yeah I guess he's pretty good."  He never quite, it was too much for him.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Through no fault of his own.
Speaker 1: No, no, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And your mother [Flossie Coleman Casey] did she--
Speaker 1: Well, she had abandoned us.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They got divorced, and she just ran off.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I suspect that her difficulty was that she went from her daddy's [Charles Coleman] house to his house.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She never had a life--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you understand what I mean?
Speaker 2: Yep I do.
Speaker 1: So she kept wondering, there must be more out here than this--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and so she got very disgruntled and unhappy and got divorced and we were kind of estranged.  I didn't see enough of her, so when--she's always of the church, so when she would go to church and of course they all followed me, everybody knew who I was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and these careers and they'd say, you know, when I played pro ball, "My God, he was on the all-star team."  He was, and then I began to make movies and they said, "I saw your boy in a movie and he was with such and such and such," and she would go, yeah.  She said I could never, only that because I wasn't there.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: I said, "But mom, I love you and you're my mother."  "I know, but I was never there."
Speaker 2: She could not get over that guilt.
Speaker 1: No, she could not.  She could not.  Way down the line, my mother passed away two years ago at eighty-six, and way down the line because it had given me difficulty I went to therapy, and I remember the therapist said, "Until you own this it's going to own you."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That stuck in my head.  So, one day I called her and said, "Mama I know you didn't do what you wanted to do, and that your life did not turn out like she would have loved it to, but I wanna tell you that I love you and I forgive you."  She broke down and cried like a baby.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah absolutely.
Speaker 1: She said, "I prayed all my life that you'd forgive me."  God Paul [HistoryMaker Paul Brock], you're killing me (laughter).
Speaker 2: I apologize, but sometimes it's good to just get it out.
Speaker 1: God.  And the last years of her life we were pretty good buddies.
Speaker 2: Great.  How about your father, is he still?
Speaker 1: No, he pa, he (laughter)--my daddy chain smoked, ate pork, drank beer (laughter) all the things that you're not supposed to do, did all of that, worked like a dog, worked hard, and he died at seventy-one.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not in '71 [1971], at seventy-one he died.
Speaker 2: Seventy-one, right, right.
Speaker 1: But you know he was just a tough old guy--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Coal miner. He had black lung, just tough.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep, and there were a lot of others out there, unfortunately (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) His brother, of course there were nine of them, nine siblings and his brothers were the same way.  They all drank hard, and worked hard, and just, you know, died young.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Left here with no regrets, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right, yeah.
Story_ID: 475308
Speaker 1: Let's go back to that coach visiting and wanting to get you to Bowling Green [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio], and so you graduate and you're preparing to leave home now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well first of all what did you do in between January, 'cause I was a January graduate also.  What did you do between January and September?
Speaker 2: No, Paul [HistoryMaker Paul Brock], I went immediately.
Speaker 1: Oh, you went immediately.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a week.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know I graduated from high school [East High School, Columbus, Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --January the 15th or something--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I've washed my shirts and ironed my little pants, packed up, and went to college in five days or something.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: That semester, that spring semester was starting,--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so you could go right in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So what a jump for me, what an impact.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I went from this existence in this black part of town in Columbus, Ohio, with black education--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to this absolutely lily white university.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Not a black person lived in the town.
Speaker 1: Geez.
Speaker 2: So any black person you saw you knew went to school there.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And out of five thousand students then, today it's twenty thousand students, that's how the university has grown--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but back then it was five thousand students and about one hundred black people and almost all the black males were athletes on a scholarship.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: It was, it was just a traumatic experience for me.
Speaker 1: What was it like, what was your roommates like at that time, I mean--
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: --this had to be startling?
Speaker 2: Well my roommate was my best buddy from junior high school [Champion Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: He was also an athlete.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So, we went through the process.  I knew him since I was twelve--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so we both had scholarships.  He was an incredible running back.  I was an end--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he was all-state--
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: --and so we said--
Speaker 1: Bowling Green was lucky enough to get the both of you.
Speaker 2: Both of us, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so we decided--we had a few scholarships, not a ton of them, and we said, "What do you wanna do?"  I said, "Let's go to Bowling Green," because another, a person that had gone to high school before us had gone there and he said, "It's okay."  I said, but as, but as a black guy.  He said, "Oh it's fine, it's okay," and so we said, "It's like flipping a coin (laughter)."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, went to Bowling Green.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His daddy drove us up there, let us off, went in the dorm, and there we were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know what's interesting, I never took an SAT test.
Speaker 1: Oh is that right.
Speaker 2: When you talk about these things, I think that was before they did that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, LSAT, none of that stuff.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: None of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You just enrolled.
Speaker 1: Your SAT test was if you could catch that ball (laughter).
Speaker 2: Exactly (laughter), that you was all-state.  That's your SAT test, you got hands (laughter).
Speaker 1: He just passed.
Speaker 2: So, we just enrolled and there we were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't take any test or anything.  I can recall though they put us in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], they call it, ROTC, remember that?
Speaker 1: Right, I do.
Speaker 2: --which is to, it's like joining the [U.S.] Army exactly, and when you come out of that you're an officer.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We were in it one week.  We said, "We don't like this, can you get us out?"  The coach said, "Well gee, you know, you guys signed up."  I said, "Yeah, but I didn't know what it was.  I don't want to be in this."  And luckily 'cause we'd only been there for just a heartbeat--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --he got us out.
Speaker 1: They could do anything.
Speaker 2: Yes, when you're all-state (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, you just passed another test (laughter).  I got it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I got it.
Speaker 2: When the coach [Doyt Perry] was thinking, this guy's gonna make my career, and sure enough as a junior we were undefeated.
Speaker 1: Oh is that right.
Speaker 2: National small college [NCAA College Division] champions.  They had that, but they don't have that division now.  They don't have small college and--
Speaker 1: They call it Division II [NCAA Division II] or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  But there used to be a small college.  So, we were small college champions.
Story_ID: 475309
Speaker 1: It was also a period--and let's get--you entered Bowling Green [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio] in 19--
Speaker 2: The winter of '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957] right.  There was a great awareness of racial tensions throughout the country, and on some of the campuses because blacks are beginning to enter these campuses.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you, in the beginning did you experience any of those racial tensions?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and the fact that there were no blacks in the town, had ever lived there, and it was quite a little pristine campus, and you know, and you're very obviously, I mean--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Plus I was an athletic star--
Speaker 1: No doubt.
Speaker 2: --so you're even more obvious.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And to add insult to injury, I was an art major my God (laughter).  This guy is studying art, whoever heard of such a thing.  So, that was--but in the dorms and stuff yeah those slights--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and asides and things.
Speaker 1: You wanna make excuses for them, oh they didn't mean anything and all of that but--
Speaker 2: It hurts you a lot.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did you want to give us an example of some of the, one or two or any--
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think 'cause there are so many and you begin to erase them and to submerge them.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: There was a sociology professor, Ph.D., I can't think of his name, but I can still see his face, who said and I was the only black in the class, he's a sociology professor, that he didn't think that colored people were ever above average in anything, so it would be very hard not to give them a C.  And you know what I got in that class?
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: A C.
Speaker 1: A C.  So, you weren't gonna--you just got the top mark (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.  That's still in my head.  Once I walked up in the art building, which is a much more relaxed atmosphere because it's of nature people running around in paint smeared clothes, the class is kind of unstructured and they're in three hour blocks and because it's a painting class you can't you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so it's much more relaxed.  I remember walking up on two professors talking, and the N word was flying.  They looked around and saw me and then they changed their behavior.
Speaker 1: Those, you know I keep hearing that the difficulty of just being in the front of that integration (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the beginning of it yeah, right.
Speaker 1: In the beginning of it where people did not try to be cautious of that, and I want to explore a lot of that with you and the campus--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and what it was like.
Speaker 2: It's very interesting because it's--it was an ordeal.
Speaker 1: I know it.
Story_ID: 475310
Speaker 1: So you are now on the Bowling Green [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio] campus--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you're a football hero for the campus winning games, but are you totally accepted in the classroom and on the campus?
Speaker 2: Let me tell you a story.  When I first got there in that winter at mid-year, which they don't do now as we said, there had been a confrontation between some of the black athletes and some of the white athletes in what they call the commons, which is where you eat.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Commons is where everybody goes to eat, like a huge cafeteria they called the commons and that's where you go to get your meals and hang out and play cards and do whatever.  And they had had this confrontation over allegedly one of the colored athletes had called one of the white girls who was in his class on the phone and talked to her and they had conversations or something, you know.  Some of the white athletes got wind of this, I mean they had not had a romance, but they had become friends--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and the white athletes had gotten all crunchy about it--
Speaker 1: They had found out about it.
Speaker 2: --and so in this commons, the black players, bid whist was very popular then.  I don't know if they still play that or not, but it was a real popular game, you know, game of cards, bid whist, and--
Speaker 1: I play it like crazy.
Speaker 2: Oh you do?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh so, so then they all stayed in this one part of the room and played bid whist together because they couldn't integrate.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean they could, but no one would.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Integration was there, but the white people wouldn't talk to you, you know what I mean (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 2: So, there was always a strained kind of curious thing.  So, the black people to protect themselves and try to get through the ordeal--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --stayed together--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --and then they said we segregate ourselves.  How come you guys always staying to yourself?  Well because when we don't, you treat us badly.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: It's our protection.  Anyway, they had a showdown and they had gotten on different sides of the room and got ashtrays and forks and stuff and they getting ready to go at it.  Now, we weren't in Mississippi, we're in northern Ohio.
Speaker 1: Exactly, that's the, go ahead.
Speaker 2: So, it got cooled down and sort of nothing happened, thank goodness, but there was a strain that was always there between the white athletes and the black athletes.  And there were not a lot of black athletes, but the ones that were there were always the winners; they could help the team win.
Story_ID: 475311
Speaker 1: No one remembers that when I first started playing professional football, no team had more than five or six black athletes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Today almost the whole team is black.  You watch the lineups and you see maybe three white guys on defense and two white guys on offense--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and that's about it, do you know what I mean--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --unless there's really great stars.  But back when I played, one year in San Francisco [San Francisco 49ers] we had eleven African Americans.  And I was chatting with the coach one day (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who was the coach?
Speaker 1: Jack Christiansen, who played--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --had been a star for the Lions [Detroit Lions]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for a decade, nice guy, we was talking about all kinds of stuff, and the coaches liked to talk to me because I didn't talk football, I talked life.  And so he said, "You know how many letters about, how come you got many niggers on your team?"  I said, "Coach you're kidding."  He said, "Can you imagine that.  We have eleven out of forty-five players, and they thought, how come they got so many niggers on your team, that's why you don't win."  Now today it'd be reversed--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --you'd have maybe eleven white people.  Think about it, you know.
Speaker 2: Exactly (laughter).  And then you had people like the guy from Green Bay [Green Bay Packers] who said one of the teams had to get more black players, oh Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana] had to get more black players in order to win.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's the same thing that the great coach at Alabama [University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama] said.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: Bear Bryant.
Speaker 1: Yes.  When, I can't think, a running back from USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] went down there and ran all over everybody.  He gained like 250 yards or something, and Bear Bryant said, "We got to get some black players."  (Laughter) Ricky Bell.
Speaker 2: Ricky Bell, right that's exactly.
Speaker 1: But, you know it's interesting when talk about all the things about affirmative action and how things change, and people misunderstanding what really manifest, we see quoted in the paper because it's public knowledge what athletes make.  That's, they know what.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You can call and find out what somebody makes.  What's interesting is that there is this great misperception, what Shaq [Shaquille O'Neal] makes and Kobe [Kobe Bryant] makes, oh my God and da, da, da, make a hundred million and it sounds staggering, but I always say, "If Buss [Jerry Buss] can pay Shaq that how much money do you think Buss makes?"
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Let's put this in context here.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And if he has a multi-year contract for $110 million, oh my God that kind of money, but the guy who, who kills himself to bring home $35,000 a year, he can't grasp any of that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He doesn't understand--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that this is a business, it's a multi-billion dollar business--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and it's show business--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and it is not out of the ordinary because for years they got paid nothing, a pittance.  The owners got all the money.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, until they began to get the union and organize and say, we want medical care and we want retirement, they took all of the money--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and said, you should be glad to play, you're a pro--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --they're gonna love you,--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I'll give you ten grand [$10,000] a year.
Speaker 2: You'll be glad--
Speaker 1: And we thought, well that's more than I can make teaching.  I'll make six teaching--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --twelve playing, I'll play.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Well, so now it's like, it's such, it's changed so drastically that it's fascinate--it fascinates me now 'cause I tell young players today, I say you have no idea how we labored to get you where you are.  You have no clue.
Speaker 2: Right.  No appreciation.
Speaker 1: No, none.
Story_ID: 475312
Speaker 1: For instance, and I'll come back to my original point, when I was a first draft choice for San Francisco [San Francisco 49ers], I mean you're the first pick they get and they picked me--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which is quite flattering and this means you're pretty sure you're gonna make that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They'd be embarrassed to cut you because they'd look like fools.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So, you knew you're gonna play one year at least because you're the first pick, and my salary was ten thousand dollars, first pick.  Now, I can teach school for five and teach all year--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --play football half the year and get ten; didn't sound too bad to me.  And I got a two thousand dollar bonus.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm trying to allow you to understand the context in which all this stuff evolves and exists.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now fast forward, now you could teach school and in the first couple of years and make $35,000, but you become the first draft pick and you make $10 million.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: A signing bonus of $3 million and then a three year contract of $3 million a year--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --with some package makes $10 million.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well it's gotten way out of stretch here, you know what I mean.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So now you understand why there's tremendous conversation and consideration for young men who they say, I understand why they don't go to senior year.  They can go play ball, why wouldn't they?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you can always pay to go back to college you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  But if you break your leg--
Speaker 1: That's right--
Speaker 2: --in your senior year.
Speaker 1: --you, you tear your knee up and you're just a junior, yeah.  I understand that.  People say, my goodness--now I'm an educator, so I am very pro-education.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I ran a university [Savannah College of Art and Design, Savannah, Georgia].  I love education, but I do understand it.  This kid is twenty-two, he can play professional ball and make in the collective $6 million.  Now, as they say you wanna say in his language I can buy my mama a house (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right (laughter), right.
Speaker 1: My mama a house.  He can buy his mother a home--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and a car, himself a home and a car, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Unless he's a fool, he'll still have some money left.  And he hasn't run a down yet (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: So, I understand the temptation.  You can't walk from that.  You can't--or I can teach school my first year and make $32,000.
Speaker 2: Right, right, but the people who say they should stay in school for that one more year, they wouldn't do that if their job offered them the same opportunity you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely not, absolutely not they wouldn't.
Speaker 2: Let's look at another phenomena there and get your comment on that.  As you, I don't have to tell you about the former owner of the Washington Redskins, a man--
Speaker 1: Who said a black player would never play for me.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Bennett.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: It was Bennett I think.
Speaker 2: No, no, that was Edward Bennett Williams you're thinking of.  No, he was one of the first to get the black players I think.
Speaker 1: I'm, what's his name then?
Speaker 2: This guy's, I can't even think of it.  I knew him as a kid by the way (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It'll come to me.
Speaker 2: And he refused to accept me, when he refused to accept white sheets from me at his laundry because I was a black kid--
Speaker 1: Gee whiz.
Speaker 2: --and I'll think of his name in a few moments, but he owned, he--
Speaker 1: Marshall [George Preston Marshall].
Speaker 2: Marshall, Marshall was his name.  He bought the team from Boston.
Speaker 1: And the first black player that he employed was Bobby Mitchell--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --from the Browns [Cleveland Browns].  They traded him.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And he stayed with them right into the administration.
Speaker 2: And become assistant general manager--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --and has just retired as general manager.  But, my point that I was going to was the racism, Sonny Jurgensen refusing to throw to Bobby Mitchell even though throwing to him meant you would win the game you know.
Speaker 1: Absolutely, because Bobby was phenomenal.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  The num- the amount of racism that keeps people from doing what is in their best interest is where I'm going on this.
Speaker 1: It's a malady (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The ignorance of the--
Speaker 1: It's a malady, it's a sickness.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: It's no logic in it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It is like you've lost your mind.
Story_ID: 475313
Speaker 1: The fight that you were talking about there at school, that they're going to fight over someone else talking to another person, that fact that they happen to be black and white (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And it's none of their business.
Speaker 1: None of their business (laughter) and so forth.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But, anyway I wanted to get to that because I don't know how often--the coach obviously is not going to do it because his welfare is tied up in how well you do as a football player.
Speaker 2: Let me share a story with you.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: As you speak to me, I'm reminded of this.  There was a student, a white girl, we're friends to this day, she's retired from school teaching.  We were, I don't know, a junior or something, and in this circumstance it would be very difficult to just walk into the union and sit down and have a piece of pie, so we would meet in a car.  We're parked on the street, not doing anything indelicate, indelicate, just talking.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She--and back in those days they had separate dorms, remember that?
Speaker 1: Right, I do.
Speaker 2: The women on one part of the campus--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and the men on the other part of the campus.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You never stayed next door to some, I mean this, that was unheard of (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Didn't happen.  Right.
Speaker 2: And they had to be in at a certain hour, be in by eleven or whatever it was.  It's very strange when you think about it now, isn't it?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Anyway, her name is Sandy [ph.].  We were still in there talking.  Now, I had met her mother and her family.
Speaker 1: So, they had accepted you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but not a clandestine kind of crazy thing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, the campus police pulled up behind the car, it was night, and does this sort of highway patrol, puts his lights in the car and thing, and, "What are you doing in here?"  What do you mean what are we doing, we were talking.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He said, "Do you have any ID?"  She was, she said, "No, I don't have any."  He knew who I was 'cause I was the star athlete.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The next day the coach [Doyt Perry] calls to see me, come into his office.  The audacity of this, so, he says to me--now we had just had an undefeated season, I was gonna make All-American, I was the big poobah, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, he says, "I understand you were out with a white girl last night."  We're not in Mississippi, we're in north Ohio.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: I said, yeah.  Well now of course he could see I had an attitude right away.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: "Well now, now look, now if we're in California or something, New York it'd be different.  You know it's a little small town here and I'm not telling you what to do, I'm not saying you can't do this, but I would advise you that maybe you'll make your life a little simpler if you just wouldn't do this."  I'm looking at him thinking, I can't believe this is happening.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he said, "But I'm not telling you what to do, but," and I said I'm going home.  He said, "What?"  I said, "I'm going home."  "What do you mean you're going home?"  I said, "I'm quitting school."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: All he could see was his star halfback and his program not doing as well, you know what I mean?  He said, "Now wait a minute, just hold on, now don't get upset."  I said, "Well of course it's upsetting.  I wasn't doing, what was I doing wrong?  I'm a human being."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'm a person, she's a person.  Okay, fast forward.  I didn't go home.  The word went around to her sorority.  She was Delta Gamma [Delta Gamma Sorority], a DG, and they avoided her.
Speaker 1: Ostracized her.
Speaker 2: Yes, they wouldn't talk to her.  She's tough, so she said, "Okay I understand."  Now, we were never lovers, you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: I met her mother.  Her mother talked about going, she went to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], and she said, "I knew Jesse Owens."  She was so proud of the fact she had met Jesse Owens at Ohio State.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so much later, I didn't find out, she never said a word to me, much later I became then famous and then I'm Bowling Green's [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio] wonderful guy.  He went to school here and we all love him and he's this and he's that, and dah, dah, dah, dah--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and she began to teach school and she taught school and had two children and a life, and she said, "Did you know what they did to me?"  And she didn't tell me until way down the road how they ostracized her and wouldn't talk to her.  And the dean of women, Ph.D., wanted to kick her out of school.  She said, "Based on what?"  "Well, we just don't like your behavior."  None of your business, you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now, all of the same race people were in the bushes making out.  When springtime came, we said at Bowling Green if you kick the bush, the bush will kick back 'cause everybody was there, you know, doing their whole little (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, twenty-year-old kids courting each other.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's common, but you see that that was always a dicey thing.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  But, you pointed out, as you pointed out when you say I'm going home, then it becomes a whole different story.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well the hell with that you need to say (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, gonna hurt my program.
Speaker 1: Right (laughter) you would have hurt the program.
Speaker 2: We want to win a championship next year too.  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Story_ID: 475314
Speaker 1: How are you doing--now you're still at Ohio State how, how are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, Bowling Green [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry I didn't mean, Bowling Green.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: How are you doing in your art class (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very well.  And the chairman of the art department was my champion thank goodness.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: A man named Willard Wankelman, who was my champion.  He really looked out after for me.  And was a racist.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did not wanna be (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, but 'cause I would hear him say things about Jews you know and, but you know how people to combat that malady they will exorcize you from the pack.  He's different.  He's not like those other colored people--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --he's a, you know what I mean--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --Oprah [Oprah Winfrey], somebody else.
Speaker 1: Good example.
Speaker 2: She's still a Mississippi girl.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: But anyway, he championed me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I would sometimes stay at his house when I came to town and everything.  When I went back to graduate school, he got me into graduate school--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --and I was a TA [teacher's aide].  I taught there and so, I mean I must say he was just, and I knew he was a racist, but he had, I was an exception to him.
Speaker 1: Right, right, somehow he separated you.
Speaker 2: Yes, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you are graduating from Bowling Green and you're number one pick of the San Francisco 49ers.  What is it like going there?  What are your teammates like?  How did they view you?  I know--
Speaker 2: Well, you know I played in the all-star game.  I played in the East-West game [East-West Shrine Game] and all those games, when you're the best in the country you're getting all those exposures and so I went to San Francisco [California] and the town just narcotized me.  It's a beautiful place.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'm coming from Midwest, Ohio, northern Ohio,--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --flat land and cold and all of that and I'm out in San Francisco where there's a Chinatown and all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Right.  What, what year was that by the way?
Speaker 2: It was 1961.
Speaker 1: Sixty-one [1961], okay.
Story_ID: 475315
Speaker 1: So 1961 you're drafted number one by the San--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Francisco 49ers [San Francisco 49ers].
Speaker 2: And I go to San Francisco [California].
Speaker 1: Okay, idolized by the citizenry, or the citizens.
Speaker 2: Well, they're looking forward to seeing you because you're the first pick and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --hopefully we'll do well with you, you'll bring us a championship and all that.
Speaker 1: What about your teammates though?
Speaker 2: They were, they're all are veterans in this--you got to test your medal.  They got to see if you can play.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They ain't gonna give the job 'cause you gonna take somebody's job,--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so it's not all fun and games.  I was there one day, we went to the all-star game, all-star camp, and we came a little late because we were in all-star camp, so we came to camp at Moraga [California], Saint Mary's College [Saint Mary's College of California].  Now, they have it someplace else, but at Moraga, California, and I was there one day and I realized, this is a business.  You know, college is like fun and all that stuff, you play against your rivalry, I mean the whole structure was like this, son, this is business--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --you know what I mean--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and you have to adjust right now.
Speaker 1: You are--that first year you're not experiencing any nonsense from your teammates and loved by the citizens of San Francisco (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, I mean, I as a rookie I didn't, I started a few games.  I still had to test my mettle.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know I was a rookie, so they didn't--I wasn't thrown to the wolves right away.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The next season I had a great season.  I was fifth in the league [National Football League] in my second year, fifth in the league in receiving [sic.].
Speaker 1: Oh, oh okay.
Speaker 2: So, I matured and provided for them their benefit right away.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And I played six years there and then I went--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to Los Angeles [Los Angeles Rams] for two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, the city was fascinating and very sophisticated and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and all those things and the art exposure to all the art galleries and all that stuff.
Speaker 1: That's what I wanted to ask you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 475316
Speaker 1: I know you always kept your art career up and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was always my first intention.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Artist first and the other stuff afterwards (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did you do to advance that in the City of San Francisco [California]?
Speaker 2: I kept painting and I had my first major show at the John Bolles Gallery [San Francisco, California].  And John Bolles [John Savage Bolles] was the architect who designed Candlestick Park [San Francisco, California]--
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: --and he had an art gallery.  So, I'm not stupid I know that the fact that I was a 49er [San Francisco 49ers] and a celebrity and all that lent itself to the expectation, but he was amazed when I was at his house one social function and we talked about it, and I was able to make manifest a show possibility, and he came to see the work and I see he thought, this guy is serious.  This guy's a painter, you know what I mean.  He was prepared, I think, for it to be like a lark--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --but, I mean, he went, oh, and that was my first show, in 1963 I think it was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --something like that.
Speaker 1: And so art (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the works stood up very well and I remember the review, the reviewer, the art reviewer said, "To imagine this young man out on the field bashing people in the head, what is his position?  My goodness, it's amazing this kid can paint," yeah, something like that.
Speaker 1: Did you save that?
Speaker 2: I have it somewhere in a scrapbook, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay that's something we may want to just shoot.  Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) See I didn't just wake up one day and decide I want to be a painter.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I studied it--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --got a degree in it and I was going back for an advanced degree [at Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio].  So, they said, this guy is serious.
Speaker 1: Right, and it had been a passion a long, long time.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Any other highlights in your artistic career we should know?
Speaker 2: That, well that first show was quite, quite exciting, and then I had in 1964 or '65 [1965] a show in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'd come down and simply being naive and not knowing how it works I simply walked in off the street, and a lovely gallery on La Cienega [Boulevard], the Ankrum Gallery [Los Angeles, California].  She's passed away, she lived to be ninety-two, a wonderful lady, Joan Ankrum [Joan Wheeler Ankrum], very supportive, very impactful on my life.  And I just walked off the street and said, I was looking around the gallery and I said, "I'm a painter."  She said, "Yes."  And I said, I wanna--and we just started talking 'cause I didn't know what I was, I was naive,--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --no one does that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know what I mean.  And she said, she was kind of amazed I was just so brazen--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because you'd usually be introduced and have somebody of some clout recommend you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, verify your work and all that.
Speaker 2: --and you know what I mean, you had a connect, yeah right, right, and so they agreed right then, we'll show you.  I said I'm teaching in the offseason at University of Ohio [Athens, Ohio] and maybe next season I can come.  She said, "Okay, we'll work on that," and so I left and that's how I got my first show in Los Angeles, and I showed with them for thirty years.
Speaker 1: Wow, wow.
Speaker 2: And I had about fifteen or sixteen one-man shows there.
Speaker 1: You also have had some shows at other places around here in Los Angeles that I can remember, over at the Broadway [Broadway Gallery Complex, Los Angeles, California] you had a big show one time, but let's go into some of those places and--
Speaker 2: We had a show at the Museum of African American Art [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and it was an interesting show because it was a show of athletes.  I had recruited Ernie Barnes, who was a wonderful painter--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --wonderful guy, and he played professional football.  And Milan Tiff, another very, very good painter who went to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], we all had degrees now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were not just goofing around.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Milan Tiff had gone to UCLA, and he was a track star, track athlete, he was in the triple jump--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I had gone to Bowling Green [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio].  So, we all had degrees in art.  We all had careers in art--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and we all were recognizable artists and so I fashioned a show.  It was fascinating because we were very different kinds of artists.  Ernie Barnes is a genre artist.  He paints people, and--well you've seen his work so you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --and I was more abstract and Milan was very abstract--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so it was, but we were all African American athletes.
Speaker 1: You had those similar backgrounds as athletes and so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) African American athletes, yeah.
Story_ID: 475317
Speaker 1: We want to get into your work as an actor because at some point during that period you had moved down here, you were a Los Angeles Ram, I believe, and how did that first acting assignment come about?
Speaker 2: What's interesting, by happenstance when I--I was always sort of enamored with acting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to watch it, and I was a cinephile, I went to movies all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Still do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --still.  I may go to two or three a week.  But, I'm in the business now so I know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But, when I was in San Francisco [California] playing for the Niners [San Francisco 49ers], I took a course in characterization--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --at the University of California in San Francisco [University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California] at night, one night a week--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and it kind of piqued my interest because we had those exercises you do, and you had to get up and act and stuff--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and so I got kind of interested.  By happenstance, fate--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I was traded to Los Angeles.  I could have been traded to Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh Steelers]--
Speaker 1: Exactly (laughter).
Speaker 2: --you know what I mean, or Dallas [Dallas Cowboys] or something, but I was traded to Los Angeles.  So, I'm now playing for the Rams.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I thought I still wouldn't mind pursuing acting, so I enrolled with a wonderful drama coach who is not with us anymore, Jeff Corey, who was an actor who was blacklisted, wonderful guy, witty and terrific, and I studied with him.  I never would go into anything with happenstance.  I'd go in prepared--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I studied for a year and a half--
Speaker 1: Oh, whoa.
Speaker 2: --before I ever auditioned for a role--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you understand?
Speaker 1: I hear, I hear.
Speaker 2: I didn't say, "Hey I'm a Ram, give me a job."  So, if we're gonna come back I'll save this story--
Speaker 1: Please.
Speaker 2: --and we'll come back and if you write a note I'll remember it and I'll take a specimen.
Speaker 1: Okay, Jeff Corey.  I remember him.  Okay, all right, we will break here.
Speaker 2: He was an actor.  Did you see a film called 'Home of the Brave'?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: Do you remember that film?
Speaker 1: I do, and I remember his role (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) About this black man--
Speaker 1: --with Edwards--
Speaker 2: --whose name was--
Speaker 1: James Edwards.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Who had this trauma and he couldn't walk because he got traumatized--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and Jeff Corey, was the physician, he says, "Get up and walk, nigger."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he said, "I'll always," you know, and he broke through that wall.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: That was Jeff Corey.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 475318
Speaker 1: All right, this is part two of an interview with [HistoryMaker] Bernie Casey.  The videographer is Scott Stearns.  [HistoryMaker] Paul Brock is the interviewer, and observing is Larry Crowe.  Bernie, I believe where we left off, you were playing for the 49ers [San Francisco 49ers], but you were, had just had your first major showing of your artwork here in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that would have been about 1964.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 2: Something like that yes.
Speaker 1: And without talking to anybody, you had also started acting classes, right?
Speaker 2: Well, not quite yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was still in San Francisco [California], and I had the occasion to be in Los Angeles, and as we shared, I simply with my naivety walked off the street to a major gallery and finagled a show, how I ever got it no one could ever believe that, but the lady, Joan Ankrum [Joan Wheeler Ankrum] who owned Ankrum Gallery [Los Angeles, California] until she passed away, she was ninety-two when she passed away, but I was with them for thirty years.
Speaker 1: Thirty years, whoa, whoa.
Speaker 2: And so there was kind of meeting of the minds that was simpatico, and she agreed to show me without ever seeing any work.
Speaker 1: Oh, any of your work.
Speaker 2: Just off my enthusiasm and my joie de vivre, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, just to make sure that we do have it all down and I don't remember whether we talked about the year or the day of that first showing.
Speaker 2: In Los Angeles?
Speaker 1: In Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: Yeah about 1964 or '65 [1965], somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: All right, all right and so that was your--and you were still playing football at this time for the 49ers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes for the 49ers, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, are there any memorable incidents that took place at that first showing that you remember particularly where you can share it with us?
Speaker 2: As I recall, it was quite a nice turnout, and in those days there was always the consternation of the conversation about, my gosh, he's a football player and he paints, and they always wanted to make that some curious kind of an anomaly or something, as if people cannot be multifaceted.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's always a curious position to take to me--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because people can do a lot of things.  I believe that old adage, a jack of all trades and a master of none, is nonsense.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You can be a master of a lot of things--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and some people are.  They're just very facile people.
Story_ID: 475319
Speaker 1: You have the reputation of being a very, very disciplined person.  Do you think that had a role to play in your being able to master being an outstanding football player, you were a first round draft choice, and being an artist, and later being an actor, all successful in all three?
Speaker 2: I'm su- absolutely sure that's a large part of my success.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was in graduate school [at Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio], the chairman of the art department [Willard Wankelman] used to comment on that.  He said, "You can break your day up into little pieces and dedicate yourself to each segment with great enthusiasm and commitment."  He said, "I've watched you work out in practice to get ready to go to camp, and when you practice you practice, and I've seen you do your painting, and when you paint you paint, and in the classroom teaching, when you taught you taught," and so yeah I can do that.
Speaker 1: We did want to mention that at this time you were also an educator--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so that's a fourth one--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you were equally successful at all four.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The, during this time your mother [Flossie Coleman Casey] and father [Frank Casey] were still alive, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they were very proud of you, you had now become very, very successful.
Speaker 2: But, neither person had the capacity to speak to that.  If they were very proud, it was secretive because they never said so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that gave my heart great pain because we all want to make our parents proud--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and I'm sure that one of the reasons I was so driven, as we shared in the first segment, my mother left us, abandoned us, and went off to chase her dreams whatever they were--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --when I was about thirteen, so my sister [Franketta Casey] was about fifteen, and we remained with our father--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and in the most curious way I think, because when you are of that age and with a limited understanding of life, if your mother leaves town and doesn't come back, you think in some way you weren't worthy and you failed or something.
Speaker 1: You blame yourself.
Speaker 2: Sure you do, and why aren't I good enough?  Why did you leave me?  So, everything I pursued, I had to do well in it.  As we talked about in the first segment--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I was in high school [East High School, Columbus, Ohio] an athlete, but an athlete scholar, so I got an award for getting good grades besides being an athlete--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and so then I didn't just play pro ball, I was all-pro.  I mean I had to be wonderful you see.
Speaker 1: Right.  You were self-driven to be great at everything.
Speaker 2: I think something to prove to my mother that I'm worthy of your love.  I'm worthy of your being proud of me.  Look at me now, don't you think I'm terrific?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And she never said yes, so I was driven at whatever I did--
Story_ID: 475320
Speaker 1: When I became an educator, I was the board chairman of the largest art university in the world, the Savannah College of Art and Design [Savannah, Georgia] with 5500 students.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Most art universities are like six hundred, eight hundred students, maybe 1200, RISD [Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, Rhode Island] and Cranbrook [Cranbrook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan] and CalArts [California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, California] and all those schools, Chaminade [ph.], they're not that big.  But, the president who asked me to become aboard, this story is really interesting, when I was doing a television series and I was being interviewed by NBC, and the president, Dr. Richard Rowan [Richard G. Rowan] at that time who was the, who had started the Savannah College of Art and Design, he started it--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in 1978.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, he saw the interview and he's a very tenacious fellow, tracked me down.  He called NBC in New York [New York], and they said, "We didn't tape it here, it was in Los Angeles [California]."  He kept pursuing everything until finally they left a message with me that Dr. Richard Rowan had called you and would like to speak with you, and I called him back at the Savannah College of Art and Design.  At that time, it was two buildings and about twenty students.  They had only been in business for a year.
Speaker 2: Since 1977.
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978], okay.
Speaker 1: He hocked his--he and his wife [Paula Wallace] were both educators and they refi'd [refinanced] their house and got some money from her parents [May Poetter and Paul Poetter], who were also educators, and they scratched this money up and they purchased an empty armory in Savannah, Georgia, and rehabbed it themselves.  They painted it (laughter).
Speaker 2: They did the painting themselves (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes and fixed the toilets and everything, yes.  That housed the first beginning of that school.  So, when he called, he said, "We have a gallery called Exhibit A [Exhibit A Gallery, Savannah, Georgia], would you consider showing here?"  And I said, "I have two commitments, so I will show with you if it's possible when I'm done with those commitments."  He said, "Fine, sir, we will look forward to that.  Will you speak with me again?"  I said, "I will."  So, I called him and we arranged to have a show here in Savannah, Georgia.  And so I flew in and had the show.
Speaker 2: That show, do you remember it?
Speaker 1: Oh sure, Exhibit A Gallery, which was in the armory.  It was a well-received show--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and we became just the fastest of friends.  And so he asked me if I would consider being a board member, and I was so charmed by his ideology and his courage to start a college because most colleges that we are mindful of started in 1892--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --nineteen twelve [1912] or something, you know what I mean?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So, no one starts a college today, he did, and so I accepted to come aboard as a board member--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and to fast forward I served that and then was asked to be the board chairman, and our ideologies were in sync because he had been a college basketball star--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --so he understood athleticism and success--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and all of that, so we were on the same page.  So, our school, we with great diligence pursued educating the whole person because you're not just a painter--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or sculptor or jewelry maker or designer or computer graphic artist, you are a person.
Story_ID: 475321
Speaker 1: So, we wanted to develop as best we could the best person we could fashion in their four years of staying with us as a student [at Savannah College of Art and Design, Savannah, Georgia], and so we had athletic teams.  We said, "Because you're a watercolorist doesn't mean you can't play basketball," so we had athletic teams, and while I was there in that capacity as a board member and then chairperson of the board, I said, "We've got to raise our possibilities to a high level.  Let's go for a real visible coach for our basketball," 'cause we were Division III [NCAA Division III], which is a small (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Smaller than small.
Speaker 1: We couldn't begin to play UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but we could play small schools, and those young people who came to play who also were textile designers loved that that they could play basketball--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --'cause many had played in high school.  So, I went out and recruited because I know him one of the more available coaches, Cazzie Russell (laughter).
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: I talked to Cazzie and I said, "Let me allow you something and see if you respond to this."  Because Cazzie is a teacher at heart.  That's what he is.
Speaker 2: And you knew this (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, and I knew he would respond.
Speaker 2: Right, that's--
Speaker 1: Besides being one of the great ball players of all time--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --he was school board player of the year for three years at Michigan [sic. George Washington Carver Area High School; George Washington Carver Military Academy, Chicago, Illinois] in high school, three times All-American, University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  He just had an incredible--and then played for the Knicks [New York Knicks].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, I said, "Come down and talk to us, and see if you are interested."  You know who else we talked to who almost came too--
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: --before we couldn't get him, K.C. Jones (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --who coached the Celtics [Boston Celtics]--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --to a championship.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: But you see, you respond to people's inner sense of what is important.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They had won all the recognition as athletes, but they were intrigued by could I take this small school and make it a school of consequence athletically even though they are jewelry makers and sculptors and potters.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, we were all challenged by that and we found it fascinating.
Speaker 2: Plus they knew your standards.
Speaker 1: Yes and I knew them.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So, Cazzie came down to see us and he said, "You know what Bernie [HistoryMaker Bernie Casey], I'm coming."  So, he and his wife Myrna [Myrna White Russell] came down and he's still there even though I've retired from that and don't do it anymore, he's still there coaching.  And sometimes, I mean he hasn't won championships, but he said, "I enjoy educating and teaching these young men."
Story_ID: 475322
Speaker 1: Now let's go over this, this way this enrollment ballooned.  I don't wanna say blossomed, it ballooned (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: In 1978, it had how many students?
Speaker 2: About--he allowed me I think in '78 [1978] when it started, they had put up an ad if you will that we have the school [Savannah College of Art and Design, Savannah, Georgia] and here's what we're going to do, and I think they had like seven students or something.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Seven students, wow to--
Speaker 2: And so when I, when I had my show there it was 1979 or '80 [1980]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they'd been in business a year or something--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the one building, one building.  Today they have fifty-five buildings.
Speaker 1: Jeez.
Speaker 2: Amazing isn't it?
Speaker 1: It is amazing.  One building (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To fifty-five buildings.
Speaker 1: --the president and his wife--
Speaker 2: Painted himself.
Speaker 1: --had refurbished--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and painted and so forth.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And up to now it's--
Speaker 2: What they would do as it is wanted to be in a lot of cities, the downtown is the oldest part of town--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in any city, whether you're in Cleveland [Ohio] or Chicago [Illinois], that's the part that starts first and then they spread out--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so it's--so buildings lie fallow.  So in Savannah [Georgia], which is a very small city--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --there were a lot of empty buildings, so he would buy them and one of the good degrees you could get there is a degree in restoration and what's it called, restoration, in other words you're taught how to restore buildings.  They win awards with that, they're so good at that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, what they would do, as a matter a fact I have a building named after me called the Casey House [Savannah, Georgia], which won a lot of awards.  It was a building, it was lying absolutely fallow and empty.  It had been a candy store and a candy factory, and he pursued it and found the owner and the owner thought, ho, ho, ho I'm gonna make a killing with this, this guy has no idea.  So, Dr. Rowan [Richard G. Rowan] says, "Would you sell this?"  He said, "Oh, how much you got?"  So, he made him an offer, yeah sure.  He's thinking ha, ha, ha, boy I got over on this guy.  So when they rehabbed it and it won three major awards he won, he said, "You tricked me, (laughter), you tricked me."  He said, "No I didn't, we just, that's an honest barter, and you said yes you would sell it because you thought it wasn't worth anything."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, he said, "I wish I hadn't sold it."  So, they ended up in called the old district buying a lot of that property that was lying fallow, and so now it's really quite, they literally rehabbed Savannah because it had become one of the largest industries that, a paper company and one more, oh an air, air, a company that makes airplanes, Craftsman [sic. Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation] or something.  They make airplanes, those three companies.  But first that wasn't a college.  It wasn't even there--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but it became so successful and so big and so impactful that it became one of the biggest employers in that city.
Speaker 1: In the city and you also said this was, this art college is now one of the largest--
Speaker 2: It is the largest art university--
Speaker 1: Art university.
Speaker 2: --in the world.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh wow.  And approximately how many students today?
Speaker 2: Fifty-five hundred.
Speaker 1: Fifty-five hundred okay.
Speaker 2: That's almost as much as Baylor [Baylor University, Waco, Texas] has, or schools like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a wonderful story.  I'm sure you're proud of your role in that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well absolutely because it was, it was through my working with Dr. Rowan and his vision and his wife, Paula [Paula Wallace], we said, "We can do and be anything," so we would not be dismayed or taken off track.  We were in pursuit of excellence all the while and so it came to fruition.
Speaker 1: Now, where were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well let me tell you, I forgot--
Speaker 1: Go ahead, go head.
Speaker 2: --to share with you, our baseball coach was El Tiante.  You know who that is?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: Luis Tiant, hall of famer, Boston Red Sox.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: We talked with him.  He still has a heavy Spanish accent.  He's a Cuban--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and he got enticed and he came down there because it had, he had enjoyed all his wonderful athletic success--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and he wanted to be a teacher, I mean a coach is a teacher.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they were intrigued by the possibility of, could we take this little art school and maybe find some outstanding players?  And he said, "I always have an avenue to the Dominicans."  So, he could bring all these Spanish players up there that no one knew, yet they could throw BBs, you know what I mean, they could spit fire.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: It's like, when, well the playoffs are right now and all these Spanish names play, but we don't know who they are--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but they're excellent, from Cuba and from Dominica and all those kind of places you know.
Story_ID: 475323
Speaker 1: Where were you in your career at this point when--
Speaker 2: Which career?
Speaker 1: Well, your career with the 49ers [San Francisco 49ers] was over.
Speaker 2: Oh way gone, we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay, so we had jumped way ahead.
Speaker 2: Oh, by this, I retired in 1960- my last year was 1968.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: I played during the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm an old fellow.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I didn't realize that, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so then by then that was yesterday's news.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't even know, you know.
Speaker 1: Well that's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was always kind of shocked when people would recall some game.  "Oh my God I saw you against the Packers [Green Bay Packers]," and I'd go, "What?"  I mean it was like it was dead bones or something.
Speaker 1: Okay, I did not realize that, that we had moved ahead in your career.
Speaker 2: Well, when we were talking about the late '70s [1970s] and when I began to lend myself to the art university [Savannah College of Art and Design, Savannah, Georgia], but during the '70s [1970s] okay when I retired in '68 [1968] and I allowed you that I had studied with them I got intrigued about the possibility of acting and so I studied with Jeff Corey--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because I did not want to be a celebrity anything.  I bring to the moment my commitment and credentials, and I will seek them so they'll know what I'm doing, so I studied for a year and a half before I went out on an interview as an actor--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --because I wanted to be able to know what I was doing, not just say, "Well I'm a football star in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], so give me a role," I mean that's, because then you see you are pigeonholed as an ex-football player who acts.  I hated that phrase.
Speaker 1: I can remember that.
Speaker 2: You know Ram [Los Angeles Rams] turned actor.  What the hell is that, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, I never liked that, so I always wanted to prepare myself.  As an educator, I got three degrees.  As an actor I went and studied to know what I'm doing so when I would go to an audition I wasn't begging--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I was a viable (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were offering them something.
Speaker 2: Yes a viable entity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: Now, what was that first role that you, you went for?
Speaker 2: It was--there was a great, great film that they made called 'The Magnificent Seven,' which was actually--the one we saw in America was a western, but the classic one ['Seven Samurai'] was Japanese.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was about some samurai--
Speaker 1: Samurai.
Speaker 2: --who come and rescue a village.  Wonderful film, terrific film and Toshiro Mifune became a huge star, well I should say bigger, he always was a huge star in Japan, but he became sort of international because he was so fabulous in that.  And so then they did a western version of the same story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so I was not in that, but then it was very successful and they did three of them, and I was in one called the 'Guns of the Magnificent Seven.' Which was--
Speaker 1: Was that the third one?
Speaker 2: The third one.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: We shot that in Madrid, Spain.
Speaker 1: And that was your first one?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I can still remember the guy stepping up with a clapboard saying (speaking Spanish) siete magnifico pistola (laughter), the seven magnificent pistols.
Speaker 1: Okay and--
Speaker 2: Sort of a loose translation of 'The Magnificent Seven.'
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Siete magnifico pistola.
Speaker 1: Now by that time you had finished your career in football?
Speaker 2: My first year, no, as a matter of fact in the spring of that year I did the movie, and then '68 [1968] I finished, I played the last season and then retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I made one film before I retired.
Speaker 1: You were a Ram at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  This role led to other films.
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely, yeah (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 475324
Speaker 1: Where I'm going with this, I wanna get into the films, but I wanna get up to that, I'm bringing you up to the part at NBC, and 'Harris and Company.'
Speaker 2: Oh sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, okay I retired, and folks thought it was a ploy to get more money, but it wasn't.  I had played eight years and I had enough of that, and that was never my dream.  I was never a person who dreamt that I would one day play in the NFL [National Football League].  I could care less about it.
Speaker 1: A means to an end.
Speaker 2: Well, I was a big, facile athlete that was fast and able and committed to being successful, so one thing leads to another.  So I made All-American and I got to be the first draft choice and I played and I played in the Pro Bowl and all that stuff, and at some point you think, well I've got to get on with it because I always wanted to and did attain being an artist.  That was always my childhood dream.  That muse pounded through my blood my whole life.  That was never just an idle happenstance.  That was always even secreted when I was a little ghetto black and you wouldn't talk about stuff like that 'cause it would be, "You're gonna do what, a painter?  Ha, ha, ha."  Because I'll never forget that one phrase that a lady said, "The only painters I know are white or dead."  To say you're gonna be a painter was like, you're crazy.
Speaker 1: In our first interview, first part you spoke of the joy you got when the teacher called on you to put something on the blackboard to draw.
Speaker 2: Yeah the Thanksgiving scene, or the Christmas scenes or the Easter bunny thing or something, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  So, this was really an extension of all of that and so forth (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, absolutely.  Not so knowingly, but we house in our thumping hearts a lot of private dreams that sometimes come to fruition in spite of us.  It is something that we hold dear to our spirit, and so you know I remember talking to a guy who had been in business, African American man and he had had a career for twenty years as a successful businessman, but he always wanted to be a physician.  So, at forty-five he said, "Bernie [HistoryMaker Bernie Casey] I just, I'm gonna do this."  Case Tech University [Case Institute of Technology; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio] is a med school, a very good school in Cleveland [Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --they were combined, Case Tech and another one [Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], and they sort of, not specialized, but they had a kind of understanding that people do and can be other things, and so they did not discourage persons who had gotten middle-aged from coming to med school 'cause a lot of schools won't take you past a certain age.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: They say by the time you do your internship you'll be too old.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They don't.
Speaker 1: They hate to take you past thirty.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they don't.  They say, you'll be more amendable, wiser, your maturity will be more usable.  They weren't against it.  So, he went there and went to med school and became a physician.
Story_ID: 475325
Speaker 1: You though were now fulfilling two things.  You were an artist, fast gaining national or international recognition and you had been accepted for roles in the film industry, entertainment (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.  I had done--my second film was with Ralph Nelson, who is the man who directed Sidney Poitier to his Oscar [Academy Award] in 'Lilies of the Field'--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he did a film called '...tick...tick...tick...', and I played a rapist, I loved that role, with Jim Brown who was the sheriff.  It was based on a true story, not the rapist, but this first black to be a sheriff in this southern town--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and all the difficulties that he encountered because he was the first black sheriff during the time of integration and turmoil and confrontation.  So, it was a very interesting story.  And then I did some TV shows, and then I did 'Brian's Song,' which was just a huge television movie.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And so I'll tell you another funny story.  James Caan played Brian Piccolo--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and so we were in Rensselaer, Indiana, at the training camp of the Bears [Chicago Bears] for real--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so my having gone through all that and just retired, I knew all those guys still because they were still playing--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and we were chatting, and I asked James Caan, I said, well, 'cause he's always kind of a rodeo guy, kind of athletic kind of a guy, not a very big man, but he liked all that rough and tumble stuff.  And so I said to him, "So what do you think about doing Piccolo in 'Brian's Song'?"  He said, "Well, I'm having a good time, I just hope it's gonna be okay."  He said, "I just wrapped a film, I don't know what it's gonna do, but I just got through before I came here to shoot this I just got through doing a film that may be pretty good."  I said, "What is it?"  He said, "'The Godfather,'" (laughter).
Speaker 1: And of course he would never be forgotten for that role.
Speaker 2: Oh my gosh, I mean, but it hadn't come out, so he had no idea it'd be so huge.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The book ['The Godfather,' Mario Puzo] was a bestseller, but that doesn't mean it's gonna be, you know.
Speaker 1: No guarantee.
Speaker 2: But the film is one of the most classic you'll ever see.
Story_ID: 475326
Speaker 1: This is during the shoot of 'Brian's Song,' and you are beginning to get roles, very positive roles I should add, that are forming the foundation of your career.
Speaker 2: As an actor, yes.
Speaker 1: As an actor.  What, were there other incidents there on the shoot for 'Brian's Song' that you may remember?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's some kind of funny because I still knew most of the Bear [Chicago Bears] players, I played against a lot of them, and James Caan is a, I like Jimmy, he's kind of an irascible kind of rascal and, but he's an actor and he's not, he was never big, he was 165 pounds or something you know, and he was strutting around there acting, and Billy Dee played [HistoryMaker] Gale Sayers, Billy Dee Williams--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and the wonderful gosh, actor, I can't recall his name played "Papa Bear" Halas [George Halas].  If I told you, you'd know immediately, wonderful actor.  Anyway, so James is strutting around and annoying the real Bear players, right, and I'll never forget this one end, Doug something.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Buffone.
Speaker 2: Yes, Doug Buffone, linebacker, he's a linebacker, he was standing there staring at Jimmy Caan, and Caan was mouthing off and this and that, and so they had set up a play, 'cause we're all acting the players aren't really hitting people, they're acting.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And one of the other guys said, "Doug, stick him," (laughter) so they're gonna do a little screen play, you know.  It's all rehearsed and everything--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --he's supposed to catch the ball 'cause he's playing Brian Piccolo.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Catch the ball and you know start running and then do this magnificent jaunt up the field.  So, they had threw the ball onto the flat and Buffone stuck him, knocked his helmet off him (laughter).  So Jimmy jumped up like it was nothing, but he went back to the huddle and everybody was snickering because he knew he got his bell rung, you know (laughter).  So, that was, it was so, we were there for a week with the Bears, and they all had a good time.  They enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  I'm sure he still remembers that hit though, even today (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm sure he does, yeah.
Story_ID: 475327
Speaker 1: Following 'Brian's Song,' you started to get more attention, I'm imagining, in your career (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yes, I started to do films, and I had a conversation, this is interesting, with a young man who--an African American man who's a writer who wants to do a documentary about, he said, blaxploitation.  And I said to him, "There was no such thing."  He said, yeah the whole, there's a whole time when there was a lot of films with blaxploitation film.  I said, "You know, that's a phrase that was coined by an African American man who put that phrase into the lexicon for the media, but there's no such thing as blaxploitation," because it was of the time, like I did 'Hit Man' and 'Cleopatra Jones' in 1972--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and they were films that weren't terribly sophisticated, but they were certainly watchable.  But, we all had those big afros and those bellbottom pants, and we strutted around and everything was a clenched fist, and you know, and power to the people.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, that--I said, "Let me tell you something and be mindful of this, when white films were done for not much money for a very specific audience," because most films are done with an audience in mind, "and when they are complete and marketed to that audience no one calls them white exploitation films.  You've been hoodwinked.  You've been bamboozled as Malcolm [Malcolm X] would say."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So get that out of your mind.  It's just a certain time and a certain genre film that that's what it was, and I can remember during that time, there was a phrase called the nigger budget of $400,000 or $500,000, and then you rush it out and if you got $3 million returned you were happy as you could be, so that was the turnover.  Like today I don't think they'll do what they call, you flip it.  You buy a condo for $175,000, and you hold it for a minute, you flip and sell it for $220,000--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and you take, you make the profit.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's, you know, same premise.  So, until the bubble bursts and the bottom drops out, you can do pretty well with that.  So, a lot of the studios would put up a small amount of money, rush the film out, shoot it in six weeks, I shot 'Hit Man' in six weeks, had it back in the theaters within six months, which is fast.  The film made $4 million, they shot it for $300,000; they were happy as they could be.  So by the time the smoked cleared with P and A, printing and advertising and all of that, and if you put, if the studio, if MGM [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc., Los Angeles, California] did it with their money, so if they put up $300,000 and put in their pocket $700,000, are they happy, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Right, right made a quick turnaround.
Speaker 2: Sure.  But, there's no such thing as blaxploitation.
Speaker 1: Well let, let me ask you this question.  Because I know you are a very no-nonsense person, you think when black folks need to be thinking about advancing the cause if they're out there singing and dancing, they're wasting time and hurting us all.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: There were a few films that were meant to be jokes, a play--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and you were in one called--with the platform shoes.
Speaker 2: 'I'm Gonna Git You Sucka.'
Speaker 1: 'I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,' that's what--
Speaker 2: But, that was written to be a joke.
Speaker 1: It was written to be a--
Speaker 2: It was not a joke accidentally--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --it was written to be a joke.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean it was a parody of certain genre of film.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And, and that's what made it so funny.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, but you would have no problems with that as long as it was meant to be a joke?
Speaker 2: Yeah, then you just simply must decide if the film is a good film or not for what it was made for.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And if it is made to be a joke, it's not funny, well the film failed--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but the worse thing is it becomes a joke accidentally because it's so bad and stupid, that's demeaning.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you did a film called 'Gordon's War.'
Speaker 2: No, that was, that was the fellow who passed away two years ago, Paul Winfield.
Speaker 1: Paul Winfield, okay, okay.  Got, got that--
Speaker 2: I've done I think fifty-four films, and most I can't even remember.
Speaker 1: I remember one where you were stuck on a foreign planet, and Charlton Heston.
Speaker 2: No, that was Rock Hudson.
Speaker 1: Rock Hudson.
Speaker 2: 'The Martian Chronicles.'
Speaker 1: 'Martian Chronicles.'
Speaker 2: That's a classic.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Ray Bradbury.
Speaker 1: Right and--
Speaker 2: Classic.
Speaker 1: --it was a very serious film and I remember your performance (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, going, when they went to Mars.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 475328
Speaker 1: One more question on films and then we're gonna go to television and that is how, if you had to rate one, two, three, how would you rate the best films that you've appeared in?
Speaker 2: I think the ones where I played real people.  I did a film called 'Maurie,' which wasn't widely seen, but it was really wonderful, and I'm very proud of that.
Speaker 1: Would you spell 'Maurie' for us please?
Speaker 2: M-A-U-R-I-E, it's short for Maurice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the real person was Maurice Stokes--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --who was an outstanding basketball player that had gone to St. John's [sic. Saint Francis College; Saint Francis University, Loretto, Pennsylvania] and played for the Cincinnati Royals and sustained an injury that paralyzed him, and it's about his rehab at the behest and comfort of Jack Twyman, who was his teammate, and so I played Maurie--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and Bo Svenson (laughter) played Jack Twyman--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but it was a very touching film because it was true and meaningful about humans having compassion--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and caring about another person because Jack Twyman adopted Maurice because that way he could handle all of his affairs legally.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I didn't realize that--
Speaker 2: And Maurice was his teammate.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I remember that part.  So, would, could we put, make that number one on the list?
Speaker 2: It certainly, not many persons saw it because it was PG and there's no controversy, no shoot outs and none of that stuff--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but it was a very interesting film.  I did another film called 'Brothers,' which was the story of the love affair, the unrequited love affair of George Jackson and [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis, a true story.  As you know George Jackson was shot down in prison, in the prison yard.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he'd gone from thug to activist.  When he first came to prison, he was a thug, but through self-introspection and reading and beginning to understand the system and its oppressiveness and how it can demean and destroy people, and he met Angela Davis, and they would have these meetings and they fell in love, but they never, he never got out of prison.  They never could touch--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so it was unrequited love.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Good, that's a good film.  These are, if you can get these on tapes, on a tape.
Speaker 1: I will make it a point.
Speaker 2: They may be coming out in DVD, but years ago there was no DVD it was just tape.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's, that one is interesting too.  And then I did a movie of the week for television called 'Ring of Passion,' and I played Joe Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's about the two fights he had with Max Schmeling and how it impacted the, the world and the war.  The first was 1936, World War II [WWII] was coming--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and Hitler [Adolf Hitler] was fast rising with the Aryan supremacy posture and that Schmeling was going to destroy this black beast, et cetera, et cetera, and then of course Joe was distracted.  He was very popular and he was spending and he didn't take Schmeling seriously and Schmeling did beat him--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and that just, he just, it just hurt him badly because people said, "Joe," the black people, "Joe, you let us down," because I am old enough to remember when Joe Louis fought, all the black folks gathered around the radio and listened.  He meant a lot because we had so few heroes--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --from which to gather anything that was meaningful for us in the collective as a people.  And so two years old he fought Schmeling again and almost killed him.
Speaker 1: Right.  And 'Ring of Passion' captures both of those fights--
Speaker 2: Both fights.
Speaker 1: --saying what had happened.
Speaker 2: So, the second fight after this, Hitler's aggression, and they kept saying, "Joe you got to stop this guy."  You don't know what this means.  And Joe said, "I'm not political, I'm just a boxer."  It means more than that Joe, that was always on him.  And then they said, "Are you afraid of him, you can't beat him can you?"  And he didn't like that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so when they fought in the second round he knocked Schmeling out.  He broke three ribs, gave him a concu- he almost killed him.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: This sort of quiet gentle guy.  Joe was a very sweet guy.
Speaker 1: But, inside--
Speaker 2: He was boiling--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and when the bell rang he came out there and just whooped the crap out of him.  But ironically because I had to research it, he and Max Schmeling became friends--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and remained so until Schmeling died--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Joe died first.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Joe was a greeter in Las Vegas [Nevada], and whenever Schmeling came to America he would always go to Vegas to see Joe.
Speaker 1: You know if I had to guess, there're three things, or a few things these three films have in common, but most of all they are true stories--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: -- of compassion and determination and true stories of African American males (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) African American men who have as we say, cojones.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the other thing they have in common is, I have never heard of any of them, none of them had received any notoriety (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were off the radar, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, and there's another one ['A House Divided: Denmark Vesey's Rebellion'] of course in which Larry Crowe and I watched Thursday in which you said, "Be strong, Denmark--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --I'll be strong for both of us."
Speaker 2: Denmark Vesey.
Speaker 1: Denmark Vesey.
Speaker 2: Rebellion.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: And most folks have no idea who Denmark Vesey was.
Speaker 1: To this day.  And those who saw that said it was fiction.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it wasn't fiction though.
Speaker 1: And it wasn't fiction.
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 475329
Speaker 1: You're doing films now, and NBC comes to you to offer you an opportunity for a series.  How does that come about?  Can you give us some of the details?
Speaker 2: Well, as I recall Stan--oh my goodness it's terrible, African American man, was a producer, Stan Robertson [Stanley Robertson].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And he was going to produce this show, and Ivan Dixon was to direct the pilot, and I went in for the interview and they selected me, and that's how it went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Ivan was never, and he smiles at this, but I say, "It's true Ivan, you didn't want me."  He said, "No I didn't."  He didn't think I could do it.  For some reason he just didn't think I was the guy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so we--
Speaker 1: And Ivan is very much like yourself, huh.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He's gonna give you the truth always (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah absolutely, and that's why from that day we became really good friends because we don't slack off.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I was not offended that I wasn't his choice.  That happens all the time in this business--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I mean a lot.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You see films that are very successful and the guy wins an Oscar [Academy Award], and he was actually the third choice.  Nobody wanted him at all.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but that's the way it worked out.  The other two guys weren't available, you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So you understand that it's okay.  So, Ivan said, "I just thought Bernie's [HistoryMaker Bernie Casey] not the guy for this."  So, the very first day of shooting, I had the five actors that were playing my children, and there was a scene where I was off camera--
Speaker 1: First give us what that family was like, 'Harris and Company.'
Speaker 2: Okay, 'Harris and Company' was a story about an African American man who was a crackerjack mechanic and had a tow truck business, and this, and a wonderful happy marriage and five children, and his wife became ill, this is the backstory, we didn't see this, and she dies.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So he's now a widower with his children, and it's an hour drama, not a comedy, and hour too.  And so he goes into business with a service station owner.  He becomes the tow truck guy with his own tow truck, they became business partners, and so, and they also were friends, and so that's how he made a living.  But, what was interesting, and this was before 'Cosby' ['The Cosby Show'], or was it?
Speaker 1: I think it was (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cosby' came in the '80s [1980s] didn't it?
Speaker 1: I think, 'Cosby' came in the late '70s [1970s] or '80s [1980s] yeah.
Speaker 2: It was before 'Cosby.'  So, we had, as you had alluded to, primarily had television fare of blacks sort of shucking and jiving and cooning, and he was not that at all, and I said, "It's important that we establish a certain amount of humanity in this man, of integrity and his resistance to compromise," and they said okay.  So, that was the story and each week we shot four shows.  They only gave us a commitment for four shows.  You can't sustain an audience in four weeks.
Speaker 1: No you can't.
Speaker 2: So, it was destined not to be on.  The response to it was humongous among African Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Once they found it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You got to, it takes them a couple of shows to find the damn thing.
Speaker 1: Say, by the third or fourth week they found it.
Speaker 2: And we were gone.
Speaker 1: Who wrote that show?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But Ivan directed two of them, and also it was a two-hour movie of the week.  It was a pilot--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --and then it sold and we got an order for four--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and Ivan directed two of them.  But, during that, during that two-hour movie of the week I was off camera and my four, five kids were on camera saying something, some scene about are we gonna go do something daddy, and I was watching them, and before they rolled I'd say to one, "Your eyes alert, eyes alert, come on be into it, be into it."  I mean I was just able to touch them and they'd perk right up, and like, I became their daddy immediately and Ivan said, "Oh my goodness," and he was sold then.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then he said, "Oh my goodness," because I was able to just touch them and so we melded quickly.
Story_ID: 475330
Speaker 1: You would see things you never saw, like one of the hours my son, my youngest son, who was played by Dain Turner, and he was like eight, but Dain was really about ten in real life.  And he got sick and we didn't know what it was, and so there's a scene in the hospital where I go see him, and I'm talking to him, and I start to cry and I tell him how much I loved him and I hugged him.  He said, "I love you too, daddy." They'd never seen that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --with black people on television.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know what I mean (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Well, you were saying they, but black or white folks had never seen it.
Speaker 1: No, no, and he's got on his little dirty tow truck driver clothes but he came right to the hospital--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and told his son he loved him and hugged him, and there's a scene where his son played the guitar, had a little band, and he had done something that his father said not to do.  I think he stayed out too late or something, and he came in and I was sitting up waiting for him when he came in.  And it was a wonderful scene where he just talked to him logically about right and wrong.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you know what I mean?  You lied to me.  I said so and so, you said you would, you didn't--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and the kid almost started to cry, "I'm sorry dad."  It was just--we had never seen those images ever.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then of course--
Speaker 2: We didn't believe they existed.
Speaker 1: Well then when 'Cosby' ['The Cosby Show'] came along that was the same kind of imagery--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --except they were professional.  She was a lawyer and he's a doctor.
Speaker 2: But more importantly 'Cosby' had more than four shows (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, he had about eight years or something.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Do you know the back story of how they were able to get that, because I'm sure there were NBC executives who were saying, "Nobody's going to buy it, you know.  We're gonna lose money on it."  You know, I'm sure there were the naysayers.
Speaker 1: There was a favor owed.  That's why they only gave them four.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They said, "We'll give them four and they'll be out of here," and we were.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But, they didn't fight us badly because we had sort of a good vision of it and we said, "We're not gonna coon and we're not gonna tap dance and be laughing at things that are not funny, yuk, yuk, yuk, yuk, you know."
Speaker 2: Or telling 'Amos 'n' Andy' jokes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  We just said, this is a family of consequence and value and we love each other, and that's what we wanted to show is a tremendous love.
Speaker 2: Since I, you know since it was on I've heard questions and mostly blacks, but a lot of whites also, how did they ever, who made the mistake (laughter) of allowing the show ['Harris and Company'] to get on because it was such a real show, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: --but of course they covered themselves--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --only four issues.
Story_ID: 475331
Speaker 1: Following 'Harris and Company,' what were your other television pieces (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did--
Speaker 1: Or disappointments?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I did some television.  I tried to do more film, or back in those times, we did more what they called MOWs, movies of the week.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So two-hour films done for television, but it's still like a movie.  So, I tried to do those--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, because the series you got then were not what you wanted to do.  You have 'Good Times,' 'That's My Mama,' those kinds of shows which just did not appeal to me at all--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and I was able to do some good films in the meantime that kept me in a career.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I never considered myself a star.  I considered myself a working actor.
Speaker 1: Now, do you think you may have suffered some in the industry, minor blackballing if you will because you did have such high standards, and refused to do shuffling and shucking, shucking and jiving, you know, parts?
Speaker 2: Sometimes your agents would allow you an interview, and this is what it is, you go, "No, I'm not gonna even go do it, I'm not gonna do the interview."
Speaker 1: Did you--and you had some instances like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah okay.
Speaker 2: But you have to decide what is important to you and where your integrity lies, and when you've made your journey and this begins to resonate more clearly as you get older, when you hear people say what would you like people to say about you when you pass on.  You know when you're thirty-eight and you go, "What are you talking about," you know (laughter).  But, when you get up there you think, you know, hm, and I think we all want to believe that we will be held in some good regard and I want to, I trust that I will have left some footprints in the sand.
Speaker 1: And I was gonna ask you that question toward the end, but let me go to--there were some films that you did that, where, where you did stand up and I can remember one in which you pulled my coattail, you and Georg Stanford Brown on something called 'Beulah Land.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I believe they had tried to recruit you for that film.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was just, yeah I think we spoke in Baltimore [Maryland] or something didn't we, about that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And Georg spoke and I spoke and said that you know, it's demeaning how they approach you and misunderstand what's important, and born out of their own ignorance they victimize you because they are so reluctant and resistant to common sense and humanity.
Speaker 1: This was a film by David Gerber, and he had won two Image Awards [NAACP Image Awards] and felt that he could do this film.
Speaker 2: I like David too because I used to do--the business changed so much, back in those days, they would sometimes call you and say, "We got a role for you, here it is."  You don't have to audition or anything because they knew, after a while they knew your work and who you were.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, he did an hour show called 'Police Story.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That was David Gerber.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And they were good.
Speaker 1: Oh they won Image Awards [NAACP Image Awards].
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were good.  And he'd call and say, "Bernie [HistoryMaker Bernie Casey] I got a thing, I want you to play a cop for me."  Said, okay.  I mean he did have a consciousness.
Speaker 1: You trusted him?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in the police stories I did.
Speaker 1: Right, right.

Speaker 1: Today you look at 'Roots,' it doesn't hold up.  It looks ridiculous.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But at the time it was seminal.  It was just absolutely seminal.
Speaker 2: So, you were in 'Roots'--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and how did that--
Speaker 1: Wasn't everybody (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes that's true, that's the truth.  On reflection, how do you feel about your role on there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I have, I take no truck with that and the fact that it was done at all and that they, we know the story that they were afraid of it, so they ran it eight nights in a row as opposed to eight weeks in a row--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and that's what killed everybody 'cause it just slaughtered everybody viewer wise.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: The nation got hooked immediately, and we all watched it.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But, there were some real fudging and some real compromise, and they felt it was too harsh then.  But you look at it now, and you go that was a joke.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  It was like most films, and you're well aware of this, it's an accommodation you know.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Okay I'm gonna let you have this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but it's only gonna be for four weeks--
Speaker 1: Right yeah.
Speaker 2: --and so forth and so on.
Story_ID: 475333
Speaker 1: Any other comments you have about your career and the films, your art career, what you're doing in education, any--
Speaker 2: I think.
Speaker 1: --we may have left out about your football career?
Speaker 2: No, the football is, I'm--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it's so passing beyond my remembrances that when people bring it up I go, oh.  They'll say, "That game against Baltimore [Baltimore Colts; Indianapolis Colts] you scored," I thought, "I did?"  (Laughter) Yeah, so, but I'm glad that I did it.  I--what was interesting is that I had a difficult time trying to kill the football monster.  I would never talk about it--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because when you show up on the set they wanted to talk football.  Well now I'm an old man, it was a thousand years ago, but then I just wouldn't do it because you get pigeonholed and seen in a very limited capacity, and they would take great issue at your--deciding that you could actually act--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so they wanna give you little bit parts where you just sort of knock people down or something stupid and I just would not be a party to any of that.
Story_ID: 475334
Speaker 1: During the break we were asking the question, so let's come back and ask, you had said on reflection, going back and looking at 'Roots' today you feel it falls short.
Speaker 2: Way short.
Speaker 1: Way short.  Would you like to discuss that?
Speaker 2: It falls short because in the time that it was done, it was done always to kind of appease white people.  They didn't want to shock them too much lest they turn away and not watch it because they tried to sally away from tremendous guilt feelings and all of that, and that always comes up when you begin to talk about reparations and slavery and bestiality they get very nervous because they don't want to feel any guilt reflexes about it, and when you, when I speak truthfully I've probably spoken to thirty or forty, fifty universities over the years, I lecture a lot, and you say to them, "Please understand that much of the behavior of white people is born out of the fact that white people don't like black people, and they never have, in the collective."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: White folks will select certain ones that they think are pretty wonderful.  They love Oprah [Oprah Winfrey], they like Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell].  They love Sidney Poitier.  I can go through, but in the collective they don't like black people and they never have.  One is because they have always considered African Americans a vanquished people, now hear me well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They have no regard for them because they were slaves and in their minds in the residuals of their unconscious that's still there.  So, they're not about to say you are equal with me when you were a slave.  And white people feel very privileged.  They came here with that whole arrogance.  Brigands and ruffians and persons born on deception, but that was okay.  And they came here committing genocide.  Europeans came here with genocide in mind, and they carried it out.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The indigenous persons whom they called Indians [Native Americans], a misnomer, they were never Indians.  Christopher Columbus got lost.  He was going to sail to India.  He got lost and never got to India.  He got to an island called Hispaniola.  So, he says, "Oh this, this is the West Indies."  He just made it up right and because white folks write things down (laughter) and put them in books we believe that that's the truth.  So, what happened is that from that point on they began to murder the indigenous people.  There are estimates there are about 25 million indigenous people when the Europeans got here and they soon had it down to about a million.  Well what happened to them, they all got the flu?  They killed them.  Now, that's the truth.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But they don't want to hear that because they will give you a lot of misinformation about being Christian people, and God-fearing, which is blasphemous because if that were so you wouldn't kill other human beings.  So, that confliction is always there.  So, what has happened is that when he misnamed them and said these are Indians, they've been Indians ever since, and they are not Indians, but the Europeans had so much arrogance they wouldn't say what and who do you call yourself.  I mean the same thing in Africa.  They talk about tribes, and they weren't tribes they were nations.  The Mohawk nation (background noise), the Iroquois nation, do you know?
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: They were sovereign nations--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --that was all put asunder.
Story_ID: 475335
Speaker 1: I've asked you this question or you've answered it one way, but you might want to answer it a different way, and that is, if you, what should, would you like your legacy to be, what you've left here for everyone of the world?
Speaker 2: Well, as we get older we want to believe that we are of some worth and consequence, and it becomes a valuable entertainment in your mind more than what have you done.  You don't think much about that when you're young.  Once you're gonna live forever, and of course you won't, but when you realize that there's more time behind you than in front of you and you want to think, I hope I did some worldly good.  I hope I was graceful and contributory and a God-fearing man, and that when my name is mentioned that you pray that they'll say, "You know what he was a nice man," and in that way as I said before you want to believe that I'll leave some footprints in the sand.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there anything that I may have left out in these two interviews that you can think of that you would like for us to cover here?
Speaker 2: I enjoy so speaking at universities and colleges because I am able to impart to them a lot of knowledge that they don't think about.  They don't understand and I try to allow them that don't be so trusting because people are facilely (unclear) hoodwinking you.  The media does it all the time.  You look at what Bush [President George Walker Bush] is doing and his administration.  There's a lot of chicanery in how certain things will just suddenly disappear.  The comment that Bennett [William Bennett] made was reprehensible, but there's no ire.  Where's the ire about that.  Things like that you have to be willing to examine that.  I mean, they tried to sort of soft soak Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], but a lot of the reporters finally said you can't, my God this is horrendous, and it kind of sort of caught on--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --how awful it was.  They were gonna assume--Bush showed up days late with photo-op posture hugging people saying, "We're gonna be fine."
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: Excuse me, we're not gonna recover from this for decades, and speak to that. So, we have--when I talk to young people I say, "Don't you allow yourself to be bamboozled."  Because someone says it's true, doesn't make it true.  You can call an elephant a giraffe, it doesn't make it a giraffe, and don't believe everything you hear, or everything you read.  When you read something in a magazine or a book and you get the flavor of it, whether you like it or not, just say, "Now who wrote this?"  And sometimes when you look up the writer, you find this guy was a horrendous guy who wrote this.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: Just had an agenda.
Speaker 2: Yes, he had an agenda.  So, be ever mindful of that so that you will be able to stand fast on the path of righteousness, and be steadfast in your commitment to be a good person because I believe that good does triumph.
Speaker 1: Right, I believe that.  Okay, the, we want to thank you very, very much for this Bernie [HistoryMaker Bernie Casey].
Speaker 2: I thank you for having me, sir.
Speaker 1: I know you have a very strong opinion on everything and I appreciate that and I hope that you can share that with everyone in this entire world because they need to hear your words.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
