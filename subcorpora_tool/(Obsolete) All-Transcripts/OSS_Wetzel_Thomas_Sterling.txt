 Gill. Today is February 9, 2010. I   m visiting with Dr.  Thomas Sterling Wetzel here on the Oklahoma State University campus  in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories  project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program.  Thomas, I appreciate you taking time to be with us today. I know you   ve  been a long time faculty member in the School of Accounting at  Oklahoma State, but for awhile I   d like to visit with you about your early  life, then we   ll get back to your OSU experiences. Can you tell me a  little bit about where you grew up, something about your parents and  your family?  I grew up in Chicago, Illinois. I was born and reared in Chicago. Mother  and Father, an older sister and an older brother   not me, I   m the  youngest of three children. My father was a tobacco salesperson and my  mother was a social worker. My mother got her degrees from the  University of Chicago and all three of us went to college and got  degrees. My sister has a bachelor   s degree and my brother has a  bachelor   s and a master   s degree. He   s a retired Episcopalian priest. I  got three degrees   a bachelor   s, a master   s and a PhD. The parents can  rest peacefully knowing that we should be productive citizens, anyway.  You talked about your brother; did you have any other brothers and  sisters?  Yes. I have an older sister that got a degree in chemistry. My brother got  a degree in English and he   s a priest, so he got a master   s in divinity, and  then me   three of us.  Now obviously education was valued in your family.  Very important.  5  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Where did that come from?  My mother   s side of the family. My grandfather on my mother   s side  was a M.D. My grandmother on my mother   s side was the first black  woman to graduate from Northwestern University   s dental school. She  had her office in the sun parlor of my mother   s home.  She was a dentist?  She was a dentist.  And then her husband was a     M.D. During the Depression, my mother said there used to be bread  lines outside her house, because her father would feed people. This is an  old story that my sister and brother and I always tell. We were never  asked if we wanted to go to college. It was just understood in our house;  it was just understood.  Wasn   t an option. Thomas, share a little bit of some values you learned,  life lessons from your family that stayed with you the rest of your life.  The one thing that I can remember that has stayed with me all my life is  to be honest. When I was rearing my two daughters, I always told them,     Hey, look. You can do anything but do not ever come in this house and  lie to me. If you broke the neighbor   s window and you come in this  house and I say,    Did you break the neighbor   s window?    You better  fess up.    That   s the one thing. I   ll tell you what, I never lied at home,  because I was afraid. I was afraid. We used to get double whammy at  my house. My mother never touched us but my mother could make you  feel like you were about that big. She  would say,     I   m so  disappointed.    And then when my dad would get home, she would tell  him and then he would do the physical part. (Laughs)  The discipline.  Honesty to me is the best policy.  So you grew up in Chicago and then you got your bachelor   s degree in  accounting in 1974 and your MBA a year later at Northern Illinois  University.  Yes, I did.  Can you share a little bit about your student experiences at Northern  Illinois?  6  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Okay, I had a full scholarship to Northern Illinois University in 1961,  when I graduated from high school. And I, for lack of another term,  blew that, basically. I just had fun for three semesters. They call it  academic dismissal now; we used to call it    flunking out.    I flunked out  after three semesters. But I took three. Most people only took two, but I  took three so I was pretty good. (Laughter) Then I just kind of became a  bum   a frat bum and all that kind of stuff.  The best thing that ever happened to me was in May of 1966, I had to  take a physical for the draft, because they still had the draft then. This  lady at the draft board said,    Oh, you   ll be drafted here shortly.    I was  taking some courses in junior college to try to avoid the draft. The lady  said,    I don   t care. Your class has graduated.    And she was right,  because my class graduated in    65. I got my draft notice on June 13,  1966 and reported for duty on July 20, 1966. That   s when I grew up.  That   s when I became a real man. I was very irresponsible. A party was  more important than doing anything. I   d held a few jobs here and there  but nothing very responsible. In the military I realized, this is the place  that you can   t quit. Back then, you didn   t just walk into the first  sergeant   s office and say,    I quit this.    You had to fess up. You had to  play the game. I realized that the road of least resistance in the military  was to jump when you were told to jump, and then ask how high later.  And I grew up.  Now this was just a quirk. This was just a real quirk is what this was. I  was taking basic training at Fort Polk, Louisiana, July, August,  September   a little hot. They used to make announcements in the  morning of what was going to happen during the day. One of the things  they said on this particular day was,    Okay men,    I think it was two  o   clock, or twenty-two and three, a bus was going to pull up and if you  wanted to take the OCS  Officer Candidate School  qualifying exam,  you could get on that bus and go take the exam.  Which was for the officer qualifying school?  Yes, Officer Candidate School qualifying exam. I hadn   t planned to do  this, but we were in these pits and it was hot. We had sawdust all over us  and all that. I saw that bus pull up and I said,    Well, I   m just going to  take that bus to get in the air conditioning to get out of this mess.    So I  went over there and got on the bus   went to take this exam. I really  wasn   t concerned. About a week later, my company commander,  Captain Hammond himself   I   ll never forget him   called me in his  office. He sits me down on the couch and we have casual conversation.  He says,    Private Wetzel, you know you got the highest score on the  Officer Candidate School exam in the brigade. You got the highest score  in the entire brigade.    I said,    Thank you.    He said,    So you   ve got to go  7  to Officer Candidate School.    I said,    No, I don   t think so. Nope. I   m  two and out. That   s it, and I   m under two right now.     So he bugged me. He bugged me for probably three weeks. The third  week, he called me in   I was really impressed with what he had done.  He had done a background check on my family and all that. He said,     Well you know, Thomas, it looks to me like you   ve come from pretty  first class roots. Your grandfather was an MD, your grandmother was a  dentist, your mother graduated from the University of Chicago, your  aunt graduated from the University of Chicago; that   s pretty good roots.     I said,    You are correct.    He said,    So why do you want to be a private  the rest of your life when you can be an officer?    He convinced me and I  went to Officer Candidate School. That was probably the very, very,  very best thing I ever did was go to Officer Candidate School. In Officer  Candidate School, which was very competitive, by the way, I convinced  myself that I could do the work and I could get it done. And we run  very, very tight schedules. You did this from five to seven, you did this  from seven to nine, lights went out at nine o   clock and so on. I was  almost a distinguished military graduate except for my gunnery grades     but we   ll discuss that later. (Laughter) That   s where I kind of figured  out, maybe I   m not stupid after all. I kind of felt like I was dumb after I  flunked out of school. My buddies kept moving and here I was not  making much progress. That   s where I got the urge.  When I got out of the military, my goal was to go back to college. That  was it. I made a promise to my mother. I was finishing college   at least  getting a bachelor   s degree. I reapplied at Northern Illinois University  and got accepted. I just treated school like a job. If you can work eight  hours a day, you can treat school like that. If I had three classes in a day,  then I would owe myself five hours of study at a minimum. Sometimes  you work overtime, so maybe six hours, something like that. That   s what  I did all the way through my career. I finished my undergraduate degree.  I   m very proud of the fact that I ended up with an almost 2.8 GPA  starting off with a 1.8. I made a 3.67 in my last sixty hours.  Then, I went to graduate school only because they had  the  GI Bill.  Back then you had the GI bill for a certain number of months. So I got  my master   s degree on the GI Bill. Then I was ready to go back to work  and one of my mentors, a fellow named Donald E. Kieso (who has  written the most popular selling intermediate accounting textbooks for  the last thirty years) told me I was not going back to work, that I was  going to work for him. I was going to teach for him, because he was the  department head at that point in Northern Illinois. I told him,    I   ll give  you a minimum of two, a maximum of three years. Then, I   m working  on a PhD.    Unbeknownst to me, he was good friends with Wilton  Anderson here at OSU.  8  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  He was head the School of Accounting at OSU.  Yes.  Thomas, you finished your bachelor   s degree, was it in accounting?  Yes.  Where did your interest in accounting come from? Is there someone in  the family who     That   s a good question. When I graduated from high school, my high  school advisor said,    Thomas, you should major in either mathematics,  architecture or accounting.    Those were the three things she said I  should concentrate on. During a couple of the summers in Chicago, I  went to summer school. In going to summer school, I used to take  classes I was good in. So I had five years of English, because I took  English in summer school. I had five years of math and I took math in  summer school. I was tired in those courses. When I started college back  then   I don   t know if you remember back in the sixties, you declared a  major when you got on a campus. That   s what we had to do. I   m in this  long line and then there   s a nice lady sitting there. She says,    Oh Mr.  Wetzel, how are you today?    and all that stuff.    What do you want to  major in?    I   d ruled out math and ruled out English. So I said,     Architecture.    She said,    We don   t have architecture here.    Northern  Illinois used to be one of the normal schools   it was a teacher   s college  basically. They didn   t have architecture. So I saw this table over there  and it said accounting. I said,    Oh, I   ll just major in accounting.     (Laughter) I had no idea what it was   I really didn   t. When I was in  high school, only the dumb-dumbs took bookkeeping and stenography  and all that. I was an honors student in high school so I couldn   t take any  of that, so I didn   t know. I just said,    Accounting.    That was it. That   s  the honest to God   s truth. That   s all I knew, that she said,    Architecture,  accounting or math,    and that   s where I ended up.  You   d assume in your normal career track you   d do a master   s in  accounting, but you did an MBA. Why an MBA?  I had an accounting emphasis on the MBA. All of my electives were in  accounting. Then, I just decided to go that route because I wasn   t  planning on teaching. I was planning on going back to work. I was  planning on going back into industry. I figured that would have been a  better degree than a master   s in accounting.  Picking up your story then, the professor you were talking about that  wanted you to teach under him, were you a graduate teaching assistant?  9  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Yes, I was. Then, I taught for that two years for him   I was like an  adjunct instructor.  That was in    76        76 and    77. I came here in the fall of 1977.  So your professor there at Northern Illinois   back to our conversation  earlier   had a tie with Wilton Anderson, so he said,    Go to OSU to do  your PhD in accounting,   ?  I have no idea. I   ll tell you   this is a funny story, too. I had a friend that  I used to hang out with. They were a group of instructors I used to hang  out with. This one girl said to me one day,    Have you filled out any  applications?    I said,    No, I haven   t filled out an application.    She said,     Look. You   ve got to get an application filled out because I   ve got a  whole drawer full.    It just so happened  the  Oklahoma State University   application  was the top one. So I said,    Okay, I will fill out one before  Thanksgiving.    This is 1976. I reached in the drawer, took out that  application, filled it out, sent it here. Next thing I know, about a week  later I get this phone call from Oklahoma State University. They said I  had been accepted into the PhD program. I said,    What?     I went in and  I told Donald Kieso that I had been accepted. He just played dumb. He  said,    Oh. Congratulations. That   s good.    He knew all that happened so  I threw all the other applications away. I had Virginia Tech, Mississippi  State, Tennessee; they were all in that drawer. It just so happens that that  was the top one. That   s how all that happened. I had no clue until I came  here to interview. I came here to interview in February    77. Wilton T.  Anderson, intimidating person that he is, gave me all these papers to  sign. I didn   t even read them, I just signed them. As I was signing the  papers, he said,    Tell that Don Kieso person I said hello and thanks for  sending you. He has a very special place in my heart.    That   s when I  figured it out. (Laughter)  Connected the dots right then.  That   s when the dots came together. That   s how I ended up coming here  as a PhD student.  So you had a teaching assistantship then while you were working on  your PhD?  Yes, I did.  You were teaching some intermediate     10  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  No, I taught the two beginning classes in accounting the entire time I  was here.  You talked about Dr. Anderson. I want to ask you some questions about  Dr. Anderson. He   s a legend here at Oklahoma State and our School of  Accounting   headed that up for years. I   d heard, and maybe you can  help me with this because you were there over the years, that he had  these relationships like with your professor there at Northern Illinois.  There were two ways that he would do it. They   d send in some of their  brightest students to do their PhD here or he would grow his own here  at OSU and do their master   s or maybe bachelor   s here and send them  out there where they   d get a doctorate and then return back for the  faculty; it was a way to build up his faculty.  Yes, he had that relationship with Michigan State, University of  Southern Mississippi   those are the two strongest ones I can think of.  Those two for sure.  When you were there, this would have been a little bit later in Dr.  Anderson   s career. Was he still teaching the introductory  courses ?  Yes, he was.  I   d heard that he insisted on teaching those  courses  himself because he  wanted them to learn accounting     And he wanted to pick out good students. He used to literally buy  students into the program. (Laughs) He   d take them to lunch and bribe  them.  And offer them a scholarship?  Yes.  So you   re saying then, he wanted to teach it for two reasons. One is  because he wanted to be sure they learned accounting correctly from the  beginning. Then two, he wanted to identify the outstanding students so  he could recruit them.  That   s it.  Because a lot of those weren   t necessarily at that time accounting  majors. Maybe they were finance or general business. (Laughs)  That was his ploy. But he   s the most intimidating person I   ve ever  encountered. He is intimidating. To this day, he still intimidates me.  11  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Even though he   s a jokester, he still intimidates me.  Did you have any classes under Dr. Anderson?  No, I didn   t. He only taught  the  principles class. That   s it. He never  taught any of the other classes.  Do you have some favorite Andy Anderson stories? You   ve got to have  some good ones on him.  The best one I can come up with is my wife and I got married over  Christmas in 1979. Generally, during the summer, Andy would give the  PhD students  500. I went in and asked him if I could get that  500  dollars six months in advance because I was getting married when I  went home. He said,    Oh fine. That   s fine.    So he gave me that money  before I left and went home for Christmas. Now this is back in 1979.  Andy is in Sterling House or one of those places now   kind of going  through the Alzheimer   s thing. I went to visit him. Four other professors  and I went over to visit Andy. He remembered Lanny  Chasteen  and  Jim Boatsman and so forth. He looks at me and he says,    How   s that  wife of yours doing? She   s got a heavy burden to carry.    Now, how did  he remember that? He just laughed. He thought that was the funniest  thing in the world. (Laughter) That   s all he said,    She has a heavy  burden to carry.    (Laughter) The other thing about Andy that I thought  was kind of unique is the world to him was very black and white. He  either liked you or he didn   t like you. There was no in between. I have  seen him go into a crowd of say, five people, and shake four of their  hands and skip one of them.  Wow.  To him, that   s the way life was. Either you were okay or you weren   t  okay. That   s it. So it was always good to be on his good side.  He was pretty stark on who he wanted to be associated with.  Oh, yes.  Thomas, you indirectly alluded to it, but in your opinion, how strong of  an influence was he on the School of Accounting?  He is the School of Accounting. They ought to name the School of  Accounting    The Wilton T. Anderson School of Accounting    as far as  I   m concerned.  What did he do, in your opinion, to deserve to have the school named  12  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  after him?  He put it on the map. It was nothing when he got here. After he had been  here for awhile, he had hyped it to the point that people knew what  Oklahoma State University   they didn   t know about Oklahoma State  University. We   ve had people in the Financial Accounting Standards  Board   Mike Crooch is on the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  Every place can   t claim that.  I understand, and you can certify this   this has been several years ago.  When you take the CPA test, it   s on a regional basis. You   ve got Texas,  Oklahoma and a couple other states in our region, and Oklahoma State  had the highest percentage of graduates taking that and passing it the  first time than any other school.  We had the highest percentage passed   we never had the highest  percentage taken. The University of Texas is much bigger than we are.  We were in that category for awhile, that   s correct.  Are there other faculty members that you recall when you were a  graduate student here? And we   ll get into your later years but as a  graduate student  anyone  that influenced you, other than Andy?  Lanny Chasteen, of course. He was the chairman of my doctoral  committee. It was kind of funny, to me anyway   I had to chuckle. If  you know Lanny, he has that Texas/Arkansas drawl, however you want  to describe it. When he asked if he could be the chairman of my  committee, we were riding around in his old Volkswagen looking for  apartments. When he did that, I almost fell out of the car, because I   m  thinking,    My friends in Chicago would lynch me if they knew I was  going to take this fellow in as a chairman.    (Laughter) But he ended up  being a delightful person and a very, very close friend and we still stay  in contact. But he was very influential in my academic career, yes.  Putting it in perspective then, Lanny later became head of the School of  Accounting.  Yes, he did.  What about diversity in the accounting graduate program at the time  when you came here? Were there other African American students and  other people of color in the program?  Now when I got here, there was Rod Posey, Helen Kennedy, and then I  made three, so there were three of us in the PhD program at the same  time at that point. I was surprised, because I didn   t know. The first night  13  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  I was here I went out to dinner. The person I went out to dinner with was  Rod Posey and I   m thinking,    Hmm.    So Rod, Helen and myself   really  a diverse group. Helen had grandkids, Rod was really young   Rod was  in his twenties, and here I am mid-thirties or something like that. It was  a diverse group. Helen never went to summer school. She went home to  Louisiana every summer. Her husband was a professor at Grambling  State University. Rod and I used to always stay around over the  summertime and worked and so on. Helen graduated and went to  Grambling State University. Rod went back, too. He came from the  University of Southern Mississippi. He   s been associate dean there and  so on. I went back to Northern Illinois University. Then, we kind of had  a dry spell and then when I came back in    86   I guess they started that  PhD project in about    88 or    89, maybe    90. We   ve had quite a few go  through since then. The thing we don   t have is, we don   t have minority  faculty. I   m the first and only African American professor in the School  of Accounting and the School of Business.  In the whole school?  In the whole school, yes. There have never been any other professors,  black or African American   whatever the popular term is   I   m the first  and only. I   m a full professor. If I have my facts right, I   m the third full  professor of color at Oklahoma State University. Earl Mitchell was first,  Pat Bell was second and I was third.  Thomas, going back on your graduate experience, there were three of  you together. You were sort of the three amigos there, I guess. Was it a  positive environment for you at that time? Did you feel comfortable?  When I was a PhD student? Yes. Oh, yes. We had quite a mixture. Andy  did a good job of evaluating students. He didn   t let age or any of that  stuff get in the way. So we had a very diverse group. Like I said, Helen  Kennedy was a grandmother. We went all the way down to Rod, like I  said, being in his mid-twenties. We had them all sprinkled in between  there. We had a diverse group. They were from everywhere     Mississippi, Alabama, Illinois, England   Jim Hall was from England     Virginia; we had a broad base. It was a close-knit group.  The seventies was a time of change on campus here at Oklahoma State  and across the country. Social unrest, et cetera. Did you participate or  witness any of that here?  No, I didn   t. That was when we had all the Iranian stuff and so forth. I  came here with one thing in mind   to get my PhD. I didn   t vary from  that, no. The only outside activity I had was, I went to football games  and basketball games. That was it, nothing else. None of those social  14  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  activities, I didn   t participate with my fraternity. I didn   t do anything  else. School of Accounting classes and that was it.  You earned your PhD in 1980     1980  This is interesting with a minor in Higher Education and  Administration. That   s an interesting combination. What interested you  about higher education and why did you think that would help you?  Well, Lanny kind of convinced me to do that. When I was at Northern  Illinois University, I was Don Kieso   s assistant chairman. That   s how I  got to really be close     Kieso  was the chairman and they appointed me  the assistant. It was during the time when he was writing a new edition  of his textbook. I just told him,    I   ll cover for you. You write. I   ll  cover.    That   s how we got to be good friends. So he could re-write his  book with his co-author and I did most of the department head duties  and all that. So Lanny said,    Well, it looks like you like doing that stuff  and they say you do a good job at that stuff, maybe you ought to take  some higher ed classes.    Higher ed was right across the street. Then, it  was in Gundersen, right across from the Business building. That was  how that happened.  So you went back to Northern Illinois then after you got your PhD,  joined the faculty and you taught for six years?  Yes.  Then, you returned to OSU as an assistant professor in        86. Fall of    86   came back in August    86.  What influenced you to come back? Why did you return to OSU?  I just thought it was time. There are people that believe that you can   t go  home. Maybe I made a mistake in going home, because it wasn   t the  same   it really wasn   t.  Speaking of Northern Illinois   ?  Yes, Northern Illinois University. At that point, we had two kids, but  neither one of them was in school. One was three and the other one was  six months. I had a neighbor on the end of the block   lived on a cul-de-sac  and the fellow on the end of the block was an old education  professor. Wes Schmidt was his name. He was like the father of the  15  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  block. So he caught me one day and he said,    Hey, hey, hey. Somebody  told me you had an opportunity to move.    I said,    Yes, I got an  opportunity. I just haven   t pulled the trigger.    And he said,    Well you   ve  got to pull the trigger. You   ve got to go.    He said,    That oldest of yours  has never met a stranger, the youngest is only about three or four months  old, so you aren   t harming any of their schooling. If you   re going to  move, this is the time to move. That   s an opportunity. You   ve got to take  that.    That was what kind of influenced me. I held off for a long time  and then I just said,    Well, got to go.     Who was the department head at that time that was extending the offer  to you?  Jim Boatsman.  Jim was there just a couple years, wasn   t he? Interim     No, when Andy retired, Jim Boatsman took over. Then, when I came  back in the Fall of    86, Jim took off for Arizona State.  Is that when Lanny then     Then Lanny took over as interim and then he took over as the chair.  Does it give you some sense of comfort that Lanny was the head of the  school, having worked under him as your senior  advisor ?  At first, but that ended quickly, I   ll tell you. We had a few run-ins when  he was chairperson at the time.  What do you remember about Lanny? He was a long-time department  head.  The one thing I remember about him as chairperson that used to really  rub me the wrong way is you could go into his office and discuss  something with him and he   d say,    Well, Andy wouldn   t do that.    Well,  your name is not Andy. (Laughter) This isn   t 1969, either.    Andy  wouldn   t do that.    That used to really frustrate me. He knows to this day  that that still frustrated me.  You alluded to  the fact that  you had some run-ins. Is there anything  you care to     Oh no. No, that was when he would say,    Well, Andy wouldn   t do that.     I knew what that meant. He wasn   t going to do it.  16  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Any favorite Lanny Chasteen stories? He was an avid runner. What do  you remember about him?  The one thing I can remember about him running is  that  he was nosy  as heck when he was running. He would stop at people   s homes if they  were outside and talk   even if he didn   t know them, he would just stop.  If he thought he found a gas leak, he would call the police to find   he  was nosy, nosy. He   s a nosy fellow as far as I   m concerned. But he does  that running religiously.  Thomas, you moved through the tenured faculty ranks to tenured  associate professor to full professor. So reviewing our conversation, not  only were you the first tenured black faculty in the accounting school but  in the College of Business. Is that a source of pride for you?  Yes, it is. I just wish we had more. We don   t get any in. We don   t get  any. We   ve interviewed a couple and management   s interviewed a  couple but it   s hard to get   I remember we had an old president who  made this comment. I think it was John Campbell,    It   s hard to get  people to come here and it   s hard to get them to leave.    (Laughter)  Turnover is very low   at least in our college, it is.  As an African American academician, did you sense the bar was set any  higher for you as you were moving through your tenure track?  At times, yes, but there   s nothing I can do about that. My mother used to  always say,    Caucasians make us better, because they do set the bar  higher.    And if you think about it   just think about it, you   re an old  athlete. When African Americans or blacks or Negroes or whatever the  popular term is these days began to integrate in some of these places,  they played. They didn   t sit on the bench; they played. There were no  blacks on the bench. Now you can go to an NBA game, you   ve got six  blacks on the bench. Back in the old days, Willie Mays didn   t sit on the  bench. Jackie Robinson didn   t sit on the bench. Larry Doby didn   t sit on  the bench. Those people played. There was none of this substitute stuff.  They played. They came up and they played. Why? Because they were  better than the rest of them. So yes, I think so. Since I didn   t set the bar,  there was no way for me to modify the bar.  Thomas, from your perspective, are there some perceived or real issues  related to recruitment, promotion and tenure? Is that the issue? What   s  your perspective on that?  I don   t want to get in the promotion and tenure stuff, but it   s not as  independent as everybody thinks it is. There are ways to manipulate the  system. I   ve seen it manipulated. For example, outside reviewers: I  17  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  know the right people to send letters to as outside reviewers if I want  this reaction and I know the right persons to send it to if I want this  reaction.  You   re saying outsider reviewer for     Tenure and promotion or whatever. And if you think that process is  independent   if anybody thinks that process is independent, they   re  wrong.  They   re na  ve, huh?  Yes. All it takes is a phone call or an email,    What do you want me to  say?     In your opinion, what diversity issues, if any, has the university made  some progress on from the time you first came here to now, in your  tenure?  Oh, faculty, for sure   black faculty. The staff is much larger than it used  to be   much larger, more faculty. Now staff, I can   t speak to. But there  seem to be many more black faculty. I don   t know the status but I think  there are more black faculty than we   ve had. In defense   and maybe  I   m making an excuse for the university now, but this is not a place for a  young person of color to come and have a social life. If you   re twenty-nine  years old or thirty years old and single, you don   t live in Stillwater,  Oklahoma   at least I wouldn   t. I   d want to live in Louisville or Atlanta  or Chicago, or someplace like that. What are you going to do in  Stillwater on the weekend? So the social life is not conducive to meeting  people     Particularly if you want to meet someone of color     And of your age area. So to me, that   s the biggest culprit about this  place. That   s the biggest. I   m surprised when we get people in their  thirties coming in. I just saw a girl that works in the library that   s in her  thirties. I   m surprised she came.  To change the subject a little bit, what classes have you taught through  the years? What are your favorite classes?  Principles 1 and 2, Intermediate 1, Intermediate 2, Auditing and  Advanced Auditing. My favorite class I ever taught is Advanced  Auditing   my graduate Advanced Auditing class. That   s my favorite  class.  18  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  I   ve got to challenge you a little bit. I noticed on your resume it appears  that you have a special interest in auditing from organizations,  presentations you   ve made, articles that you   ve written, classes you   ve  taught; why auditing? Some people don   t have a real high opinion of  auditors.  I like auditing because first of all, you change teams periodically. You   re  not working with the same people all the time and you aren   t in the  office all the time. Auditors are out and about. I   ve interned with a  couple of public accounting firms and I   ve been to some very unique  places. I   ve been to a plastics manufacturer, I   ve been to a gourmet food  place, what else   I   m just trying to highlight some stuff. I   ve been in  some situations where, basically, the client has given us two shopping  bags; one with all the checks and one with all the receipts, and we were  supposed to audit that firm. So it   s been fun. It   s a fun, fun thing. I like  the challenge of auditing as opposed to sitting in one office every day  doing property, plant and equipment or something like that.  So two bags, would that be more like forensic accounting? (Laughs)  Almost. (Laughter)  Thomas, let me brag on you just a little bit. You   ve been very active in  professional accounting society, Beta Alpha Psi, throughout your career  and you ultimately served as president in your organization   national  president, which is impressive. This is a significant honor. How does it  feel to have been honored by your national association like that?  It was quite an honor. I was kind of choked up when I   well, first of all,  when I got the phone call asking me if I was willing to accept the  position, I was kind of choked up. I took over the reins in Hawaii and I  didn   t think it would be as difficult to accept and make a little  presentation as it turned out. But it was very difficult. There are a  thousand people sitting in that room   students and colleagues. You have  to say something that makes sense and so on, so it was kind of strange. I  enjoyed it and I spent probably twelve years of my career with Beta  Alpha Psi   the national Beta Alpha Psi. I probably could have made full  professor before that if I concentrated more on research, but that   s what I  like doing.  Obviously, throughout your career  at Oklahoma State  something you  enjoyed is athletics. You   ve served on OSU   s Athletic Council and the  sports committee, the Faculty Council. From these collective  experiences, you must have a unique perspective on collegiate athletics  and the student athlete concept. Can you share your philosophy and  your thoughts on value or lack of value in collegiate athletics?  19  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Okay. I   m a believer that intercollegiate athletics are a very important  part of the university. I don   t think it   s a separate element. It   s a part of  the university. If I can use this term, maybe I can say intercollegiate  athletics is the front-porch of the university. Now, some people don   t  like that but there is nothing I can do about it. I   ll compare us to Notre  Dame. What makes Notre Dame so popular? Notre Dame football. I  didn   t say Notre Dame accounting. I didn   t say Notre Dame School of  Law. I didn   t say Notre Dame   s English department. It   s Notre Dame  football. That   s how Notre Dame made its reputation   with football.  Other schools have copied that model.  The important thing when it comes to athletics, as far as I   m concerned,  is integrity. That   s where we lose out sometimes. People think that  athletes are dumb-dumbs. Hey look, if a kid can get a playbook from a  coach   a defensive coach or an offensive coach   and that kid can  remember what to do on the field of play, based on what   s in that book,  that kid is not stupid. That kid is lazy. There   s a difference. I think some  schools have done a better job of educating athletes than others. I think  it   s a very important element of the university. It   s been proven that  contributions go up when you win.  Have there been some OSU sports highlights that you look back on and  think about it? Some success stories of student athletes     No, the highlight to me is Barry Sanders winning the Heisman Trophy. I  saw every game that year. That   s the highlight to me.  You mentioned the word    integrity    earlier. Have there been some  special challenges or issues at OSU over the years?  There   s one that we   ll never live down. You know what that is; the  Dexter Manley thing. We   ll never live that down. There   s no way   I  would think that   s the reason we don   t have a Phi Beta Kappa chapter  today, because of Dexter Manley   the Dexter Manley issue. That   s just  my opinion. It   s sad but true. And the sad part is, this has happened at  other universities, but they   ve kept it covered. Those universities have  kept it covered up.  Thomas, you   ve been recognized numerous times for teaching excellence  and received several awards for teaching, student advisement, including  Mortar Board   s Outstanding Teacher Award twice and the OSU Award  of Excellence for Advisement. Can you share your philosophy about  teaching and why you enjoy working with students so much?  Well, that   s why I   m here. The number one objective as a professor is to  educate students and impart knowledge. I take that task very seriously.  20  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  When it comes to advising students, that all came from working at  Northern Illinois University when I was Don Kieso   s assistant chairman,  because I advised all the students at that point. I feel very comfortable  doing that. Some students just need guidance. They just need a little  understanding of some things and then they can move on. Unfortunately,  in most universities, the order of importance when it comes to tenure and  promotion is research   it always goes research, teaching and something  else. But we   re here to educate students, number one. Of course,  research takes the top bill, so I understand the game. The game is that  you   ve got to get your research done even though teaching may be your  emphasis.  Have you had some students that you   ve mentored that you   ve taught  through the years that are special to you that you can recall?  Oh, yes, I   ve had a few. I have some that have a very special place in my  heart. I   ve had a couple of those, yes. No more than ten, but I   ve been  doing this since 1975. That   s a long time. I have a few that I   d jump off  a building for.  Do you get calls from some of those students and occasionally letters?  Oh yes, I still stay in contact with some of them, yes.  For several years, you worked with student organizations, did student  advisement work. What has been the primary satisfaction that you  derived from that? Because you had to take time away from, as you said,  research or other scholarly activities to do that.  I just like to see the organizations move. Some of these kids want to  organize, but they don   t have the where with all to get organized. I  organized what   s now the Black Student Organization in the School of  Business, which has changed names a few times. I helped reorganize my  fraternity on campus. It   s just nice to see those kids start functioning as  units. You see them grow. You watch them. When you first start,  everybody is kind of standoffish. Then you just kind of watch them grow  and then they get a personality. That organization gets a personality.  Then, that   s fine. I   ve made some good friends there, too.  Speaking of organizations, you   re an active member in the Black Faculty  and Staff Association, having served, I think, as a board member and  past president in that organization. What is the role of the association  and what are its goals?  The role is to keep everybody informed. We   re such a small group that  it   s hard to keep everybody informed. I would say our meetings are more  21  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  informational type things. Keep people informed and oversee the black  students and help them when necessary and so on.  Have you discussed recruitment and tenure issues for black faculty, for  example?  We do, but as an organization, we   re very powerless. I can   t go to the  Dean of Arts and Sciences and say,    Hey, why aren   t you interviewing a  person of color for the Chemistry Department?    Those things don   t  work. Those types of tactics don   t typically work. If you   re concerned  about something like that, that   s got to come from the Provost   s office.  You   ve got to get the Provost involved in that. I think our current  Provost is involved in that kind of stuff. You can   t make somebody  come interview, either.  In your opinion, what have been some of the important contributions of  the Black Faculty and Staff Association?  There are some things behind the scenes done, I think, that were very  good   protecting them. We   ve been involved in a couple of employee  disputes that I think we   ve done a good job at. I think Black History  Month we do a good job with the events that we have then for  informational purposes. Still, we   re such a small diverse group, there   s  not much else we can do.  Just lift up some of the issues and move them closer to the front burner if  you can.  Yes.  Also, we were talking about the Black Faculty and Staff Association, I  just wanted to change gears a little bit. You supported the formation of  the Black Alumni Association under the umbrella of the OSU Alumni  Association. What was the perceived need at the time for a Black Alumni  Association? Is that one of the issues that you all talked about?  Again, black alums are so splintered   and I say    splintered,    everybody  is kind of spread out. We don   t really have a constituent group in  Oklahoma City or Tulsa because we   re small. We don   t have a large  population in any one location. I think the need, then, was to organize  somehow so at least we   d have some venue to meet and greet and so on.  I don   t blame the university or anything for that; it   s just that we   ve got  a small group. Have you been to graduation recently? There aren   t that  many students of color graduating, so that means that we aren   t putting  that many out in Tulsa, Dallas and various and sundry of places. I don   t  think there   s a constituent group any place else.  22  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Can you recall some of the other faculty members that are involved  within that effort?  Pat Bell, she has been quite involved. She was really kind of the  ringleader, I would say, along with another person, I can   t think of her  name. She   s down at Mississippi. But those two   with the faculty   she  wasn   t a faculty member. Pat Bell is a faculty member. Those two kind  of led the charge for that. Then, who stepped in after that? Who   s the  fellow from Houston? I can see his face.  Was our first president of the Black Alumni Association?  Ira Scott. But those are really the ringleaders of that whole thing.  In your opinion, what have been some of the accomplishments of the   Black Alumni Association ?  The major accomplishment is the  10,000 to spend annually on  scholarships   ten  1,000 scholarships. That   s the major one. We started  a golf tournament   this was Sam Combs. Sam Combs was president.  We started the golf tournament and I think we had twelve people play  the first time. Now, we fill all eighteen tee boxes.  Sam was a major reason for that happening, wasn   t he?  Oh, yes. That was Sam Combs pushing for that. Now, people look  forward to the tournament.  So they have the tournament every year, they have the reunion,  Homecoming and scholarship development; you get together and  communicate.  Yes.  The Spears School of Business is currently searching for a dean.  It   s either searching for or has one. I think a name has been announced.  Can you share some insights about some of the deans you served under?  Best dean I ever served under was the person that just resigned, Sara  Freedman. I told her, she   s the first dean I have ever had in the School of  Business that figured out where the fourth floor happened to be. The  dean   s office is on the second floor. Most deans come in, go to the  second floor and never leave the second floor. She knows everybody in  that building   faculty and staff   and is cordial to them. She   ll come to  23  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  your office as opposed to her calling you down to her office. Very  competent person. I   m sorry to see her step down.  Comments on any of the other deans, Thomas?  Bob Sandmeyer was a good dean. He was one of the old-fashioned  types. Like I said, he   s one that would come in, go into his office on the  second floor and never leave. He was there, he   d just never leave. Some  of the others, I don   t want to comment on. They   re still alive and kicking  and there   s nothing that stands out with the rest of them that I have to  say.  Are there other faculty members, administrators, then, in the school,  Spears School of Business, that you feel like have been influential in  advancing the school? Department head, it could be administrator,  faculty member   anyone?  Not really. I think Sandmeyer did about as much as he could, based on  his personality. Then for a long time, we just kind of stayed there until  Sara took over. She   s done a wonderful job. That   s all I can say.  Looking back on your career at OSU, what have been some of the  personal highlights for you, Thomas? The accomplishments that have  given you the most satisfaction.  I guess being selected as national president of Beta Alpha Psi is one of  them. Being selected for some of those teaching awards, which I know  are faculty, staff and student oriented. I appreciate those. And winning  the   I won a research award in the department. I was the first person  that got that research award, as a matter of fact. That was quite an honor.  I guess having been the first tenured black faculty member in the college  is pretty significant as well, is it not?  Oh yes, that   s significant. Yes.  A pioneer in that sense.  Yes.  I know this is a big word, but think about it. What   s been your legacy, do  you think, as you look back on your life?  I would hope my legacy would be that Dr. Wetzel cared about students. I  had students come in to start the Black Business Student Association in  the college. I had the fraternity come in and do that. The fact that the  24  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  Gill  Wetzel  students want me to work with them   and I do. I don   t say,    No.    I  haven   t said    no    to any of them. I think that   s what would be my  legacy. That   s what I   d want; that I help students.  Sort of the same question, but just a little bit different twist. How do you  hope people will remember Thomas Sterling Wetzel? People will say,     Yes, I remember that guy. He was here ten years ago.    What do you  hope they   ll remember about you?  That he was active, participated in a number of things on this campus.  I   ve kind of slowed down now, but I   ve been involved in quite a few  things. I don   t want to say I   m an activist but I participated in quite a  few things. So that   s what I   d like for someone to say. And that he was  fair. That   s important to me.  And that he was also truthful?  Honesty.  You learned that from your parents, right?  Yes.  Well, Thomas, it   s been a great interview and I appreciate your time.  What have we not covered? Are there some things that you   d like to  share that we haven   t touched on?  Oh, I   ll just say this. The Stillwater community has been very good to  my family. Both of my kids were reared in Stillwater   you know they  were born in Illinois    went through schools in Stillwater and have been  very successful now that they have completed school and have moved  on. I   m very satisfied with the school system in Stillwater and the people  that we   ve met through the school system and through the university,  also. I think it   s a nice community, I really do.  Quickly, tell me about your kids. Where are they now?  My oldest is a second year law student at Stanford University. My  youngest is living in Phoenix, Arizona, working for the school system  there.  Where did they get their undergraduate degrees?  The oldest one got her undergraduate degree at St. Olaf College in  Northfield, Minnesota. The youngest one hasn   t completed her degree  yet.  25  Gill  Wetzel  Thank you very much. I appreciate you taking the time to visit with us.  Oh, no problem. Appreciate it.  -------  -------
