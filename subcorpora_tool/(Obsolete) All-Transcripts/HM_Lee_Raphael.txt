Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, can you please state your name and spell it for us, please.
Speaker 2: My name is Raphael Lee.  And it's spelled R-A-P-H-A-E-L.  And the last name is Lee, L-E-E.
Speaker 1: And your middle name is C--?  It starts with a C?
Speaker 2: It's Carl, C-A-R-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Sumter, South Carolina, on October 29th, 1949.
Speaker 1: Alright.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, I work at a university.  And I'm involved in plastic surgery, in research related to plastic surgery.  I'm also involved in some other issues related to how the effects of electric force and radiation have--exhibit manifest harmful effects on humans.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're a medical doctor, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I am.
Speaker 1: I thought that was important to ask (chuckling).  Now what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Well, today, the 23rd of May, 2003.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Well, we're in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the office of HistoryMakers?
Speaker 2: Well, right in the office of HistoryMakers.

Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five 'People' magazine-ish type questions we always ask and they just require a brief answer.  The first one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: That depends on the day of the week, actually.  But what I remember fondly, but, geez, would have to say I like sea food.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I have color patterns that I prefer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's your favorite color pattern?
Speaker 2: Well, I like color patterns in shapes that satisfy the criteria of being aesthetically pleasing.  So that's a redundant answer to your question, but obviously color patterns have to be consistent in a certain relationship to make them attractive.  I find that I'm not conscious of any particular colors that I like.  There're many that I do.  There're some that I don't particularly like, but other than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I would say spring, favorite time of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I have many favorite vacation destinations.  I like to ski.  I like sailing, scuba diving, things like that.  So they work out better in different places.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 9961
Speaker 1: Tell me about your family history.  How far back can you trace your family?
Speaker 2: Well, we have succeeded in tracing, at least my father's [Leonard Powel Lee] side of the family, back before they came to this country in 1860s, and so we have had some success with that.  Obviously, as we go further back only bits and pieces of the tree are kept, you know, we're able to trace.  But yeah, we've gone back now for five or six generations or more.
Speaker 1: Well, who are some of the individuals back there and where is their--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, the name that first comes to mind is John Lee, who--the person that came from the Dominican Republic to Charleston, South Carolina, back around 1860.  And to the best of my knowledge, he was the first Lee that's related to me to come to this country.  And as we have traced back data before the Dominican Republic, then there's another part of the family called the Noisettes (ph.) that were--John Lee married the Noisettes.  And we were able to trace them back in a very similar pattern from the Dominican Republic and then, actually, from France.  And we have actually gone to meet them, some of our distant relatives in France. That side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your family basically arrived here in the 1860s?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Was it prior to the Civil War?  The Civil War started in '61 [1861].  So it was--.
Speaker 2: It was just after the Civil War.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you don't have a family history here prior to the Civil War?
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At least not on my father's side, and my mother's [Gean Maurice Langston] side, that's just really not clear.  I mean there's information back several generations into the late 1800s.  And they were the Joneses and the Langstons in Virginia and northern--northeastern North Carolina. And so there's data that takes them back into the 1800s.  But I don't have any information about them before that.
Story_ID: 9962
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about your father?  Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's Leonard Powell Lee.  It's L-E-O-N-A-R-D P-O-W-E-L-L.  Last name Lee, L-E-E.
Speaker 1: And what's his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, he was born in Summerville, South Carolina, about 1905.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what kind of person was he and what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a physician, like his brothers and other members of his family.  And so he practiced mostly family practice, general medical practice, initially in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] where a big contingent of my family is, both sides.  And then they moved to back to South Carolina, where he grew up as a kid.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was he like basically?  What did he like to do and what kind of personality did he have?
Speaker 2: Well, it's really hard to describe.  He was quite complicated. I mean there's--.  But he really liked to work.  I think he was very outgoing and, kind of individual, and enjoyed long conversations with his patients and anybody else.  And he was--he certainly liked to fix things, whether they needed it or not.  I think he really--you know, a very family oriented kind of person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You say he tried to fix things whether they needed to be fixed or not (chuckling).  Are there some incidents where he tried to fix something that wasn't broken?
Speaker 2: Well, we had lots of different hobbies, you know, boating, and so forth, and fixing cars.  And the cars were always being dismantled and put back together again whether, you know, there was some adjustment that needed to be made.
Speaker 1: So he liked to tinker with things?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about your mother.  Can you give us her full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Her full name was Gean Maurice Langston, is her maiden name, and her married name is Lee.  And Gean is G-E-A-N and Maurice, M-A-U-R-I-C-E, Langston, L-A-N-G-S-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1918.  And her place of birth was Sunbury, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was she like?  And what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well she--before she was married, she worked in assembly plants in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Bud was a company that made cars, railroad cars and so forth. So, she was basically doing that kind of industrial work.  And she'd done some clerical work, etc., etc.  And then met my dad and they became married.  I don't know exactly what date that was.  But I think it was in the late, in the mid 1940s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: I'm not exactly sure of all the details.  But I think through--the families were pretty close.  My father's family and my mother's family know each other fairly well in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  So there were multiple opportunities to meet. So it would have been surprising for them not to meet.
Story_ID: 9963
Speaker 1: I want you to reflect back on your childhood and give us the sense of what community you lived in.  Did it have a specific name or anything?
Speaker 2: Well, I actually grew up in two different communities.  I was born in the small town in South Carolina called Sumter, about thirty thousand people, twenty to thirty thousand people. And I was there until I was about thirteen.  And then we moved to Charleston, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The community you lived in either city was like an all black community or what was the--?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean at that time for sure, this was in the '50s [1950s] for the most part.  I was born the end of 1949.  And certainly, you know, the communities were racially separated at that point.  And they still are.  But nonetheless, it was formalized at that, during that period of time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, give us the sense of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, rural town, went to a Catholic mission school.  The teachers were all from the North. You know, there were very few black teachers. They were all from Catholic missions, educational programs in the North.  And so we grew up in that environment then.  It was a small school, the school that I attended.  I can remember being in kindergarten. Of course, it was smaller, but part of a church.  But then--and certainly in grade school there were four classrooms and eight grades.  And so we shared, you know, we shared the time of the teacher for each class.  And so it was one of those kinds of environments.  And, of course, there were public schools, but they were, you know, racially segregated.  And I think my parents [Leonard Powell Lee, Gean Maurice Langston] didn't really think--. For whatever reason, they made the decision that they thought this other program would be better.  And the public schools were larger. But nonetheless that's the decision that was made.  Small town, South Carolina, you know, 1950s.  The--I don't recall in the '50s [1950s] having much encount--any interaction at all with races, you know, outside of being black. You know, it's just not part of the universe. Some, you know, interactions as you would go through town.  But we never went to the movies or went to things like this, because--or rarely did, simply because most of the theaters were segregated.  We just never participated in that.  And if we went to the movies or we did those kinds of things, we left and we went to the Northeast.
Speaker 1: Okay, to another town?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] New York [New York], Washington [D.C.]
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you like to do when you were growing up when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: Everything (laughing).  You know, into everything, probably some--.  But, really, playing sports, you know, and traveling around on a bicycle and swimming and that kind of thing.  Those are the extracurricular activities.
Story_ID: 9964
Speaker 1: What kind of a young man were you, and what did you--what was your personality like?
Speaker 2: Well, obviously you get a very biased answer by asking me that question (laughing). Better to ask other people.  But the--I think that compared to others, for whatever reason, I was a bit more interested in scholastic things.  I was more interested in science and physics and math, and if I had to distinguish myself in anyway from things that everyone likes to do, that would be it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had an interest in the sciences and so forth as a young man.  Did your father [Leonard Powell Lee] take time to show you some of the, I mean to introduce you to medicine on any level when you were young?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.  We had some exposure to that.  And we'd go on house calls and things like that.  And those were the days when physicians went on house calls.
Speaker 1: That doesn't happen anymore.  What was that like going, you know, making--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well for us, it was just waiting (laughing) and finding something to occupy our time.  'Cause most of these were rural homes and farms and, so we'd watch the animals or walk around or do something until time to leave.  And then, of course, we had exposure to the museums and so forth when we would travel.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how many physicians are in your family?  I mean you come from your father is a physician, your uncle, who else?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There were many relatives.  You know, if you go back through the family tree, you can find physicians in practically every generation for the last--.  I'm the fifth generation. That would be, you know, everyone through the last five generations.  It wasn't a direct line, but there were physicians in every group.  And so had my uncle, and we had cousins and others, etc., that were physicians.  And at one point in the early 1970s, there were twenty-three practicing physicians with the name of Lee that I was related to in the United States, and one in Ghana.
Speaker 1: Now, that's unusual as well as interesting.  Do you have any reflections or thoughts on why had so many physicians in the family?
Speaker 2: I'm sure it's just influence, you know, once the ball gets rolling.  But, you know, it stopped.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yep.  Absolutely, and with my generation, I--maybe one or two, that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't even know them.
Story_ID: 9965
Speaker 1: Tell me about school.  What grade school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Well, the school was St. Jude's Catholic School [St. Jude Elementary School, Sumter, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's sort of a grade school and high school?
Speaker 2: And, of course, you know, St. Jude is the patron saint for the hopeless (laughs).  But anyway, that was where I went to grade school, yeah.  And then when I went to high school, this was right after the, you know, the desegregation of the schools.  And the Catholic schools desegregated in South Carolina, and we moved to Charleston, and I started a new school.  And I got plugged into the other school called Bishop England High School [Charleston, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Bishop England?
Speaker 2: Bishop England. And that was a new experience for me (chuckling), to be a minority,  I mean a true minority (laughs).  Minority is when you're just really, you know, a dot in the crowd. And so a much bigger school, we had multiple programs and a whole different cultural environment, took a lot of getting used to.  There was people that were advocates and then there were people--kids, you know, high school kids that were, you know, just intrinsically supportive.  And then there were some, many others that were intrinsically, you know, antagonistic.  That was an interesting experience.
Speaker 1: What activities were you involved in, in high school?
Speaker 2: Well I was involved in a number of things.  I played basketball.  I was involved in the chess team and the junior engineering technical society and various things like that.
Speaker 1: Were there any particular teachers that were role models for you or mentors for you?
Speaker 2: You know, in later years  there were people I can remember.  But you know, it was hard to--.  Most of the teachers were nuns.  There were a few non--you know. So there was really not that kind of a connection, you know, to identify with, somebody that you want to emulate.  No.  I would say the answer to that is, no. Not that that reflected negatively on anybody.  But--.
Speaker 1: So--?
Speaker 2: I think overall, it was, you know, considered a very good school, and that's my impression, too.
Story_ID: 9966
Speaker 1: Your primary inspiration was coming from your family basically, around medicine and--?
Speaker 2: I think we were, we were certainly given a lot of freedom about that. No one--my parents did not push me in the direction of medicine.  As a matter of fact, I was pretty sure that would be the very last thing, career I would ever pursue (laughing). 'Cause my father worked all the time, you know. He worked weekends and out on Sundays and always going back and forth.  And I just thought that was a little bit, you know, not my calling.  And so actually, not because of the time issues, certainly just personal interests, things that really interest me, things that we heard from other peer groups and friends and what they were doing,  Engineering became--gonna pursue engineering.  And so that's--I choose to pursue a curriculum in college in electrical engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did you choose the school that you eventually went to? How did you choose that?
Speaker 2: The University of South Carolina [Columbus, South Carolina]?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah, the University of South Carolina, which supposedly recently desegregated, right?
Speaker 2: It had recently desegregated.  That wasn't an issue with me.  You know I think that the--I applied to a couple schools, a couple private schools and then the state school as the fall back, and the--and then ended up going to the University of South Carolina.  And I'd heard good things about it and the curriculum. And it was very popular there.  A lot of the classmates were going and a lot of friends were going. And so it was, you know it was--I thought I could achieve what I wanted to achieve there.
Speaker 1: Okay. In those days, I know it was probably rare.  How many black students were on campus?
Speaker 2: (Laughs). Well, a few.  I think I'm the first--I was the first African American to attend the engineering school, I think, in its history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there weren't that many (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.  Certainly, when I was there.  But now, it's pretty, much different story.
Speaker 1: South Carolina as a state, in those days and I think it's still true today, the black population is greater than the white population, I believe, or close to it, as I understand.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I don't know the answer to that.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I've heard of two states where that was true: Mississippi and South Carolina.  Did they then talk about it when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: No.  But I mean the thing is--no, no.  I mean, yes, you hear a lot of comments. But you know, I'm basically--.  I wanna see the data (laughs).  And been pretty much that way (laughing).  So yeah, I'm not sure.  I don't know if that's true or not.  But certainly there's a large percentage of the population.  That's why again--and actually it's reflected that way in the university, too.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now you were in school, a lot of the major civil rights activity had taken place, I guess before you got in college or when you started college.  Is that true or is that just--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh it was definitely ongoing during my experience in college. And it was a major source of energy, and a big part of what we thought about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any stories that you can relate to us about incidents on campus?
Speaker 2: Well there're many. But, you know, certainly I was involved with students.  And we were marching on the capital for this, that and the other, demonstrations.  And then it became the anti-war demonstrations, and one thing after the other and tear gas flying.  And then we had the Orangeburg.  You know there was a very famous event that occurred at South Carolina State College [Orangeburg, South Carolina], which was only thirty miles away,where students were demonstrating on campus and one thing led to the other.  And then state police began to fire.  And they hit several--.  A number of people injured and killed, very much like the Kent State [Kent, Ohio] kind of thing.  It was a South Carolina State event like that, where undergraduate students on campus were shot. So that led to a lot of initial demonstrations and issues.  I mean it was a very tumultuous time. And academics were pretty much on the back burner.
Speaker 1: Now what year was the Orangeburg--?
Speaker 2: Well, now you're testing my history.  But I would think that around 1969. 1969, 1970.
Story_ID: 9967
Speaker 1: What's your social life like at the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: It was limited (laughs).  No, it was fine.  You know, obviously the sense of community--.  I worked with the, you know, with the photographer.  I did studio photography.  I was a photographer for my high school yearbook, and I did that kind of stuff.  But then I earned some money doing that. And I did weddings and portraits.  And I started out doing technical work.  But anyway, I got to meet a lot of people in the community. Of course, you know, South Carolina was a pretty small community so--. So we--and I joined the fraternity.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh, which one did--?
Speaker 2: This was Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, which was great, you know, camaraderie. And, so it was, that was fine, I mean the social life was fine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you did pretty good in your studies and stuff?
Speaker 2: I mean the first couple of years I was not too focused on academic activities.  As I said, there was a lot going on.  And social activities were fine.  So I was not as serious a student until, at some point, I made a transition.  And I can't tell you when that was.  But I really started to become basically interested in what I was doing.  And I find myself, you know, really, just interested in the work intrinsically, as opposed to trying to succeed in the course, by grades or something.  And then that changed me as a person altogether.  And I started making some--and that, certainly in the latter two years, and the end of my junior year, that's when I became interested in the medical applications of some of engineering, particularly lasers.  And then I thought about going to medical school, and I got a lot of positive reinforcements from my father, you know.  I got a car.  And-- (laughs).  So at any rate, that was encouraged.  And I became a very serious student.
Story_ID: 9968
Speaker 1: You went to graduate school at Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], well the medical school at Temple, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  There was one combined MD graduate degree program in biomedical engineering and medicine in the United States, at that time. And that was Temple and Drexel [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  So I had to apply to the admission committees at both.  But they coordinated the curriculum as such a way--.  I mean I was the only person in my year in that curriculum.  But anyway, they adjusted things so it was possible for me to make the classes at both institutions and go back and forth in the subway and etc, etc.
Speaker 1: Hmm. Okay.  So you say your scholarship improved, you know, was steadily improving at this point too, right with the seriousness about--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, by that time I really liked what I was doing.  And I was fundamentally interested and I did it all the time.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers there or people who--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, there were many people there, sure.  Absolutely, yeah. At that level, there are a number of people that took an interest--.  I mean that I took, that I found to be engaging and served as mentors.  And probably the first person that comes to mind is a gentleman by the name of Peter Lynch, who was a marine biologist.  And he was in the physiology department. And he also studied cardiovascular physiology.  And so I began working with him.  And the dean got me a job working with him in the summer.  And that led to some research that I did.  And then, one thing lead to the next, you know.  I won--got a lot of positive reinforcement.  I won the Pennsylvania Heart Association research award for a presentation as a freshman, you know, summer student.  So these kinds of things give you real positive reinforcement and got a lot of positive reinforcement from the faculty at Drexel University to pursue.  You know, I really worked hard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  So you finished both of these programs in 1975?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Story_ID: 9969
Speaker 1: What did you do next [after completing medical school at Temple University, 1975] ?
Speaker 2: Well, I came to Chicago [Illinois]. I did a residency in general surgery.  And during that period of time--that was 1975--they had a chairman here who was a great man, who just died recently, who was truly an academician.  And he wanted to make scholars of all of his surgical trainees.  And he encouraged us.  I worked hard and I think people were convinced that I was a serious student.  And they gave me time from some of my residency responsibilities to work in the physics department.  And I worked with Isaac Abella, who was a physicist here at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And we built lasers and we did things like that.  And then I looked around and thought it would be a good idea--.  Because I left Drexel [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] at the master's degree level, I didn't finish the doctoral degree there.  I wasn't really sure of what kind of clinical problems I was interested in.  And I think I got some really good advice to focus the research on the areas that were--on the type of clinical interest I would have.  And so I think it was helpful and good advice to wait. And I did.  And over the period of time that I was resident, first and second year resident in general surgery, I sorted out the kinds of problems that I was interested in solving.  And then the chairman of the department thought that, encouraged me to finish my doctorate training.  And I applied to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], because one particular professor was there that was working on something I really thought was very interesting and it's the kind of thing I really liked to do.  And just going back, reflecting back for a moment, you mentioning the mentoring and certainly there was a, at the undergraduate level, there was a professor by the name of Joe Gibbons at the University of South Carolina [Columbus, South Carolina].  He's now an emeritus professor there.  But he--the material that he taught in the class and the style of teaching and the way of thinking about things, really captured my interest.  And I think that was part of this transition for me of getting interested in the work. But anyway, so the work that--there's some elements of that in the work that I was interested in in Boston [Massachusetts].  And so I went to--the University of Chicago was kind enough to give me the time off to go and support me financially and, you know, career-wise while I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay. This puts us around 1979 or so?
Speaker 2: (unclear)  Right.  Well, I finished the graduate program at MIT in '79 [1979].  I started in '77 [1977].  And I finished graduate program in '79 [1979], came back, finished the two years of residency here in general surgery.  And then I was being recruited back by MIT and Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  At that point in time, I knew I wanted to enter plastic surgery.  And so I did a plastic surgery residency at  Mass [Massachusetts] General Hospital in Boston and then stayed on the faculty there for seven or eight years at MIT and at Harvard University.
Speaker 1: So you started the faculty appointments in '83 [1983]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 9970
Speaker 1: In '81 [1981], you won the MacArthur Prize Fellowship?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In 1981, the first year of the, that the MacArthur Fellows Program was in place.  There was a--I was fortunate to be one of the, included in that group.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And they used to call this the genius award, right?
Speaker 2: Well, the newspapers call it the genius award.  I mean the spirit of it was to try and find individuals that showed unusual promise, who could actually, might do something if they had the resources that they did not have.  So someone with tremendous--. There's lots of Nobel laureates and so forth, and many great scientists, there that are well funded and are working as hard as they can, and having enough resources to do whatever.  So identifying those individuals in a program like this was not what the goals were.  The goals were to find individuals who might do something different, and someone who's in the midst of a career change, for example. Someone who is a brilliant person, very creative in one area, well-known in one area, now wants to make a big change.  Physicist is now going to become, you know, a concert pianist or something (laughs).  So these were the kinds of, you know, unusual opportunities. And of course, and that's where the idea--I mean, how do you label it? What's the catch term? So, genius award, so we're all sort of branded as geniuses.  And I was a student at the time and that had pluses and minuses. Because you know you get, as a resident in surgery, you have the presidents of the universities coming over to meet with you and so forth.  And that generates a lot of tension. And it's easy for me to understand that now (laughs).
Speaker 1: Did some of the veterans feel a little bit like--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, it's some pretty sharp people you're pushing aside there, you know, on the totem pole.  And--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) You're a genius (laughs).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now we're gonna find out, you know (laughs).  So, there's good things about it and there's some things that are not so good about it.  But I have to say I think overall, it's a good thing.  It was a good thing because as a young person, you're given a lot of public recognition around your own capability.  And every single day you try and prove that to yourself, but in addition, they set standards for yourself that you really want to achieve.  And I can't tell you that I honestly wake up every morning and say, "I gotta prove something."  I don't.  That's not true.  But the bottom line is that--.  And I think my mother [Gean Maurice Langston] and father [Leonard Powell Lee] both all throughout my childhood were always--.  And I think we probably all have heard that.  I mean it's a very common thing in the South to hear, in South Carolina if you're gonna do something, do it well. You know, if you're gonna do the job, do it right or don't do it.  That was the culture that I grew up in.  If you're not gonna be the best, don't get involved.  And that's basically my culture.  And I don't think that I'm saying anything different than that.
Story_ID: 9971
Speaker 1: After that [MacArthur] fellowship, you went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in '83 [1983], right?
Speaker 2: Well, oh on the faculty?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I joined the faculty there.
Speaker 1: How long were you at Harvard and MIT?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, it was a joint appointment. It wasn't really joint, it was a dual appointment.  It was two tenure track appointments:  one in medicine and surgery in Harvard and the other one at MIT in electrical engineering.  That was challenging, to be on two tenure tracks and going back and forth.  And I mean I enjoyed it, don't get me--but it was a twenty-four-seven kind of effort to compete with the best of the best on the faculty for publications, promotions, those kinds of things.  But that was quite an experience, a great learning experience for me in terms of developing my own interest.  And we actually made some very important basic discoveries during that period of time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were those?
Speaker 2: Well, one very important discovery that has really, beginning to have a major impact on how we treat disease is that we could use drugs to control the way in which tissues, particularly skin or tissues in a wound, would behave. And such that we could control the amount of, in the wound-healing process, the amount of scar that was formed, and then we developed strategies to, in effect, pharmacologically mimic the effects of the, or control the adaptation response of tissues so that you could achieve the desired result.  Let me just make that a little clearer.  If one were to begin to lift weights and build, increase muscle force and muscle mass, the tendons would have to respond by getting thicker and stronger as well.  And the bone, that is the tendons are attached to, would have to change to accommodate that additional load.  And if one were to stop using that kind of increased force, then the tissues would adjust back.  Muscle mass would decrease, and tendons would decrease in size and bones would become thinner.  So we--the body is constantly adapting to whatever physical demand is placed on it.  It makes us a successful system.  Now, when people are healing a wound, particularly after a burn or laceration, sometimes they make more scar than is necessary to close the wound, and they get keloid scars.  You hear of that, probably of that term.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right.  That's something that I--.
Speaker 2: Thick scars.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And mostly in African Americans, right? Africans and some African Americans--?
Speaker 2: There's a lot of confusion in terminology. In fact, we just wrote a paper about that.  But people with pigment in their skin tend to make more scar.  But it doesn't mean that they're  keloids.  Keloids are less genetically, or less biased towards people with pigmented skin than is commonly believed.  So the incident is not as isolated to people--. Yeah.  So that's just a mistake in terminology.  But nonetheless, the point is that one discovery we made there was how to use drugs to mimic that or to control that adaptation response so you could influence how much scar was made.  And then subsequently, we've learned some other things about controlling the temperature of the scars and keeping it in a warm, moist environment and so forth to get impro--.  That has matured now into a number of technologies which we can use and employ routinely after surgery and trauma to control how much scar is made so that one gets much more functional outcome.  So that's one thing that came from that experience.  And then, of course, there're other things as well.  And perhaps one of the most important things that subsequently emerged during those years, we started to work on the problem of tissues in, the mechanisms in which tissues that were exposed  to strong electrical or radiation forces were damaged.  And because I had a background in electrical engineering and one of the professors at Harvard called me when I was a resident and said, "Look, you need to work on this problem, because a great deal more needs to be known."  And then I did. And we got the funding.  And we developed, started to work on understanding what happens to tissues that are exposed to, you know, strong electrical forces like when you touch an electric power line. And began to appreciate that very few of the real mechanisms of tissue damage were actually described and understood.  It was all thought to be a burn.  And we pointed out that there were direct electrical interactions that were very important.  And that was very controversial.  That led to bringing new ideas like that to the community, the burn community, was something that really was initially met with a great deal of skepticism, but now, you know, over twelve years has been pretty much adopted and is in all the standard textbooks of medicine.  So it's taught to the medical students. But, being a physician, once we learned about, that disrupting the membrane of cells was such an important component of not just electrical shock injury, but with blunt trauma and heat injury and so forth, that the little fragile membrane--just like a soap bubble--which the proteins are embedded, which is so critical for the ability of cells to maintain the inner workings of the cell environment to be different then the outer workings.  The integrity of that is disrupted so easily.  It's the most common cause of tissue loss, of tissue death.  And, therefore, having had some background in looking at the physics of physical chemistry of how the membranes form, I began to look for therapeutic strategies to seal membranes.  And in 1992, we were the first to describe a practical and successful approach to restoring the integrity of cell membranes with polymers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now can you explain what a polymer is, basically--?
Speaker 2: A polymer is a molecule that is made from bringing together multiple, similar components.  So it's like a chain.  But each link in the chain is similar to the next link. And you add them together and you have a chain.  So poly means many; mer means unit, many units.  Now in the case that these polymers that we were using for repairing damaged cells, they were different than just many units.  They were multiblocked co-polymers, in the sense that they were different types of polymers attached together to function as one single heterogeneous polymer. So, co-polymer.  And the advantage of that is that one part of the polymer would stick to the areas or tend to localize the areas of damage, damage in the membrane, damage to the protein.  The other part would localize in the water around it and alter the local water structure, and by doing so, making it possible for membranes to seal.  It's very much like the polymer that you put on your windshield when you go through the car wash and you don't want the droplets to dry and leave a ring.  You put polymers in to break up the water structure to allow it to smooth out.  So by altering the local water structure, you can not only change how the water behaves, but you can change the behavior of anything dissolved in the water, as well.  And that was fundamentally the approach we began.  And that has led to the development of new approaches to treatment of trauma.  In terms of, historically, when tissues are damaged and will, if not repaired, if the molecules, and the organ themselves are not repaired, you know, cell tissues were going to die.  We would surgically remove that tissue and replace it.  And our thrust in the past decade has been focused on preparing the damaged molecules in that tissue, repairing the damaged cells, and salvaging the tissue.

Speaker 1: Tell me about two doctors at University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], two surgeons. Dr. David Skinner and Dr. George E. Black [sic, Block], I think.
Speaker 2: Well, Dave Skinner was the Chairman of the Department of Surgery when I was an intern there.  And he was the person that was very encouraging and sent me to graduate school.  And he certainly pushed me on a daily basis, on a weekly basis at least to get the work done and finish, come back and finish up.  And so that worked out very well.  And so he helped me throughout that whole process.  And then, of course, George Block, you know, who was also a very strong, famous surgeon at the University [of Chicago], was also a significant figure and very influential and supportive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you came back to the University of Chicago in '89 [1989]?
Speaker 2: At the end of 1989, yes.
Speaker 1: And, now you developed research in clinical centers for electrical trauma victims, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  I've been explaining that, yeah--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: So as we understood more about the electrical injury process, and realizing that we saw more and more patients and many of those patients had neurological and neuropsychological and psychiatric issues.  It became clear that a big component of therapy for these individuals was in this domain.  And began to, because, also, in addition to our own realizations, the neuroscience community was beginning to appreciate the fact that the mind and the brain are one and the same.  Every thought you have represents a biochemical event.  Every experience you have that you can remember represents a change in the biochemical makeup and the structure in the connection within the brain, so that our minds, our brains, are really plastic.  It's a combination of the, what you were born with and the events that happened to, that it experienced over the course of its time.  And so that when people have bad experiences, that there's inexorable changes in the mind that you can't just ignore.  And that many people who have had electrical injuries--.  Because the brain is designed to communicate very precisely in response to tiny electrical signals in millivolt levels, microvolt level signals, and then to expose it to very non-physiologic currents and produce ten--volts, to tens of volts, it just causes such disruption of the physiologic function of nerve and muscle that has not been well understood. And it's still not well, totally understood.  But at least we know it's an important issue.  And we're beginning to, you know, address this in a multimodal, multidisciplinary team.  And so we started the electrical trauma program at the University of Chicago (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  I wondered how they were different.  I mean how treating a burn victim is different from treating a victim of electrical trauma.
Speaker 2: There are some similarities, but there are some huge differences, because the mode of injury is different.  And the tissues that, in the body that are in the body that are normally very sensitive to electric signals, like your muscle, for example, your brain tells it to move.  Why does it move?  Because it detects the tiny electrical signal sent to it.  And then when one exposes those delicate mechanisms, you know, to industrial strength electrical currents (laughs), you can expect some problems.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And there are some serious problems.
Story_ID: 9973
Speaker 1: We were talking about the differences between burn victims and electrical trauma victims.
Speaker 2: Right.  Traditionally, the electrical injury victim was thought to be a burn victim and most of the literature has reflected that.  And we have pointed out that it's more complicated.  And, of course, that went through the normal course that new ideas experience when they enter into professional societies, you know.  And generally speaking, as it's been written about in 'Science' and other magazines, it's not--the experience I had was not unique to me, but soon some certain people who are traditional leaders who want to be looked upon as all-knowing, come out against it. And they worked to politically discredit it, and then--which is a tough thing for the person who created this idea, usually a young person trying to gain acceptance in the field, and trying to show this, make this contribution.  And what happens is they get stomped in the ground and crushed.  One of the things I think would be helpful, because this is such a common experience for people who make significant, scientific contributions, is that they should teach a course that, you know, not only is it great idea to make great discoveries but you have to be prepared, you know, for the consequences of it.  And you also--it's helpful to do as much political preparing as you possibly can (laughs), because ultimately, if not just for yourself, because the limit for--it's really to benefit everyone, you know, to advance the science and to advance medicine.  So I think it's worthwhile to invest the time and energy in trying to prepare the way politically, so that the ideas are accepted as readily as possible.
Story_ID: 9974
Speaker 1: You said earlier when we came here, this is the busiest time of life, basically.  You're busier now than you've ever been, you know.  What are you engaged in that's making this the busiest--?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm involved in doing reconstructive surgery.  I'm on a dermatology faculty, the plastic surgery faculty.  I'm primarily a plastic surgeon.  I ran the burn center for ten years.  And then I moved out of that in order to get some more control and regulation through the schedule.  You never know when someone's gonna get a burn.  If you did, you'd prevent it.  But you don't. So life is not, it's cons--.  So anyway, I focused on different aspects of that work, and then--so my practice in that area and also working with the gynecologists have become pretty substantial. In addition, I have a number of grants to do research in the area of trauma.  And I'm involved in other projects that involve the Chernobyl [Ukraine, former USSR] problem in the World Health Organization, and have responsibilities in those arenas.  So I--and because of the discoveries that we have made with development of polymers, around the development of polymers, to reverse damage at the molecular level, there's a growing international community involved, and there's a growing collaboration between our group at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and groups in Europe.  So we're putting in grant proposals.  And we're hiring postdoctoral students and young faculty, and there's a lot of things going on.  In addition to that, one of the--about six years ago, we started a company called Avocet Polymer Technologies, which focuses on developing pharmaceuticals and strategies to control how much scar is made after wounds heal.  And you know, it's a big problem today. But today, as opposed to thirty years ago, everyone expects their wounds to heal. No one--and not only do they, as opposed to thirty years ago, they were happy for it to heal and not to get infected and survive.  Today, people expect not to have a scar.  So, and it's interesting because the technology's becoming available to make that possible.  And so our company, the company I founded with several other people, certainly has the most robust technology in this area.  So helping to guide that, develop it and work with the people there, the employees and the staff there, who are working to build a company has really been a big time thing.  And then because of the success of the polymers, a new company was formed.  And that has won a lot of awards and attention from investors.  And this has really caught a lot of interest, because the polymers have been shown to be effective in treating spinal cord injuries and other brain injuries, cerebral palsy, myocardial infarctions, and burn injuries. Different polymers, but because they work to correct the underlining damage, they're finding increased use.  And therefore, that concept is now being commercialized and that's taking a lot of time and energy too.
Story_ID: 9975
Speaker 1: You know, this is kind of just an opinion question here.  Based on some superficial things that are going on here it seems that today, in popular culture, plastic surgery is being pushed quite a bit by the media. You see people talking about it not in regards to a trauma so much, but just in regards to improving one's appearance. There's even a television show on plastic surgery makeover. Not just new clothes and hairdo, they send them to a surgeon, you know.  Do you have any thoughts about that so far?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's increasingly clear that you can do more, you know, to change a person's appearance safely than we could twenty years ago.  And the advantage of being physically attractive is a very powerful one, so one doesn't have to do anything other than be present in order to offer something to other people.  So in a competitive marketing community and one is trying to convince someone else to purchase something or to do something, physical attractiveness has a tremendous advantage. And so what you're finding is that because the technologies are here to make the changes, and the complication rate is getting lower, and we can then learn how to do them better, I think it's going to, you'll find more and more of that.  Is that frivolous?  Well, is it frivolous to fix a broken finger so a carpenter can be more effective in their work?  I don't think anybody would say that that would be frivolous.  In fact, in our society we would think that insurance companies should pay for that. But what about a person whose nose, for example, prevents them from being very successful? Or like in many cases, where we have a college student who's been in a motor vehicle accident, and who now has facial lacerations.  How does that person compete in a job interview?  They may have great talents, but to expect people to ignore that disfigurement is just unrealistic.  You have to keep in mind that human culture has been on this planet for well over 200,000 years.  And that the whole success of the human culture is part by selecting out genes.  And without great--it's only been the last few thousand that we've had science and medicine, and so they begin to understand that maybe a scar that's acquired on the face was just an acquired scar and doesn't mean that there's not some fundamental genetic abnormality.  So pretty hard wired in our genes is this discriminatory process.  And so it's a lot to overcome, in business or any other thing, so I don't think it's frivolous.  You might ask yourself, you know, what favor are we doing to mankind to trick the human response to morphology, because the physical morphology of a person reflects their genes. And so, most of the evidence suggests that that part of our mate selection and determining the gene makeup of the offspring is related to those kinds of genetic screens that are done very subconsciously.  And to go and trick that may not be so clever.  That really is a major experiment that needs to be done.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that a person who is not physically attractive may not make the best mate in the long run because of the genes they may pass along?
Speaker 2: Well, in a way that's exactly what I'm saying, because why is attractive, attractive?  If you look at the rules, or, and so many--.  This is part of some ongoing research that I'm involved in, that some of my former students have taken further. But initially we were talking about color patterns, and then there's sound patterns and what you can find are there're fundamental basic relationships between information that we receive, that give us, that determine whether we choose to like that or not. And it really appears to, and so, the reason why that's important is because the features that tend to be most attractive, tend to provide the best stability, competitive advantage, in our environment.  For example, you can make very attractive figures using fractal kinetics.  Maybe you've seen some of the screen savers where beautiful color patterns are generated.  Why is that attractive?  And what are the rules that make those molecules organize in such a way that we think that they are attractive? And so as you begin to look at those rules, what they really, basically are determined by are the patterns of organization that are most stable in the, against thermal fluctuations, grounding motions, randomness.  So while it's certainly true that we can learn to like certain things, just as we--our brain is plastic--hard wired with us at the time of birth are fundamental programs, aesthetic preferences, and taste and sound, visual information.  And that you find that, that that is not arbitrary at all. It's a very, very important capability.
Story_ID: 9976
Speaker 1: What's the most rewarding part of your job?
Speaker 2: Rewarding part of my job? Geez, it's hard to answer that.  I mean I really like many aspects of it.  I have to say the things that give me the most gratification on a day-to-day basis are really making a patient really happy, that something worked really well for them.  And that's really, and of course, then there're other things but I think that's probably the most, in the context of my work, probably most important.
Story_ID: 9977
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: I take the longer view, in the sense that when I think about where mankind has come over the last 200,000 years, from caves and, to now.  We're actually, have people living in extraterrestrial environments that we create.  And if somebody up in one of those space--.  If something happened in one of those space stations that they needed to get off, let me tell you, no matter what color or background, they'd be happy to be anywhere on this planet where they could get food, shelter, you know, in a safe environment.  They'd call it home.  So I think that as I see it, this tiny planet in this great universe that we are, we're reaching a point in time where those kinds of issues are becoming less important.  You know, and that is not to say that there is not preferences.  You know, the fact of the matter is, hard wired as we talked about in terms of the esthetic sense, there are hard wired genetic preferences in mate selection and so forth, that you can see manifested.  And so documented are, that children before they can learn to be culturally biased, infants have better recognition for faces of similar cultures.  And that's why, you know, the Tarzan story of the baby going off with the ape is so implausible.  So to say that discrimination or race is not important would be scientifically flawed.  That's just not the case.  It manifests itself culturally in all kinds of ways, and it's there.  But we are reaching a point where this planet is becoming home.  And I think that we will find that it's more important to figure out, you know, how to be productive together.  I have--my work has carried me in practically every corner of this planet, in one way or the other, to be involved, and I have worked with all kinds of people.  And it's interesting to see in this day and age, as I travel, you know, in Eastern Europe and Asia and so forth, people all watching CNN.  They all watch the same marketing material, you know, same fashion ads.  They all have the same reaction to, many people had the same reaction to the catastrophe that occurred with 9/11, same visceral feeling of, you know, empathy with the people that were involved in that.  And so I think that while there are differences, the similarities are--far out weigh those. And what we see now with involvement, global involvement of our society--.  If you look 5,000 years ago or more, Europe, for example, or Asia, warring tribes over little territories.  Now we have the European Union.  And the same thing in the war between the States.  Now we have--so you see the same process continue on a more global basis over many, many years.  That doesn't address the issue of a person who can't get a job today--I recognize that--because they happened to be discriminated against.  And it's certainly true, I certainly believe that in my lifetime that I've experienced a great deal of discrimination.  I think it has taken, I think it's harder for the general community to accept, you know, an idea from me than it is from someone who looks traditionally like Albert Einstein (laughs). You know, that's what, these are the kinds of things that people feel comfortable with.
Story_ID: 9978
Speaker 1: And then the guy with some brown skin and doesn't look, you know, the usual facial features.  And he's saying, "Well, you know, you can change the water structure and you can repair damage, prevent tissue death from trauma.  And after a burn, you can uncook the tissue.  You can unboil the egg."  They--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Tell us about that.  I don't know how technical it is.  But what do you mean by that?
Speaker 1: Well, when you heat proteins, and we've been talking about this, and you change their structure, their nature. Basically, you know, the clear part of an egg becomes white for example because the proteins have lost their structure and they coalesce.  And the light scatters differently than it did before, so it's no longer clear.  It becomes, you know, boiled.  Well the primary amino acid structure of those proteins hasn't changed at all.  If you can predict the protein, if mean if you burn it in a flame it will, but a boiling process doesn't reach that temperature. So that, it's theoretically possible, and certainly been demonstrated with many proteins in separation that you can unboil that.  You can basically renature, refold that protein.  And so one of the main strategies of the research we're doing today, is to create those polymers that will change the local water structure, so that the protein--'cause it's the water binding to the protein that prevents it from going back.  And the fact that the protein are all aggregated and precipitated out and there're ways to break it up.  And, in fact, you know, there are natural proteins called stress proteins that do much of that kind of work.  But when that system gets overwhelmed, then you might need some additional help with some polymers that might mimic those affects.  And that's the thrust of our work right now, to make, to really reduce the tissue loss in a burn injury for example, and in other forms of trauma, in ways that were not thought possible before.  And we've had some success.  And as we look in the literature we find that forty years ago people have demonstrated that you can do similar things.  But really they weren't focused on the medical problem, they were more interested in just the physical chemistry of it. But somehow it was not picked up by medical community.
Story_ID: 9979
Speaker 1: I think I read something about you that you, one of your goals is to try to link disparate research together. You know, people--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, you know, I think that the things that we have accomplished in terms of bringing new therapeutic approaches to medicine can be thought of that way. You know, that by being fluent in multiple languages, one can make translations that others can't.  So that's the whole idea, and the reason why in the last few decades, M.D. and Ph.D. combined programs were really put into place, so that scientists--not only does it help you translate information to the people without, other than in the field of knowledge wouldn't understand. But it helps you collaborate with individuals on both sides.
Story_ID: 9980
Speaker 1: What would be your advice for a young, aspiring doctor that wanted to get involved in the same field as yourself?
Speaker 2: When people ask me about career advice, which they sometimes do, what I tell them is that there are no hard and fast rules for being successful.  There are a couple of rules that are pretty hard and fast about, that will, about not being successful.  One of the rules is that you should really follow your heart.  And that's because that you can never be the best at something you don't like doing.  You can't sustain it if you don't love it, and you can't think about it all the time, and you don't enjoy it every day, you cannot get up and be, compete with the people who do, day after day, and find success.  And what determines what some person likes versus another person is beyond me.  I do not know.  And the other thing, of course, is that, it's like one of the basic rules of thermodynamics.  You can never get out of it more than you put in.  And so, that's the advice I have for anybody going into any field. If you enjoy it, and you find that you're happy and feel delighted that you're doing what you're doing and feel that you're the luckiest person, that somehow you have, you can say, like so few people I think can, that, you know, that what you're doing, you really love and you really enjoy, then you have just made the--you're on the right track.  So that's my advice for anybody in the area.  I mean I think medicine, like any other field of endeavor, you know, has a very bright future.  There are frustrations today.  There are misunderstandings about, you know, our role in society, and what we should do, and who we should be.  And I think that everybody has an opinion about that.  So I'm not sure that I have any particular extra wisdom to add.
Story_ID: 9981
Speaker 1: When you look back on all the things you've done, and it's certainly an impressive resume of accomplishment.  And even just getting to the point where you started your career, you already had like four or five degrees or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) (laughs).  Well, anyone looking at this resume would remember it's impressive. You know, "Wow, how did he do all that?"  If you had to look back now, and you're still relatively young, what would you consider as your legacy, thus far?
Speaker 2: I think the things that are going to--people will remember me for is the work that we've done in scar management. The work that we've done in creating approaches to, that now make it possible to prevent paralysis after spinal fractures and reduce brain injury that occurs in cerebral palsy, for example.  And then lately, we made a new contribution to reconstructive surgery, because one of the gynecologists approached me about finding a better way to reconstruct the perineal area after cancer in such a way that the anatomy was more normal, people were more functional and with less pain, and then there was less discomfort.  And we went to the anatomy lab and we worked and we found some strategies now that's been very, very widely acknowledged and accepted, a new surgical approach, that was a contribution that I did in collaboration with one of the gynecologists, Dr. Jacob Rotmensch, at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  That is what's going to persist beyond myself, in addition to my own personal kinds of things, you know, for family and children and so forth. They're cutting their own path, you know, (laughs) you know.  So those things are important too. Not only important too, but, you know, equally important.
Speaker 1: Well, how do you think your friends and family will remember you?
Speaker 2: Well, I think my kids will probably remember me the way I remember my dad [Leonard Powell Lee], and that was mostly gone (laughs), unfortunately, or, mostly not there.  But I mean I think that they will know that I was out doing work that was important and that they were important to me.
