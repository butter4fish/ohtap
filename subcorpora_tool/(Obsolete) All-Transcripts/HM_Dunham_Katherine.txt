Speaker 1: Mrs. Dunham. I need to have you first state your name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Katherine is E-R-I-N-E, K-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E  because there's so many ways of spelling Katherine. And Dunham, D-U-N-H-A-M.
Speaker 1: Now I want you -- today's date I'm just gonna state is Sunday, December 17th [2000].
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: And we're in New York City, Mrs. Dunham's apartment.
Story_ID: 6677
Speaker 1: I'd like to know what your favorite color is.
Speaker 2: There was a time when I would have said blue, but with all of its various variations, which I think it has more variations than any other color in the rainbow, I'm leading away from blue and more into tones of -- I don't know.  I think I can say tones of rust, rust and gold.  Oh, I'll tell you a color that I'm very fond of these days, and that is a platinum, just a little gold, a pale gold platinum.  I'm thinking now of materials and well, people's hair, different kinds of hair colors.  Maybe that's it, this sort of platinum gold thing. But it sounds sort of pretentious, doesn't it?  It doesn't?
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't.
Speaker 2: Now Mrs. Dunham are you the -- I want you to look at me when you're answering if you can. And her tendency is to lean forward -- so are we going to be okay with that?
Speaker 1: Okay, you want what?  Did you say you want me to look at you?
Speaker 2: Yes. Look at me when you're responding.
Speaker 1: I'll try.
Speaker 2: (laughing) Okay.
Speaker 1: Well. I'm a shy person.
Speaker 2: I don't believe for a moment you're shy.  But okay.
Speaker 1: I don't think so.
Speaker 2: You can pull that off on someone else.
Speaker 1: Yes, but it does cover a whole lot of peculiarities you know.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And what is your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: You know, if all of your questions are like these.
Speaker 1: They're not.
Speaker 2: Good, because it's a problem to me because at different periods of my life I changed, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell me what it is now.
Speaker 2: Oh, dear.  Well, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  These -- there are only five short questions.  So don't even worry about (unclear). It's short.
Speaker 2: Alright, alright.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Favorite food?
Speaker 1: Well, if it's properly prepared, I would say filet of sole. And as a vegetable, I would say aubergine.  You know, eggplant.
Speaker 2: And favorite place to vacation that you may or favorite place in the world, favorite place?
Speaker 1: In Haiti where I live I can be at home and in peace and comfort.  Yes.
Speaker 2: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 1: Favorite what?
Speaker 2: Phrase or saying?
Speaker 1: Well, I like what I said on my -- someone asked me many, many years ago what would I like on my tombstone, and at the time I had not the faintest idea of not living forever, but I did say, "She tried."  I don't know if that satisfies your question.  I don't think it does. But at least I want to say, "She tried."  That's it.
Story_ID: 6678
Speaker 1: I was born in a little town.  It was then a very little suburb of Chicago [Illinois] known as Glen Ellyn.  My father [Albert Dunham, Sr.] had a tailoring shop in Chicago.  My mother [Fanny June Dunham] was a schoolteacher. And my mother was maybe twenty, between twenty and twenty-five years older than my father when they married.  This always interested me later in life. Found it fascinating.  My mother was French-Canadian who had some Indian blood in her and probably some black.  I don't know, but at any rate she was living as a citizen, a white citizen, in Chicago, and she married this African-American young, very young man.  They decided that they did not want to raise children in the Chicago that they would be living in.  It was sort of a mixed area so they went to Glen Ellyn to - they built a house and had - my brother, I think, was born in Chicago.  He's a little older than I, but I was born in Glen Ellyn, Illinois.  We lived there till I was about three and a half.  My mother died.  When she died, I think it just disrupted my father's plans to have a family for a period so he toured.  He went and toured.  He went to different - as a salesman of men's clothing - different places in America.  I don't think he meant to live in Glen Ellyn because there was not very much social life.  Without my mother there was not much reason to it, you know, for him so he moved us to Chicago where we did have relatives, his relatives, and it's there that I knew my Aunt Lulu who was very important in my childhood life, and the Weir family were on the white side.  They were - I had a - what would it be?  A nephew I guess, who was young, younger. - no.  Oh, dear.  You're making me think now.
Story_ID: 6679
Speaker 1: Do you think your memory of her [mother Fanny June Dunham] was more of what people said or actually what you thought you experienced?
Speaker 2: Well, I've had to sort of fight that battle every time I started to write about that period of my life, and I am more and more convinced that I do remember certain things.  Actually if you ask me, I think I can go back before I was born, and this has always caused publishers to be a little nervous. But I would go before I was born and through my rest of my life, but certainly my babyhood, infanthood, childhood. I'm sure that I remember.  Now what they said -- that's why I'm a little bit troubled about some of these periods in Glen Ellyn [Illinois] because I was full of what everybody said, you know.  A half dozen people were all remembering their way of things were, and I may or may not agree. But I have learned with time to trust pretty much my memory on these things so it doesn't bother me anymore if I say, "Yes, I remember coming home from the hospital in my mother's arms." And people used to say, and certainly biographers, "Oh, you're kidding." But I'm not, you know.  This -- if I choose to remember, it's like -- who was it?  One of the great philosophers said you're -- who was it?  Oh, [Mortimer] Adler, that's right.  If your memory of something -- if I am treating you, clinically working with you -- is as important to me as is the actual fact. So when that sort of thing began to appear in my life, I then said, "Well, look, actually I do remember this."
Speaker 1: Of your memory of your mother, I mean I know -- What do you, what is most outstanding about your memory of your mother?
Speaker 2: I think her coolness.  I don't know if it would have been because of a summer night or something, but there's something very cool about her and refreshing, and I remember that she was very, very unhappy about leaving us, her two last children, 'cause she had cancer, and it had been diagnosed, and at that time there wasn't even no dream of any kind of cure at all so she put herself to a kind of retreat in our house in Glen Ellyn, a room that we were not supposed to go into, and that was always a little mysterious, but I would say that what I remember most about her is this kind of paleness beside certainly my father, and it was not a distance from us, but it was - she - the dear lady was probably trying to protect us from these agonies of hers.  I know she was, and that I could feel.  I didn't know what it was, but I could feel it.
Story_ID: 6680
Speaker 1: You know it's the age difference between your mother [Fanny June Dunham] and father [Albert Dunham, Sr.] was so -- you know, it's very different in many ways, and what do you think the attraction was at that time?  I mean I know it was to -- it was actually Fanny June, the daughter, who met George Weir, right, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Fanny June was my mother.
Speaker 1: Right, but didn't she have a daughter that was --
Speaker 2: Yes, she had two.  One was Fanny June, yes, and the other one was -- oh, what was her name?  My goodness.  She was a little younger and a little darker in color.  I can't remember her name, but she did have -- so that I would have been her third daughter.  It does seem a little strange, doesn't it?  Well.
Speaker 1: So what I was asking was do you have any idea of why that -- why did she find, you know -- was it that he found her so entrancing or she was -- he was.
Speaker 2: Well, as I learned later in life, my father was a charming person, and he did particularly charm ladies and caused a little trouble in my later life with my mother who raised us, Annette Dunham.  I think that he was just an attractive man, and I do believe she had in her mind the thing of more children.  I think she wasn't satisfied with Weir children per se, and I couldn't tell you, but now that I have lived through as much life as I have, I don't find it so strange at all that at her age she was attracted to a much younger man.
Story_ID: 6681
Speaker 1: And your father [Albert Dunham, Sr.], can you describe him for us?
Speaker 2: Well, he wasn't very tall.  I think he and my mother were probably the same height, but for a man he wasn't tall. And very dark.  I think he was good-looking if you could accept African American good looks, which at the time I think they were more acceptable than they were in the succeeding years, you know?  After awhile we began to dislike ourselves and dislike our looks, and my father was, I'd say, a very good-looking young man who was a musician. And that had a lot to do with it, too.  He played the guitar, and he had played with a small quartet, a string quartet. And I think he made sort of an attractive package for a widowed lady [mother Fanny June Dunham] who liked some of his ideas.  She liked his political ideas.  He always was a little bit activist, I would say. So I think it was on those grounds that they met and were attracted to each other, and we still don't know why people fall in love, but they did.
Story_ID: 6682
Speaker 1: I know your mother [Fanny June Dunham] -- I know she had Indian in her.  Do you think -- which do you think she really considered herself?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Did she consider herself white or Caucasian or French-Canadian?  Would she --
Speaker 2: My mother?
Speaker 1: Um hmm.
Speaker 2: I think that she considered herself white because that was the group that she lived with in school teaching and so forth and so on. And probably in Canada they were just taken for granted as people, white people, I think, without any of the barriers that come with it.
Speaker 1: Do you think that at the time that -- I mean I know that, you know, that the family moved to Glen Ellyn [Illinois] or at least that was the impression that the book could get -- that to have a more comfortable environment to have an interracial family, but do you think that there was any sense of herself that she was sort of stepping out or she just sort of fell in love?
Speaker 2: Why, I would imagine that she just fell in love.  I don't think that my mother, as I can recall her or anything said about her, was a very frivolous person and wouldn't be anything as quote "like stepping out or something."  He probably played in a string quartet, we'll say, if you want to imagine this, at one of the parties that some of the North Shore [Chicago, Illinois] aristocracy so-called used to give, and part of the evening was inviting different, like a Spanish couple or this, and then my father's quartet fell into that category.  My mother would probably have been a guest at such things. And so they probably met like that.  I don't know, but I would imagine.
Story_ID: 6683
Speaker 1: And you tell this one story about Grandmother Buckner and the dolls, and I, you know, I don't know if that is significant in the whole thing, but it's -- you know, you had -- it seemed to have something that you sort of remembered, this, you know that she -- as young people remember instead of older people.
Speaker 2: You mean Grandmother Buckner and her dolls?  Well, Grandmother Buckner was a little strange.  She had one leg, for instance.  She had had a leg cut off, and I don't know what the illness was. And when she came to live with -- when I was born, she was already living in the house of [father] Albert [Dunham, Sr.] and Annette [Fanny June] Dunham. Had her own room sort of around the corner part of the house, and she had a passion for dolls, feeding dolls, so there was a ledge around her room where she'd put these dolls, you know, different kinds and colors and so forth. And she'd give them some of her breakfast, some biscuit rolled up or some -- a few of them had some soft egg, which I did not appreciate.  You could see signs of it.  Yeah, that was Grandmother Buckner.  Now she -- I think I don't know what her attitude would have been toward us because she never, no one had ever married anyone as dark as my father, you know, in the family. But I rather liked her.  I was curious about her, and I was a little afraid, in a way, of this woman with one leg.  She had a wooden leg, too. So I would say that on the whole, I just looked at her as something strange that was a part of our household, strange because it did not come and mix with us and have meals and all that.  Meals were always sent in to her. So I think that I appreciated her because I liked her collection of dolls.  I never played with them or touched them or anything.  I just looked at them.
Story_ID: 6684
Speaker 1: Now I want to talk about your brother, Albert [Dunham, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: And what -- describe him and what he was like.  He had a great influence on you in many ways.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think he was - I must look this up.  I keep saying it every time I think of the difference between our years.  I think he was about four or five years older than I, about.  At least I've sort of taken that as a measure of my own.  It would be easy enough to look up, but I don't for some reason look it up.  Albert was his name, Albert Junior.  He was in his intellectual life in those years a brilliant person, philosopher.  As a young person, he must have looked on me as being at some times a burden and at some times a rather interesting intelligent part of his life, a necessary part of his life.  He would try to keep me from getting in trouble over foolish things, like don't step in that puddle of water, and this and that.  He just took that on as a natural thing, and it lasted as long as he lived.  He died - I must have been 25 or 26, something like that, but he was institutionalized for a long period of his life, and the diagnosis at that time was schizophrenia, but there I think should be another diagnosis.  I don't know because he handled his illness in a way that really puzzled these very avant-garde psychiatrists at the St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington [District of Columbia].  He went into there and probably may have had slightly better position than another black or colored person going into the hospital because of the inevitable racial distinctions, but because he was brilliant, he was recommended and loved by some of the most outstanding philosophers of the day.  They did everything in the world, I believe, really to try to bring him to reason in terms of what we thought was a reasonable sane person.  He finally convinced the people within the hospital that he was there practically by choice, and on two occasions he met with the groups of deciding fathers and said look, you're wasting your time.  I don't want to leave here.  I don't see anything that has changed since I have been here, and therefore why should I go back to that?  That was his attitude so they would let him stay, and one time he was so violently opposed to leaving that he took out his own eye with his hands himself to prove to them that he meant business.  He was just not going to leave.  He didn't want to.  He didn't see why.  What he really wanted to do was die, stay there, and or just be off the planet Earth so these - I'm skipping way ahead in years, of course, but as a child, he apparently appreciated me for many things, and for some other things just was really disgruntled, you know, and he sort of - oh, why do you think such things?  You know, he was trying to bring me to his level of knowledge and learning which was not possible at all so he took care of me in his fashion when I was very, very small and was terribly important to me in those early school years in Chicago [Illinois], and I depended on him in a different way and more, I think, than I would have depended on a mother and a father.  I seldom saw my father because he traveled, and my mother most of the time - after my mother died, my mother was Aunt Lulu.
Story_ID: 6685
Speaker 1: You often talked in the book, 'Touch of Innocence,' about how you felt that you were not as academically endowed.
Speaker 2: Well, it was true.  I was just talking the truth as I saw it. And it didn't make a difference really when I was a little distance from it, and with the help of some good friends, you know, like Erich Fromm and so forth, I didn't not consider myself inferior at all for this.  It just simply was a different way of living, practically a different form of a way of looking at life, you know?  I think I believed I was an entertainer for many years to be categorized as such.  As far as the -- I can't even say a split in my own personality, but as far as a different aspect of my own life, I know that I am a lover of humanity.  I don't know what just the word for that would be.  I enjoy making people happy, which may have had something to do, may have been may way of doing it in being an entertainer because I wanted to be a satisfactory one, a good one. And I would sing almost everything I did, singing was sort of with tongue in cheek because I didn't want people to think that I was competing with a singer, but I had to express certain things in song that I did not in movement or dance or whatever you will. So whatever I did, I tried to do it to its fullest and with its most, with the most giving to life and the humanity as I could. And I think that this many times I did succeed in doing because after I began to grow out of my entertainers years in life, then I had to place myself.  I think I'm a very good writer.  I don't consider myself a writer, you know, because I did several other things, but I would not have been happy to be remembered simply as a writer.
Story_ID: 6686
Speaker 1: University of Chicago [Illinois] has been like a sort of beacon in my life.  It was something that nobody could take it away from you, and you know, I mean it couldn't die or go away or never have been or something.  You were right there on the record as having gone to and finished at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. And that meant a great deal to me. And I didn't flaunt it,  sometimes I even forgot it. But especially now at this period of my life, I'm pleased that I did go through whatever it required of me and come out, I could practically say triumphant because there's nowhere that it is not mentioned with respect. And I'm sure my brother [Albert Dunham, Jr.] was responsible for this because that's where he went.  Now, in writing his own story of his own life, which I'm sorry I have not been able to find any indications that he had even started such a thing, I'm sure that he would have found that among his professors at the university were those who felt that he was material for an established or future philosopher of the age and therefore that he should continue his work at the university, which he did.  He finished there with a Ph.D.  His master's was from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  These things were not easy for him.  I sometimes wonder how in God's name did he do it.  I know that he waited table during one summer during his master's degree hopes -- no, his doctorate, actually -- and well, he found a way to manage.  He always had scholarships and fellowships.  He was a very brilliant person.  I've read a few things of his in later life, and goodness knows I have to have a dictionary with me.  I'm not always sure that I know exactly what he meant, and still I do know.  Everything he did and every word he spoke was for the recognition by us, our society of man, and everything he did or thought seemed to be for the elevation of man. So he meant to me someone who cared enough about me to want me to go ahead and do better.  In other words, if I'm going to be a dancer, then be the best one around.  He helped me define dance as I was using it then, which was to bring people more together, different people, different kinds. And he helped me realize that anthropology was the only academic study that I would be interested in at all. And I don't know what happened, I don't know whether I had a crush on one of my professors or what, but I actually with very little effort and very little coaxing fell into anthropology, and I now think that that's -- if you have only one subject in your academic life, let it be that because it has -- there are five elements that -- I hope I can remember them.  Physical, the measurement of the human body; social, which is the way people live among each other; linguistic, the different languages that we have.  Oh dear Lord.  What are two more aspects of anthropology?  So that it really covers everything that means being a person, being a human and living in a community on this earth, on this planet. So he did that.  My brother kept me there and awake, and he was not an anthropologist.  He was a philosopher.  It was his real interest in life.  He did see the importance.  He knew that I would never in the world be a philosopher because I can't be that detached.  Maybe that's the best word for it.
Story_ID: 6687
Speaker 1: What came first?  Did the dance, the interest in dance come first or the interest in anthropology?
Speaker 2: Oh, the dance.  The dance came first.  I was a physical person, I think, the first twelve or fourteen years of my life.  It was athletics.  It was getting records in high jumping.  It was running and whatever was physical motion, but - and then it turned into dance as I became earlier - older, fifteen, sixteen years old so anthropology didn't really set in until I was at the university and discovered that thinking of myself as a philosopher was outrageous.  It would just never work, but anthropology did work.
Story_ID: 6688
Speaker 1: Had your brother [Albert Dunham, Jr.] graduated by the time that you started in University of Chicago [Illinois]?  He already graduated?
Speaker 2: He was, he had graduated with his bachelor's, yes. And he had started his work on his master's, which he moved into Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] on a fellowship from them.  Then he came back to the University of Chicago.  They decided that they would be very happy to have him representing them as a doctor, so he went back there for his doctorate.
Story_ID: 6689
Speaker 1: You worked as a librarian for a period of time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Before you went.  How long did you work as a librarian?  That brought you to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: I think it must have been two or three years.  I'm not sure, but it was a way I could earn my keep, you know, a way I could live. And I took it because it was not an offensive job as many would have been that I might have taken. And it was new, and the whole thing opening paths to -- crossing barriers of racism again.  That is when I think I began to realize that my life would be made up of crossing these barriers of racism.
Story_ID: 6690
Speaker 1: And who most influenced you at the University of Chicago [Illinois]?  What teacher influenced you to really start looking?
Speaker 2: Well, Dr. [Robert] Redfield and I -- and it's hard for me to say this 'cause I think I was almost in love with the man so that's hardly fair to say that.  Dr. Redfield -- You know, actually I can't think of as a person, any single person that -- you know, I was grateful to Dr. Melville Herskovits who periodically would come to teach at [the University of] Chicago although he was a professor at Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois]. And see, by the time I got really deeply into anthropology at the University of Chicago, I had an opportunity to get a fellowship, a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship, and at the same time, I met Dr. Fromm, Erich Fromm, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst coming from Germany.  I think that then I was completely - you could put a dot to the paragraph, as far as my interest in anthropology.  It became a life's mission sort of thing, and then with Erich Fromm, I began to think of not only people and the way they thought and behaved, but there must be another - that takes us to the fourth one of the anthropology divisions.  My interest was not only in people and how they behaved, but then I had to begin thinking about, which is closer to home, about the individual, and I knew that I was deeply interested in people, but I had to then think of my own survival as a human being, and what are you doing?  Are you doing what was in your mind, and you think you're a mystic, what you were intended to do in life?  Are you contributing to this being a person, being a human person, by your way of life today?  Now that's a hard thing to put upon a person in their very early 20s, but that's what I - that is, that's a person that met and fell in love with Erich Fromm.
Story_ID: 6691
Speaker 1: So how did the Rosenwald Fellowship come?  How did you decide you wanted to go and study in the Caribbean?
Speaker 2: Someone in that whole coterie of anthropology - anthropology was just a budding thing then.  Remember, a lot of people would say anthro what?  You don't know what you're talking about.  There would be Melville Herskovits who had published material that I was reading.  There would be Redmond. Faye Cooper Cole, Redfield, Herskovits - they'd probably be the three that I was most familiar with, and then Erich Fromm, of course, came into my life through the Rosenwald Foundation.
Story_ID: 6692
Speaker 1: Where did you travel [for the Julius Rosenwald Fellowship]?  I know you traveled in the Caribbean, but where was that?
Speaker 2: I had four places to go -- Jamaica, Haiti, Trinidad - good heavens, don't tell me.  That's awful.  Jamaica, Haiti, and Trinidad, and there's one other that just escapes me at the moment.
Speaker 1: What do you think you learned?  Mrs. Dunham, I don't want you to get mired down in details either.  You've got a very good recall, much better than even I have, so don't worry about it, but what did you learn you think most of - what was most fascinating about that whole experience?
Speaker 2: I believe that at the time the fascinating thing was how they danced, why they danced, the form of it, and I was beginning to be vitally interested in form and function.  Now those are the things that seemed to have preoccupied me when I lived among the people and joined them in their rituals and ceremonies and so forth.  Later in life I have drawn from all of these places and people and things the things that I needed for the moment per se.  I believe that the greatest thing that I learned from that experience was an in-depth understanding of the family, of the need and destiny of man to be a part of a unit, not just to be a unit, be a part of a unit, and I think it's given me comfort in the later years of my life to know that I'm not wrong about the family.  I'm not wrong about the tribe or - you name it - you know, the cult.  It depends on your interpretation of cult so that the things to me that are essential in the social structure of mankind are the things that allow man to develop, to live, to breathe, to be, to contribute.  These are the things that count, and these things I believe are not accomplished in isolation.  I feel we can work for a period of time in isolation.  Some people feel they need that.  I don't.  I did that for awhile.  In my first West Indian trip I thought I was alone much of the time, but as I look at it and study it, I see almost always there was a person or persons who would be not just background but who would be the surrounding material that would help me to continue with my purpose to live, to search out, to make for progress, make for contribution, all the things that we really know.  That was my purpose without me even knowing it.
Story_ID: 6693
Speaker 1: Formed a ballet company?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had had a little group of people who danced in Chicago [Illinois] and some girls, and I liked the idea, but I think at that time I began a learning thing.  What I was doing was not by accident or, you know, accidentally this or the other.  It was one of my purposes in life.  I believed in the community, and while my community in Chicago had not been to my liking or my taste or style, I knew that it had to exist, and if it was going to change and be to my style, I would have to be the one to do that change.
Speaker 1: So you acted as a change agent in many ways, a change agent.  You were. Okay. Now you were -- that's why I was saying you formed first Ballet Negre, right, or that's what it says, and then you formed Katherine Dunham Dance Company.
Speaker 2: Yes, um hmm.
Speaker 1: And how old were you then?  Were you like twenty-one [years old] or so?
Speaker 2: Twenty-one, twenty-two, something, twenty-three.
Speaker 1: So what were you wanting to do in forming your own dance company?  What was this.
Speaker 2: I wanted to have a unit with which I could work and which would surround me, and I would be a part of it, and it would be a part of me.  We could give to each other and take from each other and form a theatrical expression that, to my knowledge, had not yet been formed among black people, to form a theatrical expression that would carry the needs and the beliefs and the aesthetic patterns of - at the time I thought of a people, thinking then of black people, not just black but of black people.
Story_ID: 6694
Speaker 1: A survival thing.  I think that New York offered more in terms of theatrical experiences and also in terms of training, and Chicago [Illinois] was getting to be that I was giving all the time, and at times I found I did not have enough to give to make a difference.  In New York I did.
Speaker 2: And what were people saying about you at that time?  Did they think you very strange or odd or?
Speaker 1: They thought I was strange.  Some of them thought that I was what they had been waiting for.  Others thought oh, she think she's just so much and that kind of thing, you know, but I think that on the whole New York was very kind to us, and I found there other nationalities, for instance, a thing I didn't know in Chicago, other nationalities and people.  I found a kind of a touch - no matter how faint it was - touch with the rest of the world.
Speaker 2: And what would you consider significant about your New York experience there, I mean in terms of the troupe?  Is that when the troupe really started to take hold?
Speaker 1: I think it was when we really began to think of ourselves, or I thought and our management, of ourselves as a commercial possibility, and I think that New York helped me to realize that there was no way to learn all of our potential in Chicago.

Speaker 1: And at what time did you get married?  Was this around -- were you married at this time?
Speaker 2: Oh, how -- I think I must have been about twenty-four [years old], something like that.  I married a young man who was, considered himself a writer.  I don't know if he was a good one or not because I didn't really read much of his work, but no, I don't think I was selfish.  I was self-protective.
Speaker 1: And his name?  Give me his name.
Speaker 2: Jordis.  His first name was J-O-R-D-I-S.  I don't know where that came from.  McCoo, M-C-C-double-O.
Speaker 1: And you were married how long then?
Speaker 2: Maybe a year, but I'm not sure, and we decided on a divorce.
Story_ID: 6696
Speaker 1: You went and became a voodoo, a voodun, a what, a?
Speaker 2: Voodoo, voodoo.
Speaker 1: Voodoo, right.  Is that part of the Yoruba [culture, Nigeria] or is it just part of the religion that you found in Haiti?
Speaker 2: It had a lot to do with the Yoruba, a lot to do with their initiation ceremonies, their gods, their practices.
Speaker 1: Now what -- when you first saw a ceremony, was that what influenced - I mean what really was the pivotal point that sort of influenced you to make you seek out?
Speaker 2: I think it's the same thing of as we were talking about before about mysticism, that one of the crutches, one of the sustaining walls to my personality and my being, my style of living, was a belief in the difficult or impossible becoming possible, and once I was convinced that that was true, I saw patterns in the Yoruba tradition and their beliefs and their gods, that one can.  It can be done.  Maybe you needed to fall back on mysticism.  Maybe you needed to fall back on the village priests.  It's not - as African-Americans, we cannot break a tie with Africa no matter how hard we try.  We cannot break a tie with the America in which we live 'cause we do live in it.  Therefore, it became a thing to my way of thinking of not reconciliation but a wisdom of knowledge, of understanding of, probing into, delving into, and coming out of this complex of these two cultures mixing in with each other, coming out of that with a not necessarily new culture but a new knowledge of self and a new feeling about being.  That I think is about the best I can do to answer that question.
Story_ID: 6697
Speaker 1: You created a whole different dance form.  I'm wondering at the time did you realize you were doing that?  Did you go out -- remember you said earlier I went out with purpose to do things.  You know, I knew that some things weren't being done so I went out with purpose so it's not that -- it's not every day, Mrs. Dunham, dance has been around a long time.  Not many people created their own dance technique.
Speaker 2: Well, it's a strange thing.  There were other dancers who were bringing new forms, you know, and like [Martha] Graham, for instance, and other dancers, [Charles] Wideman's and so forth. So what I was doing was placing myself among them, same level of intelligence, design, social, this, that, and the other, and so forth.  I was just adding myself to them.  I resented another black person or person of color coming up there and trying to pull me down to get that position because I knew that they had to have the opportunity to do it.  Some of them like Edna Guy and one or two others had gone out and done A, one or two numbers from A countries.  It was black-dominated, you know, and so forth, but that's not the same thing.  The thing, the desire to form a company with a whole base in a company that was examining and then putting onto a level with other dance companies examining colored people.  That was my objective, and I felt rather selfish about it. Interestingly enough, being immersed in anthropology at the same time, there was this great field that had opened for me, this great black, colored field, but I felt closely related to Orientals that had not seen what they what should be seen of them and even Eskimo.  My main thesis for this particular period was to show that all men dance so it wasn't just black men because that was my tool at the moment, but that all people do. And therefore I get in among the Eskimos and in among the Panamanians, in among this, that, and the other as an anthropologist, but the two of them were very, very close together.
Speaker 1: And who did -- who gave you your biggest resistance then at that point?  Was it -- I mean were there -- because Martha Grahams were around the same time, wasn't there?
Speaker 2: A little bit ahead of me.
Speaker 1: A little bit ahead.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I think my greatest resistance was finding a way to survive.  It was purely economic at that period.  They didn't mind me, and many of them were interested in this whole approach. But I just had to scuffle, really scuffle to be able to feed these people.
Story_ID: 6698
Speaker 1: And now you had in your dance company [Katherine Dunham Dance Company] a lot of people who came along that were -- you know, ended up being famous in their own right that you helped, sort of nurtured along. And was your first big -- was 'Le Jazz Hot' sort of the first big thing here in New York [New York] or was it -- I mean there was 'Cabin in the Sky,'  I mean --
Speaker 2: Well, I think my work with the labor stage did not have the widespread recognition that 'Le Jazz Hot' would have, but I think it was an important foundation and settled once and for all the thing of any jealousy or problems with other dancers who had the same desire toward humanity.  'Tropics' I couldn't put aside, so the only thing, I couldn't get it into one word so I had to say 'Tropics and Le Jazz Hot'
Story_ID: 6699
Speaker 1: I don't know if you want to talk about some of the students that came through, you know, whether it's Arthur Mitchell.  I see Butterfly McQueen, Doris Duke.  Is any of that?  Eartha Kitt.
Speaker 2: The students, the people were touched by our school [Katherine Dunham School of Dance].  It's hard for me to say because I was not there all the time.  Once I got into Europe on a commercial basis, I had to stick with it, you now. And I know that Arthur Mitchell studied at our school.  I'm delighted that he did and that he realizes that it meant something in his life development. But we had people such as Talley Beatty who had come to us as a child practically, he was fifteen, and who then went on. After ten years, he began his own ideas, not just choreographic patterns because that's probably the least of things but his own creative ideas. And Lily [Butler] Romero became Carmencita Romero.  You know.
Story_ID: 6700
Speaker 1: What would you consider the essence of the Dunham Technique?  Let's talk about that.
Speaker 2: Dunham Technique has several aspects.  One is social.  It's a thing which aids in the melding together of people.  It is a social act.  It can be looked upon as an isolated act, but that is not its real intents and purpose which is an erasing of conflicting boundaries among people.  You want to go on?
Speaker 1: Um hmm.
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay, then so you're saying that that's the critical part?  Wasn't also the technique that involved the movement of the body?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I mean there is that.  Of course, you have to then start wondering, "what am I doing?"  As a Dunham Technician, you're learning about space, about time, about the relationship.  I think the most important thing is form and function. And if those two things are brought together, you get a person doing Dunham Technique and making a movement.  I'll say to them, "What are you doing?"  "I'm doing this," and I'll say, "Why?" And they'll tell me why.  They're learning little by little Dunham Technique, form and function.
Speaker 1: And where do you feel that your technique fits within the whole area of modern dance?
Speaker 2: I think it is key.  I think it is not the only one, but I think it is a key one.  In other words, it is looking toward man's survival truthfully as a meaningful and progressive entity.  I think the Dunham Technique aids man in this drive in life.
Story_ID: 6701
Speaker 1: Now here you are.  It's the 1940s and I think 1950s.  You say 1945, I think, was a watershed year.  You said that's when, you know, you ended up going to Europe, and were you talking about that from a standpoint of touring?
Speaker 2: Our first trips to Europe were not with standpoint of touring.  I didn't know.  I didn't know what it would offer.  I didn't know if we could survive even.  It was to appear, to be in their books or literature, their pamphlets, their this, that, and the other, just to be a being, a thing, an existing technique among other techniques.  That was my first.  How to do it I didn't know because I didn't know how long then our success in Europe like England and France and so forth in the beginning gave me a feeling that we were invincible.  No, and it's good that it did because I felt invincible, and that allowed me to do some daring things I would never have done otherwise.
Speaker 1: So what were some of those things because I know that in one report they said that - or was it someone was quoted saying that, you know, the crowds even in Paris [France] they would leave the - you know, leave and follow the group, you know, and then dance behind you.
Speaker 2: Yes, and I expected it.  Actually I shouldn't say expected it.  I will say I accepted it.  Maybe that's better.  I began - I was maybe spoiled, but I began feeling that what we were doing was right and good, and then when it began to make enough money so that I could be sure that our next engagement would be a wise one financially, then I was pretty sure of it.
Story_ID: 6702
Speaker 1: You went over there [to Europe] looking to see if you would be accepted, and you had some early successes, and you knew that at that point you were sort of invincible, okay. And at that point then what were your plans for the group [Katherine Dunham Dance Company]?
Speaker 2: I had to realize that I must make a decision between the group life and my life.  I'll give you an example of that.  Bernard Berenson became vitally interested in my work and in me and so forth and so on.  I would say that it was, to a degree, the same type interest that Erich Fromm would have had without the personal relationship.  Bernard Berenson invited me to visit him when we were in Rome [Italy], and I did.  Now I had to realize that with him, knowing a little about him and reading his works and after meeting him and visiting him at [Villa] I Tatti [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I had to realize that here was an opportunity for me to become a woman who knew Bernard Berenson, who understood his philosophy, accepted it, and who chose to move into his world out of her world.  The other choice I had, which is the one I took, which was to remain in my own world and draw from Bernard Berenson what I could that would support me in my own world which still carried with it a company.  That's all.
Speaker 1: How large was your troupe at this time?  How large was the -- you carted a lot of people around.
Speaker 2: How large was the company?
Speaker 1: Um hmm.
Speaker 2: Oh, goodness, probably twenty dancers, four apprentices in dance, one stage manager, one assistant to the stage manager, conductor, and a musical director.  You know, we were traveling almost -- let's say forty people then.
Speaker 1: And you were managing all of this.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'll be honest.  I think I was.
Speaker 1: And you -- and did you -- how old were you at this time?  How old were you?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Thirty some?
Speaker 2: Yeah, thirty-something.
Speaker 1: And so the skills that -- okay, so you were like part den mother, part dance instructor, part everything, part.
Speaker 2: Don't leave out banker.
Speaker 1: Okay, banker.  Okay.
Story_ID: 6703
Speaker 1: And you toured over how many years?
Speaker 2: Well, from 19 -- if you want to take those early years that -- when I, before I, you know, began touring with the university [Southern Illinois University, East St. Louis] staff, I'd say from 1940 until '80 [1980]. That would be thirty years, forty -- about forty years of touring, and after that it would be sporadic.  It'd be now and then.
Speaker 1: Can you share with me one or two of the most memorable experiences you had during that time?  One.
Speaker 2: I don't see -- I don't see how.  It's like when we spoke of [Bernard] Berenson a few minutes ago.  I'd say that meeting Berenson and putting myself in the structure of his thinking, of his - being a part of that whole Berenson complex was a very great thing for me.  The same thing happened with Erich Fromm before that, you know, twenty years before that, and periodically it would be a person who, by their achievements and position in the world, lifted me into where they were going, a way of thinking.  Those were my great experiences in life.
Story_ID: 6704
Speaker 1: In 'Cabin in the Sky,' they said that your legs were insured.  They were insured for a large amount.  Was it for -- I had read a million dollars, and I had read a quarter of a million dollars.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: I don't know how much it was for, but it was a lot of money.
Speaker 1: So you had great gams as they call it.
Speaker 2: I think so.  I mean a couple photographs out there, I look at them and I say, "Well, that's not bad at all."  You know?
Speaker 1: So you had --
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) But I used to say to some reporters, you know, "They get me around," you know, which is sort of a vulgarization of the whole thing.  As long as they get me where I want to go, great.
Speaker 1: You know what I find?  You were a combination of a very, very bright woman and a very, you know, and you had a very --
Speaker 2: Sex symbol.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's the word.  Absolutely.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: You had it all.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I did, and I owe you the other secret is that I used it all.
Speaker 1: And the other thing that you could teach young people is that you knew how to use it right.
Speaker 2: Good, good.
Speaker 1: Because some people have it, they don't know how to use it.
Speaker 2: Hmmm.  Well, thank you that I had to know how.  See, the other people do not have the creditors following you for every penny that you earn in order to keep things in line, and I did.  I couldn't make a mistake.
Story_ID: 6705
Speaker 1: So was [Bernard] Berenson -- during these years, was he your mentor? Was he, you know -- because the thing is you're running like a major enterprise on the road for years.
Speaker 2: Berenson was not a person who would've helped me financially like Erich Fromm.  Berenson was a person who would try to -- his wealth that he gave to anyone was simply his brains, and he would put out there before me if I so choose to take the Satan's sentence here or wisdom there or some.  That was his contribution to me, and I welcomed it.  I knew it.  I didn't want anything from him but that.  That I had in great quantity. But meanwhile I had to learn certain things like you can't always sell a company of fifty.  Sometimes I had to get out and do a nightclub show and things like that.  I learned this, and I did it.
Speaker 1: And were there things that you would have done differently?  This is during that time period that you look back on.
Speaker 2: I can't think so really.  You know?  I don't think so.
Story_ID: 6706
Speaker 1: Was there any work that you created during that time that you were most proud of?
Speaker 2: Every day I feel the importance of 'Rites de Passage.'  It began long before this period, but its polishing, its understanding, the subtle tones in it begin to show themselves now.  I enjoyed the (unclear) big numbers, but I feel that you see pictures of 'Barrelhouse,' me in a position, and 'Floyd's Guitar Blues' me in another position.  Oh, they're so full of meaning, so full, so not any one.  At certain days certain ones are just so full of meaning to me, and the fact that I was able to get this across to the public just makes me proud of myself.
Story_ID: 6707
Speaker 1: Now when did you get married the second time?
Speaker 2: John Pratt, I'll go through this again.  I went through it today once.  John Pratt said to me one day, "Look, we don't have to do anything about marriage because the minute you sign into a hotel or something like that as Mr. and Mrs. So and So, you're married in Illinois."  It was a great relief to me 'cause we had been signing in as Mr. and Mrs. John Pratt into the Sherman Hotel [Chicago, Illinois] for a couple years so this was wonderful so I have had to fix the date of our marriage at a time when it would help us to be able to adopt Marie-Christine.  I think the adoption went through in 1950.  I think so, but I would just say, for your sake, don't trouble yourself over when we were married by this law or that law, and so just say we met and fell in love and began living together as husband and wife would be 1943.
Story_ID: 6708
Speaker 1: He [John Pratt] played a very important part in your whole life.
Speaker 2: Very.
Speaker 1: And can you just talk about that just a little bit, just a little bit?
Speaker 2: John Pratt was a designer.  We worked on the same artistic level.  He understood the things that I did, and I understood the things that he did.  We were in love not only on this great important artistic level but also on a humanistic level.  He felt about people the way I did.  He loved what people do, and he wanted to do something about the destruction of the human spirit, which I did and so forth and so on. So we had everything going for us, but everything, and aesthetically we matched.  I found him a very handsome good-looking man, and he found me a very handsome good-looking woman.  Therefore everything went for us.  We had problems.  I won't say we didn't.  People -- even his mother loved me very much.  His father I never met, even though he was in Chicago [Illinois], so everything seemed to go, you know, the way it should, and it didn't.  It was not easy.  I'm sure it was harder on him than I even realized.  I refused to realize it was hard, and much of our life was spent -- this is yours, you've chosen it, it's essential to you, and it's great partly because of you, so don't question it.  It was our life.
Speaker 1: It was hard on him because it was an interracial marriage.  Right?
Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't say hard on him.  I'd say it could've been hard on him, you know.  It was -- oh, you know, I mean put it out there.  Yes, of course, he was picked on and so forth and so on.  Whether it touched him or not most of the time, though, you know, he was aware of it, but he didn't let hurt or destroy what we had.
Speaker 1: Because he was very much in love with his Katherine.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was in love with me.  He was in love with what we did together, and his work, and you know.
Speaker 1: How did you meet -- can I just ask that one question and we'll go on? How did you meet him?
Speaker 2: W. P. A. [Work Projects Administration].  He was at the head of  -- a supervisor of a theater design unit.  I was a supervisor of a dance theater.  Just that simple.
Story_ID: 6709
Speaker 1: Is there anything else about your dance that you want -- you know that period or the troupe [Katherine Dunham Dance Company] that you would like to say.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: If I could advise people who have any sense of movement and rhythm and community, reaching out to people, I'd advise people to take someone's life or take some study in dance.  Whether you dance or not, it's not the important, important thing.  The important thing is that you recognize, that you realize this human element in people, that you realize that the sense of movement and beauty and love and life are all accomplished in this one activity, if you want to.  They're all a part of the behavioral science of dance, so give it a trial.
Speaker 1: Why do you think dance has never gotten its real day yet?
Speaker 2: Puritans.  You were not supposed to -- and the Puritan religion that beset this country, and this country has had a hard, hard row to hoe because you're not supposed to know that your body can feel anything.  Don't ever touch your body for the sense of feeling or touch it because you have to put something on or hook something here and there, you know?  The whole thing of the human body being a part of the human feeling is not Puritan at all, and we've had that beset this country for more than a hundred years, but otherwise I think it's because it dropped out of our daily living.  If you live on a crowded street in New York, you can hardly skip your way through it, you know, and if you live way out in the country in Yugoslavia, you can whirl around and dance around and feel good at it so dance has had to adjust itself to the roots of the human being, and it's doing so beautifully, I think now.
Story_ID: 6710
Speaker 1: I'm wondering what drew you to that country [Haiti] in the way that it did?
Speaker 2: Its climate for one thing.  Oh, I couldn't bear with those winters in Chicago [Illinois].  This constant climate of warmth and sunshine, that had a lot to do with it and the independence of the black spirit is another thing, and the freedom of body motion.  See, these are all things that drew me to the country.
Speaker 1: You were on a mission there for the - once you decided to move there, you became - you know, you were on a mission to accomplish something in that country, and I'm wondering if you could describe that.
Speaker 2: Well, I think that it is very clear that I thought that I could bring rhythmic motion which was by primitive interpretation of dance but that I could bring rhythmic motion to people, people in general, and that they would know a refuge in it, that they would know a completion of themselves in it. They would know a way to communicate by means of that, and that they would know how to love one another through it.
Story_ID: 6711
Speaker 1: My hopes are that the rest of the world, especially the monetary world, will not be too discouraged and stop helping it [Haiti] financially and just let the whole country run into a really worn down, dried coconut tree, piece of land.  I'm hoping that the financial aid that is due to come into there comes in and very soon. And that the country itself will, little by little, even working from the outskirts into a central authority, clear up, get rid of the negative influences in the country, and live even if it is under a standard that they would not have chosen earlier but live along with today's economic development, social development demand of it.
Story_ID: 6712
Speaker 1: You went from Haiti basically to East St. Louis [Illinois], and one would say that you went from one hardship place to another and that maybe you had even chosen hardship.  What was your passion in going to East St. Louis?  Why did you gravitate back there?
Speaker 2: I felt that it was a place of family.  I felt that even though East St. Louis itself did not know the importance of its family life, I could see it, and I could see the possibilities situated as it was on the border between southern racism and northern kind of freedom of spirit.  I could see that as the possibility of a city that would be able to stand on its own. But above all let me say that the family was the big thing for me.
Story_ID: 6713
Speaker 1: You said family drew you to East St. Louis [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes, because.
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: Well, my brother-in-law [David Pratt], Mr. P's [John Pratt] brother, was in Carbondale [Illinois], the university there [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale], and between us driving back and forth to an assignment that I had in East St. Louis, we began to see it as being a major development in the Midwest about as far as we went, major development in how a city can overcome its inherent cultural diversities and its inherent racial -- what should I say -- its inherent racial -- I can't give you the word.
Story_ID: 6714
Speaker 1: In your life you are a product of an interracial marriage.  You were also in an interracial marriage.  You could have chosen a white life as easily over, you know, a black-oriented life, and I'm just wondering why you made -- what made you choose to be so committed to that black cause in every way?
Speaker 2: I think that what made me do what I did like making East St. Louis [Illinois] my life cause after my disappointment in Haiti -- I mean along with my disappointment in Haiti, I think that you've got to look at people that I have said influenced me, you know, people like Erich Fromm, I put him at the top of the list.  People like Melville Herskovits and like Robert Redfield and the various people, Bernard Berenson, these people have all looked upon me as a person, as a human being, and this is what I apparently needed at these stages of my life because each one of these persons represents a different stage of my life.  I'm just coping with that now, going back to the very beginning, who represent my brother, Erich Fromm, Robert Redfield, and I go on like that, and I can see that I am the product of the good thinking, the forward direct thinking, the right thinking of a half dozen brilliant thinkers of our century.
Story_ID: 6715
Speaker 1: What things would you want to do?  What do you still want to do?  Do you want to write 'My Field', but what things do you still want to do with your time?
Speaker 2: Well, I want to finish that book.  I feel that I must, you know.  I not only must.  I really want to.  Leaving it out, I'd like to go on guiding, guiding the training of certain types of people, guiding the training of the people who want to be somebody themselves, people who feel that they have something to offer.  I'd like to go on examining people, want to do and helping them on their path to be able to do it.  I'd like to have a quiet personal life into my closing years on this planet. And I'd like to be able to set standards for people that they know that they can achieve and open a pathway to achieve it and do it. And I would like to exhibit my feelings, put forward my feelings of love.  I'm very anxious now to take the single word 'love' and its meaning and how to achieve it.
Speaker 1: And Mrs. Dunham, I can -- I mean, what -- You've probably heard this before, but there probably will never be another Katherine Dunham ever.
Speaker 2: No, but there'll be another somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Another me is impossible without that same mix, and I don't think that same mix has to occur now or several thousand years later or whatever it is.  I am the mix of these things.  They may not come together, God knows when.  The important thing is the understanding that they will come together in somebody else.  You'll sit here I don't know how many generations from now and say to them, "How does it feel to be another Katherine Dunham?" And they'll say, "Well, I'm not.  I'm another me."  You know what I mean?  They better not. (laughter) I'll fix 'em.  Yeah, I'll fix 'em.
Speaker 1: You'll come back and haunt them for sure.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 6716
Speaker 1: I want to ask you a question about your hopes for the African American race.  I want to ask you that question first.
Speaker 2: I would say every hope in the world.  I think the American -- the African American life is one that all people should study and know about and read about and admire that it has done what it has done and is doing what it is doing.  I think that our life in America has given an example to the rest of the world that is unparalleled.  Nothing like it, and we are going to live it through the crest of knowledge and experience and feeling to its heights where it belongs, where we belong.  I'm proud of it.  I'm happy with it.  It is not the only life that I have known, but it is the greatest.
Story_ID: 6717
Speaker 1: What, in terms of the arts and humanities, because you're a humanist -- what role does the arts play in life or humanities or what would -- what is its intrinsic value?
Speaker 2: I think that art is such a founding part of our being as human beings that it can no longer be just simply considered and tossed away or it is something that we know about but with so and so and so.  I think that art is us.  Art is our being.  Art is our isthmus, just like breathing, eating, defecating, making love, whatever art's do, man come in.  Art is us.  Those of us who are wise enough to recognize it see it and know it, not push it in a part of our lives but accept it.  I think art is the great master of the being of man.
Story_ID: 6718
Speaker 1: If your mother, both mothers [Fanny June Dunham, Annette Dunham], could look back and look at you now in your life, what do you think they would say?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think the dear lady would be happy with what she sees.  I think she'd sit for a minute and say, "Oh, I remember that little bundle, little delightful person, and I'm happy because she's happy."
Speaker 1: And last question, Mrs. Dunham, what would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I would like for what my legacy?  Oh, oh.  Giving, loving, embracing, hoping, achieving, giving.
