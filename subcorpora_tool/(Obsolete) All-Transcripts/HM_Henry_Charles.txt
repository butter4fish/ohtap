Story_ID: 333230
Speaker 1: All right.  We're gonna do some of your family background now, please.  Could you please tell me about your mother, what was her name and could you spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother was Ruth Holbert [Ruth Holbert Henry], R-U-T-H, H-O-L-B-E-R-T.  And she was born in Zanesville, Ohio, July 15, 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you know about her background and her growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, her, her father, my grandfather, Lewis Holbert, was born in Marietta, Ohio.  And her mother, my grandmother, Inez Holbert [Inez Mayle Holbert], was born in West Virginia, near Grafton, West Virginia.  And--
Speaker 1: Do you know her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Her maiden name was--
Speaker 1: Mayle (laughter).
Speaker 2: Mayle, M-A-Y-L-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And so could you tell us about your mother's growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was raised in Zanesville, Ohio, born in Zanesville, Ohio, one of eight children.  One of the children died very young as a, as, as an infant as many, and my father's [Charles Patrick Henry, II] family also had, was a family of eight children with one sort of death as an infant.  And she grew up, my, my grandfather worked at the glass mill in Zanesville, Ohio, and worked the furnaces.  Many African Americans got sort of the toughest jobs around the furnaces.  And as a result of working at the furnace all those years eventually went blind in his, his later life as, as a result of that.  Pardon me.  When she was a teenager they moved to the country and this was in the Depression [Great Depression] and they lived in a, (laughter) the large family, in a very small shack on, it was about a hundred acres of land at the time.  But the, the going was very tough.  And she tells stories of my grandfather sort of hitching a ride to Chicago [Illinois] to try to find work.  I know he walked thirteen miles to Newark [Ohio] and back several times looking for a job.  The, the farm was halfway between Zanesville, Ohio, and Newark, Ohio, where I was born.  And fortunately because they had land they were able to grow some things so she spent at least half of her childhood on a farm and sort of, I can't remember whether, I think, she said she actually learned how to milk a cow at one time.  So she knows a good bit about, about the farm.  And my grandmother was raising those, those eight children.  And so they were, they were what we would call poor.  She talks about having sort of one, one school outfit, one dress, and one skirt that she would wear every day and she would wash it and then put it back on and they would get one pair of shoes a year, that kind of thing.  But, you know, it was a, a strong family.  And there were four girls and four boys and they remained a sort of close knit family for, until the deaths, there are, there, three of the girls are still alive, my Aunt Dorothy [ph.] and my Aunt Mary [Mary Holbert Jones] and one of the boys is alive, my Uncle Woodrow [Woodrow Holbert].
Story_ID: 333231
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother [Ruth Holbert Henry]?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother is, is, was quite good-looking as a, as a young lady and, and fairly athletic.  I recall trying to race her, thought I, thinking that she couldn't run and she beat me in a race around a park once which was very deflating for my ego.  And she played some baseball with me on occasion.  My mother was my, my father's [Charles Patrick Henry, II] second wife.  His first wife died.  And so she was twenty-five years younger than my father.  And as she told me fairly recently had to talk him into having children since he was fifty-seven when I was born and sixty-three when my brother [Oren Henry] was born.  And so because he was retired for most of the time that we were growing up, he didn't get out and play baseball with us and those sorts of things.  So he had been a bricklayer for forty years and so I assume he had some aches and pains at that age since I have them and I'm not a bricklayer.  And so my mother would be the one that would get out and ride bikes with us and toss the ball with us.  And, and she was very much a homemaker.  My father was paternalistic, he was born in 1890 and a lot of the 1890 Victorian values stayed with him, so the man was the breadwinner and the woman stayed in the home and raised the kids.  And she wanted to go out to work several times and he said absolutely not.  So she raised us.  I had one brother, so there were just the two of us.  I, I think most people who know us would say we were spoiled by our mother, who did everything for us including buttering our bread and all of this.  And so she was, she was very attached to, to the kids.  And I was her favorite, and my brother was my father's favorite.
Speaker 1: Did she ever go to work?
Speaker 2: She did go to work after my father died.  And my brother was only sixteen, actually fifteen at the time my father died.  And so she had to go out to work because we were living on social security at the time, well when I was being raised I had moved out by the time he died, but for a number of years we lived on, on his social security.  And so she went to work at Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio], my alma mater, as a switchboard operator.  And in her fifties learned sort of how to operate the switchboard.  And, of course, I think it was a very good move for her to get out, she made friends and gained some self-confidence, I think, knowing that she could take care of herself.  But the Holberts, in general, are a kind of passive group, and they're non-aggressive.
Story_ID: 333232
Speaker 1: My father, on the other hand, was a take charge kind of guy and a leader (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what was his name, please?
Speaker 1: His name was Charles Patrick Henry, II, all right.  And his nickname was Cap because he was a captain in the Masonic lodge, in the patrols.  And my nickname growing up was Chick.  So to keep the two Charles separated it was, it was Cap, I was Chick, my brother [Oren Henry] was Buzz.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Where was your father born?
Speaker 1: My father was born in Newark, Ohio, February 26, 1890.  And he was the third generation of Henrys to be born in Newark, Ohio.  I was the fourth generation to be born in Newark, Ohio.
Speaker 2: What do you know about his background?
Speaker 1: Well, the Henrys came from, came to Newark from New Castle, Pennsylvania, the Normans [ph.] and the Henrys, which were sort of, part of the, the Henry families.  My, my grandfather [William Henry] married a Norman [Elizabeth Henry].  And so stories around 18th--in the 1830s, my great-grandfather took a Conestoda--a Conestoga wagon and bought the family to Newark, Ohio.  And then the, the story, I don't know whether it's apocryphal or not, was that he had traded a house for a race horse at one point.  But the family did have a home on Elmwood Avenue in Newark, Ohio, and that's where my father was born upstairs.  He said the doctor charged five dollars to deliver him in 1890.  So I don't know a lot about my great-grandfather in terms of his occupation other than he was very interested in horses.  But my, I, I do know that my grandfather, and his two brothers served in the Civil War.
Speaker 2: And what were their names, please?
Speaker 1: One was Oren Henry, and my brother was named after him.  And the other was, I think, William, John William [sic.] or--
Speaker 2: Charles [Charles Patrick Henry].
Speaker 1: Well, well, Charles, yeah, I'm thinking or, yeah, Charles, who my father was named after.
Story_ID: 333233
Speaker 1: As the story goes, you could, sort of--people could buy their way out of the, the draft in the Civil War.  And so the story goes that my, my, my  grandfa-  my [paternal] great-grandfather, actually, received money for signing up my, my grandfather [William Henry] and my two [paternal] great uncles [Oren Henry and Charles Patrick Henry] to serve in the Civil War, which as you might suspect created some tension and bad feeling in the family.  And actually one of them was wounded, shot in the head at the Battle of Lookout Mountain but lived for, for ten years after that with the bullet in his, in his skull.
Speaker 2: Were they part of the colored troops?
Speaker 1: Yep, yeah, yeah.  There was Ohio colored troops.  And I actually had at one point, I gave them to the Chicago--the DuSable Museum [DuSable Museum of African American History] in Chicago [Illinois], I gave them my great uncle's discharge papers from the [U.S.] Army, Uncle Charles, and along with my father's [Charles Patrick Henry, II] discharge papers from the 10th Cavalry [10th Cavalry Regiment].  And he, we have a picture, well I have a medal here, he went to the reunion of the Grand Army of the Republic in the early 1900s as a Civil War veteran.  And, and so we've got some sort of memorabilia and some other sort of Civil War memorabilia from their service.
Story_ID: 333234
Speaker 1: So can we assume that your family was a free family, or they were slaves?
Speaker 2: From--so the research my wife [Loretta Crenshaw Henry] has done, we've, we have traced the Henrys back to the late 1700s in the United States.  And I had thought because I am Charles Patrick Henry, III [HistoryMaker Charles Henry] and, and I know the line had gone back, and at one time when 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley] came out I had done some research and had traced the family back to Rockbridge County, Virginia, and this was the county that the, the more famous Patrick Henry, give me, give me liberty or give me death fame, came from [sic.].  So at, so I, I, I thought maybe at some point we had been servants, slaves to Patrick Henry.  But through research done by my wife it turns out that it would be what, my [paternal] great-great-grandfather was the keeper of the Natural Bridge at Monticello [Charlottesville, Virginia], on Jefferson's [President Thomas Jefferson] plantation.  And the indications are he was a free black.  So as far as we know, as far back as we've been able to go, the Henry side of the family has been free.  The Normans [ph.] also appear to have been free for, for several generations.  We know at the turn of the 20th century, the Normans had a, a white woman serving them as a maid.  And so this would (laughter), this would have been rather unusual for, for, for blacks in 1900.  But my [paternal] grandfather [William Henry] was a barber.  My Uncle Charles [Charles Patrick Henry] was a barber, my, my, my father [Charles Patrick Henry, II] was a barber, my grandfather was a barber in Newark, Ohio, my Uncle Charles eventually went to Coshocton, Ohio, where he was a barber.  My grandfather died in an accident on a streetcar in 1898.  And my father went to live with his Uncle Charles in Coshocton.  So from the age of eight, my Uncle Charles in Coshocton raised him.  And for one reason or another I, my father I (unclear) discussing it, decided not to go into barbering but went into the bricklaying trade, which was quite unusual for African Americans at that time, in that area.  And the Norman side of the family helped him get in to the bricklaying trade and hired him in, in Newark [Ohio] at the glass works as a bricklayer.  And so he began, he dropped out of school in, in the eighth grade and began his career as a, as a brick mason.
Story_ID: 333235
Speaker 1: What about his [U.S.] military career?
Speaker 2: Well, in 1909 he [Henry's father, Charles Patrick Henry, II] joined the 10th Cavalry [10th Cavalry Regiment].  And, of course, in 1909 we're talking about the cavalry on horses.  And served for three years from 1909 to 1912.  And, and listening to him talk about it and tell many, many stories I, I think it was the happiest time of his, his life.  I recall a trip we made to New England, and I think it was 1955, I know we drove clear up to Vermont because for much of the time he was stationed in, in Vermont and he tried to get on the military base where he had, he had trained at Fort Bennington [ph.], Vermont, and he didn't have any military papers with him and so they were very apologetic but they said we can't let you on, on the grounds.  But I think actually he enjoyed, enjoyed the cavalry so much he would have stayed if there had been room to sort of move up as an officer.  He became a corporal within those three years, and I think he would have liked to have stayed for a military career.  He often talked about Colonel Young [Charles Young], who was the highest ranking black military officer at the time and everyone admired him.  But he said the hardest thing he had to do was, was to leave his horse, which he grew very attached to.  And he said he almost reenlisted because he didn't wanna leave his horse which was called Red.  And he had very sandy hair and blue eyes, my father, not the horse (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: My father had sandy hair and blue eyes and he was called Red, so the horse and my father were both Red.  And, you know, he played baseball, he boxed in the military.
Speaker 1: Was this, was he a Buffalo Soldier?
Speaker 2: Well, the Buffalo Soldiers came out west and so part of the 9th [9th Cavalry Regiment] and 10th Cavalry are the, the original Buffalo Soldiers.  My father actually fought, I don't recall him talking about some of the people he served with being out west but he did talk about people he served with being with the Rough Riders in Cuba and Teddy Roosevelt [President Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.] in the 10th Cavalry.  And they were very irate because Roosevelt  at one point, after praising them for political reasons, said they were, were not good soldiers, but they had really saved him on San Juan Hill [Cuba].  There are pictures of him sort of riding up the hill on the back of a horse and, and they said if they had Gatling guns he would have been mowed down and, and the 10th Cavalry captured it and then he had the photo op of charging up the hill.  And, and one of the few times I saw my father get so agitated that he had to actually sit down and write something, which he actually dictated to my mother [Ruth Holbert Henry], was Life magazine did a, a big spread on Teddy Roosevelt at San Juan Hill and they were talking about the heroic Teddy Roosevelt, and they didn't say anything about the 10th Cavalry, said something negative, so he wrote, he dictated this long sort of thing about what really happened at San Juan Hill and my mother printed it up and we sent it off to Life magazine, and I don't think they ever, I know they didn't run a story, I don't even think they ran it as a, as a, as a letter to the editor, but he was quite proud of his, his military service.
Story_ID: 333236
Speaker 1: Now we're going to talk about your, your growing up.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Could you please tell us your earliest memory of child, from childhood?
Speaker 2: The circus, the circus.  I actually have a, a book of pictures I colored because it made such an impression on me.  It's the earliest bit of work that that I have today of, of sort of my, my pictures and coloring and growing up.  And it was in east Newark [Ohio], and I was preschool, I think, my mother [Ruth Holbert Henry] says I was, I think I was five, something like that.  But it was a big top, you know, circuses weren't indoors those days.  And so it was the, I'm sure the first time I saw elephants, and lions, and the clowns, and all of this.  And remember we're in pre-television days (laughter) as well.  So you weren't seeing these kinds of things on TV either.  So the circus made such a big impression on me I had to record my views in this, in this book.  And I still love circuses today.  Now there's a, there's also a story I tell that nobody believes the, I was in my crib and I was, I was not, I was not yet a year old, I was eight or nine months, and my mother left the house for something and left me in the crib and I remember waking up and she wasn't there.  And she, she does say she, she left briefly for something, came back but nobody says, they say it's impossible that I remember that.  So I don't know--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --I don't know.  But, but the, certainly the earliest memory that we're certain (laughter) is the circus.
Story_ID: 333237
Speaker 1: Could you describe your family life for us?
Speaker 2: Our nuclear family?  Well, my parents [Ruth Holbert Henry and Charles Patrick Henry, II] were very sort of intent on the, were very intent on the, the two of us sort of going to school, all right.  Even though my mother had a, a high school education and was quite a good student, a much better student in school than I was, a straight A student, but too poor to even consider going to, to college.  And my father, as I said, left in the eighth grade.  But there was always an assumption, there was, and there was always an assumption in my family that that we would go to college, my brother [Oren Henry] and I.  And I, I don't ever remember that being a question in anybody's mind, it just seemed, we were gonna go to college.  So, you know, we came from school, we got to play, we had dinner, we always had dessert for dinner, my mother has a sweet tooth, I think to sort of say is an understatement.  Still today at ninety years old she likes a banana split.  And I share that so I blame her for, for my, my, my weakness for, for sweets and pastries.  And then we would, you know, we would do our homework and, and she would help us with it.  Sort of one or two of the other sort of family events that I remember is because my father was retired for most of our childhood, every now and then we would get in the car and go to Zanesville [Ohio], mainly because Zanesville had a, a much large--even though Zanesville and Newark [Ohio] were about the same size, forty thousand or so people, Zanesville had a much larger black population, Newark had a very small black population.  So there were black bars in, in Zanesville.  And my father liked to drink beer.  And so we would go and we would hit two or three of these bars and he knew the owners of the bars.  One of them was actually a relative of my mother's in one of the bars.  And I, I can remember us kids going in with all these adults and there was a cloud full of smoke in the room, all your clothes smelled like smoke.  And we would order Coke [Coca-Cola], and my mom and dad both liked beer, they would order beer.  My brother would eventually like beer, but he wasn't drinking beer then.  And then we would get to play the, the skee ball machines, the bowling machines, guys would come over and treat us to Coke.  And on occasion I remember Little Richard's 'Tutti Frutti' coming out, I jumped up and danced and people, one guy wanted to pay me to dance.  And, and so this was, and then we'd get in the car and we would drive home another thirty miles to Newark and we would all sing.  And my father had been in a barbershop quartet as a young man and so he liked barbershop songs, 'Sweet Adeline,' and, and 'Clementine' and the kinds of songs they sang with barbershop.  And so, so we would sing all the way home in the car and, and, and, you know, I was undoubtedly the worst singer and he said he was--I was the only person who really couldn't carry a tune at all and to this day that's true but still we sang and we had a good time, and I still remember the words to most of those songs.  And so that was a kind of family event that happened maybe a couple of times a month that sort of we all shared and remembered.  And then I would go out and, and play baseball with my buddies and play with neighborhood kids and ride my bicycle.  And Newark, I think, was sort of a great place to grow up.
Story_ID: 333238
Speaker 1: You mentioned that you have a brother, could you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --tell us his name and when he was born and something about your brother?
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.  My brother is, Oren, O-R-E-N, John, J-O-H-N, Henry, H-E-N-R-Y [Oren Henry].  He's the, is he the second or the third, he's named after my, my [paternal] great uncle [Oren Henry], but I think he's the second, I don't, I don't, I don't think there are any other Orens in the family.  And he's six years younger than me.  He was born August 23, 1953 in Newark, Ohio.  And, you know, was the typical young brother, always bugging the older brother and I had to drag him around places and I had to take him on the back of my bicycle when I would go play ball and things like that.  So we have that kind of relationship with a younger brother.  Six years younger, you're not really competing, you're just kind of a pest for your older brother.  But because there were only the two of us, you know, I think, we're, we're, we're close in the sense we don't talk a lot but I would do anything for him and he would do anything for me.  And we actually sound exactly alike except he's, he's heavyset and, and I was the thin one and, and he's, he's heavier and but, but his voice, his girlfriend used to call up and start talking to me and I wouldn't identify myself as, as, as Chick but as, I, I just didn't say anything and I would say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah," and she would think it was my brother and then every now and then I would say, "Oh, well, you must want my brother."  So he is, he went to Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio] also, where is, where I went as an undergrad, and majored in political science.  And he got his master's degree from Ohio University [Athens, Ohio] in public administration and worked for a long time as the community development director in our hometown of Newark, Ohio.  And then moved to Columbus, Ohio, or moved, he took a job in Columbus, Ohio, he still lived in Newark, with the state community development agency.  And then after working, working there for a brief time moved to Cincinnati [Ohio] to work for the Federal Home Loan Bank [Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati], which he did for, for several years in community development.  He also was president of the Ohio community development, association of professionals.  And for the last, I don't know five or six years, he has been the community development administrator in the government at Cincinnati, Ohio.
Story_ID: 333239
Speaker 1: Could you tell us about the street that you grew up on?  What was the community, your neighborhood like?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we grew up in downtown Newark [Ohio] and it, it, it was quite an unusual environment for kids because my father [Charles Patrick Henry, II] always said he would live on the Courthouse Square if he could.  And Newark does have a Courthouse Square.  We were only a block away from the courthouse.  And so I'm not sure where the loving downtown came from.  He grew up though not far from downtown in, in Newark.  It was also close to the bar he liked (laughter) to walk to.  But so we had fire trucks and regular trucks going up and down the street all in the middle of the night, the fire trucks would go off.  So to this, to this day, I can sleep in, around a lot of noise because you just get used to it growing up there are fire trucks going in the middle of night, it didn't bother you eventually.  But there weren't a lot of kids in, in the downtown area.  Blacks tended to live on the east side of Newark and not downtown and there were a few, sort of on the fringes of downtown, I don't know, quarter mile, half mile from where I lived.  But in my elementary school [Central School, Newark, Ohio], my local elementary school, which was a, had several grades, a couple of first grades I think, I mean but it went from first to ninth grade, I was the only African American in, in, in the elementary school.  And then when we went to junior high school [Central School, Newark, Ohio], I was one of two or three.
Story_ID: 333240
Speaker 1: When we took our break you were describing your neighborhood that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Right.  In, in Newark, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Which is a conservative area of a state that sometimes is conservative and sometimes not as conservative.  But so, it's a largely Republican area.  And it was not until college [Denison University, Granville, Ohio], sort of, that my politics, because my father [Charles Patrick Henry, II] was a Republican.
Speaker 1: Why was--that's unusual for (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he was a, he was a Republican because his father [William Henry] had fought in the Civil War, and so [President] Abraham Lincoln was a very real figure for them.  And, of course, they waved the bloody shirt of the Union.  And, you know, for most, FDR [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] and the New Deal changed things but my father used to say when he went down to try to get a New Deal job they said, well you have to switch parties and become a Democrat and he said well, you know, it shouldn't be that kind of qualification for getting a job so he refused to do it.  And so he supported the Republicans.  So we have pictures in 1960 of my brother [Oren Henry] and I going around with big Nixon [Richard Milhous Nixon] and Lodge [Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.] buttons on.  And sort of fitting in then to sort of the, the general Republican tenor of, of, of the town of Newark.
Story_ID: 333241
Speaker 1: Could you tell me, are there any sights or sounds or smells when you come in contact with them it immediately takes you back to childhood?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee.  (Laughter) Things like ice cream parlors and, and those sorts of things take me back.  I played Little League baseball in Newark [Ohio].  And so that was, you know, when I go in to see baseball or go in to a park, I often, often think about sort of Little League ball and that was a big part of my growing up.  My father [Charles Patrick Henry, II] would drive me out to practice and, and, and that sort of thing.  So I would, I, I, you know, the, (laughter) the other thing as I mentioned is my, my brother [Oren Henry] and I spent a good part of our childhood, at least a memorable part of our childhood, in smoke filled bars.  And so if I go into a smoke filled bar today, which is hard to find, I think of Zanesville, Ohio, and going into smoke filled bars.  Back then we were the only kids in those bars.  And I remember my mother [Ruth Holbert Henry] used to send me to go get my father.  After he retired he would go to the bar and see his friends on the Square [Courthouse Square, Newark, Ohio] and have a few beers in Newark so come dinner time she would say, "Go over and get your dad; it's dinner time."  And so I would run, I ran everything, everywhere as a kid.  I, you know, I, I have no memory of standing still at all as a kid.  I would run to the store, I would run everything.  I, I fell down the stairs, broke bones several times, was very accident prone as a kid.  I guess because I was running all the time.  Had every childhood disease, including whooping cough, measles, mumps, chickenpox, you name it, I had it.  So (laughter) I, I'm, I sympathize sometimes with my mother having to, wondering, you know, what's gonna happen to him next, is he gonna break his arm, is he gonna get the mumps.  But so I guess those, those strange things of, sort of going in the baseball stadium reminds me of sort of playing ball back then and smoke filled bars (laughter).
Story_ID: 333242
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, we're gonna talk about your schooling.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell us about your elementary school.
Speaker 2: Well, Central High School--or, Central School [Newark, Ohio] was an elementary and junior high school.  Growing up, it had no kindergarten, so I did not go to kindergarten.  And I, I have a, a rather traumatic memory of my first day of school because my brother [Oren Henry] was born that week.  And so my mother [Ruth Holbert Henry] either was in the hospital or at home with my brother who had just been born, and school is starting.  And I had to go to school by myself, I don't know what my father [Charles Patrick Henry, II] was doing (laughter), but he didn't accompany me to school.  School was fortunately only a block away.  But as, as you might imagine for a six year old that was quite intimidating to kind of leave your mother, I didn't have any kindergarten experience, and we really didn't have any experience with other, lots of other little kids around then who had school experience.  I didn't have, you know, a lot of cousins, or I did have cousins, but, you know, they hadn't sort of briefed me on school, what school was like, especially since they hadn't gone to Central School.  So I, I had to go to the first grade by myself.  And then and so that was a big, a big step.  But I spent nine years in that school from the first grade to the ninth grade.  And, of course, as with many kids I can remember the names of all, all of my teachers, you know, from the first grade to the ninth grade.  As I said, I was the only black kid in that elementary school.  I don't recall any, feeling any instances of prejudice, I mean, as, as, as an elementary school student.  They might have been there I just might not have been conscious of them.  But in terms of the teachers treatment of me or anything like that I don't, you know, I, you know, we went on field trips together, we ate lunch together, we got our milk together and so forth and so on.
Story_ID: 333243
Speaker 1: In junior high school [Central School, Newark, Ohio] there were a couple of things that and, and as I said there were maybe three or four other black kids in junior high school, there were, there were two or three things that stick in my mind.  One was that I was, I was placed in a general business class in the eighth or ninth grade.  And even though I was a member of the National Junior Honor Society out of only a handful of kids and, of course, I was the only black kid in junior high school in, in, in the National Junior Honor Society, for some reason they placed me in, in the business track.  And I actually was the best student in the business track and had a trophy at the end of the year for my work in business, but it wasn't college track.  And so my mother [Ruth Holbert Henry] came to the school and said, you know, "I want him to go to college, and this is gonna do it," and they said, "No, he needs to," and so she got me out of that business track.  But, you know, sort of ironic now that I'm a college professor that, you know, if, if I hadn't been taken out of that business track, I, I certainly wouldn't have had the, the, the credits to go to, to, to college.  So that certainly could have been an instance of people saying well this is a black kid, why put him in a college track, right.
Story_ID: 333244
Speaker 1: And then, of course, you have, I had white friends, but I don't remember being invited to any social events at their house and so that I'm sure was a reflection of some of the prejudice, the kids got along fine, but their parents probably said, well we don't want, you know, them over to the house for dinner or for your birthday party or, or whatever.  There was also in, in Newark [Ohio] a skating rink, a roller skating rink and there were one night a week black kids could go to that.  And it was probably not until high school [Newark Senior High School; Newark High School, Newark, Ohio], I didn't roller skate, but we decided in high school to go on a Saturday night instead of Thursday night, which was the black night, and that was our big civil rights protest.  And, and we were all afraid, we got together the three or four us and decided to do this, we were all afraid we were gonna be beaten up or something.  But the funny part is the, the three kids I was with could roller skate so they got out on the floor and skated and since I couldn't roller skate I had to sit there and all these white students gathered around me sitting there looking at me instead of out on the floor skating, but they didn't do anything.  And so that was uneventful and, and then, then we went back, I guess, they went back to skating on Thursday night.  There used to be also one, one, we'd go to Buckeye Lake [Buckeye Lake Park, Ohio], which was the resort in Central Ohio for, it had an amusement park and it was, it was a lake and picnic grounds.  And we used to go once a, once a year and it was great and there would be all these black folks there and, and there would be bands and so forth, and I said, this is great.  And it wasn't until I got significantly older that I realized that was the only day of the year that blacks could go to Buckeye Lake that was black day at Buckeye Lake, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's, it's just, I guess, lots of people don't think of the North--of Ohio, especially during that time as, as being segregated.  We always think about the South.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we think of the South and, and, and, of course, if you're the only kid, or a few kids, then they don't make a big effort to separate you out.  If there had been, you know, 10 percent, 15 percent then I'm sure there would have been more of an effort to separate you.  But on the social events it kind of comes out.  And I remember in high school, it wasn't my high school class but a class above me that had a few black students, they used to have a, a picnic at a swimming pool for the senior class but they didn't invite the black kids to this because they didn't wanna swim with them.  So they were excluded from, from the senior, senior picnic. Then I'm also suspicious, I was on the tennis team as a senior in high school, and I had just taken up tennis a year or two before so I was kind of lucky to, to make the team.  But I missed the team picture and nobody told me that we were taking the team picture.  And so I showed up, we all sort of, we would leave school and some of us had cars and, and, and I had an old car.  And so we would just drive up to the, the tennis courts weren't near the school so you'd have to drive to the tennis courts.  So I showed up I think around the usual time but by the time I got there the picture had been taken, they said, "You missed the picture," and I said, "Nobody told me about a picture."  So there's a high school yearbook with, (laughter) without my picture.  So I'm suspicious, I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You can't--you have no proof.
Speaker 1: --you know, I don't know if that's the case or not.
Story_ID: 333245
Speaker 1: In your elementary school [Central School, Newark, Ohio] that you went to for nine years do you remember any of your teachers?  Did any of them have an influence on you?
Speaker 2: I remember all of my teachers.  You know, there, there was an incident when I was nine years old that is deeply imprinted on my mind because I was in an accident.  I was walking home, passed a construction site, they were building a bank, and there was this steel beam, the, the major beam holding the front of the bank up was laying on the sidewalk, they were gonna hoist it up with a crane, and I think there was a chain under it, and I was just walking along side, it was right on the, right on the sidewalk, all the school kids are walking on the sidewalk (laughter), there weren't any barriers around it, and so I was walking beside it, I wasn't on it, but apparently some kids behind me or some kids, I don't know if they were in front of me or behind me, but enough kids jumped up on this beam that it tipped over, it was an I-beam and it tipped over and landed on my foot and crushed, I can still feel sort of the weight pressing down today.  And, of course, a bunch of workers ran over and they pried it up and they pulled, pulled my foot out from under it.  And somebody put me in a car and took me to the hospital, right.  And I remember yelling and the whole time, "Am I gonna die, am I gonna die," you know, they said, "No, you're not gonna die, you're not gonna die."  But it was serious enough that I was in the hospital for two weeks and my foot sort of was swollen like a balloon and turned all black and blue.  And I remember the doctor coming in and poking, you know, the big boils that developed, and they were really, at some point, were trying to make a decision whether they could save the foot or not.  And they decided they could save the foot, and then some of the bones were crushed so they were kind of jammed back together and they said, "You might have chronic arthritis as a result of this."  And so I also remember the dietician coming in because I wasn't eating and she said, "What do you like?"  And she read a, she had two pages of things she read, and I think of those two pages of things she read I checked three things, hot dogs and hamburgers and fries, or something like that, nothing good for me but they brought me some stuff I would eat.  And when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How's your foot today?
Speaker 2: My foot is fine today.  My foot is fine today.  My mother [Ruth Holbert Henry] and father [Charles Patrick Henry, II] alternated staying overnight with me.
Story_ID: 333246
Speaker 1: But I mention it because my, my schoolmates were very sympathetic.  Then I came back to school [Central School, Newark, Ohio] on crutches and they were all tell us all about it, what was the hospital like, they sent me cards in the hospital and all of them signed their names to them.  And I remember sort of getting very good on crutches that I could like move as fast as you could run almost on the crutches and go up and down stairs.  The worst part of it was that I missed a baseball season.  The best part of it was that we sued the bank and the construction company, and two years later we had a trial, we actually went to trial.  And I remember I had a suit and a tie and I had another sport coat and they said, "No, wear the same suit, we want you," you know, preparation for the jury, "we don't want you to appear to be wealthy," or anything like that.  But we actually went through a couple days of testimony and I'd had lots of x-rays and they made plaster casts of my feet and all this.  And I think it was the third day and we had, in this huge ornate courtroom and this is all very sort of impressive and intimidating for an eleven year old and to have to get up on the stand and all of that.  I think the third day of the trial, this was a jury trial, the third day of the trial I think the, the defense said, "Hey, this kid's gonna win," (laughter) "The jury's gonna give him some money" or something.  But they made me quit baseball because they said, "You know, if you're running around it doesn't look like you're gonna be permanently injured," so I had to quit baseball.  So we got a settlement large enough to pay for my first three years of college [Denison University, Granville, Ohio], I think it was like twelve thousand dollars, so it wasn't a lot, but it ran out my third year of college, and so I had to get a loan for the fourth year, this was before they were giving lots of financial aid for black students.  So it did finance my first three years of, of, of college--
Story_ID: 333247
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers who really stand out in that (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, my fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Disponette [ph.] was my favorite teacher, and I'm not sure why.  I loved the fifth grade [at Central School, Newark, Ohio], I loved going to school up through the fifth grade.  When I got to the sixth grade we had Mrs. Bazler [ph.] and she was the anti-Mrs. Disponette.  Mrs. Disponette was an angel, Mrs. Bazler was the witch.  And she turned us off, or at least turned me off to school.  But then when we went to the seventh grade, of course, it was different you were changing classes and we had several sort of folks we like, the first male teacher I had was my homeroom teacher in the seventh grade and he was a big 6'2" ex-marine and he had served in the Korean War and he would do sort of strength tricks holding kids up by, you know, their necks and, and, and taking care of the, the, the, you know, the tough--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --kids, right.  And keeping them in line and, and telling all these stories about the [U.S.] Army or the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps].  And so he was, he was great because we hadn't had male teachers and we certainly hadn't had a marine.  And so everybody remembered Mr. Dawson [ph.], you know.  And so he was probably my favorite teacher in, in junior high school [Central School, Newark, Ohio].  And as I said I don't remember them being encouraging or discouraging in terms of me, they just expected me to do my work and I did my work and I got promoted on.  The toughest course was algebra and, and to this day (laughter) it haunts me.  I had Algebra One in the seventh grade and we had, I think, five or six substitute teachers that year.  And so I blame that for me not getting a good grounding.  The, the class was always in an uproar.  And that sort of weak algebra background followed me right on through my math career.
Story_ID: 333248
Speaker 1: High school, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Newark Senior High School [Newark High School, Newark, Ohio].  And it was unusual in that it was the, one of the few campus high schools in the country when it was built, it was, we were like the second or third class.  We might have been the first class to go all the way through in, in that high school.  But it was several buildings on a very nice campus.  And I think there were five or six in the country at that, at that time.
Speaker 1: Was it the only high school in the city?
Speaker 2: It was the only public high school.  There was a Catholic high school [Newark Catholic High School, Newark, Ohio] in the city, and I actually had a couple of cousins who went to the Catholic high school.  And it was a quite large high school with about 1600, 1700 students.  I think there were eight black students in my senior class of 600 and some.  And, you know, high school was not my favorite time or experience.  I guess the most exciting thing about high school was learning how to drive.  We were all, my buddies and I were all down there the day we turned sixteen to get our driving permits.  And when I was seventeen I was able to get a '57 [1957] Ford, a used car, and drive around when we had money for gas, right.  I joined several clubs, I joined the Key Club [Key Club International], I joined the math club, I joined the German club.  I took German as a language because I thought I was gonna be in science at one time, so it was advised I take German.  I must have joined two or three other clubs, I'm forgetting right now.  So I joined these clubs, I eventually played on the tennis team.  And so, you know, high school was but, you know, I think I liked the movie, one of, 'American Graffiti' is one of my favorite movies because I can identify with a lot of those kids in that movie and that particular time and the songs from those, those times.  So I remember the Friday night football games and going with a gang and sitting with a gang and cheering at the football.  I actually wanted to sign up for football and brought papers home for my mother [Ruth Holbert Henry] to sign and she refused to sign them.  She said, "You'll kill yourself."  And so instead of playing with pads and supervision, on Sundays I would go to the sandlots and play with grown men on some occasions with no pads and come home beat up as a result of, and no supervision and trees on the sides.  So I got to play football, but not on, not on the team.  I was pretty small and so I really didn't start growing until senior year in high school, maybe in college [Denison University, Granville, Ohio] and, and I remember in junior high school [Central School, Newark, Ohio] I was like with the short group.  And in high school, at least early high school I was the center on the short people's basketball team.
Speaker 1: Short people's basketball team (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they would divide you up and, and they had the short people and I was the center and so I had all these center moves that were good with short people but when I started playing with big people, they didn't do me any good at all (laughter), right.  But I still have a great hook shot.
Story_ID: 333249
Speaker 1: Could you tell me about your, the friends you had, and what did you guys--your friends in high school [Newark Senior High School; Newark High School, Newark, Ohio] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we, we, we had, I had a diverse group of friends.  I had a couple of pretty good friends who were white.  There were, you know, Newark [Ohio] was not multicultural, so there was a small black population (laughter), it was overwhelmingly white.  I remember one Chinese person in the town, one Jamaican, who was the doctor next door, right.  Don't remember any Latinos.  And, and so we're talking essentially about a black/white town.  So I had a couple of good, several good white friends through high school, from junior high [Central School, Newark, Ohio] to high school including one who would pick me up and drive me to school for a couple of years in, in the mornings.  And then two really good black friends.  My best friend was Edward Folds, and Brent Jones was also one of my good friends.  And we used to hang out together, we used to play a lot of basketball particularly at my house.  We were able to put up a rim, it was near a wall, the corner of a wall so you had to be careful when you drove in that you didn't run into the wall.  But we would after school come and play basketball year round.  We would play in the snow, we would shovel snow, so I'd play in the snow, we'd play in the rain until my mother [Ruth Holbert Henry] would make me come in for, for dinner, and then we might play some after dinner.  And then we would play some football in football season and baseball in the summer.
Story_ID: 333250
Speaker 1: But I did my homework, and when senior came around [at Newark Senior High School; Newark High School, Newark, Ohio], I really didn't know anything about colleges, no one in my family had been to college and I'd, I'd really heard of three colleges.  I knew about Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I knew about Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], which was up the road about thirty miles, and where a lot of Newark [Ohio] students went, and I knew about Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio], which was an elite private school six miles from Ohio [sic. Newark, Ohio].  So I applied to those three schools.  And I don't remember my counselors saying yea or nay, you should or shouldn't apply to college, you know, it was one of those schools where you had--a counselor had two hundred students or something like that, so you didn't get a lot of counseling.  So I didn't get into Harvard, I got into Ohio State, and I got into Denison and so since Denison was a better school, I went to Denison.  And I remember taking sort of the, the SATs, sort of cold, you know, without any experience at all in taking those kinds of tests.
Story_ID: 333251
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [Newark Senior High School; Newark High School, Newark, Ohio], did you, what were your aspirations, what did you think you were gonna do--
Speaker 2: Ah.
Speaker 1: --when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Good question.  When I was thirteen I decided I was gonna get a Ph.D. in political science.  And--
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's a pretty strange thing for--
Speaker 2: I don't know anyone else that's made that decision at least in political science that that early.  And, and here's how I pieced together my reasoning (laughter) for that since I've been asked that.  How I've sort of come to understand that decision because it wasn't like a light went on at some point and I just knew that instant.  But I turned thirteen in 1960, and this was the year the sit-in movement began, and the real Civil Rights Movement with all these actions and students demonstrating, young people demonstrating on a daily basis, right.  And it was also the year Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] took office with Camelot, and he was a young president making his appeals to do, you know, do, do for your country instead of yourself.  And so I think it was that influence that I wanted to get involved in politics and public service and civil rights and I decided the way to change things for large numbers of people was through politics, right.  And so in my thirteen year old mind I said if I'm gonna be in politics, I need to get a Ph.D. in political science 'cause I don't want people to say I'm not qualified to be a politician.  So I didn't know that most politicians, you know, if you're gonna go into politics maybe you get a law degree, or for African Americans there are all kinds of routes, ministry, or whatever.  But in my mind, okay, I gotta get a degree in political science then I can run for office and people say ah, he's qualified.  So even after I learned that you didn't (laughter) need a Ph.D. to run for office, I was interested in politics so I studied politics.  And so from, from the age of thirteen, I knew I was gonna get a degree in political science and that's what I did.
Story_ID: 333252
Speaker 1: Did your family attend church?  Was church very important in your home life?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my family had attended church some before I was born.  This is one interesting story kind of the opposite of church is that my father [Charles Patrick Henry, II], while he laid brick for forty years as a brick mason, also for a number of years, and I'm not sure exactly how many, my mother [Ruth Holbert Henry] could tell us, ran a pool hall sort of a snack shop with, with pool tables.  And in this pool hall he also ran a numbers business which in, was pre-lottery, right, before there was lottery and numbers weren't legal, though, like the lottery is.  And both blacks and whites played numbers with, with my father in, in Newark [Ohio].  And my mother eventually got involved, too, in, in, in helping out in this business.  I guess a decision was made by the two of them before I was born that this might be a bad influence or, or something, but they sold the pool hall to my uncle and got out of the numbers business so when I came along unfortunately, there was no pool, there were no pool tables (laughter) and there was no number business.
Speaker 1: Why do you say unfortunately?
Speaker 2: Well, I would have loved to have learned to play pool in a pool hall and been able to hustle my way through high school [Newark Senior High School; Newark High School, Newark, Ohio] and college [Denison University, Granville, Ohio] instead of having to sort of be taken advantage of (laughter) in the local pool hall by, by the other sharks.  I was told by my mother, my father was quite a good pool player and actually played the state champ once, I don't know that he won, but he played him good.
Story_ID: 333253
Speaker 1: They both had attended church before I was born.  My mother [Ruth Holbert Henry] had attended church.  My father [Charles Patrick Henry, II] was one of the, sort of three principals donating money to the local A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church [Trinity A.M.E. Church, Newark, Ohio].  And that's a little ironic because he belonged to the, the Colored Episcopal [Colored Methodist Episcopal; Christian Methodist Episcopal (C.M.E.)] church in Columbus, Ohio, when I was growing up and I don't remember him ever going to the A.M.E. church.  But he did donate money to help get the A.M.E. church started, and that's the church my mother went to, and she sang in the choir at one time before I was born, when I came along they weren't going to church.  You know, I, I think it had something to do with the ministers and whether you're happy with the ministers or not.  But I started going to Sunday school and to church.
Story_ID: 333254
Speaker 1: And it was in Sunday school that I met one of my first adult mentors, [HistoryMaker] Julius Richardson, who had moved to Newark [Ohio] during my teenage years to work at the Newark Air Force Station [Newark Air Force Base, Newark, Ohio] and was a Sunday school teacher for us kids.  And was good at not only teaching Sunday school but passing out advice to young people and sort of took it as, as, as a duty of his to sort of guide people in the, in, in, in the right directions.  And he lived across the street from my best friend, Edward Folds, so I would go visit Edward and then we would go see Mr. Richardson and Mr.--see us.  And so, you know, I remember one, one evening as a teenager my car had broken down and we wanted to go somewhere to, to meet girls, and so we said, maybe Mr. Richardson will loan us his car.  So we went to Mr. Richardson's house and said, "Mr. Richardson, you know, you know us, we're good boys, so we don't get in trouble, we don't speed," and so forth, which was a lie, I drove like a demon, was in a number of accidents, "Would you loan us our car, you know, we wanna go to Columbus [Ohio]," I think it was.  And he didn't say no, but he didn't say yes.  He, he started talking about, "Well, what are you gonna do, and when are you boys, what are you gonna do with your futures," and, and by the next time we kind of looked up at our clock it was 12:30 or one o'clock in the morning, you know.  And then he said, "Oh, it's too late for you guys to go out now."  And so we, we, we left.  But it was, he was that kind of person, he wouldn't say, no, don't do it, he would just start talking to you about, you know, well, what do you think is a good decision, what is (unclear) and so forth (unclear). And, and, and so, so he was one of those really good positive influences in Sunday school.  I had perfect attendance in Sunday school for a while not, main reason was I wanted to date the Sunday school teacher, not Mr. Richardson, but there was a young woman teaching Sunday school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, well--
Story_ID: 333255
Speaker 1: You were telling us that the real reason you went to Sunday school was to meet a young lady.  Can you tell us about that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) No, I didn't say that, I said--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --the reason I had perfect attendance--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: --was that. Of course, I went to Sunday school for the Christian education--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --but a lot of the black social life did revolve as, as in many communities around, we had an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church [Trinity A.M.E. Church, Newark, Ohio] and we had a Baptist church.  And the Baptist church was in eastern Newark where or most of the black population lived and the A.M.E. church was near downtown just a couple of blocks from where I lived.  So (cough) pardon me.  So I went to the A.M.E. church.  And, you know, a number of the--so the, the black girls that I dated went to that church and my buddies went to that church.  We were ushers, we were part of the junior usher board.  They had a junior choir.  So I don't remember black social life around the high school [Newark Senior High School; Newark High School, Newark, Ohio] so much as sort of around the church.  And then, you know, somebody might have a house party that you went to church with.  And, and so you'd go to the house parties in the summer or the yard parties and, and, and that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 333256
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers in high school [Newark Senior High School; Newark High School, Newark, Ohio] who really influenced you?
Speaker 2: Not, not, not really.  I mean, I can't, you know, there, there wasn't a teacher I said I, you know, this is my model, I wanna be like that et cetera.  Mr. Richardson [HistoryMaker Julius Richardson] in Sunday school [at Trinity A.M.E. Church, Newark, Ohio].  You know, when I said I was interested in politics he said well, you know, you'll go far and he was very supportive in terms of well you can do anything you wanna do and, and, and that sort of thing.  So, so that was encouraging.  But there wasn't a kind of teacher that, we had no black teachers, of course, and so there wasn't a role model from, from, from that perspective.  I think we had one or two teachers that had gone to Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio] and, of course, I was interested in, in, in Denison, but there wasn't a, a high school teacher that I sort of said, oh, you know, I wanna be like that person.
Story_ID: 333257
Speaker 1: You said when you were in junior high school [Central School, Newark, Ohio] you decided you wanted to get a Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're at the end of high school [Newark Senior High School; Newark High School, Newark, Ohio], is that still your goal in life?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  So I was actually recruited as a senior in high school by a political science professor at Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio] who invited me up to campus.  And a fraternity hosted me overnight, so I spent the night in the fraternity house, this fraternity was the American Commons Club [ACC].  And the American Commons Club had a long history going back to World War II [sic. World War I, WWI] of sort of having a multicultural brotherhood of, of, of students living there.  So Denison had had on occasion other black students and international students and they tended to be in the American Commons Club.  When I went to Denison there were still a couple of fraternities--I remember Sigma Chi [Sigma Chi Fraternity] was one of them--that had a formal ban on black students as members.  So when they had pledged rush week or pledge week I even went, I went to those just to challenge them.  But they, they certainly didn't offer (laughter) to take me in as a student.  And so ended up at ACC.  And so, you know, the nerds were there, the non-jocks were there.  You know, when I see these nerd films and the, the, the house that the nerds, you know, you have the international students and, and, and then and, and the science students, that was ACC, and the theater students, you know.  So I was the best athlete (laughter) in the ACC.  But it was, it was a great environment.

Speaker 1: I didn't live on campus, I lived at home [Newark, Ohio] and commuted because it was a lot cheaper.  And so my $12,000 would go a lot further, it would have been eaten up right away if I had stayed on campus.  So I missed that experience.  But also since my father [Charles Patrick Henry, II] was, was, was getting up in years it was kind of important for me to be at home to drive my mother [Ruth Holbert Henry] and brother [Oren Henry] around and that sort of thing.  So, so I was recruited, I came in then as a political science major, I took this professor's course right away the first semester in, in political science.  I got a C plus.  And I got an A in a philosophy course.  And afterwards he said, "Maybe you wanna think about majoring in philosophy instead of political science."  And I said, "No, I wanna major in political science."  So I stayed with it, that was the only C I, I got in political science.  And then I had the satisfaction of, a few years ago, giving a, the Du Bois Lecture [W.E.B. Du Bois Lecture] at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], and this professor was teaching at the University of Illinois, he's quite a senior--
Speaker 2: What was his name?
Speaker 1: --professor now.  His name was Fred Wirt [Frederick M. Wirt], W-I-R-T.  He was teaching at the University of Illinois, and he introduced me and told them, you know, about me and Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio].  And I wanted to get up afterwards, I thanked him profusely, I wanted to get up and say, you remember you told me to get out of political science (laughter).  But, of course, I didn't.  I, I didn't do that but it was nice then to hear him sort of say nice things about me after having sort of suggested I get out of it.  So I stuck with it.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: And my best friend in, in college Barry Roseman [Barry D. Roseman], who didn't know what he wanted to major in at all was in that same course and he got an A plus in the course, sort of broke the curve.  That was very discouraging, this guy didn't know what he wanted to be and he was--got an A plus.  But we became best friends as a result of that in, in, in college.
Story_ID: 333259
Speaker 1: So how were your four years?  Did you enjoy it?  How many black students were there at Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I was the only black male at Denison.  And Denison had about 1700, 17 to 1800 students in 1965 when I went to Denison.  I was the only black male student.  I was warned by, I don't know whether it was Professor Wirt [Frederick M. Wirt] or some of the other people I talked to when I went up there as a high school student [at Newark Senior High School; Newark High School, Newark, Ohio] to visit that, you know, I might get a rude reception from some folks.  They said that they had had a black student either the year or two before me and he had ended up dating a white female student and there was some ugly incidents around that.  So the implied message was maybe you wanna think twice about that kind of thing.  And so, so I, I was the only black male student on the whole campus.  There were two black female students in that same freshman class.  And there were no black professors on campus at Denison in '65 [1965].  A year or two later a black counselor and assistant dean of the chapel came that was David Rice, and so I got to know him quite well.  And then I don't, I don't remember it was my second or third year there we eventually got a black faculty member at Denison.  But Denison was a much more positive experience I think than high school in, in part because I sort of came into my own politically, of course, as many students did.  I had to fight the draft and I came in sort of as a supporter of the war in Vietnam [Vietnam War].  In '65 [1965] I remember arguing with, with some of my friends that, you know, we had to stay in there to fight communism so that there wouldn't be a domino effect and they wouldn't sweep all Southeast Asia.  Well by, you know, by my sophomore year my views were changing on that and so I participated in the first march in Licking County [Ohio] against the, the war, I think, somebody said it was the first (laughter) anti-war march ever in Licking County.  And then when I was eventually drafted the first time my, my--Bill Nichols, who was my English teacher went down to the draft board with me, I applied for conscientious objector status.  And I didn't get it, and I think they said I was only the second person even to ever apply for it.  But, of course, I was, I was opposing it on philosophical grounds and they would only accept religious grounds for it.  And so I participated in the anti-war activity, but I also helped sort of co-found the, the Black Student Union.  I was a co-founder of the Experimental College [Denison Experimental College], where students taught their own courses.
Story_ID: 333260
Speaker 1: We had racial incidents [at Denison University, Granville, Ohio], we're talking about the late '60s [1960s].  I remember I had, in macroeconomics, which is a frightening course to begin with, and, of course, I was the only black student in macroeconomics, I had a, a Taiwanese teacher, and he pulled me aside early after one of the classes and said, "I expect you to do twice as well as anybody else for the same grade, you're gonna have to do twice the work."  And I'm like, "I beg your pardon?  Twice the work in macroeconomics for the same grade, what gives?"  He says, "Well, my people made it by working twice as hard, and so if African Americans wanna make it, you're gonna have to work twice as hard in this course to get the grade."  So he considered that, I guess, helping me (laughter) or inspiring me.  So I stuck with the course, I think I got a B in it, you know.  I had another teacher I think in English I wrote an essay on Malcolm X and at the end of the essay I said I hope we have other Malcolm Xs, and by that I meant Malcolm had been open to changing, to educating himself, he was sort of self-educated, and then open to changing his viewpoints at the end of his life.  When I got the paper back and the professor said at the end, God, I hope not, when I wrote, you know, I hope we have another Malcolm X.  I remember joining the Denison Christian Association, and we would go to suburban churches and talk to sort of people after church about integration and race relations.  I remember going to my first race relations class in sociology taught by Irving Mitchell, who ended up being my neighbor eventually.  And I remember talking about Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] and Charles Hamilton's book 'Black Power' ['Black Power: The Politics of Liberation in America,' Charles V. Hamilton and Kwame Ture], well that came up and, and he turned to me and said, "Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Henry], what do black people think about that?"  And there were forty white students and me and I, I sort of said I don't know what all black people think about (laughter)--this is what I think about it.  But because of that I, I tried to invite Stokely Carmichael to campus to come and speak, unfortunately he backed out at the last minute.  But so there were those kinds of incidents where, you know, everyone on campus knows your name because you're the black student.  And for some reason I'm not sure when or where it started, I mean, it started immediately, but I was called Chuck and all through high school [Newark Senior High School; Newark High School, Newark, Ohio] I had been Chick.  But my name is Charles Henry but, you know, I went through the fraternity [American Commons Club] pledge thing and everybody said, "Hi Chuck," Chuck, Chuck.  So I didn't say hey, that's not my name, I just, I went along with it.  When I was in, playing Little League baseball my coaches called me Charlie [ph.], and I didn't like Charlie, so I, I wouldn't respond to Charlie, but Chuck I accepted.  So I can kind of, if somebody calls me on the phone and they say, "Hi Chick," I know they're from high school, if they say, "Hi Chuck," I know they're from, from college.  If they say, "Hi Charles," I know it's somebody I met after college.
Story_ID: 333261
Speaker 1: Do you feel like you received a good education there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I do.  I had no trouble sort of in graduate school, and I was competing with students, I went to University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] for graduate school so I was competing with very good students and Chicago was very selective in the people it admitted.  I had a lot of trouble my first year of college because I really didn't have to work that hard in high school [Newark Senior High School; Newark High School, Newark, Ohio] to get good grades but college was a step-up.  And, you know, I really had nobody to help me with my homework or to study because my mother [Ruth Holbert Henry] had gone to high school and not beyond that.  And plus you had required courses you had to take in science and in language.  And so you take all those as early as you can, so you, I took those the first year.  So I had a, a two point average my first year, a C average.  I didn't do well in my science course, I didn't do well in my language course.  I only got a C plus in my political science course (laughter).  And so I didn't do well but I learned how to study, right.  And then I learned from listening to other students what professors to avoid, either they were too hard or they weren't fair or whatever and, and, and faculty you could work with.  And I think Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio] was very helpful because it was such a small school, it was all faculty teaching you, you knew where they lived, they knew your name.  If I had gone to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] I, I, I didn't have the grades to get into Berkeley (laughter), but if I had gone to Berkeley I would have been lost, you know, and I would have been one of a number.  But so, so it was good from that standpoint.  So I learned how to study and so I was on the dean's list then from, from my sophomore year on, on, on through graduation.
Story_ID: 333262
Speaker 1: This was during the time of the Civil Rights Movements?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did that affect you at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, you know, '65 [1965] we were shifting into black power and so because I teach the Civil Rights Movement among other things and I teach black nationalism, and your students always wanna know, I say well I'm more a product of sort of the Black Power movement than, than the Civil Rights Movement 'cause the Civil Rights Movement was primarily a southern movement and so the major demonstrations were in the South, they were far removed from me.  I wish I had gone to the March on Washington but nobody was putting together a bus load of students to go to the March on Washington and, and that kind of thing.  So I wasn't involved sort of in the Civil Rights Movement in the South.  I had mentioned the one little protest that we kind of had at the skate, skating rink.  But certainly by college, I was very much an activist.  I remember my senior year I went to more meetings than I did classes, you know, and I had my highest grade point average (laughter).  But so helping found the Black Student Union, I taught in the Experimental College [Denison Experimental College] a course on Africa, recent African history because I had taken the African history course from the professor at Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio] and he taught it from the perspective that colonialism was a good thing for Africa.  And I didn't know anything about Africa, but I suspected that this was not (laughter) an accurate portrayal and that's not what I was hearing publicly in, in, in the '60s [1960s] about Africa.  And so I read up on Africa and then I offered a, a course on Africa in the Experimental College that had the opposite perspective.  And I remember sort of being in the Experimental College class teaching and he came once and peeked his head in the door to see who was in there taking this course and then, and then left.  So, so the activism was around that.  We formed the Black Student Union, and I named the, we had a minister of defense.  Now you don't normally think you need a minister of defense for a college organization but the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] had a minister of defense so we had a minister of, of defense.  And, you know, we had a, you know, we had ministers instead of presidents and, and that sort of, so we were very much influenced by sort of what was happening with the Panthers and, and all of that, what was going on at places like Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] and, and, and Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio] and obviously out here at San Francisco State [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] and, and Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  So the combination of, of black power and I participated in the first black culture course that we taught, we demanded it as students.  And since there were no black faculty, some of us students, and I was the senior (laughter), I ended up sort of teaching in that along with some of the professors.  And I remember sort of having to grade my peers and several of them said, "Well you should give us automatic A's because we're black," and I said, "I don't think that's the way it's supposed to work," right.  And, and so, so it was a time of great activism and, and I was kind of advantaged in the standpoint that Denison was a couple years behind places like Oberlin and Antioch [Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio] so they had already had black student unions so I, I was able to be in sort of on the ground floor in doing some of this.
Story_ID: 333263
Speaker 1: Okay, so after you left Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio] what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, fortunately, it didn't feel fortunate at the time, but Denison's political science majors have to take oral exams from outside examiners so they brought two professors in from prestigious schools, the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], to examine us.  And so while I, I took my exam from the, the professor from the University of Pennsylvania, the professor from Chicago got to know the students that had come out of Denison.  And so I applied to several graduate schools.  This time I applied to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I got on the waiting list, I didn't get turned down, but I got accepted at, at Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] and, and Chicago.  And I wanted to go to Chicago because they focused on theory and I was interested in theory, but they didn't offer me any money.  And so my college advisor got on the phone and called the guy who had come down to, to test our students and said, you know, it's kind of insult to accept him, you know he doesn't have any money, right (laughter), his family's on social security, he doesn't have any money and so you should offer him some money if you're serious.  And so this professor--I got a full ride at Chicago.  So I went to Chicago and I eventually ended up sort of with this Professor Theodore Lowi [Theodore J. Lowi] of being my mentor at, at the, at the University of Chicago.  So that's how I ended up at, at, at Chicago.
Story_ID: 333264
Speaker 1: Did you go through cultural shock coming from a small kind of rural town in Ohio [Newark, Ohio] going to this big city?
Speaker 2: It was a major cultural shock.  One, the University of Chicago is on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois], so it's this small integrated island in a vast, almost all-black area.  But the thing that struck me the most was how strictly segregated Chicago was.  So my wife [Loretta Crenshaw Henry] and I, who I hope we'll get to talking about (laughter) in a minute, lived on, in student housing in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], but if you drove west from Hyde Park through the South Side you reach Racine Avenue, which went the length of Chicago, and on the east side of Racine Avenue from, from Racine all the way to the lake [Lake Michigan] it was solid black, even the stores and the postmen on the east side were black.  You crossed the street, the stores were white, the postman was white and everything was white all the way up to the suburbs, passed Midway Airport [Chicago Midway International Airport, Chicago, Illinois].  And that would be the only time we would go out there, we'd go to Midway Airport or to the shopping center way out on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].  I remember a couple of times blacks had strayed over this line and they had run out of gas and they were beaten to death by, by gangs.  And so I had never experienced this kind of racial segregation.  I had also never experienced a large black community like this.  The black Muslims were at their peak, Elijah Muhammad lived in our neighborhood.  Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] was operating Operation Breadbasket, later to become Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois].  We used to go to Breadbasket meetings.  I got involved with their political action committee.  We had a black state senator, Senator Newhouse [Richard H. Newhouse, Jr.], I got involved in anti-Daley [Richard J. Daley] machine activities with Senator Newhouse.  We formed a, a tenant union.  And so we had a tenant union in our building and we were doing things around the tenant union.  And so it was a time of great deal of activism.  Fred Hampton was killed on the West Side shortly after that so we visited that site.  I went to the Panther [Black Panther Party] headquarters on the West Side of Chicago.  So it was a very, I went to the Gary [Indiana] convention [National Black Political Convention] in 1972, the national--first national black convention of the modern era.  So it was a, a great sort of coming together of the theory I was learning at the University of Chicago and sort of practical black politics.
Story_ID: 333265
Speaker 1: The other thing I, I want to say about Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] was I had my, finally my first black professor at Chicago.  We didn't have any black professors the whole time I was at Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio], I think, I said we, we had some at the time, we, we did not have any.  We had the assistant dean [David Rice] of the chapel, we did not have any black faculty, so I had never had a black faculty member until I went to Chicago.  And so my first semester I signed up for [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin's course in American history.  And so my first black professor was John Hope Franklin which (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you tell us something about him?
Speaker 1: Well, he's probably the most distinguished, certainly the most distinguished black historian and, and one of the most distinguished American historians, having won virtually every major award there is in history and being president of the American Historical Association.  And he's still alive, he is in his nineties today.  I just got something about contributing to a chair they're going to establish for him or, or a fellows program for students, Franklin fellows at the University of Chicago.  He had, after he retired from Chicago he went to Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] and, and stayed there for a number of years.  What I remember most about him other than being, he's a very distinguished historian who absolutely knew sort of history backward and forward, was that he took the time to grade my grammar and my English and my spelling.  And, and it needed some correcting.  But the first time I got back a paper there were, it was all marked up with all this red stuff and, you know.  Sometimes you get the impression faculty don't even read your papers, not only did he read it, he went to the trouble of, of correcting all this.  So he spent a lot of time sort of working on his students.  And I was not a history major so I was not mentored by him but the students he mentored sort of stayed with him sort of the rest of his life just as Lowi [Theodore J. Lowi] students who I was have sort of stayed with him.  But I still have been in touch with Franklin on, on several occasions since I graduated.  He's written letters of recommendation for me for various things.  I actually, when I was his--going to school at Denison went back to my high school and taught black history, I volunteered to go back because I said I, I didn't have any black history at Newark High School [Newark Senior High School; Newark High School, Newark, Ohio].  And so with Mr. Richardson's [HistoryMaker Julius Richardson] help, we convinced the school board [Newark Board of Education], I remember going to a school board meeting with Mr. Richardson support, convinced them to let me come back and, and volunteer to teach black history.  So I remember teaching three or four sections of black history a day, giving the same lecture and that was really boring.  But I think I did that for a semester and they promised me they were gonna hire somebody and do it regularly but they--
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: --didn't do that.
Speaker 2: Never did.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 333266
Speaker 1: When you were at Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] did you meet any interesting--were any students, were there any black students?
Speaker 2: Ha.
Speaker 1: Ha?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a, we had a cohort in political science of four that came in at the same time I did.  And there was one black student who had been there the year before and then there was a, a more senior black woman there, Marguerite Barnett [Marguerite Ross Barnett], who later became the president of the University of Houston [Houston, Texas] and unfortunately has since died.  But that core, cohort that came in with me have remained good friends today.  I think it was the largest cohort of black students they had ever had there.  I remember going to my first poli-sci [political science] class and the, the one black student who had been there the year before came back to me after the class, which was on the Ivory Coast and Africa, came back to me and, and said, "Oh, you must be the new affirmative action student."
Speaker 1: Who was that (laughter)?
Speaker 2: And that was [HistoryMaker] Lorenzo Morris, who's currently chair of political science at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And this is his personality, he tends to insult people right off the bat.  But once you get to know him and deal with that he's, he's a good person.  And I wrote my first book with him.  We were both graduate students when we wrote a book called 'The Chit'lin Controversy: Race and Public Policy in America' [Lorenzo Morris and Charles Henry].
Speaker 1: Your choice in title (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It gets, it gets its title from a story in 'The Book of Negro Folklore' by Langston Hughes and Arna Bontemps called the "Chit'lin Controversy" [ph.], I think, about desegregating restaurants in Washington, D.C.  And it was quite appropriate for the topic we were, we were talking about.  We had to fight the publisher [Dodd, Mead and Company, New York, New York] to keep that, that title.  And I think the book is out of print now.  And one other close friend that was in my class was Dianne Pinderhughes, who is now the president elect of the American Political Science Association.  So, so that group has done very well sort of in, in, in political science.
Story_ID: 333267
Speaker 1: So you stayed there [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] for your master's [degree] and your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Right.  We--I entered the Ph.D. program and you sort of pickup your master's along the way, they didn't have the terminal master's.  So a couple of years in I got the master's and then within five years I got the Ph.D.  And I was the first in my cohort to, to get the Ph.D.  And then I, I became an American Political Science Association Congressional Fellow.  When I was in college [Denison University, Granville, Ohio], my, my faculty advisor Roy Morey [Roy D. Morey] had been an American Political Science Association Congressional Fellow and had worked in [U.S.] Congress as a fellow and then stayed on as a staff member.  And so he used to lecture and they'd say, well this is what it says in the book and then this is how it really happens on the ground.  And I said, gee, that's a great experience, you know, that gives you another insight, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) so what did you experience, excuse me?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, the, the experience of how it actually operates, there's a theory and there's the practice.  So I said, hey, if I get a chance I'm gonna apply for an American Political Science Association Congressional Fellowship so I can get that practical experience.
Speaker 1: Of doing what?
Speaker 2: Of working in Congress.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Congressional Fellows, it's, it's not, it's not an intern, you're certainly not a full staff member but you're given duties as a sort of full staff member because these are people who are graduate students and, and, and there are professional journalists who are also Congressional Fellows and senior civil servants, so these are people with some skills.  So it's not sort of getting coffee for someone.  So I applied for this, you know, at some point in my graduate career when I was getting near the Ph.D., I applied for the Congressional Fellowship and I got it.  And, in fact, one of the books I was quizzed on, they give you an oral exam among other things for the Congressional Fellowship, was a book on the legislative process ['The Legislative Struggle: A Study in Social Combat'] by Bertram Gross [Bertram Myron Gross], who later became a mentor of mine when I moved to California.  So I knew his work from that.  So I got this Congressional Fellowship and I worked for six months in the office of Senator Hubert Humphrey.  And, and then for six months in the offices of the Congressional Black Caucus.  And so that was a great experience.  I moved from then Washing- or from Chicago [Illinois] to Washington [D.C.].  And I interviewed for Humphrey's job.  The Congressional Fellows have voluminous files.  Every fellow has to sort of compile a, a sort of diary of their experience in offices.  So I read these files and I learned the two best offices to get into in terms of getting hands-on experience were Humphrey's office and Lee Metcalf of Montana.  And Humphrey had a whole bunch of people apply.  I was lucky enough to get in one of the two slots of fellows he took.
Story_ID: 333268
Speaker 1: You're on your way to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] to work for the, no, you've been accepted by Mr. Humphrey [Hubert Humphrey] to work for him.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I wanted to mention that, you know, I, I said I got through graduate school [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] in five years.  The reason I got through in five years, I had a wife, who was teaching school in Chicago [Illinois] and getting up at -15 degrees in the middle of, of the night to get ready to go to school and that would be blowing snow.  And I'd be staying in bed 'til 11 A.M. and then heading down to the library, get a stack of books to read in grad school.  And after a couple of years of that she got very irritable and said, "You need to get out of here and get your degree and go to work," you know.  My [maternal] grandmother [Inez Mayle Holbert] couldn't understand why I was in graduate school anyway. I had a college [Denison University, Granville, Ohio] degree, what--was I just goofing off, you know, she didn't understand the whole concept of graduate school.  So I was getting a lot of pressure from my wife.  And, and, and that leads me back to the most important event of my whole life, which was my marriage between my junior year in college and my senior year in college.  I got married a week after I turned twenty-one.  And this was a traumatic event especially for my mother [Ruth Holbert Henry], who thought I was gonna drop out of college as a result of that.  It turned out just the opposite, my wife (laughter) encouraged me to not only get of college but get out of graduate school and get a job.  But I married Loretta Jean Crenshaw [Loretta Crenshaw Henry] from Dayton, Ohio.  Her family had moved to Newark, Ohio, about the same time the Richardson family had when the Newark Air Force Station [Newark Air Force Base] was opened in Newark.  And they had worked in the [U.S.] military in Dayton [Ohio] as civilian employees the Richardsons and the Crenshaws and several other folks.  And they moved to Newark giving Newark its first sort of black middle class (laughter).  And my best friend, Edward Folds, started dating Loretta's sister, Delores [Delores Crenshaw Thompson], and so when I was sixteen years old I went to a yard party and there was Delores and her sister, Loretta, and so I immediately asked my, my best friend to fix me up with a date for, with, with Loretta.  And this was difficult because I was two years younger, and she wouldn't have anything to do with me.  But I was persistent and so after a couple of years I got a date and we ended up married at age twenty-one, and then lived together on Mulberry Street in Granville [Ohio], moved to Chicago [Illinois], and then to D.C., where I worked within--Humphrey as a Congressional Fellow [American Political Science Association Congressional Fellow] in the Congressional Black Caucus, she worked at an education consulting firm.
Story_ID: 333269
Speaker 1: Working with Humphrey [Hubert Humphrey] was a great experience, he was a great man, he sort of considered himself a mentor and teacher to all the fellows [American Political Science Association Congressional Fellows].  So I would see him several times a week, I would travel around with him to give, he gave a lot of talks to students and I would be sort of the guy introducing him.  He gave me real legislative responsibilities, et cetera.  And it's ironic because I had voted against him in '68 [1968] when I, the first time I, I, I voted because of the war in Vietnam [Vietnam War], and its association with Humphrey and the war.  I didn't vote for Nixon [Richard Milhous Nixon] I voted for [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory.  So I kind of was very suspicious of Humphrey as kind of the old guard but what I, so I, I signed up to work for him 'cause it was a good office to work in not because I felt great about Humphrey, but by the time I left I was really a big fan of Humphrey and his wife, Muriel [Muriel Humphrey Brown].
Story_ID: 333270
Speaker 1: And then I went over to the Congressional Black Caucus, which was brand new, it was just a couple of years old and they had a new staff.  And so I got sort of in on the ground floor of helping the caucus get organized and I helped (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who were some of the congressmen?
Speaker 1: Well, I was actually on Barbara Jordan's payroll for a while.  The, the staff members of the, of the caucus were on the (unclear) staffs of the individuals.  [HistoryMaker] Louis Stokes from Ohio was the chair of the caucus.  And ironically the, the legislative district that was created in Cleveland [Ohio] in the late 1960s that Louis Stokes won election to, he won election by defeating my, we called him uncle but he was really my cousin, Charles Lucas [Charles P. Lucas, Sr.].  It was Charles Lucas' lawsuit in Cleveland that got that district, I think it was the 22nd District [sic. 21st District] or something, created.  But my uncle, my cousin (laughter) was a Republican.  And this was almost all-black district, they elected the Democrat, Louis Stokes.  So I ended up working for somebody who had defeated my cousin for office.  So I got to organize the first legislative weekend of the caucus.  We got to go to the big banquets, and I remember [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes and Aretha Franklin and some of the folks that participated in those banquets.  And, of course, if you're a political science person, Washington [D.C.] is the center of the universe.  And I also finished my dissertation then while I was a fellow [American Political Science Association Congressional Fellow] that that that first year.  And then they offered me a, a job to stay on full-time with the caucus, but by then I knew I didn't wanna be a staff member with the caucus, you kind of have to have no ego at all, you're, you are who your boss is, and, you know, I, I never considered myself a staff person, I wanted to teach political science.
Story_ID: 333271
Speaker 1: And so I managed to get an offer from Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And Howard University was one of the few black universities with a graduate program [in political science], I had an illustrious history, it was there in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: It's a black school, you'd always been at white schools (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And it's a historically black school [HBCU] and I chose to go to Howard precisely because I wanted to be in an environment that I was the majority instead of the one--one of a few.  I wanted to know what that experience was like.  And so I, I taught political science at Howard for three years.  And including doing a lot of administrative work early on, et cetera, and it was a very diverse department that Ralph Bunche had created.  And ironically later on I would write Ralph Bunche's biography ['Ralph Bunche: Model Negro or American Other?' Charles P. Henry].  But at the time there was very little about Ralph Bunche, sort of known on campus among the students, et cetera, they had a Ralph Bunche/Civil Rights Collection [Ralph Bunche/Civil Rights Documentation Project] in the Moorland-Spingarn Library [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.], but not much about Bunche and, and nothing in Douglass Hall [Frederick Douglass Memorial Hall], where the political science department was.  And so that was a great experience.  It was a very diverse department with, with whites with West Indians with Greeks with Yugoslavs with, with people who had been students of Ralph Bunche, with young black professors, I think there were twenty-six of us.  And I was teaching graduate students who were about my age by my second year at Howard.  But it was so intense politically in terms of what was going on on campus, and D.C. was so expensive to live in, that I had to teach summer school.  And then they provided no research funds, so I couldn't get any publishing done.  So I figured if I'm ever gonna be able to do research and publishing I need to get out of Howard where I've got some research support and where I, it's not so expensive that I have to teach summer school.
Story_ID: 333272
Speaker 1: My wife [Loretta Crenshaw Henry] and I adopted our first child as an infant, she was two weeks old in 1974.  We picked her up the same week I got (tape interruption) my Ph.D.  Went to Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], got the Ph.D., drove back all night and picked her up (laughter).
Speaker 2: And what's her name?
Speaker 1: And her name is Adia Jean Henry [Adia Henry].  And so we were trying to start a family and so resources were important.  So my third year at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I got a call from the provost at Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio], who had been my old political science professor, Louis Brakeman [Louis F. Brakeman], saying, why don't you come back and head up the, the black studies program which you were a student agitating for and we created and now it's sort of fallen on hard times and also teach political science.  So that's how I got into black studies by going back to Denison and heading up this program that I had agitated to help start and taught the first course in black, the black culture course that we had started.  And so it was a nice move back to Ohio because my wife's parents [Virginia Anderson Crenshaw and Roy Wesley Crenshaw] were still there, my mother [Ruth Holbert Henry] and brother [Oren Henry] were still there, we now had a new baby, so they, the grandparents would be there.  And it was much cheaper to live in Granville, Ohio.  So I was directing black studies, I was teaching political science, within a year I became an assistant dean of the college.  And we did a number of things, we were able to get black studies installed as a requirement for all students, either had to take black studies or women's studies.  We were one of the few country, course, one of the few schools in the country to do that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And how long were you at Denison?
Speaker 1: I was at Denison from 1976 to 1980.
Speaker 2: Were you the only black faculty member?
Speaker 1: By the time I went back as a faculty member there were a handful of other black faculty members.  They had a new black assistant dean of the chapel, there was an economist, there was a psychologist, there was an English professor.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They were black--
Story_ID: 333273
Speaker 1: So after you left Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio], where did you go?
Speaker 2: After I left Denison I, I--Denison is a teaching school rather than a research school, and I wanted more opportunities to do research.  So I went back to Ohio, not with the intention of staying at Denison but to sort of turn around the black studies program.  And after four years I felt that I had done that.  And so I saw an ad for a position at the University of California at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] in African American studies and I had actually visited San Francisco [California] and ran over to Berkeley's campus, saw a fraction of it and had to run back for a meeting, so I really hadn't been on the campus, but we liked the area, my wife [Loretta Crenshaw Henry] and I liked the area.  We had driven down to San Diego State [San Diego State College; San Diego State University, San Diego, California] and UC Santa Cruz [University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California] while we'd been out here in the early '70s [1970s].  So we liked the area.  So I said I'm gonna apply because there's less teaching and more opportunity to do research.  So I applied, I went out, interviewed and I was offered the job.  But at the same time I had applied for a number of fellowships, a Fulbright Fellowship, which I received for France.  And an NE, an NEH [National Endowment for the Humanities] postdoc fellowship at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And so I wanted to take one of the fellowships, the, the, the postdoc at Atlanta University.  And so Berkeley agreed to wait for a year while I took the postdoc.
Story_ID: 333274
Speaker 1: So I went to Atlanta [Georgia] with my wife [Loretta Crenshaw Henry], we spent a year.  By that time we had adopted our second child in Ohio in 1978.  And, and we named him Charles Wesley Henry after his two grandfathers [Roy Wesley Crenshaw and Charles Patrick Henry, II].  He was two months old when we adopted him.  And by the time we got to Atlanta my wife was pregnant with our third child, Laura [Laura Henry], who was born--
Speaker 2: A week after we got there.
Speaker 1: --a week after we (laughter), we got to Atlanta.  So we had our full family in Atlanta.  I was able then to get a kind of intensive course on African American studies since no one was offering a Ph.D. on it then, by taking this postdoc course from [HistoryMaker] Richard Long, who was one of the great figures in African American culture.  And introduced me to James Baldwin, had drinks with James Baldwin, he had Romare Bearden over to his house.  He knew everyone.  And so it was a great kind of experience in Atlanta.  We met some good friends, Frances Foster [Frances Smith Foster] being one, who was in that seminar with me in Atlanta.
Speaker 2: And where does she teach?
Speaker 1: She teaches at Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia], now, ironically with Richard Long who's moved from Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] to Emory University.  Fran was at San Diego State [San Diego State University, San Diego, California] when she was with me in the postdoc and then moved to the University of California, San Diego [San Diego, California] and then to Emory.  And so had a great year in Atlanta.  It was in Atlanta University at, at Atlanta that Richard Long told me where Ralph Bunche's papers were, and I had decided by then to do a biography of, of Bunche and they were at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] so it was great, I moved to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], and I was able to go back and forth to UCLA and begin work.  So in '81 [1981] my wife and three children now moved to Berkeley to my current position.
Story_ID: 333275
Speaker 1: Could you tell us a little bit about what's happened at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], not that long--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --a little bit (unclear) (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Over the last twenty-five years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, in twenty-five words or less (laughter).
Speaker 2: In twenty-five words, a word for each year.  Yeah, well, being in black studies it was a really serendipitous move for me because I think if I had been in a political science department I would have been a much more narrow scholar, like working on [U.S.] Congress and some of the issues.  My first paper was on the Congressional Black Caucus, and you could easily spend your whole career just working on Congress.  But by it--being in a department with people like Barbara Christian and June Jordan and psychologists and, and people from all these disciplines, I needed to learn something and did learn something whether you wanted to or not from each of them because you have to review their work and et cetera in, in, in a small department.  And so it was very good and broadening of my perspective and it actually led to, my, my second book, 'Culture and African American Politics' [Charles P. Henry], which used folklore, which used black sermons, which used folk tales to look at black political thought from a kind of folk level.  I don't think it would have ever occurred to me to do a book like that if I had been in a political science department.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about the black studies department [Department of African American Studies; Department of African American and African Diaspora Studies]?  They had a very interesting beginning, had it settled down when you got there (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, Berkeley never quite settles down, but it certainly wasn't the activist bed that it was in the '60s [1960s].  But we were by then an established department.  But I do remember Eldridge Cleaver dropping by my office one day, brought in by one of my sort of community scholars who used to sit in on my courses.  He had struck up a friendship with Cleaver and brought him by to meet me and I tried to figure out what Cleaver was really dropping by for.  It turns out he wanted to sell some of his Panther [Black Panther Party] papers so we had a discussion about that.  And, and I introduced him to our African American studies librarian in the library.  But apparently we weren't able to work out a deal, I think he eventually sold them at, at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California].  And we have a lot of interesting people who will come by your office, if you're teaching politics, come by your office with all kinds of interesting ideas that they want to try out on you.
Story_ID: 333276
Speaker 1: But I was involved in a number of sort of important things I think at, at, at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  Berkeley established the first ethnic studies Ph.D. program in the mid-'80s [1980s] and I was chair of the Ethnic Studies Graduate Group.  Ron Takaki [Ronald Takaki] in Asian American studies was the major force in creating that.  It was the first in the country.  I was on the, the committee [Special Committee on Education and Ethnicity] that created the American Cultures Requirement [American Cultures Breadth Requirement] at Berkeley, and that was sort of the first in the nation to be a requirement for all students who would have to take one of these American cultures courses.  And our department [Department of African American Studies; Department of African American and African Diaspora Studies] in 1997 established the second Ph.D. program in African American studies in the United States, Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was the first.  I'm sorry the third one, I think UMass Amherst [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts] beat us by a year.  Ours is the first to focus on the African diaspora.
Speaker 2: What's the diaspora?
Speaker 1: Blacks outside the Africa, so black Britains, Afro Germans, blacks in the West Indies, blacks in Brazil.  We do comparative kinds of studies.  And blacks in the United States, obviously.  So it's been a very enriching experience sort of being at Berkeley, which is sort of a crossroads, everybody comes through here eventually.
Story_ID: 333277
Speaker 1: While you were here, you were involved in some other activities that had very little to do with school.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I think it was probably when I was at Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio] in 1977, I, I heard of Amnesty International because they won the Nobel Peace Prize.  And, you know, I, I teach politics and, and, we talk about horrible political situations and you can feel kind of frustrated about not being able to do anything.  And Amnesty was doing things on the ground even if it was just writing letters, they, you know, at least you feel better if you've done something even if it doesn't change anything.  But there were no Amnesty chapters at Denison or in, in the central Ohio area that I knew of.  But immediately when I got to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], I saw all these Amnesty posters and it turned out Berkeley had the oldest campus network and the largest at that time of all Amnesty's campus networks.
Speaker 1: What's their focus?
Speaker 2: Amnesty is the major human rights organization in the United States working for political prisoners and prisoners of conscience and against torture and against the death penalty.  And obviously the politics of that appealed to me, the human rights aspects of it appealed to me.  So I said, oh, they've got a Amnesty chapter, I'm gonna go.  And so by the end of the first semester I had gone to their meeting.  Well, they were thrilled to see a faculty member there.  And so they took me under their wing, particularly Liola Herinaka [ph.], who was a staff person at Berkeley who had kind of been the chapter mother of these students for several years.  And she, so she was very pleased to have a faculty member, she was an expert in sort of Japanese studies herself.  And, and also a nun, which was quite interesting, she loved to dance and smoke cigarettes and was not your typical nun and, and very much an involved activist.  And so by the summer, the annual national meeting of Amnesty was in Seattle [Washington].  So Liola and others said, well why don't we drive up for the annual meeting, you'll meet a lot of other people and the secretary general is coming from London [England] and so we all drove up to Seattle.  And in Seattle I met Bill Watanabe, who was an Asian American member of the board of directors.  And he said, "I'm trying to encourage Asians to participate in Amnesty, I need your help in encouraging African Americans, you're in black studies, you must know how to do this."  And I said, "I'd be happy to do what I can."  They invited me to several meetings with the staff in New York [New York] and with the board.  I think within six months they said, "Why don't you run for the board of directors in Amnesty?"  And I said, "I just joined the organization a year ago," you know, "won't people resent it?"  And he said, "Well if they resent it, they won't vote for you for the board."  So I said, "Well, that's democracy," so I ran for the board, I was elected.  And in 1983 joined the board of directors of Amnesty.  After three years I was voted chair of the board of directors of Amnesty.  And so in 1986 I became chair that was also the year that we began rock concerts across the United States.  And then two, three years later we did a global rock concert [A Conspiracy of Hope] involving U2 and Sting and Peter Gabriel and Tracy Chapman.  So I got to know the rock music business.  I got to know the direct mail business because we got into direct mail, so Amnesty's membership increased by threefold--its, its, contributions increased by threefold.  You know, I became, it became like another full-time job at, at, at that level.  And I also met my, my, I guess, it would be my second or third great mentor, Ginetta Sagan, who had founded Amnesty in the West.  Joan Baez had helped her in that.  She was Amnesty's major fundraiser.  She had been worked in the opposition to the war, and to the Nazis in Italy in World War II [WWII] and been imprisoned and tortured by the Nazis and had escaped jail.  So she had firsthand experience of human rights.  And she was a, a great person, a humanitarian and an activist, who had a sense of humor and wanted to have a good time.  And Amnesty people generally don't have great senses of humor and don't wanna have a good time so she, (laughter) she was a great person to be around.  And so Amnesty turned out to be a great experience for me and, and remains an important part of my life today.
Story_ID: 333278
Speaker 1: How was it a great experience?
Speaker 2: Well, some of the most inspiring people I've met have been in Amnesty [Amnesty International].  You hear their stories about being tortured, their kids being born in jail, but they're optimistic, they're upbeat, they're trying to change things under horrific situations.  And so if you're feeling sorry for yourself, you only have to listen to them.  I, I, I met someone on our twenty-fifth anniversary in Washington [D.C.] who had been held twenty-six years as a prisoner in the Soviet Gulag.  And, and he, he gave a speech and he said, "I wanna thank Amnesty International for all your help."  And we said, you know, "We wrote letters for you for most of those years but we didn't get you released," he served his full term, and so, "Why are you thanking us?"  And he said, "Well, it was just knowing that somebody outside knew about me and that I hadn't been forgotten and that people were working for me that enabled me to exist day by day by day."  And so when you hear somebody say something like that, you say hey, you know, I was complaining about all the work but it's not a lot of work after all.  And so you meet inspiring people.  It's helped me travel a great deal.  I've been to over sixty countries.  I've met with a number of heads of state.  I've negotiated for people's lives who are on death row.  And some of my good friends today were either staff members or volunteers from that organization.  So after I spent six years on the board of Amnesty they nominated me to be on the International Executive Committee, which are seven volunteers that sort of oversee Amnesty worldwide from the London [England] office, which is where the secretariat is.  And so I spent two years doing that, sort of traveling and, and, and meeting folks.  And so it's been a very meaningful experience.  So, so meaningful that I began to teach then human rights at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  So I offer a course on human rights and U.S. foreign policy to this day (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you see, do you see this as, as an extension of your black studies?  How does black studies (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It's, I see it as an extension of my interest in civil rights and I've simply broadened my perspective to a human rights perspective.  And now I'm sort of, from an academic standpoint, interested in how the Civil Rights Movement got to be called the Civil Rights Movement instead of a human rights movement because I think by calling it a civil rights movement, we narrowed its perspective and it really was and, and should be a human rights movement.  So it's changed kind of my attitude and how I viewed my work, but I think it's grown very naturally out of my interest in civil rights to sort of broaden that perspective.
Story_ID: 333279
Speaker 1: You were also involved--this was an organization that had been established for a long time--there was also an organization you were involved in that you were at kind of its birth, the National Studies Council for Black Studies [sic. National Council for Black Studies].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was sort of a part of the original group of both the National Conference of Black Political Scientists, which started in 1970.  But I played a more active role in the National Council for Black Studies because that's the area I'd really moved in to.  And I was at their first national convention in 1977, it happened to be at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].  And so I was at Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio] at that point and I was invited to be on the steering, the host committee for that meeting by, by Nick Nelson [William E. "Nick" Nelson, Jr.], the chair of black studies at Ohio State.  So I was at that first convention and got involved in running their essay contest, being the secretary of the board, of course, I was put on that board very quickly.  We formed an Ohio consortium or chapter of the group.  And eventually in 1993 I was named president of the National Council for Black Studies.  And I, I guess the two things I'm most proud of as president were our first two international meetings.  We had our first international meeting in Ghana and we had an audience with the president of Ghana [Jerry Rawlings] and we had [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou and Kenneth Kaunda and other folks.  I was enstooled by the minister of culture in, in Ghana and given a very nice ornate stool.  And then we had our second international meeting in Guyana in South America because we wanted to bring in the African diaspora from Guyana and once again, we were hosted by the president [Cheddi Jagan] of the country and, and had a number of very interesting experiences.  The Afro-Guyanese had been kind of subordinated and not, no one knew much about it so we were front page news in Guyana, so we were able to broaden our, our, our sort of reach in the national council.
Story_ID: 333280
Speaker 1: You also were involved in administration at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkley, California], you were an equity faculty person (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.  Well, in, in addition to being chair of our department [Department of African American Studies; Department of African American and African Diaspora Studies] a couple of times and, and, and other kind of administrative duties, after Prop 209 [Proposition 209] passed, which eliminated affirmative action in California, it became a real challenge to try to maintain faculty diversity and student diversity.  So I agreed, being asked by the dean or nominated by the dean, I agreed to be the first full-time faculty equity associate, and we later changed the title to the associate vice provost for faculty equity.  And my, I was essentially the faculty affirmative action officer for three years working for the chancellor in a cabinet level position trying to maintain and increase the diversity of the faculty.  So I was one of the people that had access to all of the files of folks on campus and dealt with promotions and tenure and recruitment.  And that was a full-time job so I had to give up my research for three years to do that.
Story_ID: 333281
Speaker 1: You've written lots of books.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And one of them is Ralph Bunche ['Ralph Bunche: Model Negro or American Other?' Charles P. Henry].  Can you tell us something about your Ralph Bunche book (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the ironic part about Ralph Bunche is after I began work on the biography I found out that our, our, our, my [paternal] grandfather [William Henry] and [paternal] uncle [sic. great uncle, Charles Patrick Henry] no doubt knew Bunche's father because Bunche's father was a barber, Fred Bunche, and was a barber in, in Ohio.  Once in Granville, Ohio, and once in, in Coshocton [Ohio].  And so small, well, it's no black community, Granville (laughter), and very small, and in Coshocton, and so I'm certain they knew one another.
Story_ID: 333282
Speaker 1: All right, you were mentioning that you wrote this book ['Ralphe Bunche: Model Negro or American Other?' Charles P. Henry] on Bunche [Ralph Bunche] and as you were doing your research you discovered that his grandfa- his father had been in Ohio (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His father, Fred Bunche, had been a barber--
Speaker 1: --barber in Ohio.
Speaker 2: --yeah, in Ohio in the same area as my, as, as, as my [paternal] grandfather [William Henry] and my, my [paternal] great uncle [Charles Patrick Henry].  And, of course, our paths had crossed, I never met Bunche but having taught at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in political science, Bunche founded the political science department at Howard.  I'm a black political scientist, Bunche was the first black political scientist, he got his degree in 1934 from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So you find these, of course, he did international affairs and I, I went to work at the state department [U.S. Department of State] in 1994.  I wanted to work for two years in the human rights bureau [Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor], but they had the Republican Revolution in '94 [1994], and it became very difficult to do human rights, so I left after a year.
Speaker 1: That was with Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But my, my good Amnesty [Amnesty International] buddy, John Shattuck, who was on the board with me, was named the assistant secretary of state for human rights, and had asked me to, to come and work with him, and also appointed me to the official delegation to the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna [Austria] in '93 [1993].  So I, I, I saw that as a real opportunity to go back into government as I had done for Humphrey [Hubert Humphrey] and find out what it's like on the executive side working on human rights (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So Clinton had a different view than the Republicans?  You went with Clinton--
Speaker 2: Well, unfortunately not as different as (laughter) I would have liked.  We had all hoped that he would have been more proactive than George H. W. Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush], but it turned out human rights was not a high priority for him.  We did, Rwanda had just happened when I went in and I think that was his greatest foreign policy disaster.  But Haiti was just picking up and I was responsible for collecting some of the images from Amnesty that he used and was used to convince him to intervene in, in Haiti.  So it was a very interesting time there.  But he didn't really speak forcefully on human rights, at least as forcefully as we would have liked.  So I left after a year of that.
Story_ID: 333283
Speaker 1: Now, so back to Bunche [Ralph Bunche], I'm sorry for the interruption. (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah.  I mean, I, I've, I've edited--trying to write, get in somebody's head is very difficult.  So I edited a, a book on Bunche's own speeches and writings (laughter) so you can read yourself what he thought.  But I think biography is a, the toughest kind of writing to do.  You can be objective if you've never met someone but you really don't know how they thought.  So fortunately, Brian Urquhart, who has written the other biography ['Ralph Bunche: An American Odyssey,' Brian Urquhart] of Bunche and who succeeded him and was a good friend had his diaries and correspondence and let me read those and that was very helpful in, in doing the Bunche biography ['Ralphe Bunche: Model Negro or American Other?' Charles P. Henry].
Story_ID: 333284
Speaker 1: Okay, and you've written some other books, could you tell us how you choose the topics?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I, I, I chose Bunche [Ralph Bunche] back when I was at Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio].  You know, teaching in this area, it's kind of, for a long time it was like it was the Civil Rights Movement and everything that happened afterwards and then there was Booker T. Washington and Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois].  And when I was in college it didn't seem like there was anything in between, no one was talking about the '30s [1930s] and the '40s [1940s] and the early '50s [1950s].  And so there was this big gap in my education.  And so I went back to teach at Denison and Jack Kirby [John Kirby] was teaching there and he had written a book ['Black Americans in the Roosevelt Era: Liberalism and Race,' John B. Kirby] on blacks and the New Deal.  And he had given me an article on Ralph Bunche and radical black thought.  And I said, there was radical black thought and Ralph Bunche was a radical at one time, I thought he was this conservative, UN [United Nations] guy, you know.  And I read the article and I said, "Give me some, some of the biographies on Bunche," and he said, "There aren't any."  So I foolishly (laughter) immediately said, "I'm gonna write one."  And it took me some years to, to fulfill that but I did write one ['Ralph Bunche: Model Negro or American Other?' Charles P. Henry].  And I think it's important to, these important historic black intellectual figures, Bunche was the first black Nobel [Nobel Prize] laureate in the world and he had been forgotten.  I'm evidence of that, I knew very little about Bunche and I was studying black politics and black studies.  So I've tried to rescue figures like Bunche for current generations.  Other book topics like Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], I wrote a book on--I think his campaigns in the '80s [1980s] were the most important things happening in black politics in the '80s [1980s].  And people had written on him but they were all very one sided or the other, they were all very anti-Jackson or very pro-Jackson and they weren't balanced accounts.  So I wrote a book, 'Jesse Jackson: The Search for Common Ground' [Charles P. Henry] that I think sort of is a fair-minded attempt to get at both sides of Jackson.  I edited a book ['Foreign Policy and the Black (Inter)national Interest,' ed. Charles P. Henry] on blacks in foreign policy because I was teaching this course on human rights in foreign policy and there weren't any books really dealing with blacks in foreign policy.  So I kind of either do things that I think the works out there are biased one way or the other.
Story_ID: 333285
Speaker 1: My current work is on reparations, racial reparations.  And there are some books out there but they're almost all by legal scholars.  I think politics is the real approach for reparations not the legal system.  So I've decided to write one on the politics of reparations rather than the legal cases around reparations.  And so, so I'm either looking for sort of topics that are important that people are ignoring, like a Ralph Bunche, or topics where there are obvious things like the political side of reparations that's not, that are not being dealt with.
Speaker 2: So what are the political sides of reparations?
Speaker 1: Well, well, I, you know, I, I, I think it has a lot to do with, with memory and forgiveness and, and, and sort of being, the Civil Rights Movement being put on the defensive by the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] administration as self-interest.  And, and the movement for reparations really places sort of the white population on the defensive again as they were during the Civil Rights Movement, how can you morally justify this.  And so it's a kind of, I think, the movement has grown around that because it's, it's sort of offensive again.  Affirmative action puts you in a kind of defensive position.  Reparations puts you in an offensive position.  And we're in an age of apology where you have the pope [Saint Pope John Paul II] apologizing to Galileo [Galileo Galilei], you have the Japanese American reparations being given in 1988.  And so the question is, well, why not African Americans, why not an apology.  And so there are lots of very interesting political questions around democracy and minority rights that I've been able to explore in this reparations book ['Long Overdue: The Politics of Racial Reparations,' Charles P. Henry].

Speaker 1: You've had a lot of awards and, and fellowships.  You had a Fulbright [Fulbright Fellowship] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had a distinguished Fulbright chair at the University of Bologna [Bologna, Italy] in 2003 where I was even able to teach a course on human rights and U.S. foreign policy.  Fortunately, I was able to teach it in English since I don't speak Italian.  And Bologna is the oldest university in Europe.  Galileo [Galileo Galilei], Dante [Dante Alighieri], Sir Thomas More, were students or faculty there.  Those are really old alums.  So it was founded in 1088.  And my wife [Loretta Crenshaw Henry] and I really enjoyed Bologna, and we enjoyed Italy and we were able to travel to Greece and to Egypt.  And I found the students interesting and, and we enjoyed it so much that I've applied and been awarded a, another distinguished Fulbright-Tocqueville chair in France for this coming fall.  So I'm looking forward to teaching a graduate seminar on reparations in France in the fall.

Speaker 1: Is there anything else you'd like to add, is there anything (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well in, in, in '94 [1994] President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] appointed me to the, the National Council on the Humanities.  And I found that a very interesting six, six years.  (Laughter) One of the most interesting, this will be the last Mr. Richardson [HistoryMaker Julius Richardson] story that (laughter) I can mention.  But I, I went to work for the state department [U.S. Department of State] a year before that and I was given an FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation]--I, I was told a very thorough FBI check, but the final oral exam was done when I was already at the state department and already had my secret clearance and the guy came and he sort of asked these questions, who was a retired FBI agent.  And I was saying it's kind of a little late to be doing this, I'm already on the job.  The, the, the background check for the National Council on the Humanities, which is not, doesn't deal with secret anything, was much more thorough than the check for the state department.  They asked me who, who my Sunday school teacher was.  I told them Mr. Richardson (laughter).  They also, they, they asked a number of my friends, you know, all about me.  They asked one of my former students, "Has he done anything that would embarrass the president?" And, and my student said, "No, but the president's done several things to embarrass him." And I said, well that's gonna cost me (laughter) the appointment because it's a presidential appointment with [U.S.] Senate confirmation.  So it was a very thorough investigation.
Story_ID: 333288
Speaker 1: And I spent six years on the national humanities council [National Council on the Humanities] and, and got to go to the White House [Washington, D.C.] several times, and I saw Mandela [Nelson Mandela] at the White House and Yeltsin [Boris Yeltsin] at the White House.  And, and so it was, it was probably a more pleasant experience with the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] White House than it had been working at the state department [U.S. Department of State].  And I met a number of, of people who I've become friends with.
Speaker 2: What kind of things did you do?
Speaker 1: Well the, the national humanities council is the largest funder of humanities research by far in the United States.  So I mean, we, we give out lots of different kinds of grants.  I was the first on the, sort of the public media committee, which provides funds for public television.  So we funded Ken Burns' work for example.  And so it was very interesting getting all these proposals for documentary films.  So I can tell you a lot about films we turned down.  Everything that Ken Burns put out, of course, automatically got a stamp after 'The Civil War.'  But I learned a lot about media and, and what makes a good media proposal and so forth.  And then I was on the preservation committee after a couple of years and I, I knew nothing about that, preserving old newspapers, preserving presidential papers, et cetera.  So reading these proposals was a kind of education itself.  You'd learn something about the library business, the preservation business, the museum business.  So I found that all very educational, as well as, of course, the politics of trying to get our budget passed every year when they were trying to cut it.  When Newt Gingrich was trying to cut it, and cut the National Endowment for the Arts, and we would get in there and fight for it.
Story_ID: 333289
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you've lived your life and what was important to you?
Speaker 2: I, you know, I'm in, in general satisfied.  I don't think, especially somebody who makes their living being a critic like most, most faculty members do is ever happy (laughter) with anything if they do any self-analysis but I'm, I'm, I'm generally satisfied.  I, you know, I, my, my initial goal was a Ph.D. in political science, I got that.  I've moved into an area where I feel like I've been able to be kind of pioneer in many ways with graduate programs with the kinds of works that I've done that have been very interdisciplinary in the field.  And so I feel that I've made a contribution to scholarship that I wouldn't have made in, in political science.  I've been active in politics, in campaigns, on the National Council for Black Studies, on NEH [National Endowment for the Humanities].  And so I've been involved in politics.  I haven't run for public political office, but I felt, I feel that I've been involved in politics.  And, of course, I've done a lot of administration, which is, is not gratifying at the time but you realize you're the only person that can do it or one of the few people to do it.  And, and then eventually you begin to see your students trickle out and do important things and you, you feel good about what you've been able to contribute to that.  So, of course, the professional side is important.  And then I, you know, I don't think I would have accomplished anything professionally without the support I've had from, from my family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any regrets?  Is there something you would have liked to have done?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I regret that I wasn't a professional NBA [National Basketball Association] basketball player.  And, and I often chide my mother [Ruth Holbert Henry] for making me come in for dinner and doing my homework when if I had stayed out and played more basketball I would have, I'd been a star and a millionaire and, and then, you know, a celebrity.  And she takes this criticism seriously (laughter) and says, "But, but."  But, you know, I needed to be a little taller, you know, I can't jump and I'm 5'10", and so I've pretty much given up my NBA ambitions although I still try to play some full court basketball on rare occasions.  But my only regret is not being, you know, a professional basketball player.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Laughter) That's interesting (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I, I also play some guitar, and I still have ambitions of being a better guitar player.  I've played the guitar since high school [Newark Senior High School; Newark High School, Newark, Ohio].  So I, (laughter) I regret that I'm not very good now, but I, I have a goal of, of getting better.

Speaker 1: When you started, when you were a student, you were--there were very few blacks and as you went through graduate school [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] you found more.  And then as you were teaching there were more and more black students coming in.  How do you feel about nowadays and in the future, do you see black students in education these, especially in higher education?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, we actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are you concerned about it?
Speaker 2: --we actually, well very concerned.  We actually peaked in terms of numbers in the '70s [1970s] and early '80s [1980s] and, and, and the numbers have gone down and now plateaued some.  But I don't see the people in the pipeline as, as we call it that need to be there even for us to be replaced, let alone increased.  Black faculty nationally are less than 3 percent of faculty across the country and that's true at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  Black faculty are less than three percent of, of the faculty now.  Our numbers are not, in the state of California are not 12 percent as they are nationally but they're 7 percent but that's still less than half of, of the state population.  So I'm, and my colleagues and I, I mean we meet regularly on this on how do we increase the number of black students at all levels, how do we increase the numbers of, of black faculty.  And because I've been able to advance class wise and career wise as a result of public education, we're all very dedicated, well those of who came up through public education, are very dedicated to public education as a route for upward mobility.  And, and I think we would be very self-serving if we sort of forgot about those who are trying to make it up the same way and say, we've made ours, you know, get yours some way.
Story_ID: 333291
Speaker 1: What values do you consider to be most important and why?
Speaker 2: Well, I, for me I think honesty is, is, is the most important value, I've always sort of had that.  And, you know, I, I'm willing to tolerate being called almost anything like stupid or ugly or dumb or whatever but if you call me dishonest I'll get very upset and I'll (laughter) I'll challenge you on that.  So I think honesty is, is terribly important.  I think obviously if honesty, harping honesty, honesty is being principled, I think.  And I think I've been very fortunate, I've had a number of important mentors that I mentioned, Bertram Gross [Bertram Myron Gross] a little earlier who has kind of mentored me late in my career.  And I, I think they all saw themselves as sort of having been privileged in trying to give something back.  And I think if, you know, the biblical phrase to those who have been given much, much is expected and I, I take that as kind of a principle.  So I, I'm, I'm trying to give back, you know, as, as, as much as I, I can.  And I think everybody in my position should try to do that.  And if you're African American I think you've got a kind of special burden to do that because the obstacles have not gone away.  And, and, and in some ways have intensified.
Story_ID: 333292
Speaker 1: You're a very young man, you have many, many, many years--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --ahead of you.  Is there something you would like to do in the future?
Speaker 2: Well, what I've always done in, in, in my career is sort of keep my option, options open and kind of expose myself to as many new experiences, I mean, going off to France, is kind of new experience.  I wanna learn more about the reparations movement in Europe.  I'm gonna give some lectures at other places in Europe.  And, and, and once again I speak no French, so I think it takes some nerve (laughter) to go to a country and position yourself to lecture in, in English.  But I know I'm gonna make some good friends just as we did in Italy, make some good friends and learn a lot about a situation.  And who knows what will emerge from that.  I mean, I ended up on the national council of humanities [National Council on the Humanities] because I almost ended up running the MacArthur's genius program [MacArthur Fellows Program] and the connections I made doing that put me on the national council.  So, you know, I have this saying, you mentioned favorite sayings it's, it's not my favorite but it's one of, one of the ones I like that--one way to make God laugh is, is to tell him your plans.  And so I have these plans, but I'm not gonna say them publicly, I don't wanna hear God laughing at me with these plans.  So there are certainly some intellectual work I would like to do.  I really, I'm going to do some work on sort of approaches to black studies because I'm not happy with sort of the ones that are out there.  I certainly, there are administrative challenges, but I'm just gonna keep my options open.
Story_ID: 333293
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered professionally?
Speaker 2: I, you know, I'm gonna think about that at my retirement party (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: As someone said my best work is still in front of me so, we'll, (laughter) we'll, we'll wait until the retirement party and talk about how I'm gonna be remembered.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know you have three children and you have three grandchildren now.
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: How, what--do you have a message to give to the, the grandchildren or the great-grandchildren who will, will not have the honor of knowing you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, hopefully this tape will help with, with, with the great-grandchildren if not, if I'm, if I'm not around to bore them with stories.  But no, obviously I wanna encourage both my kids and grandkids to get as much education as they can because I think it opens up options.  But you try to do that without sort of putting a lot of pressure on them.  And one of my greatest shocks was when my first daughter, Adia [Adia Henry], started rebelling against being a professor's child, and having come from a working class family it just never dawned on me, I, I mean, I kind of identified, you know, with, with workers and not college professors, some of my colleagues, sort of several generations of college professors.  And so when she's saying, you know, you don't talk black English and she wants to hang out in the streets this is all kind of a, a shock to me.  So I don't wanna sort of say you're gonna be a professional or you're gonna be a Ph.D. to them.  But I want them to be aware that the more education you get the more options you have and, and we're becoming a very bifurcated society with those people with skills are gonna do quite well and those people without skills are really going to struggle.  And I hope to make it clear to my grandkids that you need to be in that group that's got the skills and the options.

Speaker 1: This is a photo of me, [HistoryMaker] Charles Henry, in the second grade [at Central School, Newark, Ohio], it's my favorite school photo of all my school photos, I think it captures my shyness, but a friendly shyness (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Yes, well, I can't identify everybody (laughter) from, from left to right, I can identify most of them but the person, the small person in the middle is Ginetta Sagan, kind of my mentor in Amnesty International, and she won the national freedom award [Presidential Medal of Freedom], the, the highest award given to a civilian, oh, in the mid-'90s [1990s].  And I had nominated her for this through John Shattuck when I was at the state department [U.S. Department of State].  So this is at the White House [Washington, D.C.], that's Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] on her right.  Her husband, Leonard [Leonard Sagan] is just behind her.  Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] is on the left.  I'm just on Hillary Clinton's right shoulder behind her.  And, and on the other side of Hillary Clinton is Joan Baez.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Hold on a second, please.  Okay.  Great.  Next.  Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is a photo of me and Senator Hubert Humphrey taken probably in the fall of 1972 when I was a Congressional Fellow [American Political Science Association Congressional Fellow] in his office.  And it did have an inscription written on it (laughter) that has since over the years been smeared away.  And as you can see I had more hair then.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: Aha, this is a picture of my Little League team and I am in the second row on the far left of the second row.  We were a championship team, won the city [Newark, Ohio] championship, lost in the county [Licking County, Ohio] championship.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Yeah.  On, on the right, I'm on the right side in the blue shirt, my mother, Ruth Henry [Ruth Holbert Henry], is in the middle and that's my brother on, with the white shirt on the left, Oren Henry.  And this is taken in the summer of maybe 2001.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This was taken last summer in Cincinnati, Ohio.  My wife, Loretta [Loretta Crenshaw Henry], on the left, and next to her my sister-in-law, Lisa [ph.], my mother, Ruth, in the middle, that's me next to my mother, and my brother, Oren on the far right.

Speaker 1: Indulging our fondness for sweets.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Aha.
Speaker 2: Aha.
Speaker 1: This is a photo of my wedding, in fact it's the only photo of all the principals in the wedding.  On, on the far left is my father-in-law Roy Crenshaw [Roy Wesley Crenshaw] and my mother-in-law, Virginia Crenshaw [Virginia Anderson Crenshaw], and my wife, Loretta, just became Loretta Henry, me, my mother, Ruth, and my father, Charles Patrick Henry, II.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: This is one of my favorite photos of my father, it's when he was in the 10th Cavalry [10th Cavalry Regiment] so it was taken somewhere between 19-9 [1909] and 1912.  And this is him boxing in the cavalry.  My father is on the far right boxing and I don't know the two figures, the referee (laughter) and the other person he's boxing with.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is the youngest photo that I have of my--(unclear) but I don't have any of that.
Speaker 2: Well, you should--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Just one more time, we need a description of this photo.
Speaker 2: All right.  This is one of my favorite photos of my father and one of the earliest I have of him.  He's boxing when he was in the 10th Cavalry so it's taken some time between 1909 and 1912.  And that's my father on, on the right.  I don't know the other two figures, I don't know their names.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Okay.  Very good.  Next.
Speaker 2: All right.  Okay.  This is my immediate family.  On the front row, the bottom row on the left is my granddaughter, Michael [ph.], in the middle, my granddaughter, Ashland [ph.], and on the far right my grandson, Tyler [ph.].  And center on the left my wife, Loretta, and me.  And on the top row on the left my daughter, Adia [Adia Henry], in the middle, my daughter, Laura [Laura Henry], and on the right my son, Wes [Charles Wesley Henry].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Very good.
Speaker 2: This is my (laughter) favorite photo of one of my mentors, Bert Gross [Bertram Myron Gross], and I think it's one of my favorite photos 'cause he's a great scholar and academic but this is him in his wrestling pose.  And after he graduated from Columbia University [New York, New York] with a master in classics in the middle of the Depression [Great Depression], he couldn't get an academic job so he went on the road as a wrestler and he actually wrestled and this is the time leading up to World War II [WWII], he wrestled in Argentina under the name I think the Jew boy, or something and he was fighting fascists and Nazis.  And obviously he was in great shape but Bert Gross is, who is one of the great economists and, and wrote the basic full employment legislation in the United States.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Well, I had been asked to play my guitar and I, I refused.  This is a picture of me with my guitar.  And I'm in the rock promotion book for the Amnesty International Conspiracy of Hope tour [A Conspiracy of Hope] with Peter Gabriel and Sting and U2.  And that's me with my guitar and you see Joan Baez is, is in the photo next to me and all of the musicians.  It's a, essentially a history of the tour with all the musicians that's Peter, Paul, and Mary just above us.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Great, next.
Speaker 2: Okay (unclear).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my father once again in the 10th Cavalry with his corporal stripes on at guard duty.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Very good.  Next.  Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: On the left is Charles Patrick Henry, I, my great uncle who was a barber who raised my father and my father, Charles P. Henry, II is standing next to him.
Speaker 1: About 1910?
Speaker 2: This would probably be around 1910 or '11 [1911], yes, (unclear).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  And go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is one of my favorite childhood pictures.  It's my father holding me on the back of our old Pontiac.  I'm about two years old so this would be about 1949.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother on the left and my father.  And it would have been taken maybe in the mid-'60s [1960s], '65 [1965], '66 [1966], maybe '67 [1967].
