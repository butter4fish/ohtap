 Gill. Today is November 7th, 2008. I   m visiting with  Eddy Ditzler in the Edmon Low Library on the Oklahoma State  University Campus. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project in  the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Eddy, I appreciate you  being with us today.  Absolutely, Jerry.  I know you graduated from Oklahoma State University with a degree in  accounting and you   re a current partner at the accounting firm of Grant  Thornton.  Yes, sir.  But I   d like it if you could go back earlier in your life and back up from  there. Can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up and your  family?  Sure, sure. I grew up in Henryetta, Oklahoma. My sister was actually the  first one in our family to go to college, and she came to OSU. I tagged  along on her coat tails and came to OSU and fell in the love with OSU,  and from about 1974 forward I have been back, and it   s been a big part  of my life ever since then.  You graduated from Henryetta in 1974?  Yes, sir.  Well, has anything influenced you besides your older sister being there?  Was that your primary reason?  That was my primary reason. She came up here. She went to a junior  5  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  college and then transferred up here, and so I   d gotten to spend a little  bit of time up here off and on, not a great deal. But when I started  looking for colleges, it was stay close to home but not too close. My  father was absolutely   it was imperative that we were going to college  even though no one in his family had ever been to college before.  Great. Did you know at the time that you wanted to be in accounting?  Well, I really had thought a lot about accounting, because I was good  with numbers and I liked mathematics and those kinds of things. But it  wasn   t really   I didn   t know what being an accountant really meant  until I got to OSU.  You just enrolled in general business?  General business, initially, and then I believe maybe it was sophomore  year when we made a master commitment to the accounting program.  Is there something that triggered your change here at school?  You know, like I said, I liked numbers. I liked mathematics. I felt like I  was pretty good at it, much better than English (laughter) and other  topics where you do a lot of writing. At least, at the time, I thought that  was the case. But just being in the OSU accounting program, around the  professors, like Dr.  Wilton T.  Anderson, I learned a lot about what  being a professional was like and what it was going to be like. That  really influenced what I wanted to do. My father had always had it in his  mind that I would be an attorney, and that really wasn   t what I wanted to  do. But I did like the idea of having a profession, being a professional  person, and that kind of went hand in hand with public accounting.  Can you tell me a little bit about student life and your student experience  outside of academics? Maybe activities you were involved in?  Oh, sure. Well, coming here from Henryetta, it was quite a jump for me,  and where your whole  graduating  class was about 100 in Henryetta and  just one of your classes was over 300 when I first got here. It was quite a  change. Probably my biggest thing that I loved about Oklahoma State is  that I loved its sports. We got very active in going to the football games.  As I look back, I probably wasn   t involved as much on campus in  organizations as I probably should have been, but I didn   t know any  better back then. Coming from a small town, you just wanted to survive.  (Laughter) But I got to know a lot of great people up here, the people in  the School of Business as well as the people you went to college with  and had classes with. Those were the things that I really remember about  college days is just the people who were here when I was here.  6  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Being in accounting is kind of like being an engineer. You don   t really  have a lot of free time?  No. (Laughter) It was pretty much a lot of homework and a lot of critical  tests and a lot of pain and suffering some days.  Did you have some favorite memories of your undergraduate experience  at Oklahoma State?  Oh, I can probably say that some of my favorite memories are just, and  this is probably an interesting story for me, anyway, is that I told you I  did like mathematics. And one of the folks that had influenced me  greatly was my mathematics teacher in sophomore and junior class. One  semester, I believe, it was probably my second semester of my freshman  year, I got up one morning, I was walking to class and I said,    I think I  want to be a math teacher.    I was in the College of Business and walked  all the way across campus. I can remember it was awful cold. Got over  to the education building, started to go in and talk to some people about  changing my major, and I never got there. (Laughter) Never got all the  way in. Turned around, went to my class and stayed in the business  college and accounting for the rest of my career. That is one of my  favorite memories. I still don   t know why that happened. (Laughter)  You might have made a good financial decision there, too. Although, we  certainly need good math teachers. When you got into accounting, did  you get to know Dr. Wilton Anderson? He was the head of the School of  Accounting.  Yes, I did get to know him. While I was here and after I graduated, I got  to know him even better. His influence for me was that he was a  professional. He was a professional that knew what public accounting  was about and the professionalism of public accounting. From that  perspective, I just always had great respect for him and while he may  have not sat down and walked me through my career path, he did in his  own way, or my own way, just watching him and seeing how he  presented himself in class and how he presented himself in leading the  School of Accounting back then. It was the epitome of professionalism.  How was he perceived by students at the time?  He was perceived as very stern and very tough, but very fair. I don   t  ever recall anybody saying that he was not fair. And, again, I think he  brought professionalism to the classroom. Not just being an instructor,  but really teaching you beyond what the nuts and bolts of accounting are  and the debits and credits, but getting to what the profession does, and  why we   re there and the importance of public accounting.  7  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  I   ve heard it said that he probably really put, while there was a  department there before he got there, but that he probably put the  School of Accounting on the map, so to speak, at Oklahoma State  University. Is that true?  Oh, I believe that   s absolutely the case. Shortly after I started, of course,  it didn   t have anything to do with me, but it was in the heyday when Dr.  Anderson had recruited some great professors, one of which went on to  be on the financial accounting standards board,  G.  Michael Krooch.  They had a group of professors that were great academicians, but also  great representatives of the industry of public accounting, and Andy was  responsible for that. He led that process, and I think that we had one of  the most respected accounting curriculums in the country for a long  period of time when he was here.  This is from several years ago, but back, I am thinking in the 1970s or  1980s, there for a couple of years, I had heard it recited that Oklahoma  State University in our region, which was Texas and Oklahoma, where  you took the CPA exam, we had the highest or second-highest  percentage of applicants or people who took the test that passed it on the  first time than any other accounting school in the region.  That does sound very familiar. I don   t know if I could quote the statistics  either. And that is one thing that I do recall from my training. The  professors were   the expectation that Dr. Anderson and the professors  set for us was,    You   ll be a CPA when you get out of OSU, or shortly  thereafter.    That was the expectation, and that was why you were there.  You were taught to that level and expected it?  Right, and many of the classes and tests that we took were actually  excerpts from the CPA exams. So, we had great experience knowing  what to expect when we took that exam.  So, you felt that your preparation here at Oklahoma State in accounting  helped prepare you for your CPA exam and for your career in  accounting?  Oh, absolutely. There was no doubt about it. Now, I can   t say that I  passed on the first time, but it took me two times. (Laughter)  Most of them, it does take two times.  But I can also say that I did not have to go into an  additional  in-depth  study curriculum to take the exam. I was prepared for the exam coming  out of Oklahoma State. A lot of people would go and do alternative  8  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  study curriculums outside of school, Becker courses and things like that,  because they may not be prepared. But I felt like I was very prepared,  and while I didn   t pass in one, it did take me two times, but I did that  without any additional study.  Can you share a little bit about your career after leaving Oklahoma  State University and a little bit about your preparation and how it  helped your career?  I guess one of my first steps was going through the interview processes  here at Oklahoma State, career counseling, and with that process, I  joined the accounting firm which that point in time was Alexander Grant  in Oklahoma City,  a  mid-size public accounting firm that had roots  from Chicago, and became a part of that firm right after my  undergraduate degree. I worked in the Oklahoma City office of  Alexander Grant for about a year and a half. I decided to expand my  education. Came back to Oklahoma State and got my master   s degree,  and then re-entered the work force after about a year and a half in  Oklahoma City again with Alexander Grant which is now Grant  Thornton, and I   ve been with that firm my whole career.  I   ve always found that the theories that were presented by the accounting  faculty during my tenure here have stayed with me all my career. As I  see, there are numerous changes in accounting requirements and  principles, but what I always see in those new principles and new  requirements is they all fall back on the accounting theories that we  learned in closing on twenty-five and thirty years ago back at Oklahoma  State that were presented by the professors in the School of Accounting.  They were getting it right then, and those kinds of things are still holding  true today and have really helped me understand when new things come  out, how to attack them and how to understand them and what they  really mean to us as auditors and accountants.  Was Oklahoma State one of the schools that you looked at pretty  strongly when recruiting people into your firm?  Oh, absolutely. We have always looked at Oklahoma State very  positively as far as the type of people that come out of here. They are  prepared; they have the skill sets that we need. And we continue to grow  those skill sets, but they come very prepared. In the last eight years now,  we acquired the Tulsa practice of Arthur Andersen, and our Tulsa office  recruits here, I won   t say quite exclusively, but their staff is significantly  Oklahoma State graduates and they   ve had great results. In Oklahoma  City, we have a little more diversity just because we have, you know, the  other university south of Oklahoma City (laughter) and the University of  Central Oklahoma. So, we don   t probably get the volume of Oklahoma  9  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  State students that the Tulsa office does, but we sure find they   re very  qualified candidates, outstanding candidates.  Eddy, you   re a partner in the firm?  Yes.  Are there other OSU people in Tulsa and Oklahoma City firms that are  also partners?  Yes. In Oklahoma City, well, we have two partners that have graduated  from Oklahoma State. In Tulsa, I believe we have two partners from  over there and that   s out of a total of   in Oklahoma City, it   s two out of  six, and in Tulsa it   s two out of five. Very well represented all the way  through our ranks   partner, manager. We   ve had one of OSU   s  graduates, he   s now retired, but he had coordinated our nationwide  continuing education programs for many years, George Crowell. I  believe he received his master   s from Oklahoma State and actually had  instructed here for a short period of time, I think even during the  window that I was here. So, we have some great people that have been  here at Oklahoma State.  Have you maintained contacts with OSU and the School of Accounting  through your career?  Absolutely, and I find that that   s even more so maybe today than it was  fifteen years ago. Maintaining those relationships, building those  relationships with the faculty and the administration, being more  involved, being in a position to make donations as a firm and  individually to the School of Accounting and get back has been very  important to us, and from that perspective, we really have grown those  relationships over the last few years.  How has, within the region, maybe nationally, how is a degree in  accounting from Oklahoma State perceived? Is it a quality degree?  Oh, absolutely. I think not just Grant Thornton, but our other firms, I  think a degree from Oklahoma State has sound representation in the  accounting community. One of the gentlemen that is currently with our  firm, his name is Mike Starr, he is our national managing partner of Risk  Management. He   s from Altus, and has his degree from Oklahoma State.  So, Oklahoma State is well respected in our firm, not only locally but  nationally, also.  A lot of our accounting graduates are also going into corporate. Can  you think of some examples that have key positions in industry and  10  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  corporations and finance departments?  Oh, sure. As you and I know, most of our friends are nearing retirement  or closing in on retirement, (laughter) but we do have some great people.  John Lenahan was with Kerr-McGee. His background is from Oklahoma  State.  Was he the vice president and chief financial officer of Kerr-McGee?  Yes, vice president and chief financial officer of Kerr-McGee. He   s the  one that comes to mind in the industry that just jumps right out there.  The vice president of ExxonMobil?  We do, and I don   t know him personally. I know John personally. He  jumps out there. Of course, we have some folks very high up in the  ConocoPhillips organization. Dan Gilland and some folks like that have  done accounting here and are well respected in the industry.  To make a point, a lot of people wind up in different fields other than  just the accounting profession that do extremely well? Entrepreneurs?  The president of Oklahoma State University, Burns Hargis, is a good  example. (Laughter)  Back to my question about Dr. Anderson. He   s called Andy by his  colleagues but not by his students. I   ll ask you a two-part question. First  of all, as a student, do you remember some of the Dr. Anderson stories  that you heard about him?  Well, he was just always   while everybody else calls him Andy, he   s  always been Dr. Anderson to me, and I don   t know if I can change that.  Even when I see him today, it   s still Dr. Anderson. But the stories about  Dr. Anderson are the things that I saw him do. Wasn   t really the stories  about in class. To me, it was the way he presented himself in class, in  meetings.  And how was that?  With presence and with just a great degree of professionalism, really,  pride in the accounting profession.  He was really passionate about accounting, wasn   t he?  Yes, passionate about it. Passionate about public accounting, and  passionate about his students. I might not say he was close to me, but he  11  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  did direct me. I mean, he helped me know that that   s where I wanted to  be just by his presence.  I   ve heard the story that at one time, you had him during his later part of  his career, but certainly earlier into his mid-stages of his career, he  taught introductory accounting because he wanted to start off right in  accounting. Is that true?  Yes, and actually I was supposed to have him in one of my introductory  courses, either first or second one. But I had always known that if you  wanted to be in accounting, you tried to get in his class, even though it  was going to be tough. If that was your direction and if that was your  career path, you had to have the guts to do it because he was tough and  he was going to make you work hard, but that was the class you wanted  to be in. I did get in it, but then he wasn   t able to teach it on my second  introductory course, and I always had wished that he had been able to do  that.  I was always impressed with the fact that he was a senior faculty  member, highly respected, and he was teaching the introductory course,  like the freshman or sophomore level courses in accounting. You   d think  he would want to teach the junior or senior graduate students.  And I think that, to me, and my impression of why he did that, was just  because he wanted to provide the young students with an opportunity to  understand what public accounting was all about. And while I don   t  know that his classes were any tougher, he did present himself very  strongly and with a great degree of professionalism. It wasn   t fun and  games. You were there to learn, and he would weed out at the bottom  level, but if you were truly interested in the career of public accounting,  you would try to get him.  Were you fortunate to be the recipient of some of the scholarship  programs?  I was, and I think that was probably the first time I got to sit down with  Andy and talk about a potential career, and I believe I received a very  nominal scholarship, but it was very helpful at the time. And I think, if  that   s what you mean, he sat down, I think, with everybody personally  that they give scholarships to.  You had to  walk in the door and you had  to meet with Dr. Anderson to get that scholarship. His focus and his plan  for you when you got those scholarships  was  that you were going to be  in accounting and you were going to be in public accounting, and he  kind of laid the groundwork for you.  You were one of Andy   s boys. I mean, you got the scholarship.  12  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  (Laughs) That   s right.  I heard a story that even if students coming out of high school that had a  high ACT, like a twenty-nine or thirty or higher score, that Andy would  talk to one of the representatives over in the High School and College  Relations  Office  and would say,    If you meet any of those kids and  they have any interest in accounting and have the high scores that, on  the spot, they   ve got a scholarships.    (Laughter)  There   s no doubt that he recruited for that School of Accounting. He  handpicked some of the students coming in. I do know that, but they  were very qualified students. Can   t say that I was one of them. I kind of  grew my own way through, but he did handpick some of them and he  did it the right way, though.  Did he maintain contacts with his students, his graduates that went out  in the industry?  I don   t know the extent. Most of the contact I   ve had with Dr. Anderson  was coming back for events. He put on a golf tournament for graduates  to raise scholarship funds for the department, and this was probably back  in the mid- to late-eighties, and he maintained relationships that way. I  do know that. And I know that a lot of people really come back to those  events to give back to Andy.  And then after he retired, he stayed active for several years? He retired  in 1984. I say formally retired. He still worked some after he retired?  That sounds about right.  Was he a pretty good fundraiser?  I don   t think there is any doubt about that. (Laughter) Now, I wouldn   t  say that he twisted your arm, but you wanted to give back. You wanted  to give back because you got a great opportunity here, and he was a big  part of that.  Quid pro quo. Kind of like,    We helped you as struggling students, now  you can help out other students   ?  But you never felt strong armed. You felt like it was your duty more  than it was your obligation.  You   ve been successful, and I   m saying that you   re humble, and being a  part of a major accounting firm, you serve on the advisory board?  13  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  School of Accounting Advisory Board, yes.  So, you   ve had the opportunity to get a sense of OSU and the accounting  profession. You alluded earlier that someone had questioned Andy   s  involvement in the profession. Can you share some of the things that  Andy did outside of the classroom with practitioners in the field?  Well, I don   t   by the time I was in practice, Andy was kind of towards  the end of his career, so we didn   t see a whole lot of that. I just know  that in the early stages, he was very active in bringing practical  applications to the classroom. I don   t know if I can speak directly to  your comment, but he had a great relationship with the firms and our  firm, all the firms. And he brought those relationships into the  classroom, and you felt like when you graduated, you knew a lot about  all the accounting firms.  At least indirectly, did people know about Andy Anderson in the  accounting field as an individual?  Yes, I think especially   and I shouldn   t say just here in Oklahoma, but  that was my exposure. Dr. Anderson had a, I mean, he had a bit of an  aura about him as far as, in my mind, he was public accounting, and he  was a leader of students towards that career path. So, absolutely, I think  the public accounting world knew Dr. Anderson.  As you progressed through your professional career, did your  continuing association with Oklahoma State University, was that  valuable to you, professionally?  Yes, and it still is today. I think a lot of the relationships that I   ve built  with clients, with the professors, they   re probably more than  professional. They   re friends. People that you want to be around and be  with and share OSU experiences with, whether that be in a meeting with  the advisory board or a football game. So, it   s been just a great  environment to meet people that can help your career, but also people  that you like.  Back to serving on the advisory committee, I think part of the purpose is  to get feedback from the businesses; is our curriculum, our teaching  methodology, preparing them for their careers. So, you get a chance to  see, probably, at the level that most people do not, about where the  Oklahoma State University accounting program is. Do you feel good  about it going forward? Do you think it has positioned itself correctly?  I think, probably, after Andy left, there was probably a little bit of a  down turn, just probably not the strength in the program. But I think we  14  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  see that strength coming back over the last four or five years, and I hope  part of it is the involvement of the advisory board, that we   re able to add  some ideas to the curriculum that are meaningful to the users of the  graduates, the companies that hire graduates. But we do see that it   s  making strides. We   re also seeing a turnover in the professorships.  We   re seeing the professors that were here when I was going to school;  they   re starting to get to a point of retirement.  Lanny  G.  Chasteen retired here.  Lanny Chasteen. Dr.  Patrick  Dorr   s getting close to retirement. I  actually think he is retired. So, we   re seeing a turnover, and while I think  that will be a challenge for the next couple of years, it also will be good  and will bring some new people into the fold, let them understand the  relationships that the older professors had with the business community  and start building those relationships. I think it   s in good hands, and I  think it   s moving in the right direction. I don   t think   it probably isn   t  as strong as it was when we had Dr. Anderson or when we had the  professors Michael Krooch and  Elba     Bud    Baskin and that group, but  I think it   s on the uptake, absolutely.  Was there anything that you wouldn   t mind sharing from your personal  highlights, professional highlights in your career? Some of the things  that you have done that give you pride that you can share with us?  I don   t know if I can say that I have highlights; it just seems that we  have a great practice in Oklahoma City. Our firm has grown a lot since I  first started. Our firm was probably less than 20 people, and today our  Oklahoma City practice is closing in on 100 people. We   ve had great  opportunities in the Oklahoma City market, and while I can   t say I take  credit for that, that is absolutely all the players in our firm.  Highlights, I would say a steady performer. One of the things that I like  to talk about is one of my largest clients that I deal with, Hobby Lobby  stores. I was a staff on that job back in 1985 or 1986, and now I am the  partner in that engagement. We   ve had that engagement well over 22  years and serviced them in accounting and tax perspective for years.  Those are the kind of things that I look back on as highlights. Being able  to maintain life relationships like that, to help grow the firm and help  grow the practice here in Oklahoma City. I won   t take all the credit, but  just being there and being a part of it, that   s been important to me.  Major affirmations to become partner.  That   s true. Growing up with one firm. Not everybody   when I recruit  kids today, I say,    We hope everybody makes partner.    We know that   s  15  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  not going to be the case, but to be able to be a partner in your firm,  absolutely, Jerry, is a highlight.  Have you done some adjunct teaching or any professional training in  accounting?  Well, I have not. We did have an opportunity growing up through Grant  Thornton to instruct some of our training, not local, but national training,  and I was heavily involved in that, probably the first five to seven years  in my career, being a leader or instructor of brand new kids coming out  of college or people that had a couple of years of experience that were  becoming seniors in our firm. That   s really my extent of teaching. The  firm Grant Thornton, we have helped the accounting department with  practicum. I haven   t had a chance to do that, but I was just talking to Dr.   Thomas  Wetzel about possibly being involved with that this year.  That   s something that does intrigue me, and I would like to get back that  way if I could.  Eddy, there have been major shake ups since  the  Arthur Andersen  accounting  scandal . How is the accounting profession changing, and  where do you see it going in the future?  The accounting profession is changing from the standpoint   it is a very,  very complex profession these days, and it requires someone coming  into the profession to be very skilled when they walk in the door. Back  when I started, if you could write on a piece of paper and put numbers  on a piece of paper, you could probably do that for the first year of your  career. You could take your time and learn and grow, but now with  computers, our kids have to be very well trained coming in now. They  don   t have the luxury of learning as they go. You need to be ready to go  when you walk in the door.  Do they get interested in specialty areas?  A little bit more than in the past. Kind of depends on the firm. Some  firms have specialty areas. At our firm we don't call them    expertise  areas;    we call them    niches.    You may work in an area like oil and gas  80 percent of your project time     Non-profit?     and then non-profit or governmental for a short period of time. We do  have some niches, but not so much specific expertise areas.  Is there a different way of things that they   re doing in the firms that they  used to do and different kinds of activities that you   re engaged in  16  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  accounting?  You know, there are. All the firms are, generally, although they   ve  always had consulting practices. Probably the sensitivity of consulting  practices has changed, because of the independence rule over the last six  to eight years with  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  and some of the new  independence rules where you can   t perform a lot of consulting services  for a client that you audit. So, what that has stimulated is a consulting  practice that has its own set of clients instead of the audit practice  clients. It is changing from that perspective. Even auditing techniques  and auditing methodologies the firms use are now automated to some  extent; most everything is electronic. A lot of our files are electronic. It  has changed dramatically.  The complexity in accounting rules and being able to apply the  accounting rules is becoming more and more difficult as transactions  become more complex. With the financial crisis we   ve seen the past  couple of months and last year, even, a part of that has been driven by  the complexity of the financial instruments that were being created by  the brokerage houses. Very creative, and I   m not sure everybody knew  what they had.  Maybe they were too creative. (Laughs)  That presents additional complexities to the accounting profession, and  to the auditing profession. How do you account for them, and then the  auditors, how are you valuing these for financial statement purposes?  There   s a little bit of a perspective about students, that  they  are  expected to come out and hit the ground rolling, but it   s gotten much  more complex. Are you feeding some of this back to OSU and the  accounting people?    Here are things how the industry is changing, and  here are some of the complexities that we need to deal with, some of  these types of things while they are in class before they get here.     Yes, and that   s exactly what the advisory board is doing. It is pushing  back this information to the professors to adjust the curriculum. Of  course, a lot of the curriculum follows the accounting rules and the  accounting standards that are changing. It does pick up some of the  complexities, but having the depth of knowledge, it is more critically  important. When I was coming out of school, there were 13 financial  accounting standards and now there   s upwards of 170. (Laughs) That  just kind of tells you that our kids coming out today have a much  broader base of information content to understand, and we do try to  make sure, through the advisory board, that the curriculum does cover  what we need.  17  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Gill  Ditzler  Do you see the OSU students that are coming out to you, and certainly  those that are coming out to your firm, do you see them coming better  prepared?  Absolutely, I think they are very well prepared. They   re still   when you  haven   t had the experience of being with the firm and learning hands on,  there is still a learning curve, but they come out probably a whole lot  more prepared than back in my day.  Part of the discussion you have,    Now, they told you in the textbook, as  a practitioner, here        That will probably always be the case. To put your hands on and it do  something the correct way even though you   ve read about it, it is still  difficult.  I appreciate you taking the time to visit with us, a lot of good  information. Is there anything that we haven   t discussed about OSU  accounting, any feelings about our program?  When you called me and asked me to visit with you a bit, just harking  back to, really, my thoughts of Dr. Anderson, and he is someone that  influenced me, not necessarily by sitting down and pulling me along and  being a mentor to me, but just being in front of the classroom, in front of  the program and leading the program. He was so noticeable that he made  me say,    That   s what I want to do for a career,    and it has really been  beneficial from my perspective.  You mentioned earlier that the faculty that he brought together and the  program that he built through relationships with the industry, those are  all a part of what you   re talking about?  Yes, that and he did just carry himself with such professionalism and  everything he did, trying to get you to come into the program   whatever  he did, you felt it was sincere and you wanted to perform for him.  Well, Eddy, I appreciate it.  Absolutely, Jerry. Hopefully, I helped you some here.  -------  -------
