Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna ask you about your family history and I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Robert Brazier] side, but I'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Geneva, G-E-N-E-V-A, Geneva Scott.  That was her maiden name, Geneva Scott Brazier.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I believe its Montevallo, Alabama in 1885.
Speaker 1: Okay how do you spell Montevallo?
Speaker 2: I think it's M-O-N-T-E-V-A-L-L-A [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: Very li- I can't go back hardly any other than to know that my mother's father was a minister, but my parents never said a lot to me about family background, so I don't know too much about my mother's background as far as family is concerned.
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you were--well did you ever hear about--did they ever talk about slavery or about their grandparents or any of that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, my, my I know my grandfather was, was a slave.  My father was born very near the end of the Civil War.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they ever talk--are there any stories about those experiences?
Speaker 2: No, none.
Speaker 1: Okay so they don't even, they didn't talk about them?
Speaker 2: It was never mentioned.
Speaker 1: Okay, not even in relationship to the race relations in Alabama?
Speaker 2: My parents never talked to me much about race relations other than I should not grow up with a lot of hatred in my heart about white people.  My family was Christian people and they felt that having a lot of hatred and bitterness was counterproductive, so I was always taught to try to overlook that, not accept it, but not to hate people in general.
Speaker 1: Okay, did, do you know the denomination your grandfather was?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay and what was his name?
Speaker 2: I do not know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now are there any other stories from your mother's growing up, did she talk about growing up at all to you?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: Did she have a chance to go to school when she was in Alabama or?
Speaker 2: She went to school but not very much, she could read and write, but I don't think that my mother went to high school at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, well could you describe her for us what kind of a lady was she?
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother was a wonderful woman, very practical, she was a very strong dedicated devout Christian, she was a domestic and she did, she did laundry for middle class white families, but as a person, as a Christian she was very, very concerned about the spiritual welfare of other people and especially people who had less than she did, and she was always concerned about trying to help them.  She would even buy clothes for little kids to go to Sunday school.  Very often some of the families that she worked for when they wanted to get rid of some of the clothes and shoes that they had, they would give 'em to her, she'd bring them home and she would give some of it to some of us but the vast majority would go to poor families outside that she knew, and she, she was very, very concerned about the spiritual welfare of people, really wanted children to grow up in school, grow up in Sunday school, and spent a lot of time picking up kids and taking 'em to church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother also at one time when a minister left the very small congregation, maybe about twenty-five people, asked her if she would be the pastor of the church and she did, and she was the pastor of a church called the Universal Church of Christ [Chicago, Illinois] from I would say, I would say from 1937 until she passed in 1949.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Can you tell us when your mother came to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Probably in 1920.
Speaker 1: Okay and do you know under what circumstances?  Did she talk about why she came to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Well, she came to, she came to Chicago because my father left Alabama earlier to seek work here in Chicago, and finding work, he sent for my mother.
Story_ID: 289557
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is Robert, R-O-B-E-R-T, Frank Brazier, B-R-A-Z-I-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay and his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth, May 30, 1873.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now do you know very much about your father's side of the family in terms of ancestors and--?
Speaker 2: I don't know a lot about my, I don't know a lot about it other than my, my grandfather was born in slavery, not much was said about my ancestors at all, never heard very much about 'em.  My dad talked to me about--my dad and I were very, very close and I learned how to read sitting on my father's lap as he read the newspapers.  He told me how he came to Chicago [Illinois], he was a coal miner in Alabama and he was in a, he was in a coal mine disaster and while they were trapped in the coal mine he said he prayed and asked God to if he would ever get out of the coal mine he would never go back, and of course they were rescued and after a certain amount of time when the men, the, the mines were repaired and the men started going back to work, my mother [Geneva Scott Brazier] asked my father when was he going back into the mine, he said, "Never," and he left Alabama came to Chicago, and got a job at the Hyde Park Laundry Company [Chicago, Illinois] and sent for my mother and that's how I happened to be born here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay now this around 1919, 1920?
Speaker 2: When my mother came to Chicago around 1920, I was born in 1921.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay, all right so was your father here when the riot took place in 1919 [Chicago Race Riot of 1919] or did he?
Speaker 2: No he was not 'cause he never talked about that.  I think he probably came afterward, he never talked about that.
Speaker 1: All right okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm sure if he had been here I would've known something about that.
Speaker 1: Well could you tell--well you know did you father have any relatives here already in Chicago or did he, was he the first?
Speaker 2: He never said he had any relatives here.  I think, I don't think he did.  There was never a mention, I don't think he had any, I think he came on his own.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you describe him for us, what was he like?
Speaker 2: My father, my father was a tall man, walked very straight until, until he was very old, very quiet, he worked, he was a mechanic at the Hyde Park Laundry Company where he kept all the machinery running.  All he did was go to work and come home, he was very quiet.  He had a rocking chair he sat in, he rarely left that rocking chair, when he was home we always knew where he was.  He bought every newspaper that was out in Chicago at that time and there was a lot of 'em Chicago Tribune, Chicago American, Chicago Herald and Examiner [Chicago Herald-Examiner], [Chicago] Sun-Times, the [Chicago Daily] Times, the [Chicago] Sun all of 'em, he bought 'em all and read 'em all every night, that's why I said I learned how to read sitting on my father's lap while he was reading the newspapers.  Very rarely he would go out, just walk around and come back, and very kind, not loud.  Rarely if ever showed any signs of anger, good Christian man, tried to give me everything I asked for.  There was two things that he wouldn't give me, he wouldn't buy me a bicycle 'cause he thought I'd be too radical and I wanted to join the National Guard in 1939 because of the [Great] Depression was on.  I had left school to get a job and I had tried to find a job, I wanted to join the National Guard and he refused to sign for me because I was under age.  He said, "Because son if a war breaks out you'll be the first to go."  And so the only two things that I know that my dad couldn't give me, didn't but whatever he could he gave me.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did he ever get involved in political discussions with people?  I mean reading so much you would think he would discuss?
Speaker 2: He was very well read but he never talked to me about politics, and of course I was too, I, I, wasn't interested in it anyway.
Story_ID: 289558
Speaker 1: Was church a big factor in your growing up, in terms of?
Speaker 2: Only I had to go to it, it wasn't something I liked to do.  It was, it was called a Holiness church where almost everything was a sin, everything the young people liked to do was sinful and as soon as I got up in age where I couldn't, where I didn't have to go I left.  So it was a big factor, 'cause I had to go every Sunday, but other than that I stayed away from church.
Story_ID: 289559
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I do, early on my father [Robert Brazier] drank heavy and I remember on his birthday, I was very young, I don't how much but I know I was five maybe, he went to visit somebody's house.  He took me with him and they drank heavy, and then my dad took me to Jackson Park [Chicago, Illinois] and it had rained and he slipped and fell in the mud, and I could not get him up and I remember crying and pulling on him and trying to get him up and couldn't, and some men came by in a car, got outta the car and got my dad up and put me and my dad in the car and brought, brought us home and it had started raining.  I remember the rain coming down when we got out the car and to my knowledge my dad never took a, never drank again.  I think that experience of his son trying to pull 'em up, 'cause he was dea- I see him today looking up at me in the mud, couldn't get up, and I had him by the arm pulling at him, crying asking him to please get up.  He couldn't make it, that's my earliest childhood memory.
Speaker 1: That's quite a memory.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's, it's burned in my brain.
Story_ID: 289560
Speaker 1: Where did you live in Chicago [Illinois] when you grew up?
Speaker 2: I was born in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] here at 5210 Lake Park Avenue, you know in those, those days it was very hard for African Americans to get in hospitals, so I was born at home.  We moved out of Hyde Park when I probably when I was like four years old and in grew up in Chicago at 3168 Ellis Avenue, we rented a ten-room house and me and my family, we had a very close knit family, my mother [Geneva Scott Brazier], my sister [Minnie Brazier Ross], her children [Ethel Ross, Dorothy Ross, and Catherine Ross], my aunt [Bessie Scott Young] we all lived in the same house and I grew up in there until I was drafted in the [U.S.] Army.
Story_ID: 289561
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds, the smells was, I remember the smells quite well was the Chicago [Illinois] stockyards.  Although we lived miles away if the wind was blowing in the right direction you'd get a good whiff of Chicago stockyards in the summertime.  I guess the thing that my memory, I, I remember so vividly when I was twelve and thirteen was the Chicago's World's Fair, it was called A Century of Progress [International Exhibition, Chicago, Illinois] in 1933 and the [Great] Depression had just hit heavy and it was so successful that they carried it over again to 1934 so it was two years of that, and I lived at Ellis Avenue which was just about two blocks from the World's Fair, 'cause Ellis Avenue, Lake Park [Avenue] then the railroad tracks, and then the lake.  I lived which you might also call a stone's throw to Lake Michigan, and I could walk to the World's Fair in five minutes and of course we parked cars on the sidewalk for ten cents, washed cars and parked 'em in vacant lots.  So it was those two summers, 1933 and '34 [1934] very exciting because of the World's Fair.  Those memories stand out in my mind and of course we had the childhood memories of playing baseball in the streets, playing football in the streets, normal things that kids do, having little clubhouses where we would go.  It was our, my childhood was normal.
Story_ID: 289562
Speaker 1: I'm sure you went to the [Chicago] World's Fair [A Century of Progress International Exhibition, Chicago, Illinois] and it (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes almost every day.
Speaker 1: You know what was the most impressive thing about the sights at the World's Fair?
Speaker 2: One of the most impressive things was the, were the huge exhibits, the automobile exhibits, Ford, Chrysler, General Motors.  I remember Sally Rand although I never went in to see her I was too young to get in but she had a fan dance and of course that was exciting back in 1933, a woman--a naked woman with a fan.  No one ever saw her really naked either, but you know just the idea of it was very exciting, there was a lot of displays on Sally Rand and her fan, and just walking up and down the street, riding on the miniature buses, just something a little exciting.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember was there a black exhibit or a Negro exhibit?
Speaker 2: There were no black exhibits, no Negro exhibits, not at all.  In fact most of the clubs and the restaurants and all those things--African Americans did not really attend them because basically they weren't welcomed.  There were no signs, nothing that said African Americans couldn't come in, but it was an unwritten law.  You pretty much understood where you could go and where you couldn't.
Speaker 1: Okay so it wasn't--you just didn't feel welcomed there?
Speaker 2: You never went in, you never chanced, you knew generally speaking: you didn't see any African Americans in there you didn't go, simple as that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you remember the, the yearbook ['1927 Intercollegian Wonder Book: The Negro in Chicago, 1779-1927'] that Frederic [H. Hammurabi] Robb put together?
Speaker 2: No I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, they keep 'em in you know in the archive over at the Woodson library [Carter G. Woodson Regional Library, Chicago, Illinois] of it was a yearbook on the Negro progress that Frederic Robb, or Hammurabi they called him you know too, later on, put together, but so you don't remember that?
Speaker 2: No, I do not.
Story_ID: 289563
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little kid, as a young man you know?
Speaker 2: Precocious, liked to always be--back in then--I look back liked to sorta kinda be the head of the pack, always out in front.  Loved to play baseball, loved to play football, didn't play much basketball.  Basketball wasn't the thing back in those days, baseball. Had lot of friends.  They got angry with me all the time 'cause they always, they said that I thought I was always right.  I had specific opinions about things and I stuck my points of view and they always said you know, you, you think you're the only one that's always right. Well, I did and I mostly admit that I think I was right most of the time now, not that I am right now most of the time but then I think that I was right.  I did a lot of reading because I learned how to read with my dad [Robert Brazier], so I read a lot, magazines and newspapers and books like 'Tarzan and the Ape Man' [sic. 'Tarzan of the Apes,' Edgar Rice Burroughs], 'Sherlock Holmes' [Sir Arthur Conan Doyle].  So I did a lot of reading so I had some background knowledge about a lot of things some of my friends probably didn't have.
Speaker 1: Okay now did--was the radio a big factor at home?
Speaker 2: Big factor, we were very happy when we first got our, when we got our first radio and we would all--naturally we would all gather around the radio in the evenings and listen to the what we call the soap operas and 'Gang Busters' and 'Lights Out,' they had a fellow there named Rochester [Eddie "Rochester" Anderson], he was an African American, he was a comic.  I forgot the man who was the lead comic on that.
Speaker 1: Jack Benny.
Speaker 2: Jack Benny, right, Jack Benny, and of course at ten o'clock we were always there, it was always there for 'Amos 'n' Andy,' so the radio was central for entertainment in the home during that period.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The thing about, the thing I detested about radio were they had tubes and those tubes would burn out very often, so you was always going to the radio shop getting your radio repaired.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they have tube testers in those days or did you have to go take the whole thing.
Speaker 2: No you had to go to the radio, you had to go take your radio, take the tube out and take and they'd give you the same kind of tube and you are going to be putting back in.  You got a little radio you could carry, you just took the radio there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now did you have a favorite kind of music in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had--I've always liked ballads, I've always liked ballads.  I never did care a whole lot about a lot of fast music, but I did like ballads.  I liked popular music, my favorite orchestra was Glenn Miller.  I loved Glenn Miller but then we had some other good, good big orchestras.  I loved Gene Krupa, Count Basie, Chick Webb.  I liked ballroom dancing, didn't care too much for real fast dancing called jitterbugging.  I did it but didn't care much for it, so I was more like a slow dancer.
Story_ID: 289564
Speaker 1: Tell me about school now, where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: I went to grade school here in Chicago [Illinois].  My first school was Francis E. Willard [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  I went there for about three years and then I went to a school called Stephen A. Douglas Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois], and I graduated from Douglas School, I forgot the year and I went to school at Wendell Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] for a year and did what a lot of African, young black kids did in those days.  I didn't see any reason to stay in school, the only jobs that I saw available were Pullman car porters and dining car waiters and sweeping floors in the barbershops and the [Great] Depression was real heavy.  My father [Robert Brazier] had got at least three cuts on his job.  I remember my dad telling me--he came back and said, "Well son, I got another cut," talking to my mother [Geneva Scott Brazier] and myself and he said my, his employer told he said, called him Bob, said, "Bob," said "I'm sorry I got to cut you again."  He said, "Bob you don't have to take this cut, but they're lined up outside waiting on your job."  So he took another cut and contrary to my parents' wishes I quit school after one year and went looking for a job.
Speaker 1: Let me go back to grade school for a second now.  Now did you have, were you--did you like grade school, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Not particularly, I didn't hate it but it wasn't nothing about it that made me love it.  I played a lot of hooky, what we called hooky you know, missed class.  I didn't like it that much.
Speaker 1: Now here you are, you are kid that likes to read, you read a lot of books and newspapers and your father's reading all the time and you didn't like school?
Speaker 2: Not really, not really.
Speaker 1: What was it about school you didn't like?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, I don't remember exactly what it was about school that I did not like.
Speaker 1: Was there enough discipline in school, I mean could you actually you know, was the environment conducive to?
Speaker 2: There was a lot of discipline in the school, evident in fact I got my work done and I did--I got it done real quick and after I got it done a lot of the kids wouldn't have their work done so I'd do a lot of talking, and they'd send for my mother to come up to school.  Not because I was bothering anybody, but I just did a lot of talking and I was always talking.  My mother, my mother she chastised me a lot about having to come up to the school all the time and so they, they the teacher one day sent me down to a room filled with--where the bad boys were, some of these black board jungle guys, and this room called, they called, course you wouldn't call it that today, but they called it the dummy room and so she sent me down to the dummy room and that was an experience for me, but those guys in there man there wasn't nothing but noise and no learning was going on in that room, not all at.  I was down there one day and I said if I ever get outta here I'm never coming back, so I sure only spent one day down there and so the teacher sent me to the principal's office and the principal, the first black principal in Chicago, her name was Maudelle B. Bousfield and she said, "Now Arthur [HistoryMaker Bishop Arthur Brazier] do you wanna go to Moseley School [Moseley Social Adjustment School, Chicago, Illinois]?"  Now Moseley School was the school for the bad boys.  I told her, "No ma'am", said, "Now we gon' send you to Moseley if you don't stop doing what you're doing."  Well the thought of going to Moseley School was too much, so I stopped talking and (laughter) so I didn't give nobody anymore trouble at all, now I did like--well there was one period that I did like.  I was in the room with a teacher named Mrs. Marie Baltimore [ph.].
Story_ID: 289565
Speaker 1: We were talking about school and you were telling me that they threatened to put you in Moseley [Social Adjustment] School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you stopped talking.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I stopped talking in school, I got my act together, but there was a, there was a period there with a woman, a teacher named Marie Baltimore [ph.].  I went into her, I went into her class, I think I went into her class in the fifth grade and the school [Stephen A. Douglas Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] only went to the end of the sixth grade, and she had a reputation of being a very, very mean disciplinarian which she was, but I liked that class, I liked her.  And sometimes I liked her because I stayed in her class for a couple of years and then she would use me for a lot of errands to go around the school or go out to get something or go down and work for two hours or so in the office, she did a lot of things like that with me and I enjoyed her class, and I stayed in there so long because each semester the board of education added another semester to that school, so it--when I went into Marie Baltimore's room I was in the fifth grade and that school went all the way up to the eighth grade so I stayed in there a couple of years because her room went up from 5B to 5A, from 5A to 6B, from 6B to 6A and I stayed right in that room as the class moved up.  So I passed all the time but her class moved up a grade and I stayed in there for a couple of years and I spoke at her funeral.  She always called me her child.  She lived, she was about ninety something years old, but she was a tough teacher.  We need more like her today.
Speaker 1: Now did she recognize that you were probably bored in, in school 'cause, or did she (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Or did she--and you needed some activities that's why she sent you to do things.
Speaker 2: She may have but it was never discussed.
Speaker 1: Because the way you described you know here you are somebody that reads for fun and you know and here you're in school and you can finish your work faster than anybody else and you seem like you're bored you know so.
Speaker 2: Well she sent and I did a whole lot of, and of course I liked that you know running around the school doing these little errands, I enjoyed that.
Story_ID: 289566
Speaker 1: High school at [Wendell] Phillips [High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], now you started at Phillips right and you, but you said you dropped out (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah I dropped out after one year.
Speaker 1: How long were you--after a year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I left.
Speaker 1: So this is like 1937, '36 [1936], '37 [1937]?
Speaker 2: Probably '38 [1938].
Speaker 1: Thirty-eight [1938]?  Okay, well did anything happen there to?
Speaker 2: No, just boring and it was nothing, it was really nothing happening.  When I, even when I enrolled I signed up they let me fill out my own program and I had--the last three periods I put study period down, so I went home early.  I didn't (laughter), I didn't even go study, but they immediately caught that, they caught on to that and I think the principal or the dean came by and asked anybody, if anyone here who's last period was study period?  And I raised my hand, so he changed my last period to English so I had to stay (laughter), but I basically wanted to help my parents.  My mother [Geneva Scott Brazier] was doing laundry; my dad [Robert Brazier] was working every day.  I felt like I was a drag, they was--all the money that I had to get from them, they did everything they could for me, and I didn't see anything that African American--nothing, there were no African American policemen, no firemen.  I think it was one police station, one fire station, everything was segregated, discrimination everywhere.
Speaker 1: Now did you know now that was the era that wasn't Two-Gun Pete [Sylvester Washington] out there then and?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes I remember Two-Gun.
Speaker 1: And as a matter of fact there was a one we had a couple of black policemen I know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was one station called Pekin Station and that was a fire station where they had I think maybe, there may have been one fire station.  I don't even remember, I don't remember it.
Speaker 1: One over on Giles [Avenue], on 33rd [Boulevard] and Giles.
Speaker 2: I don't remember it, but it seemed to me that those on 33rd and Calumet [Avenue], it seemed to me that they were all white 'cause the fire station is still there but I don't remember any black people in there.
Speaker 1: Did you know any of the black lawyers or doctors in town or know about them or?
Speaker 2: No there weren't that many, there were very few.  I do know Dr. [Edward Willingham] Beasley, he was a very famous pediatrician, I know him and I knew him basically because by the time I got married and had children, I took my children to him.  I knew Dr. Beasley--there were some teachers, social workers and it was, it was a bad mistake on my part because there were other young people that went on to school anyway.  It was some bad judgment on my part, but I really wanted to do something to take the load off of my parents, my mother and father who I loved dearly who did everything they could to you know for me.  I remember my mother was very sad one Sunday during the [Great] Depression when she said, "This is the first time that my son had to go to church with patches in his pants."  I haven't forgot that, so I wanted to work, bad judgment, I have regretted it ever since.
Speaker 1: Did you have a job lined up when you dropped out of school?
Speaker 2: No, just went hunting for a job and first real job I had was a delivery boy out of Kohl's Drug Store, working from eight to four for seven dollars a week.  Then I got a job as a dishwasher, from nine in the morning to night at night for twelve dollars a week, for eight dollars a week, twelve hours a day for eight dollars a week.  The only job I ever got fired from, I didn't wash dishes fast enough.  I begged the owner to give me another chance.  I worked one week, I was proud of that job.  I'd come and show my mother and father how my arms had turned brown because in the hot water all day.  I was proud, I was working eight dollars, but my parents didn't have to give me any money and I was very--the guy fired, said I begged him, I said give me another chance.  He wouldn't do it, and then I got a job at the Hyde Park Laundry Company [Chicago, Illinois] and I worked there until I got drafted in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is this the same place your father worked?
Speaker 2: Same place, yeah I got the job there as an elevator operator and then I you know got a little promotion from time-to-time and then in 1942 early on I got promoted to a tumbler man where you did all the drying of all the towels and the ringer man operating the extractors, and kids that I talked to today that couldn't believe it but my yearly salary was $1,084 for the whole year, but it was a job and I felt good about it.

Speaker 1: What did you do for recreation in those days, did you have much time for that you know?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah we did recreation.  Basically we would go to the movies and we would go--Savoy Ballroom [Chicago, Illinois] had a Friday night skating, roller skates.  We'd go to the Savoy, roller skate on Friday.  Obviously we would when big bands would come, Gene Krupa, Count Basie, Chick Webb, Chuck Inson [ph.]--we'd all go to the dances on Friday and Saturday.
Speaker 1: Were the dances at the Savoy I guess right?
Speaker 2: At the Savoy Ballroom, then we had another--there were other places called the Warwick Hall [Chicago, Illinois], and the Forum Hall [Chicago, Illinois] and another place called the Greystone Playhouse [ph.], we'd go to those, so it was--some of it was fun, some of it wasn't.  Some of those places it was too much violence going on so I didn't go to 'em, or the Warwick Hall, the Forum Hall they did more fighting than they did dancing.
Speaker 1: Now in those days were there gangs in Chicago [Illinois] then or?
Speaker 2: There was always gangs but nothing like today, nothing like today, nothing; basically any fights broke out there it was over the girls, you know you're dancing with somebody's girl or whatever, that's basically what it was, but gangs as like we know it today didn't exist, but there certainly there were gangs.  No question about that.
Speaker 1: In the black community what were some of the do you remember some of the names of the gangs and stuff from those days?  Were they the same as the ones now or are they different?
Speaker 2: No, no totally different.  I don't remember--the gangs really weren't as prevalent as they are now, just a group of guys get together in a gang and intimidate the guys, I mean take their lunch money, take their little money going to the movies.  I learned how to hide my money on me so when they stopped me they couldn't find it, but nobody beat you up or nothing like that.
Speaker 1: Now you were a teenager when a lot of the area they're calling Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois] now was in its heyday I guess with people.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And what was it like I mean the streets like 47th [Street] and 43rd [Street] and--?
Speaker 2: Very exciting, very exciting, there was the Savoy Ballroom, beautiful Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois]; diagonally across the street was the Metropolitan Theatre [Chicago, Illinois].  The Metropolitan Theatre mostly showed Warner Brothers films.  The Regal showed mostly MGM films.  Next door as I said was the Savoy Ballroom, right down the street on 47th Street was a big shopping center, a store called the South Center [Chicago, Illinois], there were taverns and 47th Street was a real vibrant shopping center, much like 125th Street in Harlem [New York, New York], 47th Street from I would say from St. Lawrence [Avenue] on the east to Indiana [Avenue] on the west was just filled with shops, most of 'em Jewish owned.  Most of us brought our clothes in those shops on 47th Street, it was very exciting.  We called it going to the South Side.  I lived on 31st Street, and a little more costly to live in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s], and the rent it was fifty dollars a month and that--we were only paying thirty and we had a ten-room house you see, but up on 47th Street you had to pay fifty-five dollars a month for just a little apartment so, and mostly middle class.  The Rosenwald building [Rosenwald Apartments; Michigan Boulevard Apartments, Chicago, Illinois] was really a Mecca almost for black professionals, doctors, lawyers, social workers, school teachers, people, and you know our middle class was really, the African American middle class included Pullman porters, dining car waiters and postal workers, that was our middle class.  There weren't that many, black doctors, there was not many black lawyers, there were some obviously, and there were some teachers.  Most of my teachers were white when I was coming up in school.  So African middle class was really anybody who had a job, anybody who had a good job, paying thirty-five dollars a week was middle class, and all of us at that particular point time had--we were all poor but we had middle class aspirations.  My family never went on, we never went on what we call relief, we never had to go on relief, 'cause my dad [Robert Brazier] always had a job and my mother [Geneva Scott Brazier] she, you know she took in laundry.  That was one thing my mother said and she always thanked God that we never had to go on relief, they call it welfare today and so we never had to go on that but we, we there wasn't a lot of money to go around.  In the winter time they bought coal, you know one ton at a time, half a ton at a time you know.  To fill up the bin that would last for the winter was impossible 'cause we just didn't have the money to do that, and so all of us back in those days really had middle-class aspirations.  We, we were not middle class, but our thought patterns were that way.
Story_ID: 289568
Speaker 1: Were you paying attention to any of the agitation for social change going on in the community in those days (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was very little of that going on, the biggest agitation that I knew for social change back in those days was Marcus Garvey, and Marcus Garvey was more interested, from what I remember of him, was more interested in going back to Africa, and of course that did not affect--did not attract a lot of African Americans.  You could get a crowd around a Garveyite who was on a soap box in Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] in the summer, there was always crowds standing around there you know about twenty-five, thirty people but nobody wanted to go back to Africa.  The other biggest movement that I remember was Father Divine.  He was a religious person who claimed to be God and he had a tremendous following, but had nothing to do with social change at all.  The only organization that really talked about social change and they did theirs through the courts was the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and of course during that period of time the NAACP was a greatly respected organization and as I read the newspapers--whatever the NAACP was for, I was for, and whatever they were against I was against.  So, they were my beacon, my guide, in matters of race I followed the line of the NAACP.
Speaker 1: Okay, now Father Divine I know in New York City [New York, New York] they use to have big kitchens were they'd feed people and that sort of thing and.
Speaker 2: In Chicago [Illinois] as well, and I think that was, that was a source of his popularity because there were a lot of soup lines.
Speaker 1: Okay, in the terms of the Garvey movement was, I guess was when you were coming along it was dying out I guess 'cause his heyday was when you--about the time you were born.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah 'cause I remember reading about him even--he commandeered a ship and I don't think it ever left port but it probably when I started reaching the age of thirteen when I began to sort of understand what was going on and he may have--his heyday may been passed.
Speaker 1: Yeah he was deported in 1928 I think '27 [1927] or '28 [1928].
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: So, yeah he still had followers and he had a lot of properties but they weren't you know, they (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But there was a lot of stories, but there were a lot of speeches, because I hear 'em you know in the parks and then in some--I think that one of my friends' father was a Garveyite, but they, but their basic thing was you know going back to Africa, far as I can remember.
Speaker 1: Okay now do you remember the Ethiopian movement that people involved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Only vaguely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Only vaguely, I certainly remember it, but vaguely, only vaguely.

Speaker 1: As a teenager were you still like involved in the church in terms of going to the church?
Speaker 2: No, no when I got a job on the milk wagon where I had to work on Sunday and go with my mother [Geneva Scott Brazier], finally relenting because I was getting, I got--I had a job, I couldn't stay home and not go to church.  I left, I left I stopped going to church about when I got about fifteen and I was still going to school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] but I got a job on this milk wagon, and I, I stayed away from church for years, for years.  Not--I just, I was a Christian in name only you know, I thought I knew was Christianity and I know I was in the [U.S.] Army and I was over in India, in Burma [Myanmar] and I talked with an Indian and he asked me, "What are you?" I said I'm a Christian because they got their little Hindus and Muslims, and Buddhists.
Speaker 1: A lot of 'em look like you over there too.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, absolutely.  In fact I told one I met an African soldier over there and he asked me where I came from.  I told him I came from America, told him I was American he wouldn't believe me.  He said, "You're not an American," and he grabbed his head and said, "look you're not an American."  I said, "Yes I'm an American."  "No."  He insisted I wasn't American, he thought I was just trying to show off or something (laughter).  He could not believe it.
Speaker 1: It tells you something about the perception of the media, how the you know, how the news and other organs kinda ignored black people or you know in stuff they sent out over the world you know you just didn't think that there were any black Americans I guess if you didn't live here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There is no question about that.
Story_ID: 289570
Speaker 1: I was drafted in the [U.S.] Army in 1942, and the Army I was drafted in was the same Army as far as racial composition was concerned, the same Army that you saw in that movie 'Glory,' where the soldiers were totally and completely segregated, but had all white officers.  I was in the same kind of Army.  The company that I was in was all black, all our officers were white.  I never had a, I never had a black officer in my three and a half, three years in the service.
Speaker 2: So you were mustered in here and they--where were you trained here in the U.S.?
Speaker 1: I was drafted here in Chicago [Illinois], sent to Fort Custer [Training Center] up in Michigan and stayed there for a week and then was shipped out to Dale Mabry Field in Tallahassee, Florida and my basic training took place in South Carolina and Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Okay so they eventually shipped you out to India and Burma [Myanmar] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In India, spent a year in India and finished out the rest of the war in Burma.
Speaker 2: Okay, now that's something that probably was very interesting.  Now I can imagine for someone who read a lot and here you're sent to some place that you--did you ever imagine that you would ever be in India or Burma?
Speaker 1: Never, never it was very interesting.  The people, the thing that struck me more than anything else about India was the poverty, the people are poverty stricken.  The beggars everywhere, if you, pulled out a cigarette you'd be surrounded by at least fifteen people within seconds. If you give anyone anything, you'd be surrounded by twenty people within seconds, so the poverty was mindboggling; but the thing that had disturbed me more than anything else is as I look back and I'm looking at The History Channel and they're showing World War II [WWII], you would think that not an African American served in World War II, not because The History Channel is necessarily prejudiced, but that's the footage that they have.  If you wanted to see black people in World War II you had to go where black people were and of course no one is interested in black people, and furthermore we're all segregated and basically into quarter masters and port battalions, but not all.  Obviously we're all proud of the 99[th] Pursuit Squadron, then there were soldiers and engineers in [U.S. Army] Signal Corps.  I know African Americans who landed on Normandy [France] who were wounded there, but you would never know that by watching the footage that is there now.  The Army's really truly segregated and I didn't like the Army.  I detested it, but one think I said that I would always be glad that I was in it because of what I learned, the discipline, the ability to follow orders, being promoted as a non-commissioned officer, to give orders, to expect certain things from the men who are under you, to be able to carry out orders that you were given, the responsibility that you had to do what you were told to do and the men who are under you; responsibilities that you had for them.  So I've always been glad that I was in the service, but I never liked the service.  I dreamed of when I'd get out and after being discharged, the Army discharge, I received letters from the Army for at least six months about joining, volunteering, to keep my same rank.  I was discharged with staff sergeant rank, but I would never go back in the Army, never.
Story_ID: 289571
Speaker 1: Most of my experience in the United States was in the South and I--that was an eye opener for me because I was born and raised in Chicago [Illinois].  Chicago had its own problems, Chicago is certainly one of the most segregated housing and segregated housing in the United States, but I never ran into the kind of humiliation that I ran into when I was in the South and it was so--I despised it so I hardly ever went to town.  I stayed in the camp, I just couldn't deal with White Only, Colored Only, and I didn't understand the, I didn't understand the culture.  I remember when I was in South Carolina we had a soldier that was transferred into our outfit, but his--his luggage, his barracks bags was still at the railroad station in Florence [South Carolina], and my company commander told me to get a truck and go up there and get it.  So I went to Florence to the railroad station and I went in and there was a huge opening behind the counter.  There was a lot of bags, there was another side on the other side as well which you could see right through it, but right there was all these bags.  So I walks in to this place and I had this ticket and I said I want this bag.  He looked at me and says, "I can't give you this bag", says, "you have to go on the other side."  I said, "Why, why should I go on the other side?"  Of course, it was a barracks it was not a satchel.  I said, "There's, there it is right there, there's the barracks bag."  He said, "I can't give it to you, said you have to go on the other side."  "Here's the ticket, gimme the bag, what, what are you talking about?"  This man's face turned blood red, he became extremely agitated.  "Get outta here, I'm not gonna give you this bag, get on the other side."  I didn't understand what that meant, but he--obviously I wasn't gonna get the bag so I walked out and to go on the other side, as I walked out I looked up I saw a sign said White.  I went to the other side saw a sign said Colored.  Now I understood what was going on.  So I walked on the other side and the same guy--now when I walked outta the white side he was furious.  When I walked in on the colored side his personality changed totally, he was as friendly as he could be.  "Oh, why you want bag, absolutely, certainly."  He went on and got the bag, smiling and laughing gave me the bag.  I walked out I walked outta, "Hey old fellow, well met," but I'm telling you when I wouldn't move and go over there he was furious, and I had the same kind of problem when going through, coming back from furlough.  I had a furlough in Chicago, I go on Christmas, and me and another fellow named Anthony Thomas [ph.] was on the train from Chicago going back to South Carolina and we got to Washington [D.C.], we all, everybody in cars, but then when we got to Washington all the colored people had to get outta that car.  So Anthony Thomas and I said we're not gon' leave we gon' sit in this car.  So, because we're now going past the Mason-Dixon Line and so now the trains are segregated.  So conductor came the train was going along said, "You gotta move.  You can't be in this car."  So we said, "We're not moving, we're soldiers." He came back three or four times said, "You got to move you're violating the laws of this state."  Said, "We're not moving."  He finally came back and he said, "Now I've told you for the last time and if you don't move then the next station we're gonna stop the train and I'm gon' call the sheriff."  Well of course when he says he gon' call the sheriff, I had to start thinking.  I said now I know I'm in this [U.S.] Army I don't wanna get killed here in America (laughter).  If I gotta get killed, let the enemy do it.  So I got up and left, 'cause Thom- Anthony Thomas didn't wanna go.  He was much more provocative than I was, but when I left he had to leave too, and all of us who were from the North we all wanted to get outta the South.
Story_ID: 289572
Speaker 1: Tell us the--about the group that you were in.  You were just telling us off-camera, you said you were in a trucking group?
Speaker 2: Yeah we were in a trucking group and we longed to get transferred, hopefully to the North, 'cause we had been in the South and it was not a good place to be.  For instance in Ripley, Tennessee there was a town near Dyersburg Army Air Base [Lauderdale County, Tennessee] called Halls, H-A-L-L-S, Tennessee which was off limit to black troops.  White troops could go to Halls but Halls was so racist that black troops--it was off limits, we couldn't go to Halls.  That was the rules of the [U.S.] Army, it's off limits for you.  So we went to a place called Ripley but the African Americans had to be off the street at ten o'clock in Ripley and so what they do, they had their own little shindigs in the, back in the woods where they could back then, but I got in a truck and we went on back to town, back to the camp 'cause I didn't--I thought that it was an outrage, and so I and a lot of other guys we were alerted to go overseas we were happy.  We were glad because we was getting outta the South.
Speaker 1: I can imagine yeah that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that was one of the reasons why I think it was--that was probably one of--I think the idea that to rejoin the Army and go back south was probably one of the reasons why I really didn't--wouldn't do it.  I just could not abide that segregation and the atmosphere of the South.
Story_ID: 289573
Speaker 1: When you were discharged [from the U.S. Army] what did you do?  Did you come back to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I came back to Chicago and immediately applied for or went to the United States Employment Office to apply for a job.  I got out in, I got--I was discharged in December 28, 1945 and the week after, the New Year's Day, after New Year's Day I went to a--I went to the U.S. Employment Office looking for a job, and 'cause I was determined not to go back to the laundry [Hyde Park Laundry Company, Chicago, Illinois].  I didn't want to go back to the laundry.  I said if I ever get outta the laundry, I'm not coming back.  I wouldn't quit the laundry back in those days 'cause back in those days it was still, the [Great] Depression was on.  You quit a job, you couldn't get another one, and so while I was being interviewed the lady asked me, "When did you get out?", and I said, "I got out last week."  She said, "Well you haven't had a chance to become accustomed to civilian life."  She said, "There's a program called 52-20, that you should (unclear)."  I said, "What is 52-20?"  She said, "52-20 is twenty dollars a week for fifty-two weeks.  That would give you a chance to become more acclimated back to society."  So I signed up for 52-20 in January of 1946.  That was so boring to sit around doing nothing, just waiting on a check that a friend of mine got me a job at the Standard Steel [Car] Company [Pullman-Standard Car Manufacturing Company, Chicago, Illinois] on the North Side and I went to work in March, two months later I went to work and of course been working ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay so you start at Standard Steel?
Speaker 2: Starting at Standard Steel and didn't like it too, but I didn't care for it and my cousin was working at Western Electric.  Western Electric was a big electrical utility company that manufactures telephonic equipment you know, communications equipment and my cousin said to me, she said that Western Electric is hiring, we used the word colored.  "They're hiring colored people," 'cause she always knew because all the new hires, all the new hires got a tour of the plant and you got a free meal.  The next free meal you got at Western Electric was after you'd been there twenty-five years, and so they would see the people who were coming in the tour.  Western Electric had a program that hired ten percent minority, and she saw a tour coming through and she saw a couple of blacks in it and she called me up and said, "They're hiring colored."  She said, "Why don't you apply," and so I went and I applied and got hired at Western Electric, and I was very happy there, but I didn't like the swing shift.  They had seven to eleven, seven to three, three to eleven, and eleven to seven.  I loved the night life so I never wanted to work through three to eleven, and so I'd go from seven to three and then I'd skip the three to eleven and go eleven to seven which was, that's the graveyard shift, its miserable.  Finally Western Electric decided that they were gonna move that plant that I was in to Indianapolis [Indiana].  If I wanted to keep my job I would have to go to Indianapolis.  I had no intention of going to Indianapolis so I knew I was gonna be out of a job for not too long.  So I came home one day and found an envelope from the United States Civil Service Commission.  I opened the envelope and lo and behold it was a job offer in there to report to the post office for an examination that I had took before I went into the Army.  I had forgotten I even took the examination, I remember I passed, that was before I went into the Army and there was this note.  I went down and took my physical examination and took whatever examination I had to have and was hired in the post office, and worked in the post office as a mail carrier for twelve years, until I retired and went to full time in the Christian ministry.
Speaker 1: Okay, now so while in the post office I mean when did you--now, this is nineteen, this is (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I went to the post office, I went to the post office in 1948.
Story_ID: 289574
Speaker 1: Did you still live with your (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I still lived with my parents [Geneva Scott Brazier and Robert Brazier].
Speaker 1: Parents, okay.
Speaker 2: I still lived with my parents until I, until I got married.  How I got married was--'cause I wasn't going to church, I didn't wanna go nowhere near a church.  My mother would sit me down every now and then and try to read the Bible to me and I respect my mother, I sat down and listened to her read the Bible.  She'd read a few and then fine I'm, I'm gone, but church--everything was a sin in church, everything.  So my mother said to she said, "Son we're having a church picnic, I want you to go to the church picnic."  I said, "Naw I don't want to go."  The church picnic 'cause I knew there wasn't no beer there, nothing like that.  No smoking cigarettes, I was a heavy cigarette smoker, no cigarettes, nothing.  "Naw I don't wanna go."  She said, "Well son I really want you to go to this picnic."  Well I respected my mother a lot, so I had a plan, I said and I knew that she would not want me to go 'cause her denomination did not like for the girls to date what they called sinners and of course I was a sinner and so I told my mother I said, "If I go to this picnic," said, "I'm going looking for a wife."  I thought that was a real knuckler that was gonna cause her to say well, "Naw don't you go."  She said, "Well you come on, you go anyway."  All right, so I went to the picnic and I met my--I met this girl at this picnic and I married her.
Speaker 1: This is just what you said you were gonna do, but you had--you really didn't have intentions of doing that but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had no intention at all, I, 'cause I thought the church girls were too, they were too starchy.  I didn't even want to be around 'em, 'cause they didn't have the same kinda ideas that I had, but I met my wife [Esther Holmes Brazier] there, and it was because--and then she got me going to church, 'cause I went to church 'cause she wanted to go to church.  Well we're going to church, I said well all right let's go to church and lo and behold it wasn't too long I got baptized and I asked her to marry me.
Speaker 1: Now is this your mother's church, the same church?
Speaker 2: No, I went to my mother's church but this was another church.  I went to the church that she--that this girl was going to.
Speaker 1: Okay so she was going to a different?
Speaker 2: She was going to a different church.
Speaker 1: Well was it the same denomination?
Speaker 2: It was the same denomination yes, it was the same denomination, and I've been married now for fifty-seven years, the same woman.
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on it now, do you think it was your mother's intention that you meet this young lady?
Speaker 2: Naw she just wanted me to go to church and she, she wanted me to have some kind of environment that was different from the kind of environment that I was in.  She's always wanted me to go to church, but that I told you earlier she was really a church woman, loved the church, loved the Lord and that's how I got in church, and by going to church and listening to the ministers I became convicted.  I wasn't really happy with what I was doing anyway, it was, it was all fluff, it's all superficial.
Speaker 1: So what were you doing, I mean what were you just?
Speaker 2: Well going to work, going to work every day and running around every night spending my, getting, getting--I still lived at home.  I'd get paid on Friday and the weekend was spent going to nightclubs.  I loved the night club, Club DeLisa [Chicago, Illinois], The Grand Terrace [Chicago, Illinois], Dave's Cafe [Chicago, Illinois], my hangout was Warner's tavern [Warren Hotel, Chicago, Illinois] at 33rd [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue], get paid on Friday by Monday don't have enough money to last a week, throw it all away on women, just whatever, and you know young guys, unmarried, just having a good time.  I was staying living at home, paying minimum rent, eating at home.  People were wondering, why are you still at home?  Why would I leave (laughter)?  Why would I leave?  I didn't leave home until I got married.
Story_ID: 289575
Speaker 1: What did your wife [Esther Holmes Brazier] do for, did she have a job or sense of what she was doing or was she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My wife was going to school, that's where I met her.  She lived in Indianapolis [Indiana] really, I met her while she was just here going to school at Vogue, Ray Vogue School of Designing [sic. Ray-Vogue School of Design; The Illinois Institute of Art - Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  She was going to school there and of course when we got married--I think my wife got a job in a factory where they was making dresses or something like that and she got pregnant then after about the third month, got sick, she left the job and she didn't go to work, she didn't work again for a whole five or six years, maybe a little longer, and then she finally wanted to work--'cause she wanted to work but I was too proud, I didn't want her to work. I wanted to my own man but we were always--we weren't bringing in enough money so we were going without a lot of things, so she got a job at Planned Parenthood and she worked for Planned Parenthood for ten or fifteen years.
Speaker 1: Planned Parenthood okay, this is in the '50s [1950s] right, early '50s [1950s] or?
Speaker 2: Yes in the--no, she got a job with the Planned Parenthood in the late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Late '50s [1950s] okay.
Speaker 2: Late '50s [1950s], and early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay, now in the, now when did you--now did you, now did you start becoming interested in the ministry while you were working with the post office?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, well when I was working at the post office, yes I did.  I got interested in the ministry after I got baptized, I got interested in the ministry right--almost immediately, almost immediately and so I, I was saved in 19, in 1947 and I was eventually ordained in 1952.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got married in 1947 too?
Speaker 2: In '48 [1948], early '48 [1948].
Speaker 1: Forty-eight [1948] okay.
Speaker 2: In February 1948.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause I know, I guess there are like two things going on at the--pretty much at the same, well maybe not at the same time but you got involved with organizers of this community like in the late '50s [1950s] right?
Speaker 2: In 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In 1960, see I was a pastor of a church [Universal Church of Christ, Chicago, Illinois] my, my pastor, my mother [Geneva Scott Brazier] passed away and another gentlemen took the church by the name of Steven A. Lucas and then he passed away.  When he passed away I became the pastor of this small church.
Speaker 1: That was your mother's former church?
Speaker 2: Yes, Steven A. Lucas became the pastor of that church when she passed, and I served under him.
Speaker 1: How long was he the pastor?
Speaker 2: He was the pastor about three years.
Speaker 1: Okay so in the.
Speaker 2: He passed in '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: Okay so you became.
Speaker 2: My mother died in '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I became the pastor in 1952 after his death, and I was the pastor until 1960 when this church [Apostolic Church of God, Chicago, Illinois] asked me to become the pastor here.
Speaker 1: Okay it's the same, all the same denomination?
Speaker 2: Same denomination and what I did, the little church I had it was about thirty members, we merged with this church and we had about a hundred active members when I became the pastor; that was in 1960.
Story_ID: 289576
Speaker 1: It was at that time that a gentlemen who's a pastor of the First Presbyterian Church [Chicago, Illinois] by the name of Dr. Charles [T.] Leber [Jr.], he--that's L-E-B-E-R, he contacted me and asked me to come to a ministers meeting, the Greater Woodlawn Ministers Alliance [sic. Greater Woodlawn Pastors' Alliance], and I went to this meeting and--
Speaker 2: Now what year is this?
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty [1960].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And in this meeting was ministers from various denominations, Presbyterians, Catholics, Baptists, Lutherans and there was a big argument over Saul Alinsky coming into Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois] to organize Woodlawn against the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], the University of Chicago expansion, and for several weeks this argument went on and they kept referring to something that happened in some town in New York.  The name of the town now escapes my memory, but the ministers who were opposed to Saul Alinsky kept referring to what had happened in this town in New York, or New York City [New York, New York], it must've been upstate, but no one ever said what had happened but it sounded real bad whatever happened, I don't know what happened.  And I was not very vocal 'cause, I just--I'm new, I'm the new kid on the block.
Speaker 2: This Rochester [New York]?
Speaker 1: No it wasn't Rochester, 'naw Rochester came along much later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So finally one day I said I'd like to have something to say and I made a little speech and I said now I hear all of you men saying something happened in New York, but you never said what.  Unless you tell me what happened in New York, unless I know what happened in New York, all that's its bad, I'm voting in favor of Saul Alinsky coming into Chicago [Illinois], into Woodlawn, and that was the end of that.  Well Nicholas von Hoffman was the staff man for Alinsky was in the meeting.  The next day von Hoffman called me up and said Alinsky wanted to meet with me and have dinner with me.
Speaker 2: Now, back up a second, nobody knew what happened in New York or did they know ever?
Speaker 1: Oh they knew what happened in New York but they, no one said anything about it, they never said what.
Speaker 2: So did they ever tell you what happened?
Speaker 1: Yes they did but I've forgotten what it was now.  It mean it was just a, wasn't nothing but a big demonstration of some kind, you know some big city demonstration that the enemies of Alinsky thought was terrible, you know awful--terrible demonstration, that's all that happened (laughter) it was nothing.
Speaker 2: Okay so it's not anything that should be a problem for, for the ministers (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, just some big demonstration.  No- nothing moral, nothing immoral, just a big demonstration that created a lot of problems in the town, maybe, maybe like what happened in Birmingham [Alabama].  Not like that but you know a lot of problems, people didn't like it, there was nothing to it.
Speaker 2: Now had your heard of, prior to this time did you know who Saul Alinsky was and?
Speaker 1: No, never heard of 'em.
Speaker 2: Okay and Nicholas von Hoffman was an organizer here I guess for?
Speaker 1: For Saul Alinsky.
Speaker 2: For Alinsky, for that the Industrial Areas Foundation [IAF].
Speaker 1: That's correct.
Speaker 2: IAF.
Speaker 1: That's correct.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I, I'm I had dinner with Saul Alinsky at the Palmer House [Hotel; Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, Illinois] in the Empire Room.  I went there I had my clergy collar on, it was very embarrassing because there was a singer there.  She was a nightclub singer, I forgot her name now, but she was raunchy and very sexy and she was signing all these raunchy songs and everybody looking at me, this minister in here (laughter) with this, with his collar on, but it was at that time that Alinsky wanted me to take the lead in organizing The Woodlawn Organization [(TWO), Chicago, Illinois] 'cause it hadn't been organized, and I was in a very, very rigid organization, religious organization called the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World.  I'm Pentecostal by the way, Sanctified Holiness Church who did not believe in getting involved in these worldly things.  I had no problem with it because I had bitter taste in my mouth from the [U.S.] Army and from segregation in the South, and from some of the things going on here in Chicago as well, but I was very reluctant to do so.  I didn't want to be the president of this new organization that they were forming, but Alinsky was insistent that he wanted me to be the person and so he asked me would I be the official spokesman and I accepted to be the official spokesman which turned out to be for all practical purposes, the president of the organization, 'cause I was the one that was the spokesman.  I am the one, I was the one that the newspapers came to, I was the one who was on television and I agreed.
Story_ID: 289577
Speaker 1: My organizing experience came from tutelage under Saul Alinsky and Nicholas von Hoffman.  That's where I learned about community organization through Nick and Saul.
Speaker 2: Now let me just pause here and just maybe get into what this is because a lot of people when they hear community organizing, they, I think there's some hazy notions about what it is, and now people really don't understand what it is and this really is some really specific and very focused activity.  So could you kinda talk about what you learned, about what they taught you?
Speaker 1: Well I think the very first thing that we learned was that you had to do something spectacular to get the attention of the public, but in order to do that you first had to organize.  Now Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois] was not an unorganized community.  There was a lot of organizations in Woodlawn, but it was disorganized in the sense that all these various organizations were doing their own thing.  None of them had enough power to get anything done, and so the concept was to get all of these organizations together in one umbrella organization, always recognizing the fact that you had to meet the needs of that particular organization but everyone was focused on a program, a big plan that everybody was concerned about and at Woodlawn everyone was concerned about the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] moving their campus into the Woodlawn community displacing black people, homeowners and tenants, as urban renewal had done in other places in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  Urban renewal became known in Chicago as black removal.  The biggest urban renewal program that took place at that time was Lake Meadows [Chicago, Illinois] down on 31st Street, from 31st Street to 35th Street, from [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] Drive to Lake Park [Avenue], huge area.  Many of the people who were bought out in that area had purchased homes in Woodlawn and now they see the university coming in and they are gonna be moved again, and so we were able to organize against the--you had to have a organizational focus, the university was that focus, but also the unscrupulous businessmen along 63rd Street was also part of the focus.
Story_ID: 289578
Speaker 1: And we were able to get the Sons of Barrel King [ph.], which was a Puerto Rican group who came into the organization because they felt that they were being taken to the cleaners by unscrupulous businessmen, so we had a pretty big organization at first, The Woodlawn Organization [(TWO), Chicago, Illinois], and I consider that was some of my best days in organizing because I got--when I made speeches I got two big applauses, by making a speech in English, and everybody would applaud and then the interpreter would interpret it for the Puerto Ricans and then they would applaud, so that was a, that did a good, that did a lot for my ego (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now where did the Puerto Ricans live in relationship to (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They lived in Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They lived in Woodlawn, eventually.
Speaker 2: Now that's something I didn't know, now I'm not from Chicago [Illinois] originally but there was a substantial Puerto Rican population?
Speaker 1: There was a substantial population in Woodlawn.
Speaker 2: In Woodlawn, okay.
Speaker 1: It was not long before that population began to diminish because they began to move into another neighborhood that was predominantly Puerto Rican, so we had this big Puerto Rican contingent in Woodlawn, probably for the--maybe the first three years, after that the, the Puerto Rican contingent diminished and of course new Puerto Ricans coming in didn't come to Woodlawn, they went to the neighborhood where Puerto Ricans were establishing themselves as the dominant ethic group.
Speaker 2: Probably Humboldt Park [Chicago, Illinois] I would guess.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's another neighborhood too now that I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's Little Village [South Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois], Humboldt Park.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's another neighborhood that I--
Speaker 2: Pilsen [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Pilsen.
Story_ID: 289579
Speaker 1: And we also learned that you--there was a limitation to power, that the organizing, the most important thing that you needed to deal with was probably too much at that early organizational stage.  You had to win some victories or the organization would fall apart.  So we would tackle small things to try to get victories from small things to give people more courage to face the power structure which was very new in the early '60s [1960s] when African Americans are now facing the white power structure, that was something that had never been done before and the white power structure didn't exactly know how, how to deal with that so, but we were very careful as who, as to who would be our target when we dealt with the city.  We never attacked ever the mayor directly.  The mayor at that time was [Mayor] Richard J. Daley, who had supreme power, different than today, although the mayor today is still very powerful, but Richard J. Daley was not only the mayor of the City of Chicago [Illinois], but he was also the chairman of the Democratic Central Committee and there was tremendous amount of patronage in those days and there were only six black alderman who all in Mayor Daley's camp, we called 'em silent six because they didn't do no talking.  So when we were dealing with urban renewal and the Department of [City] Planning, and the Department of Urban Renewal [Community Development Commission], we would never attack the mayor.  We would always attack his underlings so that we would always be in a bargaining position with the mayor because we never attacked him personally.
Story_ID: 289580
Speaker 1: We never attacked the mayor [of Chicago, Richard J. Daley] directly (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Take--attacked the mayor, right.
Speaker 1: And of course one of the huge, we, we were successful in blocking the university's [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] move into Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois].  We resolved that, that--it was a three-year battle.  We resolved that in the mayor's office with a man named Julian Levi who was representing the university and myself and a number of other community leaders in the mayor's office in 1963, when we agreed that the university should expand, expansion within the 61st Street, and not go any further and that the City of Chicago [Illinois] would purchase all the land on Cottage Grove [Avenue] from 60th [Street] to 63rd [Street], tear down those marginal businesses and sell it to a developer to build 221(d)(3) housing for poor people; 211(d)(3) housing was he forerunner of Section 8, and that was the agreement and the city did exactly what it said they was gonna do and we formed a, TWO [The Woodlawn Organization, Chicago, Illinois] formed a corporation with the Maremont Corporation [Kate Maremont Foundation] and built five, built the largest 221(d)(3) project in the country, 504 units.
Speaker 2: Now that's Woodlawn Gardens [Chicago, Illinois] is that what it's called?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was called Woodlawn Gardens; now it's called Park, Park--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a different name.
Speaker 1: Park East now, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah Park.
Speaker 1: That's Woodlawn Gardens.
Story_ID: 289581
Speaker 1: But then Bill Berry, Edwin C. Berry, his name is Bill Berry who was at that time the president of the [Chicago] Urban League and I met, and we indicated we thought we ought to have a citywide organization to help combat segregated, segregation and education and Bill and I formed a group call the Coordinating Committee of Community Organizations [Chicago, Illinois], the CCCO and we organized it, I became the president of it and we had a lot of community groups all over the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] and the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  The West Side Organization [(WSO), Chicago, Illinois], The Woodlawn Organization [(TWO), Chicago, Illinois], other churches, other smaller groups to combat school segregation; at that particular point in time Benjamin C. Willis was the general superintendent, the African American schools, the schools in the black community were, were overcrowded.  Kids were on triple shifts, some schools they used the auditorium for classrooms, they had four or five classes in the school auditorium, where you can image the din that created.  While white schools had empty classrooms and we began using CCCO as the new vehicle to attack school se- what we called de facto segregation as opposed to de jure, and we wanted to bus kids into these white schools where there were empty classrooms.  Some schools, half of the schools the classrooms were empty.  Well, obviously the white neighborhoods were opposed to that, so in order to counter that they started building prefabricated classrooms on school playgrounds, we called those Willis Wagons and we refused to accept that and they started building schools in the black community.  So actually building schools to keep black people in the black community, so we had a lot of, we started making a lot of demonstrations.  It was that period of time that my life was threatened and the police--I don't know by who 'cause the police they told me that my life was threatened and for a while I had had two police bodyguards that went with me everywhere.  But I was still the pastor of the Apostolic Church of God [Chicago, Illinois], and I was the president of The Woodlawn Organization, and the president of the CCCO, which was really a bit too much for me.  So it was then that I decided to resign from the CCCO as the president.
Speaker 2: Now did you have to quit the post office before this?
Speaker 1: Oh, I had quit the post office in 1960.
Speaker 2: Okay all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had quit the post office in 1960, and a man named Al Raby [Albert Raby] who was my vice president--Al Raby became the president of the CCCO and it was under Al Raby's leadership that CCCO had its greatest impact, and it was under Al Raby that we invited [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] to come to Chicago [Illinois], and Dr. Martin Luther King came to Chicago in 1966.
Speaker 2: Okay so you left CCCO in 1960.
Speaker 1: I didn't leave it, I just left the presidency.
Speaker 2: Well okay.
Speaker 1: Presidency, but I stayed there, I stayed there yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so what year was it when you, when you resigned?
Speaker 1: I left the, as the president I think probably in '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because Al Raby was president when they invited Dr. King to come to Chicago.
Speaker 2: That was 1966 right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 289582
Speaker 1: That's something that we don't have today, we don't have an organization citywide that can pull people together (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, the days are changed, times have changed now.  You cannot use tactics of the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] today.  First of all the power structure has learned how to deal with those.  Secondly, the segregation as we knew it then is gone and probably will never return, and the door of opportunity is open.  Irrespective of some of the propaganda that I hear that we have not made any progress, things are the same, that's organizing time, that's organizing words.  Things have--things are not the same.  The difference between 19--2005 and 1955 is like night and day.  African Americans have made tremendous strides, but I believe that we are in trouble because I'm--I have a different point of view than many black leaders.  I believe we need a leader, the African people I know said we don't need a leader.  I believe we do, I think that our situation in America has retrogressed and I do not think we would have been where we are now if [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] had still been living, because everybody followed him, although he was beginning to develop some opposition basically because of envy.  I'm sure that Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] who was much more violent, the Black Muslims, who early on had the same agenda that the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] had, separation of the races.  The Black Muslims wanted to separate the races altogether and want their own county, which the Ku Klux Klan would have gladly given 'em if they could have.  Malcolm X changed from that, became much more moderate and of course it cost him his life.  But we have no one to coalesce around.  They got a lot of leaders obviously, I don't mean to say you got to have one person.  The United States got a lot of leaders, we've got mayors, we've got governors, we've got senators, we've got congressmen, lots of leaders, but the United States has a leader that in times of real difficulty this county coalesces around and that's the president, and I think we need a leader to whom we can coalesce around.  I don't see that leader on the horizon.
Speaker 1: Well there's a difference I guess with the U.S. though in that it's a position that can, it's elected you know I mean.
Speaker 2: That is true, and, and no one can stay in power forever unless he's a dictator, but the point I'm raising is that they all got a leader, every county's got a leader. The ducks got leaders, the geese got leaders, the herds got leaders, everybody's got leaders, tribes have leaders, we said, "We don't need 'em," we do have, we do.  Surely I mean to say that there's a dictator but I think we need someone who everybody respects and everybody can coalesce around someone who can articulate the concern of the masses, but the way we got now, we got leaders now the newspapers make our leaders sometimes.  We look around and all of a sudden, here's a guy who's a leader who you don't even know.
Story_ID: 289583
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea as to how we could select our own, I mean African Americans could select such a leader?
Speaker 2: I don't have any idea of that, none, no way.  I think these men emerge, I think they may emerge.  [HistoryMaker] Reverend Jesse [L.] Jackson was never--he's a good friend of mine, love him, wonderful but he was never able to really be the leader, although lots of people followed Jesse, his influence has diminished somewhat because he's been, I don't wanna use the word all over the map, no we don't wanna say that, but he's, he's not been as focused as I think he should be and sometimes I think he lost sight of where the people were.  When he defended a bunch of young guys who created a riot situation at a football game, when the people saw that on television he lost the mass majority of the black people, because black people are tired of these gangs, and that looked like a gang thing, and so he lost a lot of people.  Of course he won a lot of folks too, but he also lost a lot of people.  Okay as much as I like Jesse I would not go with him on that one, because those guys acted like hoodlums.  I don't know what the background was it was--but what I saw turned me off.  There's another very articulate man that is out now, he just now ran for president.
Speaker 1: For--
Speaker 2: What's his name, Reverend?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Sharpton?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Reverend [Al] Sharpton.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Very articulate, says a lot of good things but his background is of such that he can't really coalesce the vast majority of African Americans around him because of where he was early on, he's come a long way from there but he can't get away from that because every time he begins to come up, that comes up, the news and brings all this up when he looked like a druggie, then he got involved in some, some case in New York where some woman was accusing a policeman of raping her or something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the Tawana Brawley case right?
Speaker 2: It all turned out to be false so that's hurt, so where that's gonna come from I don't know, but I believe that the churches and other groups really have to zero in on the fact that we got too many young kids today who do not value education and in some quarters and I've heard it a lot, kids who value education are looked down up as trying to act white.  As I talk to young kids around, teenagers in my congregation [at Apostolic Church of God, Chicago, Illinois] they'll swear and when I tell them that speaking English correctly and getting an education is acting white, being ignorant and dumb has to be acting black, and we're not gonna get anywhere with that kind of philosophy, and I deplored the action of a group of African Americana literati when they came out with this new language that black people can speak, I bees all right type thing, Ebonics and tried to make Ebonics an acceptable way of speaking, where if you use Ebonics you're not gonna get a job.  You're not gonna get a job in those places where correct English is spoken.  Our young people have to be aware that your appearance has a great deal to with whether you're gonna get a job or not.  Certain places you can go where you can have cornrows in your head and wearing baggy pants and having a baseball cap turned to the side you get a job, but the vast majority of the places you go you frighten people, and they will never tell you you're not gonna get a job because of the pants you're wearing, and that's the only reason, but you just don't, you never get called, and I think that there's a lot that we have to do to infuse into our young people the concept that education is the key to success in America, they gotta have it and I'll do everything I can to encourage it.
Story_ID: 289584
Speaker 1: Our church [Apostolic Church of God, Chicago, Illinois] gives a hundred thousand dollars in scholar--for the last ten years, we've given a hundred thousand dollars in scholarships for kids to go to school, and our scholarships have been based on academics and we find (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Are these for members, I mean children of the members?
Speaker 1: Basically for the members but, but we did not limit it to members of the congregation we also opened it up to children in the neighborhood, especially kids who are graduating from Hyde Park High School [Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] which is in the neighborhood.  So we didn't limit it to this but by and large it was because we got the money from the members of this congregation, we didn't get this money from some foundation.
Speaker 2: Now you've had an incredible amount of success as a pastor in this and that neighborhood.  You started with a hundred people.
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: In the congregation and now the church has eighteen thousand members?
Speaker 1: Excuse me--over eighteen thousand members.
Speaker 2: Eighteen thousand members, yeah now how did, can you kinda outline how that happened and how you're able to attract so many people and do so much development?
Speaker 1: Well, I basically believe that the Gospel message as found in the Word of God is attractive if we stick to it.  There is a spiritual quality, there is a spiritual quality in every man that people try to reach out for it but they don't know what it is, and they try to find it in various activities, alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, fun, games, et cetera, et cetera but there's a passage in the Bible that says, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God" [Matthew 4:4].  Why all of these things are good, all of us wanna have a good time, all of us wanna have a nice car, all of us wanna have a nice home.  There's always something missing if you don't feed the spiritual man.  This is one of the reasons why that you have so many successful people who have good jobs, 501(k)s, good incomes, but they're on drugs.  Some of them lose their jobs and lose their families because of drugs, 'cause they got hooked.  Why would a man, why would a man who is, who is earning $80,000 a year turn to drugs?  Why would a man earning $100,000, his wife is working and making $60,000, that's a $160,000 a year family, why would he turn to drugs?  Why would get hooked on heroin?  Why would he get hooked on cocaine?  You see what I'm saying?  He's looking for something.  Some people think that money is the end of all things.  It is not, money is a means to an end but not the end in itself.  You cannot buy happiness and people who finally reach a place where they have all their needs met finally realize that they can't buy it.  That happiness is a very illusive thing, it's like cotton candy, now you have it, now you don't, and so I've stuck to the Gospel message of trying to reach the spiritual quality of the man.  I have not been moved from going into healing and making that my major message.  I have resisted the concept of prosperity where if you believe in God, have enough faith in God, God will bless you with money, you will have this, because it's all false.  Yes, there are by-products of living a good life, but unless a man has Christ in his life and have the Spirit of God in his life, it's always gonna be something that he's yearning for, and I've kept my focus on what I believe to be the straight Gospel message of receiving Jesus Christ, of being a Born Again Christian and living a godly and a holy life and all of these other blessings will come, maybe they won't, maybe they will, maybe they won't but the main thing is your relationship with God and I believe that has been the message that I have preached to this very day and last Sunday forty-eight people were baptized for those two Sundays.  We have baptized somebody in this church every single Sunday since 1978, have missed--we missed two Sundays because of snow storms, that's all, and I think that's, that is the message.  Not, not focusing on being on television, not he's in civil rights, not he's developing new housing, not he's concerned about the poor, those things are good and I am in concerned about the poor, but that's not the message. The message is Christ, and I think that that is what has caused this church to succeed in the manner that it has.
Story_ID: 289585
Speaker 1: I don't wanna disagree with you but at the same time I--is there something else though, 'cause you had the message (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Disagree with me--I want you--I'd like you to disagree with me.
Speaker 1: --before when it was a small church right?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: When it was a small church you had like a similar message, but now the church [Apostolic Church of God, Chicago, Illinois] has grown from a hundred to eighteen thousand, so I mean is there a difference other than the message, that I mean?
Speaker 2: Well yes I.
Speaker 1: The message is the same.
Speaker 2: Think there is a difference, I think the times changed, times do change and cause people to begin to think, cause people to tend to take a look.  There are lot of people who at one time thought money was the answer, and they were concerned about if I can get money, if I can get a good job, I will be happy, they found out after they got what they wanted they weren't, they were open to the message.  Early on they weren't open to the message because they thought church is for middle class people, it's not for me.  I'm out here, I'm just surviving.  Well you've survived, now you've reached a certain place in life.  Why aren't you happy?  Why is your marriage going to pot?  Why are you divorced two or three times?  There's something you need.  After 9/11 [September 11, 2001], the churches were jammed.  Three weeks later in some churches you could fire a shotgun through and wouldn't hit nobody.  Times change, people are affected by what's going on around them.  I talk to people about that tsunami [2004 Indian Ocean tsunami], I don't claim that's from God, could've been but I don't say that God is trying to show us something, God is punishing us.  None of that, but my point was there wasn't no storm, the clouds weren't hanging low, the sun was shining.  Everybody was on the beach, everything was wonderful, but what people didn't know was there a volcano or something had happened thousands of miles away that was roaring down upon them, and they had no knowledge of it.  There's I understand it, the sea began to back up, it receded.  Folks rushed out on to pick up all this starfish, all that--what they did they never see when the water was there.  All of a sudden here's this wave, in a split second they're gone.  You have to understand that you need to be right with God and so things, times change, things change, people have a different concept and they begin to see that they need Christ and I do believe that there are more people today who are interested in spirituality than ever before, but we have to have a message for them and we who are ministers have to conduct our lives in such a way that people do not look upon us as charlatans and crooks and women chasers and money hungry.  I think that some of us have--some ministers have not served the Lord well.
Story_ID: 289586
Speaker 1: Do you think sir that the organizing activity at TWO [The Woodlawn Organization, Chicago, Illinois] and all the activity at Woodlawn at the time that, I mean during that active period helped the development of the church [Apostolic Church of God, Chicago, Illinois] of your congregation?
Speaker 2: Not all all, not at all in fact I find that when you become controversial, a lot of folks you lose them.  I can't say that some people didn't come to my church because of that.  I can't say that, but I don't think that that was the thrust of getting on TV and oh, let's go over to Brazier's [HistoryMaker Bishop Arthur Brazier] man, he's a great man, he's fighting for the people.  'Naw, 'cause I knew too many other fellows, ministers who are doing the same thing and their churches they're not growing, but they got, they talk the talk and out there fighting for the blacks but they.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there a couple I know who talk a lot on television a lot who have empty churches.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir it's not, it's not the answer, that's not the answer.  If anybody who ought to have a huge church overflowing if that was the answer, Reverend Jakes [HistoryMaker Bishop T.D. Jakes] in Chicago [Illinois].  He ran for mayor, said a lot of good things, fought police brutality, very small congregation.

Speaker 1: Think you basically talked about some of your hopes and concerns for the black community.  But do you have any other hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that the door for opportunity is open, but nobody's gonna give us anything.  We have to work hard for what we get in this society and in some cases we even still we gotta better.  You got to know what you're doing.  You can't--we cannot expect to be promoted and to succeed merely because we're black or merely because there's a guilt complex on some white people and they're gonna give you something, that's over.
Speaker 1: You went back to school yourself and you went to, I notice you went to several, you went to Moody.
Speaker 2: I went to Moody Bible Institute [Chicago, Illinois], I regret it.  My parents [Geneva Scott Brazier and Robert Brazier] told me that I would regret leaving school and I regretted it ever since, but I've studied hard.  I went to Paris [France], and I loved the city, came back went to Berlitz [Chicago Language Center, Chicago, Illinois] and learned how to speak French fluently.  I go to Paris every year and I don't know what I would've done had I, I had a better education.  I regret not going to school, but I think school, education is now the way the African American have to go and we have to coalesce and we really got to understand that the power in America is at the ballot box.

Speaker 1: The key to power in this country is the ballot.  America--this is a democracy and to a degree that you participate in the balloting process, to that degree you've gained power.  Going to the ballot box is the easiest way to gain power.  It's much easier than picking up a sign and marching in the rain to try and convince people of something, but then will not go and vote.  If we can get African Americans to go to the polls and vote the sky would be the limit in America.  The one, the group, the first group that understood the power of the ballot box was women.  The feminist movement has made tremendous gains for women in this country.  The second group was the homosexuals.  They understand the power of the ballot box and it's hard to find people who want to get elected to come out with anti-homosexual jargon.  African Americans understand that too to a point, to a degree, but when you think of the hundreds and thousands of us who don't vote, even though we saw what our vote did when we elected Harold Washington.  We did that even though the democratic organization of which he was a part turned against him, but because blacks for the first time en masse in this city [Chicago, Illinois] voted for this man, he became the mayor.
Speaker 2: Did you play a role in the election of Harold Washington or--?
Speaker 1: As much role as I could play, you know I was right there with him one hundred percent.
Speaker 2: What do you think will be your best contribution to that effort or anything?
Speaker 1: Vocal support, encouraging--the first and last time that I really made a lot of political speeches from my pulpit [at Apostolic Church of God, Chicago, Illinois] was during Harold Washington because I avoid political speeches in my pulpit, that's cause I got a 501 c(3) and I'm very concerned that I don't get carried away and then find myself in locked into battle with the IRS [Internal Revenue Service], but with Harold Washington I threw caution to the winds, because he was a man that I think that we needed to back and we did and so to a degree that my influence and my support vocally contributed to that, to that extent, fine.
Speaker 2: Now we were discussing earlier (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I gotta--let me make one more point.
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: If black people had of went to the polls like they should have in Ohio President [George Walker] Bush would not be president today; they didn't go, but the white evangelicals for the first time went to the polls.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's what it is, so that's the key.

Speaker 1: We were discussing off-camera maybe some of the organizational and managerial reasons for the success of this church [Apostolic Church of God, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, a church has to have a--you just can't have a tent and fill it up on Sunday.  You have to have a programmatic activity.  People have needs and my concern about the Gospel is that you win them through the Gospel, they come, they get baptized, they may be filled with the Holy Spirit, they--but they got all kinds of needs that have to be met, all kinds of programmatic that they have so you have to, we have programs for parents, we got programs for married couples becoming partners, we've got, we have workshops for money management, programs for teens, programs that help children going to school, benevolent programs where people in your congregation are being put out because they don't have any money, they need, they're behind in their rent, they're behind in the light, the gas, you got to help, you gotta have programs to deal with that.  You have to do other things.  Our church just now, our church just sent twenty thousand dollars for the tsunami victims last week, ten thousand dollars to Doctors without Borders and we sent ten thousand dollars to an organization in India that lost people in India.  We probably sent another ten thousand dollars but just don't know where to send it, because Doctors without Borders said they're overwhelmed they don't want anymore, and so you don't just wanna send money, it may not be used properly.  People, the people want to see that you're involved in these kinds of things so you, and you have to have a staff to operate the orderliness.  This an enormous project and we have something going on every night in the week, we're just not here on Sunday, every night something's going on.  So it's true, and there are a lot of churches like that something's going on, but the message has to be, you've got to have a messenger and you've got to have a message, and there's a lot of big churches, I'm not the only church that's got a lot, there're churches with a whole lot more members than I have.

Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done so far is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I suspect that if I went back over my life and do something different I would not have quit school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], that's one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know of any major decisions I have made that if I had to go back I would do it differently.  There are some actions and behavior patterns and things that if I had to go back I would change.  There were some judgment calls if I--I would do differently, but based upon the direction I don't know of anything I would change.  I would do the same thing.
Story_ID: 289591
Speaker 1: Likewise when you look back over your life what you would consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think that my legacy is more spiritual than anything else.  I believe that what I leave behind will be a Gospel message of grace that God saves sinners by grace not by what they do but by God's love and by his grace.  I don't see a big legacy of housing, or anything like that.  There are lot of people that have done far more than I'll ever do with that in that area, but my concern is really how to win men and women to the Lord because their eternal destiny is based upon the decisions that they make in regard to Christ and I think that would be my legacy that this church [Apostolic Church of God, Chicago, Illinois] is established here based upon God's grace and how God reaches out to people who don't want 'em, but yet God reaches out to them and through his persuasion and through his leading change their mind.  God causes them to repent, people don't repent on their own, they repent because the Lord had touched them in their repent.  People don't repent of doing things they love to do.  Somehow people gotta come to the conclusion that, I don't wanna do this anymore, and that's the persuasive act of God using men and women as his instruments to make that happen.
Speaker 1: All right, now in terms of works though I mean you know when people think of Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois], they think of Bishop Brazier [HistoryMaker Bishop Arthur Brazier] and this church, when they think of TWO [The Woodlawn Organization, Chicago, Illinois] and Leon Finney [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Leon D. Finney, Jr.] and they think of you all's being the powerful people in our community that's still going through a lot of changes, but its--has the power equation shift far enough for you since you've started this activity in 1960?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think it has, I think that the--what we have today, and we didn't have in 1960 is access.  We have access to the power structure, we have access to decision makers that in order to get then we had to demonstrate, and bring a lot of people downtown and then sit down and meet and then get a crumb.  Today there's access, we recognize that what we had to picket to get now we can get by picking up a telephone.  It's not that you have sold out, some folks say, "Well you know it's a part of the structure and they've sold out."  That's what a lot of folks say.  It had nothing to do with selling out, it has to do with coming to grips with the realities of the power structure and the terrain upon which you are deployed and how do you make things work for you?  Just to mau-mau and to brow beat and to scream and to denounce gets nowhere and if anything you get a crumb, but you never really produce anything, but begin to understand where the power structure is and what levers to pull and how to do that.  We've learned that over the years and it all comes back to the ballot box because the people in power want your vote.  If they can't get the vote they, they are not gon' be in office.  So it's a trade off, you proceed not because people like you, although being liked is good, I'm not knocking that, but that's not really the answer.  The answer is, do you have a kind of a power base that can get the thing that you feel that your constituency needs?  And case in point is Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].  Everybody likes Barack Obama but if he does not produce for his constituency he won't be there, case in point who was our former African American woman who was a senator [HistoryMaker Carol Moseley Braun]?  She served one term, she didn't deliver, and she could have stayed because she didn't lose by a landslide even though her opponent spent millions, she only lost by about 140,000 voters.
Speaker 1: So she was close.
Speaker 2: Yes, but somewhere along the line she lost her constituency.  I'm talking about back at the ballot box, that's where it is in America.
Speaker 1: Okay now this church here and your leadership here has developed new housing and a lot of help for people, some of the poor people over here in this neighborhood and people, and a lot of people come to this church that don't even live here you know for the message (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes the vast majority of the people don't live in this community.
Speaker 1: Right, right, but this last question is, is there anything that I haven't asked that you think you should address?
Speaker 2: You have probed deeply (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 289592
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a man who was concerned about the poor, was concerned about the quality of life in our neighborhood and that I was concerned about the spiritual development of the individual and their relationship to Christ that's what I would like to be remembered. I am concerned about the poor, this church [Apostolic Church of God, Chicago, Illinois] spends hundreds of thousands of dollars to help the poor who are not members of this congregation and who never will be, but that's not the point.  The point is that we're supposed to remember the poor, the people who have less, the people who need help, and I like to be remembered as one who tried to do that and as one who was concerned about not only putting bread on their table but also their relationship with Christ, that's the way I'd like to be remembered.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not as a civil rights leader.

Speaker 1: I didn't ask you about your family, I should ask you to say a few words about your family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My family?  Well I told you about my wife [Esther Holmes Brazier], I met my wife at a church picnic; we've been married fifty-seven years.  I have four children, three daughters, one son [Dr. Byron T. Brazier].  All of them are doing well, all of them are in the church.  My son is assistant pastor here and is general administrator, my daughter is a deputy--one of my daughters is a deputy.  One of my daughters is in Atlanta [Georgia] doing very well with her husband and her two boys and I'm very proud of 'em.
