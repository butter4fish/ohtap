 Little Thunder My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Thursday, May 7, 2015,  and I   m interviewing Juanita Pahdopony for the Oklahoma Native Artist  Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at  Oklahoma State University. We are in Lawton at Juanita   s house. Juanita,  you   re an artist perhaps best known for your mixed media works. You   re  also an educator, an activist, a writer, and even the subject of a  documentary film. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me.  Pahdopony Thank you.  Little Thunder Where were you born and where did you grow up?  Pahdopony I was born in Portland, Oregon, although I know nothing of Portland,  Oregon. (Laughs) I grew up just up the hill from here, my house. It was  lovingly called the Comanche Yellow Mission. It was an Indian community  that surrounded what   s now called the Comanche Reform Church area, but  at the time that I grew up it was a little Comanche community. Didn   t know  anybody else that happened to be another tribe, but we did have some people  that were Kiowa, and I learned later, and Caddo, so we did have some mixed  marriages there.  Little Thunder Your folks had already moved back from Portland when you were an infant,  I guess?  Pahdopony Yes. Well, it   s a long, convoluted history.  Little Thunder What did they do for a living? What did your mom and dad do?  Pahdopony My mom worked at the Indian Health Service  Hospital . Early on, she was  a seamstress. It was during the times when doctors    coats needed mending  or something had to be autoclaved. I always remember that word. It had to  be autoclaved, which meant that it had to be sterilized, so she did get things  5  ready for that. But she wore a blue uniform. When I was a young girl, I  thought she was a blue nurse. I didn   t know. She thought that was pretty  funny.  My father worked for the Department of Interior. He was a soil and moisture  conservation technician and again, just right up the hill when it was located  there. Actually, on this same road. My mother worked across the highway  on I-44 at the IHS Indian Hospital.  Little Thunder How about siblings?  Pahdopony I grew up as an only child with my parents, Sam and Marjorie Pahdopony.  My mother was a Quanah Parker descendant and she was from the Quahadi  band. My father was from the Penatuka, or Honey Eaters, Wasp Stinging  band of Comanche.  Little Thunder How about your relationship with your grandparents on either side?  Pahdopony On my dad   s side, they were very mysterious to me. They were Peyote  People, at least his father was. Now, I never met my dad   s mother, our  grandmother. I never met her because she was gone before I came on the  scene. But she was very Christian and she was an original member of the  Comanche Reformed Church, which was, in those days, called the Dutch  Reformed Church.  It was one of the missionary movements. Started out as a missionary  movement when the Comanche were divided up among several  missionaries. Some were Baptists, some were Dutch Reformed, some were  Methodists, some very few, I think, Catholic.  Little Thunder And on your mom   s side?  Pahdopony On my mom   s side, my mom was a Quanah Parker descendant, the Quahadi  people. She came from a big, large family in Walters, Oklahoma. I just have  good memories of uncles, and aunties, and the stories, and a lot of teasing.  Just a big family. In fact, my mother, her family didn   t want her to marry my  father because there was only one other person, his brother Howard, and  they thought that was just too weird. They were used to a big family and  they were very suspicious of my father being in such a tiny family.  Little Thunder You were around the language quite a bit.  Pahdopony I was around the language because my mother and father were fluent  speakers and I would hear them talking. They stopped whenever I was  around, but they still used some particular words. They taught me little  things like maybe animal names and I heard some things over and over that  6  stayed with me, but as far teaching me or wanting me to learn the language,  no, because they were very colonized. They were both boarding school  products and they were taught,    No, you don   t use the old language.     I remember my father saying to me,    I want you to be successful in the  white man   s world. I want you to be able to be successful, so there   s no need  for you to learn the language.    (Ah, how sad.) Then, in my dad   s last few  years, he apologized to me because he always saw me struggling to learn  and asking him questions. He said,    I   m so sorry because it would have been  so easy. It would have been so easy for your mother and me to teach you the  language and I   m sorry. I apologize to you.    We just were quiet about it for  a while. It was hard for me to not cry.  Little Thunder It   s okay. It   s a gift.  Pahdopony I   m so emotional about that.  Little Thunder What is your first memory of seeing Native art?  Pahdopony My first memory of seeing art was when I was a baby in a crib because I  remember standing on my tippy toes holding onto the top of a crib, and  stretching and stretching to look up on the wall and see a German print. It  was of an angel   s arms, out like this and two children crossing a rickety old  bridge.  It   s such a clear, vivid memory of my seeing that image and not having the  language, of course, but knowing that I wanted to be near it and stretching to  see. It was way up on the wall. I   m an advocate for,    Please bring your art  down on the wall for someone in a wheel chair or babies to look at,    because  art should be accessible.  Little Thunder That   s an amazing story. How about your first memory of making art?  Pahdopony My first memory of making art would be, because I grew up alone, and I  was always outside   in fact, I like to say I grew in a chinaberry tree  (Laughter) because my parents were working all day. I was home alone, and  I would make breakfast. Then, I would take it up in a sack and be up in the  tree.  I remember spending a lot of time, looking at the landscape, looking at the  land, looking at bugs, looking at everything. I saw oil after a rain. I saw oil  from a car on the roads, looking at the beautiful iridescent colors, and  thinking,    I wish I could save that. I wish I could save that.     Then I remember seeing   it influenced a later piece from the H2O exhibit     I remember seeing the dried up mud that formed little images and designs. I  7  thought to myself,    That   s got to be chocolate. It looks like chocolate. If I  believe it   s chocolate, it   s going to be chocolate.    It wasn   t chocolate. It was  a mud pie, but I looked at everything like that. I was very interested in  designs and colors, the iridescence on bugs. I remember I was just very  interested in the world.  I remember drawing in the sand with a stick. I mean, that   s probably my  earliest memory of making something. Then, every year at the Dutch  Reformed Church, they would give out a huge bag full of gifts. I always  looked for the art things like the watercolors, or the crayons, or something  like that. One year I had some finger paints. I remember my thrill at being  able to play in finger paints. It   s the first time I had something quite like  that. I really enjoyed that.  Little Thunder So tactile.  Pahdopony Yes.  Little Thunder How about extended family in terms of   you mentioned your mother was a  seamstress    that might have been artistic influences     Pahdopony She was very creative because she could always, she was problem solver.  She would laugh at her position because she said,    I never made a dress, I  never sewed on a machine before this job but,    she said,    I had that title.     She could look at something and make something fit. She could repair  something. She had very creative ways. She knew measurements like from  my nose to my elbow is one yard or     I don   t know, she had measurements like that. I remember her talking about  it. She was very creative.  Little Thunder What kinds of art experiences did you have in elementary school and middle  school?  Pahdopony I lived for art in school, my early experiences. That   s why I was in school,  was the little bit of time that we spent in art. I remember living for those  times. I was in the third grade and I had a teacher named Miss Moss. I  wasn   t really an achiever then. I remember Miss Moss     we had a little assignment and it had to do with numbers. Draw three  firetrucks and draw   .  Kids are more sophisticated these days, but that little assignment. I  remember taking my time and care, excited about it. I remember her saying,     Juanita Pahdopony come with me up to the front of the room.    I thought,     Oh no. What did I do?    I was so afraid. I remember my heart beating fast.  She brought me to the front of the room and she said,    Now show  everybody your paper. I want them to look at your work.     8  She had me go, oh my gosh, up and down every aisle to show everybody. I  was so proud. (Laughs) It was the first time I remember that first experience  of success because I remember being in the second grade and I had a reading  teacher, and I was in a slow reading group, when really I could read very  well.  I knew every word, but because I was in the Red Bird reading group, (and it  was all Indians by the way), everybody,    Tip   went   to       It was like that.  I remember doing that, too. I didn   t have to do it, but everybody else did, so  I did it, too, although, I could read very well.  Little Thunder It   s great to have that support in school a little bit.  Pahdopony Yes.  Little Thunder And your parents too? Were they supportive of your artwork?  Pahdopony They were. They enjoyed seeing my art. (Laughs)  Little Thunder How about junior high or high school? What standout memories of art do  you have?  Pahdopony I remember being very frightened to go to junior high because I heard  people got into fights there. I was just really afraid. I don   t really have any  outstanding memories other than I had forgotten to learn, you might have to  erase this part, let   s see what was it?    Four Score       Lincoln   s Gettysburg  Address.    Four score and seven years ago        I remember I had a very   I had a teacher that really frightened me. Her  name was Mrs. Grundy. Can you imagine having a name like Mrs. Grundy?  Anyway, she said,    Everybody you were supposed to have learned this, so  we are going to go up and down the row and you say it.    Do you know I  learned it? I was so frightened of her by the time it got to me, (thank god, I  was toward the end), that I learned the whole thing?  Little Thunder You had it in your memory?  Pahdopony Yeah, I still know it. I still know it today. That   s one    I don   t really have  any outstanding memories of, I must have been asleep through junior high.  In high school, I remember taking art and getting to know other people that  were taking art, too. I was intrigued by some of the things. I still didn   t  really relate to it so much, but I did enjoy art.  Little Thunder You got some painting?  9  Pahdopony Yes. I     Little Thunder Basic painting background?  Pahdopony Yes, a little bit of it. Very basic.  Little Thunder Right. What happened after high school, then?  Pahdopony I went to Cameron  University . I was not sure what I wanted to do. I must  have changed my major a hundred times. I think I began to realize that art  classes, really, there was so much more to them. Printmaking, figure  drawing, painting. There was a lot more to art than I had seen before, and I  just began to come alive at that time.  Little Thunder What media drew you the most?  Pahdopony I loved painting. See, I had always, because in high school you use the little  watercolors, Prang Oval, right? Prang Oval Eight with the one-size little  brush. I did everything with that one little brush. Everything. I didn   t know  about having other size brushes and fine brushes, and brushes that were  sable or other materials. I didn   t know about all that. I think that   s why I say  I came alive because there was so much more material to explore and it was  just so exciting.  Little Thunder Were you thinking at the time that you wanted to be a professional artist?  How did you     Pahdopony I wasn   t sure how I could make a living at being an artist, but I just took the  classes and enjoyed them. Then I thought maybe I could teach art. I began  going in that direction. That really wasn   t fully me at that time. I remember  just   I was in education and I was in art. I loved art. But I had some  experiences, too, in art, early experiences that I wasn   t sure that that was  what I wanted to do.  Then, I had an instructor that taught mixed media way back. I remember just  loving   and I guess one of the things I remember is that I remember tearing  up paper and standing on a chair and dropping those torn papers onto the  canvas and then gluing them there where they fell. That would be the  beginning of the collage. I remember thinking,    This is it. This is it.    That  was so thrilling to be able to   and create it, to be able to start art.  Little Thunder And then, it was sort of a newer thing?  Pahdopony Yes.  Little Thunder The mixed media.  10  Pahdopony Yes, and to be able to create composition with color. That was pretty  exciting.  Little Thunder I think I read that you just went to Cameron? Is that right?  Pahdopony I went to Cameron for two years and then I went to Southwestern Oklahoma  State University. That   s where I began to learn a lot more about art, the  different   I learned about mixed media and it was very exciting to me.  Then, I was home for twelve years. I married and then I was pretty much at  home taking some distance courses. Then I was asked to come and teach art  in Talihina, Oklahoma. I remember just enjoying that. It was a half-day  class. I enjoyed teaching art. It was pretty exciting.  Little Thunder Completely different cultural     Pahdopony Completely different     Little Thunder    landscape.  Pahdopony Then I began to have my family. Every so often, I would do art (but not  really fully participating) here and there once in a while in an art show. I  remember when I did art, I had a lot of compliments or awards or ribbons,  and they would say,    Oh my gosh. This is so good.     I remember somebody putting up a pumpkin still life, and I remember doing  my still life from the bottom up, doing a still life, the bottom of the  pumpkin. Everybody was    Oh my, that   s so unusual.    I just thought it was  boring to do a pumpkin still life, so I wanted to do it in a different way. I had  little experiences like that, that for me, were unusual and creative and I  knew I wanted to do more art     Little Thunder So being able to shift from these small little booth shows, and then you have  this period where you   re raising your family?  Pahdopony Yes.  Little Thunder Then, you start becoming invited to some museum shows. What was one of  the most significant early museum shows that you did     Pahdopony I think having some shows at the Museum of the Great Plains, and being in  group shows exhibiting with the Comanche artists. There was a group  called Comanche Gallery of Art, and it was made up of people like George  Smith Watchetaker, Wakeah Bradley, William Poafpybitty, Leonard  Riddles. Some of them really became my early mentors in Indian art. I saw  their art and while I never really copied their style, I saw them as real artists.  11  I saw them as people that knew the history, and they were documenting the  history and a very important historical place in life. Not even just as an  artist, but as another dimension to it, documenting the history. I really  admired them and they were my mentors. I saw their colors they put  together and the style that they had. Each one had a unique style. I really     I   m so thankful that I had that experience.  Little Thunder So when you did show with the Museum of the Great Plains, and it might  have been a later show, you did a piece that was an only daughter   s dress. I  don   t know if that was     Pahdopony That was much later, way after my mentors had passed on, but I did  remember a story and it stayed with me. I had a friend named Charlotte  Declue, and she was a poet. I told her one time,    What makes a good  poem?    She thought about it for a while and she says,    It has to have  memory. And then sometimes it has a punch that takes you in a different  direction.     I   ve always thought about that because I think that art is the same way. It  has to have memory. If you see an art piece and it stays with you, you think  about it, then it has memory. Or if it has something unexpected about, not  predictable, but something that you don   t expect, then that has a punch just  like poetry. There was a connection there because I did both. I think art for  me is the same as poetry. It has to be memorable.  One of those memories was for a Comanche Elder named Ray Niedo told  me a story. He complimented me on my Comanche dress wear when I  danced at powwows. He said,    Nita, I really like the way you dress. You  dress in, not the shiny, in the little more traditional way.    Because people  were starting to wear shiny materials and he didn   t like it. He was letting me  know that he appreciated a little bit more what he knew as Comanche  traditional dress. I was just thrilled that he was talking to me, so I listened to  his story.  I wanted to continue to engage him in a conversation and so I said,    There is  one dress I wanted to get his opinion on it. There was one dress that I always  wanted to wear. It was black velvet with cowrie shells.    He said,    Most of  our people no longer know this, but that was an only daughter   s dress. The  only daughter could wear that and you   re one of the people that could wear  that,    he said to me.  Decades later, I had that memory and I decided to do an art piece. I wanted  to do it in a more abstract way. Our dresses are T dresses, like some people  say, very simple, shaped like a T, but with the elbow to the under the arm is  12  open on both sides. I designed it and did the black velvet dress and the  cowrie shells.  Little Thunder Made it very three-dimensional.  Pahdopony Yes, very three-dimensional, yes. It   s one of the pieces that I think is a very  strong, memorable piece.  Little Thunder We are going to look at later. Also, there is a funny story about the purchase  of that dress.  Pahdopony Yes. I had just finished it and as everything is drying, the glue and  everything is being sewn together, I took it to the Museum of the Great  Plains. A lot of times I   ve done this with shows. My paint is still drying and  I   m with a hair dryer trying to get everything dry before the show, to make  the show. But I had just finished the last pieces of that, getting it together,  brought it to the show, and the Museum of the Great Plains registrar saw it  and bought it. The show wasn   t even open, but he wanted to buy it and talk  to me about it.  I thought,    Oh, I didn   t even get a chance to enjoy it.    It came from a story  from a Comanche elder, and I didn   t anticipate selling it right away or even  at all. I asked him it would be okay if I could make that again for my   .     Yeah, sure.    He was fine with that, so I did it for myself.  Little Thunder That   s how we get to look at it?  Pahdopony Yes, that   s how we can film it. (Laughs)  Little Thunder What do you think was that transition because you are influenced by these  older painters, you   re painting primarily, and then gradually you   re  working your way towards more mixed media pieces?  Pahdopony I believe I, in teaching art, I was able to come across more sculptural pieces  that I really enjoyed. I always loved Henry Moore   s work, the simplicity of  it. The images are just beautiful. I had admired work like  Roy   Lichtenstein, some of the mobiles   enjoyed that for the color. So I began  looking at those art   studying about them, reading about them, even once in  a while, being able to see a show, because I did get to see a Lichtenstein  show. Thrilled about that.  Little Thunder Where at?  Pahdopony It was in New York. So I think looking at that and then thinking about it. I  took a course with Benson Warren who was a sculptor, well-known sculptor  at Cameron University. I took a course later, but I didn   t quite have it all  13  together. I remember almost being a failure in that class, not being able to  come up with what he expected to see out of me. I remember having a very  difficult time. I   m not sure if he was just testing me or what, but I really had  a difficult time surviving in that class.  Once I remember submitting thirty-two designs before he finally approved  one, and it was like  sigh ,    Whew. Finally.    But even though I wasn   t  terribly successful in that class, it was memorable to me and it stayed with  me. I couldn   t forget it. I went over the things we learned. It stayed with me  and I stayed with it until I finally got the concept of it. It wasn   t so hard after  all. It was just me resisting it and making   I   m not sure what the holdup  was, but there was some hurdle that I had to get over before I could finally  let go       Don   t worry about being competitive. Simply do what you can do  and what you want to depict.     I don   t know if that   s it or not, but for some reason or another, I began to do  some pieces that were more mixed media. I loved collage. That was mixed  media, so that was still flat, but then I began to   I believe what happened to  me was that I had jobs in my career, teaching and teaching at the college  level that really took a lot of my time and energy. I did not have the time to  paint, but I did have time to think about the art and conceptually how things  fit together. And also putting that together with my early training, with my  mentors on the history, documentary history and our stories, our wonderful  stories, putting those together, and in my head incubating, incubating until I  had an idea and I could execute it in an evening, a conceptual piece.  One of them was   Eva Williams and I are friends. She   s another artist. I  really respect her work. She and I both had the same opportunity through  Cameron to put a show together, to curate a show because they couldn   t  think of anything to do. They wondered if we might put together a show. I  thought they had only contacted me, but somehow or another she got more  information and knew that we were both contacted. She said,    Let   s  collaborate. Let   s do a show together.    We met here and talked about,     What are you thinking?    She said,    I want to do a show with Indian  women. I   ve always wanted to do that.    I said that sounds neat.    Then, she  said,    What are you thinking? What are you thinking?    I said,    The first  thing I   m thinking is       (here I go, I can   t think of her name, Judy? The one  who did the table, you know   )  Little Thunder Oh yes. She   s the artist and feminist, yeah.  Pahdopony Wait, let me just, I did have her work in here. I just remembered it was Judy  Chicago. She did a piece, it was a ceramic piece and it was a triangle table  and it had very famous women like Cleopatra, other important women in  history. I identified with that, documenting history. Indira Gandhi   she had  amazing women throughout history that were invited to this dinner party.  14  She had ceramic dinnerware place setting for each of them in a triangle. The  whole bottom on the floor was little separate tiles.  I think there were 500 of other women, women scientists, women inventors,  women artists, women political leaders. It was actually a very wonderful  tribute to women throughout history, although we   re not really in books. I  told her I was thinking about that. Could we do something that was similar?  She said,    Sure. That   s a good idea.     Annette Arkeketa, who was with us at the time, she said,    Did you know if  we are going to have this table that we have Joy Harjo who wrote a very  important poem about everything takes place at the table?    Our children, our  weddings are planned there, our deaths are planned there. We eat together,  we celebrate together, everything happens at the table. Children hide under  the table. We have a lot of stories about the table.    We decided to contact  her and ask if we could use her poem for the theme.  Then we talked about let   s not have a design that   s a triangle, that doesn   t  seem to fit us so much. But a circle would. We didn   t want to have the same  round circle, boring circle. We decided to do individual tables that would fit  together at the top. Each person had   we would do an odd number because  we thought,    Somebody   s always missing at the table. Somebody passes on,  somebody has other appointments. For some reason not everybody can be at  the table. There   s always somebody forgotten. An odd number would  recognize that missing person.    We came together with this very powerful  show, I believe. It seemed   I wanted more from the show. I think I wanted  the show to continue on and travel.  Little Thunder Travel.  Pahdopony We talked about that, but it didn   t happen. We did have eleven artists that  submitted a work. We thought about people that we wanted to invite to this  very special exhibit.  Little Thunder That   s wonderful. What year was that?  Pahdopony What year? Good grief. It   s in here. Our Place at the Table, November 2007.  Little Thunder Two thousand seven.  Pahdopony Yes, it was a collaborative project of eleven American Indian women,  exploring the impact of statehood on their personal histories.  Little Thunder The statehood deal, yeah.  Pahdopony Yes.  15  Little Thunder You also participated in H2O K  water show. I loved when I found out  about that show. You know that   s when water rights were really     Pahdopony Yes.  Little Thunder    in the media as an issue between the tribes and the state. What was your  piece for the show?  Pahdopony I had a piece that had a Comanche name. The translation was, Our Land is  Dry. It had to do with the early memory of looking at the dried up land and  seeing the geometric pieces. I had the sandstone that I had for a period of  time because I   m a found art artist now. I know that. I step up and claim that  for myself. I   m always collecting things. I collect things on roads. People  when they travel are looking ahead and looking around. I   m looking down  because I   m looking for something that I can use in my art.  I had this stone and I decided to carve it into sections because some of it had  already been done, and I decided to continue that design. I looked at a lot of  different examples of that to come up with the images that I liked. I  sandblasted all these little areas out. Then, because the theme was water and  the conservation of water, I wanted to incorporate my name into this piece.  It was Pahdopony is the Comanche pronunciation of Pahdopony, anglicized.  Pahdopony, paa means water, and napuni or kapuni, cekapuni,    look at it,     means see how deep the water is.  It comes from an historical little journey of my ancestor. I wanted to  incorporate my name into it because it has everything to do with water and  see how deep the water is. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how  could I do my name into this piece?  I came up with a mirror, and it would be in the shape of a little pond, and if  the viewer looked at it and looked down into it, they   d see a reflection of  themselves. Our people saw themselves for the first time in the reflection of  water, paa. That was a good connection for me, so that was able to connect  and also, some design. I think about the land and that you can find rusted  things on the earth. I incorporated some modern design into it by using  some metal pieces that I found.  Little Thunder Yes, I thought I saw metal     Pahdopony Yes.  Little Thunder Separating some of the cracks.  Pahdopony Yes.  16  Little Thunder It was a really powerful piece, even just from a photograph.  Pahdopony Thank you.  Little Thunder It was the particular combination that    you can get blas   about mixed  media, but it was a kind of shock to you. Just kind of     Pahdopony Yes.  Little Thunder    grabbed you.  Pahdopony Yes, and it   s exactly that. Our land was dry. We were in a drought and we  had been in a drought for a time. It was really a big concern, especially  when there are political issues like fracking that can use some of our purest  water to create oil and our addiction to oil and all of that.  That was a concern, so looking at that piece in a lot of different directions. It  came together all at once. I spent a lot of time thinking about it and then,  boom, I knew what I wanted to do. It came together quickly except for the  sandblasting those sections     Little Thunder Right.  Pahdopony    took some time.  Little Thunder You   ve been honored by Comanche Nation College with the Dean Emeritus  title. When did that happen and how did that impact you?  Pahdopony I didn   t know that I had that dean emeritus title.  Little Thunder I read it online.  Pahdopony Oh, my. Well     Little Thunder It might not be accurate, but you   ve taught there. Talk about your teaching  experience.  Pahdopony I did a presentation in Texas at Tarrant County Community College and it  was on leadership. One of the things I said to them was,    I don   t know if  anybody ever sets out to be a leader, I   m not sure about that. I never set out  to be a leader, but I am somebody who   s willing to help.     Oftentimes, I found myself in leadership positions simply because I said I   ll  help. I found myself as a tribal administrator by being willing to help. I  found myself as dean of academic affairs in the same way because I was  17  faculty, but it was also about problem solving and making sure that  everything was going in the right direction for the college and that we could  be accredited one day. Building and working on the infrastructure, and  teaching, and all those wonderful things, working with Native students.  Pretty exciting. I   m so fortunate to have fallen into that.  I was asked to put in for that when it came open and I did. Oh boy, when I  got the position, then there was really no time for anything else because it   s  a very responsible position. I retired from that position in 2013. I was home  for six months and asked to come back as the interim president, which I did  for seven months. I   m very honored by those positions. They   re very, to me,  a pinnacle of my whole career, to be able to do a responsible, exciting  important job like that.  But it also meant that I wasn   t able to do art, but I could do a lot of thinking,  incubating ideas. I could put something together by thinking about it, and  I   ve done that. Art has always has an important place no matter what I am  doing, but I might not have a whole lot of time for it.  Little Thunder You received a cultural award from Lawton in 1995, I think, which I guess  was as an artist award.  Pahdopony Yes, I think I was very active back then. I think I was doing a lot of art and  having shows, and being involved in the Arts and Humanities, and serving  on the museum boards. I was very involved.  Little Thunder Actually Lawton, I don   t know if you dealt with, I know they   ve got a couple  of strong galleries, or at least one     Pahdopony Yes. The Leslie Powell Gallery is     Little Thunder    the Leslie Powell Gallery  Pahdopony    and the Museum of the Great Plains, too, has had a number of shows, but  the Leslie Powell Gallery is really a nice gallery. Some people say,    I didn   t  know this was in Lawton. It doesn   t even seem like we   re in Lawton.    It   s  just so elegant and professional. I   ve had a show there with Brent  Greenwood.  Little Thunder I see. When was that?  Pahdopony Then I had   I   ll have to look at that.  Little Thunder Four or five years ago?  18  Pahdopony Yes, yes. When I walked into that show, I remember the first thing I saw  was this painting of Brent Greenwood   s and I remember,    Wow. It had  memory.    I couldn   t stop thinking about. I thought about it. Brent liked a  tipi that I had done and he came up to me, and I was thinking about the same  thing, but he came up to me and said    Would you be interested in trading art  for art?       Oh my gosh, yes.    I knew exactly the one I wanted. He made a  comment about,    We   re trading art for art, we   re trading tipis for tipis.    This  is the tipi that I traded with him on.  Little Thunder Was it a mixed media piece?  Pahdopony It was a painting on a hide that was shaped like a tipi cover and it had an  unusual shape. It was sponsored by the Arts Council of Oklahoma. Carol  Whitney put the grant together for that show and invited a number of artists.  There were some really powerful artists in that show. I remember we had  months, almost a year to complete this piece. I remember looking at the list  of artists, people that were just amazing. I thought,    How could I compete  with those people?    I spent months just not doing anything. Then toward the  end, the last few months, I thought,    I   ve got to get busy on this.    Then  when I thought I should do something that was Comanche, I thought I   ve  got to do some documentation. I got to go to the museum and study and  read. Then when I got over myself, I thought,    I   m Comanche for Pete   s  sakes. I should be able to come up with something Comanche.    I completed  it in a very short time.  Little Thunder You had a solo show at the American Indian Community House, I also read,  a few years ago.  Pahdopony Yes. It was a show with Shane Goshorn. Also, Annette Arkeketa had a very  important Ghost Dance play that she had written that was very important. I  did some art that with along with the theme of NAGPRA  Native American  Graves Protection and Repatriation Act . I have one piece here that I can  show you that I felt was very connected to that show. It had to do with  Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act in 1990. It was a  borrowed piece. I borrowed a story from the Cheyenne people. It was about  a young woman. I took that story. That was part of the repatriation for me. It  was symbolic that I, a Comanche, used a Cheyenne story to depict the story  of first trade between the humans and the pack rat.  Little Thunder Oh, yeah.  Pahdopony That was my piece in that show, one of the pieces. That ended up being a  very major thing because it had to be in a storage. It had to be frozen for any  bugs in the gallery. It had some big     Little Thunder Because of the materials     19  Pahdopony Yes. Wood and the holes in the wood, infestation, and it led to a lot of   .  Finally, what we did was for the opening I could show it. I couldn   t show it  for the rest of the exhibit.  Little Thunder Oh my goodness.  Pahdopony That was my most important piece of the show. It could only be in the  opening.  Little Thunder I actually know that story, too.  Pahdopony Yes. Yes.  Little Thunder Who ended up with that piece?  Pahdopony I have it here, although, I gave it to Ava Hamilton because she is Cheyenne.  I said,    I feel like it should belong to some Cheyenne person,    and I said.     I   m going to give it to you.    She has never been able to travel with it since  she lives in Wyoming   no she lives in Colorado.  Little Thunder You know, in hearing the stories, it   s such a connective thread, story,  between your different works, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit  about the buffalo hide piece that you did for the Museum of the Great  Plains?  Pahdopony The buffalo hide piece that I did, I didn   t do it for the Museum of the Great  Plains, I did a buffalo hide. I had thought about this for a long time. I wanted  to do a piece that would commemorate the Comanche history from my own  perspective and also the perspective of the Comanche people themselves,  children, elders, middle-age people, people that knew a lot about the history  and were connected, and people who weren   t so connected.  I wanted to put a story together that would be contemporary. It would give a  little bit about our history, from leaving the Shoshone Nation way back in  the sixteen, 1700s, coming down the Great Plains, traveling all the way to  Mexico. The killing of the horses in Texas. Our recent Texas history on up  to modern times when our tribal economies turned toward gaming, bingo,  and other sustainable economies for the Nation. It was really a story about  our success in modern times. I had images like that. I asked people,    What  do you think should be on this?       Oh, you must do this or you must include  this.    So those stories I included. It came from the people.  I asked people please pray for me to come together with, to be able to do  this in a good way. Say a prayer for me please that I can do a good job  20  because what a responsibility. I took this on, but then it felt like a very rich,  but very responsible thing to do, to depict our history.  Little Thunder Definitely.  Pahdopony Yes.  Little Thunder I   d like to switch and talk about your more technical practices, philosophy.  You kind of explained how neat it is that you can spend your time thinking  basically     Pahdopony Yes.  Little Thunder     about the mixed media pieces, so I   m wondering how much time you  spend    Whether it   s    I think of the concept then I find the materials?    Or  is it sometimes the reverse?  Pahdopony When I travel, when I   m anywhere at all, I   m looking down, so I   m finding  materials all the time. I have a lot of materials that I have collected that are  waiting for me to use them. An example of that is     I   m always looking for materials wherever I go. I have a collection of things  that are waiting for me. I know about those things, and I keep them in my  mind that I have a number of things. I   ll find bottle caps that have been  mashed by the traffic and they look like little frames. (Laughter) I find  things like that, rusty pieces of metal and different materials. Recently, I  found a motor gasket on the way to Memphis, Texas. We stopped to let our  dog have a little break, and I was walking along and I found this perfect  little rusted frame and I asked my husband,    What is this?    He said,    It   s a  motor gasket frame.       Wow, it looks like a little antique frame.     I threw it in the back of the car and I knew I would use it somewhere. Then,  when the rewriting history show came about, I knew that I wanted to have a  formal portrait of my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, Ida  Tahmahkera. I wanted to depict her in history, so I used that motor gasket  frame.  The piece was just so exquisite; the little frame was on both sides. I had this  terrible struggle deciding which side. One was rusted beautifully, and was  green, and had a lot of color to it. The other was flat, but it looked more like  a frame. Which do I use? It was so elegant and it was so appropriate for my  grandmother   s portrait. It looked like an ancient frame, very tiny ancient  frame.  I added some color to a copy of my grandmother   s portrait. I used acetate to  represent the glass. I ended up putting it on Oklahoma sand- stone and also  21  the clay. The connection of it was that the tiny shells that I added to the art  piece Riding Home was the story of my grandmother. You think about  riding home, the Comanche people were horse culture, so that even the  name Re-Riding History is like you   re actually riding a horse maybe.  Little Thunder Right.  Pahdopony Also, when you   re a student in a boarding school, then they think about  writing home. They think about being at home.    If I just had a horse to ride  home,    many of them thought, surely. I thought about my grandmother and  her educational story and that was a connection. The shells had to do with,  or the beads that I added to the art piece, had to do with her being a bead  worker.  The stone that it was on was Oklahoma, which the Oklahoma red earth, and  then the clay, the ever present clay, but those two things also had a  connection to the Saint Augustine Castillo de San Marcos Fort which was  stone and very cold and sterile to the prisoners who were housed there in a  very foreign landscape. Those things, and that   s what I   m talking about, the  incubation. I   m thinking about all these layers of meaning. There is much  more to it than just a rock with some beads and a portrait of an Indian  woman. There is a lot of layers and meaning. That   s the kind of art I like to  do.  Little Thunder You   ve talked a little bit about some of the kinds of research that you do. Is  there anything we haven   t touched on? A lot of it  is  talking to people,  sometimes books, travel     Pahdopony I   m very interested in the Comanche history and all of that, the language, the  writings that are already in existence. Many of them are so stereotypical  because they   ve been created in another time. One of the goals that I have in  my retirement is that I will be able to write the Comanche perspective to  some of those same stories of Adobe Walls  Texas  and the battles there     our perspective of...  I   ve been able to do that in some PowerPoints, and also it has gotten into my  art. The depiction of all that, it   s all connected. I believe that   s what I   ve  learned from my early mentors who were Comanche. I remember George  Smith Watchetaker telling me,    Nita, when you depict something, when you  do something that   s Comanche, make sure that you talk to the elders. Make  sure. Do your research and make sure that it is correct.    I remember him  saying that to me.  Little Thunder How do you sign your work?  Pahdopony Pahdopony.  22  Little Thunder Okay, and we will see it here in a bit.  Pahdopony Yes.  Little Thunder When you are thinking about something, your creative process, are you  keeping track in a notebook of ideas or is it     Pahdopony I have a lot of different journals. I have a lot of different started art books  and journals, particularly, when I   m incubating. I   m really a fan of the  Wallas Paradigm which talks about preparation, that when you first get an  idea for art, that you   re doing everything to prepare for it. Sometimes these  different terms overlap one another, but you   re gathering everything, you   re  thinking about it, in my case, I   m thinking about it while I   m writing, doing  research, or writing, or talking to people. That   s the preparation for doing an  art piece.  The incubation period is   I spend more time in incubation. I spend more  time thinking about it, thinking about it. How am I going to do it? Then my  materials, of all of that. What am I going to need? The materials, the story,  the documentation, but then also the elimination and that   s what,    ah-ha,     some people call it,    I know how to do it.     I know that   s a short period for me. I know how I   m going to do it. Once I  get it, then that   s it. It doesn   t take long. The verification for me is pretty  exciting because, what is it then? Is it that you got into a show, you were  accepted into a show, a juried show? Was it that you sold it? Was it that one  person admired it? Any of those things. Verification is very different for  different pieces. That Wallas Paradigm, those four stages, for me in my later  work, incubation is where I spend most of my time.  Little Thunder Looking back over your career so far, what has been one of the low points?  Pahdopony Low points? Oh my gosh. Decades ago when I had won   I think I won an  award for one show, for one piece and I can   t really remember what it was,  but it was a collage piece. I entered it into a show at Philbrook  Indian Art  Annual . I don   t know what it was. I can   t remember. I   ll have to look back  and see if I can jog my memory. It was so long ago. I remember I was so  confident in that piece, but it didn   t make the show.  Little Thunder It got rejected?  Pahdopony Yes, and I thought how could it be? I remember I went through all these  different stages, denial, grief, it can   t be, then I even thought,    Maybe my  work isn   t that good.    I remember it was a low point.  23  Little Thunder Right.  Pahdopony I think that   s what artists do. You get impacted by maybe even what one  person says. I   ve grown since then. That was so long ago and critique was  really an important class to be able to withstand what other people say about  your work, and make what they say constructive criticism of your work.  I   m very hard-nosed now. I really seek constructive criticism. I seek the  opinion of others.    What do you think?       It   s a little weak in this area.     That   s okay to be able to do that, and especially being able to teach that and  see that in students. It   s okay that somebody   it might not even be right, but  it   s good to see that there are other perspectives. It   s okay.  Little Thunder How about one of the high points in your career so far?  Pahdopony Oh my. I   ve had some really rich moments, but I remember one person  saying to me, when I got into the show, in the Changing Hands show, One  person said,    Nita, do you think this is the highlight of your life?    Oh, I was  so disappointed. I hadn   t even thought of that. I said,    I hope not.    But it  was a pretty big highlight to get into a show of that caliber.  Little Thunder It was. It was, and I don   t think we mentioned, you want to talk about who  sponsored the show?  Pahdopony The Changing Hands show was put together by  Ellen  Taubman and  another individual. I have to look up the person   s name.  Changing Hands:  Art Without Reservation 2 by David R. McFadden and Ellen N. Taubman   Little Thunder I think it was the New York School of Design, is that right?  Pahdopony It was in the Museum of Arts and Design.  Little Thunder Museum of Arts and Design, right.  Pahdopony And before then it had been the Arts and Crafts Museum. Does that sound  very prestigious?  Little Thunder Right.  Pahdopony No, but they changed their name to the Museum of Arts and Design, which  really sounded powerful. I remember getting an invitation to that show and  being so, so thrilled. That   s probably one of the highlights of my life was to  be invited to that. Then, also being asked,    Do you know Ron Anderson, do  you know how to reach him?    It   s very hard to reach that person, but yes, he  was a personal friend and I knew exactly where he lived. He was living off  the grid for a while, but yes.    Do you know where we could find Cynthia  24  Clay?    That was pretty thrilling to be asked about people that I knew and  that we worked together and critiqued each other   s work and we knew what  we were doing.  Little Thunder Is there anything we have forgotten to cover before we look at your  artwork?  Pahdopony I can   t think of anything.  Little Thunder Okay, we   ll pause for a minute and take a look at these pieces. So this is, of  course, the dress that you talked to us about. I don   t know if you want to add  a little bit to it, but it   s wonderful.  Pahdopony This is taa pune petaa kwasu, which is Comanche for the only daughter   s  dress. It   s a very special dress that could be worn. The story came to me  from a now deceased elder, Thomas Niedo, who was a very rich historian.  Knew stories and he knew our language. He told me the story about that this  dress could be worn by the only daughter. It was a special dress. Cowrie  25  shells weren   t in our environment, so it was trade item. It was very valuable  at one time.  Little Thunder Beautiful piece. How about this piece?  Pahdopony This is a portrait. It   s a monochromatic painting of my great-grandmother,  or in Comanche,    my tsoo.    Her name was Wehrare Parker Tahmahkera on  my maternal side. She was the daughter of Quanah Parker. She had blue-grey  eyes, but as you can see, she was very, very Comanche. The eyes came  from the Cynthia Ann Parker captive history that we had.  I had a black and white photograph of her. I remembered how the  Comanche women were very protective of their hair, and she always had her  hair in a very fine hair net. It was braided, but this is how she dressed. It  brings back some rich memories of when I was a child. I could see a lot of  elders, Comanche women, dressed just like this. We no longer see them  dressed like this anymore. I knew even at this time that it was a rich  memory.  Little Thunder That   s a great story. Thank you for sharing that. Thank you so much for  your time today.  26  Pahdopony Yes. Thank you. Come on, let   s see what we can grab to eat in here.  -------  -------
