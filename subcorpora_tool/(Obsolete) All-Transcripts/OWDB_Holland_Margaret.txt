 Kite  Holland  We   re at Mrs. Margaret Holland   s house in Stillwater, Oklahoma. It is  November 14, 2000. I hope you don   t mind me asking when you were born.  I was born January 13, 1917. I   ll be 84 in January.  Let   s see, if 1935 was the high point of dust activity, you would have been 18.  So you weren   t that young when it all started. And where were you born?  In Dewey County, Putnam, Oklahoma.  I was just looking that up on a map today.  You were?  Yes, I have some people out there we   re going to talk to in a month or so.  What was their name? Do you remember?  No. I talked to Corene Seal from the Jailhouse Museum, and she   s in charge  of finding contacts for us out there.  So many of them have left, you know. The parents are all gone, passed away.  Left for good reason, I guess.  Well, they just grew too old. My folks were old. My mother was in her forties  when I was born, because I was the last of nine kids. I had four brothers and  four sisters.  And then you came along. You messed up the even set.  I don   t even remember my oldest sister until she came home married.  Yeah, my mom was like that. Her oldest sister came home with a kid, and then  she met her.  I remember them coming home, and I went in and got in bed with them.  5  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  That   s funny. Well, where were your parents from? Do you know where they  were from?  My mother was born in Illinois, and Dad, I think, was born in Kansas. I don   t  know a lot about my dad. Mother and Dad, I think, met each other in Chicago,  Illinois. Mother was working in her sister   s restaurant there.  And your dad had traveled out there?  Yeah, he traveled out there for some reason, and that   s where they met. Then  they lived in Kansas for a while, and they came to Oklahoma   let   s see, she  had a daughter and two sons when they came to Oklahoma, in 1906. I   ve got  the dresser in there that they came to Oklahoma with.  Really? They brought it with them.  Yeah, you want to see it?  I would, after we   re done I   d like to take a look at it.  My dad let me have it, and my husband put new things on it, handles and  things. I redid it.  Did they come by train or covered wagon?  Mother came by train, she and the three kids, and Dad came in a covered  wagon from Kansas to Oklahoma.  1906   was Dewey County wasn   t in the Cherokee Outlet was it?  Well I was born in Dewey County.  Was that included in the Cherokee Strip?  I don   t think so.  I think it was a little south of there. What did your dad do when he came?  Was he a farmer?  He was a farmer, and he also later on got him a truck and did hauling for  people. He hauled cattle and wheat and wears that needed to go to the markets.  Do you know what his main crop was at the time?  Wheat and corn. He raised lots and lots of corn, and oats.  No cotton?  We tried to raise cotton one year, I think  laughter .  6  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Well you always have to try.  Yeah, but see, they were all from the north and they didn   t think much of the  cotton business. But yeah, I picked cotton.  Oh yeah?  Oh yes, I picked cotton.  Did your mom work or did she stay at home with the kids?  Oh, she stayed at home. She had all the work she could take care of there.  See, we didn   t have water, electricity, or anything like that.  When do you remember getting water and electricity?  Oh, I didn   t get that until after I was married.  Do you know around what year?  I was trying to think. Well Dub and I, my husband, W.A., let   s see, I had three  kids on the farm, and I was married in    35. I graduated from high school in     34.  You were 18 when you got married.  Just barely.  Did you stay there in Dewey County?  Yes, we stayed there until after we had three children. My husband   s folks  lived around the corner. My mother and dad had moved to town to Putnam,  and Dub   s folks and W.A. did all of the farming and all of that. When I grew  up as a kid we didn   t have tractors or anything like that. I drove mules in the  field, and horses. I worked in the field before I was married.  Was that common for the people in your area?  Oh yeah, everyone did it.  Everyone had mules and horses that they used. I want to get back to the  electricity and indoor plumbing, or lack of.  Well, we didn   t have it, I   ll tell you for sure.  You were married in 1935, and you didn   t have it then?  No.  7  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  And do you remember when you might have had it?  Well, let   s see. We left out there, and he got a job with Phillips Petroleum in  Tulsa. That was the first time we had that.  You made a big move. From Dewey County to Tulsa County is a pretty  geographical change.  Well, we lived in Collinsville for a while, and then we drove back and forth.  When we lived there, I worked at the bomber plants, during the Second World  War. I was a tool and dye maker.  Wow. Well, you   ve got a lot of stories, Rosie Riveter.  Well, my sister worked down the line from me, and used what I made in the  tool and dye department. I was the second woman in there. That   s all the  women there were in that department, in the bomber plant. My brother  worked there also.  My grandma, I   m from northeastern Oklahoma, and when World War II came  up, she took the kids and went to Wichita, and started working up for Boeing  making bombers.  See, we all did. I shouldn   t tell this, one old boy in that department, he was  always trying to tell me dirty stories. I was just a kid you know; I didn   t like  that kind of stuff. One day after he started telling that, why the guy up there  working said,    Margaret, you don   t have to listen to that.    Well then one night  I was walking out of the plant, and this guy, six-foot-four I think it was, and I  didn   t know he was behind me, but there was a bunch of little smart alec guys  shooting off their mouths about me. And boy he heard them and he walked  around there took a hold of me, wrapped his arm around me, and walked out.  They never said another word  laughter . They knew they better leave him  alone.  That   s a funny story.  Isn   t that crazy to tell that, but it   s true.  They were picking on you.  Yeah, they were saying smart things, and boy, he never would let anybody do  anything to upset me.  It   s good you had that guardian angel.  Yeah, I did. That   s what he was.  So when did you move to Tulsa?  8  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  It must have been about 1940.  One of the questions we had was about how you lived when you were in Dewey  County, the house you grew up in and the house you moved to. Sometimes  people find that interesting.  Well, my dad could do anything. He could build, or he could tear up a  machine and make it all over, so I guess when he moved down there he bought  this piece of land. Some guy had proved it up. He bought it, and it had two  rooms on it. He had one room and then the bedroom for them. He built on a  big long kitchen, a pantry on the west side, a bedroom on this side, and then he  built two more bedrooms on the other side. There was a porch around between  each one of those. We had three porches. And he built cisterns for water in  two of those porches. That   s where we got our water, right off of the house.  Was the house you moved into similar to that one, when you were married?  Lord no, it wasn   t as good as that one  laughter .  Okay, let   s hear about that one.  Well, we moved down south of Putnam, and my husband I use to get on horses  and ride down there. It was about ten to twelve miles, but we moved down  there and lived down there. We just moved back up by W.A.   s folks. W.A.  was doing a little farming there, but I didn   t help. I didn   t work in the field  after I got married, but I did milking and raise chickens and turkeys and pigs  and all of that. Then we lived there for about, let   s see Tommy was about four  years old when we left there     Your first child?  No. Jackie was born in 1936.  You had three kids on the farm?  Yes. After we moved to Vinita, I had another one.  But you said the house you moved into wasn   t that good.  Oh, the one south of Putnam was terrible.  You want to talk a little bit about that?  It was just an old ratty farm. We had rented that farm down there, and that   s  where we farmed. My husband and I farmed down there. It was just old and  run down. Then when I had my first child, the neighbor up the street brought  me a baby buggy  laughter . In fact, she was born before the doctor got there.  Your first child?  9  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Yes.  Did you have any help delivering it?  There was a girl staying there with me, and my husband had to go to town, we  didn   t have a telephone, he had to go to town to phone the doctor.  Did that girl know how to do anything at all?  My sister, one of my sisters   they were all worried to death about me   she  said,    Marge, if something happens to you and you have that baby, you be sure  and check to see the cord   s not wrapped around her neck.    And I did, and it  was, and the girl took it off.  Wow, what a story. Sometimes people talk about when it would get really hot.  In the summer they would sleep out on the porches. What did you do if you  didn   t have any big porches out there?  We raised the windows. It was out in the open, and you got more of a breeze.  Yeah, I didn   t have electricity until my husband went into the appliance  business and we fixed our house with air conditioning.  That was a big change, I bet.  Yeah. He worked for Phillips Petroleum in Tulsa, and then we moved over  here. We moved to Vinita and they had an appliance store, he and his brother.  Then we moved down to Stillwater and we had a store here.  When you were growing up everybody in the region were all farmers?  Yeah, it was out on the farm. It was about seven or eight miles from our house  to town. The other kids all went to a country school, and then my dad got with  it and got the school there at Putnam consolidated. The first year was in 1929,  when I started school.  Your dad obviously felt that education was important.  Was the main thing, yes. And he had nine kids to educate. He made some  enemies. You do that when you start changing things.  But obviously for the better.  He had a truck that he could take the bed off of the back and take the thing to  haul kids and put it on there. He and my oldest brother drove the school bus  for the longest time down in there.  Did they do it free?  Free, bought his own gas.  10  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  You said that you worked in the fields up until you were married almost. You  worked with the mules and horses and whatnot?  My sister   just older   and I were the last two at home then, and when we  were going to go to the field the next morning, before my dad left he would go  by the Barneman   s. There   s a couple boys up there, and Dad would say,    You  go harness the horses for Marge and Midge because I   ve got to leave,    and  they come down and harness the horses and mules for us. We   d go out and  hitch them up. I wasn   t this tall when I stood on a three-piece harrow and  drove those horses.  How funny. Were you five, four, five or six?  I may have been six or seven. They had to eat with their food in their mouth at  noon, the horses did, with the bit in their mouth because we couldn   t put the  bridle back on them. We weren   t big enough.  You couldn   t reach it.  So then at night we   d just pull the harness off their rears and hang it up.  That   s funny.  I know you probably can   t believe it, but it   s true so help me God, every word  of it.  I can almost believe it. My mom worked a lot on a farm. One thing that  always fascinates me   I might put you on the spot here and I   m sorry   is how  fondly people remember the horses and the mules they worked with. Do you  remember the names of some horses?  Oh, Beck and Gin. Then we always had about three riding horses. I should  have saved that picture of me on a horse after I was married and had four kids  at my brother   s house.  You had Beck and Gin, and they were the mules?  Uh-huh, Beck and Gin  were the mules    and we always had about three  riding horses. Old Pet was a saddle horse, and if you hit her behind the saddle  she   d pitch. Dad would hit her behind the saddle just to see if we could stay  on with her pitching. We hand-milked anywhere from 15 to 20 cows. That   s  the reason I don   t have very pretty hands.  Strong hands. Could you describe a typical day when you would be working  in the fields? What time would you get up and breakfast and things like that.  We   d get up about 5 or 5:30. We   d go milk our cows, about 15 or 20 to milk,  and separate the milk. Then Mother would have breakfast ready. We   d come  eat breakfast. Then we   d go harness the horses and go to the field. We   d work  11  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  until noon, come in, feed the horses, eat our dinner, and go back to the field.  We   d work until about five or six o   clock in the evening.  Your mother was working at the house?  She could milk every once in a while, but she hardly ever had to milk. She  had all she could do at the house.  And your dad was out working.  Yeah, he was out working or oiling that truck.  And you were in the fields with your sister? Do you remember what a typical  breakfast consisted of?  We usually had eggs and biscuits or toast or something like that.  What about lunch?  She   d fix us a good lunch. See, we had our own potatoes and vegetables. We  raised them, and she canned them. There was a big dugout cellar on that place,  and Dad lined it with cedar posts. She used those great big jars to can in. She  didn   t use these little bitty ones like we do now. She used half-gallon jars.  Two quarts.  And we had cherry trees, peach trees, and apple trees. We had fruit, and then  of course, we raised all kinds of other garden stuff and raised our chickens,  turkeys, and hogs and beef   we   d butcher. I   ll tell you that beef was a lot  better those days than what you get now, and chickens were too. We had  turkeys. We always raised turkeys. Mother always raised to enough turkeys  to sell to buy her a new rug for the living room. She   d say, when she got ready  to go to town on Saturday and some of us kids   d be in there, she   d say,    Now  don   t you kids go in there and dance on that rug.    And we would  laughter .  You   d do it just because she told you not to, probably. So you worked pretty  hard in the fields then. Was that during the school year too?  Yeah sometimes, but no. We didn   t work in the field when school was going  on. We did our milking, and then we   d go catch the school bus. Dad had quit  driving it when I started out afterwards. We always went out and milked all  those cows before we left.  You said you picked cotton too.  One year he had cotton. This oldest sister, she   s crazy  laughing . We all had  cotton sacks. She picked about one row, and she threw that cotton sack down  and said,    Now Daddy, if you want that cotton picked, well, you pick it  because I   m not a going to,    and she went to the house  laughter .  12  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Was it one of those big long cotton sacks? And that was the end of that.  Nobody liked picking?  No   I   ve never done that, but I   ve just heard it   s horrible.  Yeah, it is. It   s rough. We had a guy that lived with us once for a little while.  He didn   t have a family and he got his arm crushed off. He just had one arm.  He could just keep that cotton going in that sack just like that. He was really a  good cotton picker. He   s the only guy that lived with us extra.  Kind of a farm hand or a hired hand or something like that?  Yeah, he just didn   t have anywhere else to go, and the folks just kind of took  him in.  Did you ever work at a job besides the farm? When you were young, did you  have a paying job somewhere?  No.  Always doing work for the farm? In your very few spare moments, do you  remember anything that you and your sister or friends in the area did for fun?  Oh yeah, we   d all get together and do things. We had country dances, and we  all went to those. We kids at home danced a lot, too. My sister and I could  Charleston real good.  You could dance on the rug.  Oh yeah, we danced on the rug  laughter . We had fun. We had picnics  together. Easter was always great. Mother would color all these eggs, and  we   d take them out and hide them. Then all the kids would come in, and we  would hunt them. We had a lot of fun.  The Charleston was a good dance for you?  Yes. I liked to do anything dance-like.  Did you have a radio or a record player?  My dad, one night he came in from being on a trip, and he hollered at us. He   d  always call me Marge and Doris was her name, my sister, but she was so little  when she was born they called her midget and she was named Midget.  That   s a horrible name.  Uh-huh. So when he came home, he came to the door and hollered,    Marge  13  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  you and Midge come here, I got you something.    We went in there, and he  had us one of those little record players you had to just wind it up. That  drawer of there is full of great big records. Well, they never could get us to go  to bed that night  laughter . But, oh, that was pleasant. That was the most  beautiful thing, for us you ever heard of.  Even if you did tear up your mother   s rug.  Yeah. And we had a sewing machine that you treadle with.  One of the old manuals.  I   d put my toes under there and I could just treadle, make anything.  So did you sew your own clothes?  Some of them. Mother, she never had a pattern in her life to sew by. She   d  get a catalog and tell us kids to pick out what we wanted. We would, and she  would take a newspaper and cut the pattern out. She was a beautiful  seamstress. Well, I was a seamstress, too. I use to sew for people.  Did you ever make feed sack dresses?  Yes, all kinds of them. Every time dad went after anything like that, for  chicken feed or anything, we   d say get two or three or four of the same color.  So you could     Oh yeah, we wore them to school.  Do you have any of those you saved?  No, I never did save any.  You probably wore them out.  I   m glad to get out of it. We were always dressed nice.  Well, I   ve seen some examples of feed sack material, and it   s not bad.  Oh, they   re pretty, and they just last forever.  It   s sturdy material. Was there a stigma? Were you embarrassed to go in feed  sack dresses?  No. Every one of us was in the same boat. Only a lot of their mothers  couldn   t sew like mine could. That makes a difference.  So you had dances and picnics. Were there live bands or people playing music  14  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  at the dances?  Well I   ll tell you, you   re not a Catholic are you?  No.  Well, okay. We were at a dance, and my brother in-law, my sister   s husband,  was a violinist, and he was playing the violin at that dance. There was a great  big barn where they use to put hay, a great big tin barn. It had big cement  floors, slick as glass, and they got to where they had dances there. So we were  down there one night, and I was dancing   I was probably 15 years old   with  this old guy, you wouldn   t know him, from I don   t know where. Anyway, he  was nice looking and I was having a lot of fun, so he asked to take me home,  and I said yes. Well I went over to my sister, she was over by her husband  who was playing, and I said,    I   m going to go home with so and so.    And she  said,    Oh you   re not. He   s from Thomas and he   s a Catholic. You   re not  going home with him.     Laughter  We didn   t know anything about religion  except for the Methodists and the Christians. That   s all we had there at  Putnam.  You found out pretty quick that you weren   t going home with any Catholic.  I didn   t know what a Catholic was  laughter . Isn   t that ridiculous?  Today it seems ridiculous.  In Putnam there was just a little Methodist church and a little Christian church.  I use to get on a horse and ride up there seven miles to go to it.  You said you had picnics. People, just kids and friends in the area?  Yeah, because everybody had a bunch of kids. The Cobleys and the Havers  and I don   t know who all. The Cobleys had two sets of twins in their family.  What would you have for eating at the picnic?  We   d have fried chicken, beef roast     Okay that   s enough. I   m getting hungry.  Did you ever have to help butcher a hog?  I   ve never done that.   Laughing  I have, and dressed lots of chickens.  For some reason, doing the chicken doesn   t seem as bad as the hog.  Dad and I did. I remember one time he was trying to kill one of them, and we  15  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  tried to help him catch it.  A chicken?  No, a pig.  So that sounds like although there was a lot of hard work, and it was hard  times, it seems like you had entertainment.  Yeah, and we all did good in school. I had my sister and one brother, but he  was gone by that time, but all the rest of them were gone. I   d go to school and  come home from the school bus and do the chores. If I had to practice the play  that night at school, I   d get on a horse and ride seven miles to school by  myself, and come back to practice the play. I didn   t think anything about it.  It was just the way of life. So do you remember when things began to dry out?  Yeah, I remember. Whenever you farm, you have to just depend on the good  Lord for the atmosphere, but we had lots of seasons that we didn   t have very  good grass, food, wheat, or corn wasn   t too good. Dad used to grind our old  corn with his truck. He had a thing that he could put on the wheel of his truck,  and he ground our cornmeal.  Oh, home ground cornmeal. I bet that made some good cornbread.  It did.  Do you remember when the big drought came in the thirties? Do you  remember it being any different at all?  Oh, yeah. People were in bad shape. They just didn   t raise anything see. We  had to go buy feed for the cattle. I remember doing that.  Was your family   s farming operation about normal size for that area?  Yes. I think dad had about 350 acres, and then he rented a couple of different  lands.  Half a section or so more?  Yeah.  Was your family affected about the same as other families in the area?  Oh yeah, we weren   t any poorer than anybody else. We were just like  everybody else, just struggling to get along.  Did your chores or did the household change at all when the dry time began?  16  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  No. It was just like it always was.  You would, I guess, not have to work as much in the field if you weren   t  growing anything.  Yeah, not as much. But Dad had rented some extra pastureland also, and we  had cattle there. My sister and I   d go over there and take care of the cattle, and  see that they were all right.  Did you ever have to sell off your cows or kill your cows?  No. We   d sell them when it came time to sell them. When they had the calves  is when they were all ready to sell, and Dad would take them to Oklahoma  City and sell them.  Sometimes, I guess in more extreme areas, farmers were forced to slaughter  their cows or sell early.  Yeah, they   d sell them early. They had to.  Do you remember the first appearance of a dust storm coming over?  There was just a big cloud. Of course we always kept our windows in tight,  shut them up, to keep it out of the house.  And that worked all right?  Yeah, it worked pretty good. I remember though, after I was married and we  had moved from this other old place down there   moved up close to W.A.   s  folks, there was a tornado that tore up the house, and the guys that owned the  house built a new one for us. It was real tight. It was a brick house. It was  real tight; it wasn   t very big. But still that dust could get in those windows  some way. I don   t know how it did it. You   d find the next morning that it   d  be on things.  Was a brick house unusual for that time period?  No, there was several. Now our house was wood, but there were some brick  houses around there.  I never imagined a house being made out of brick at that time.  But it was.  So do you remember dust storms coming in on a regular basis or just one or  two big ones?  No. You   d never know when it was coming.  17  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Holland  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Any in particular that you remember?  No. Usually if we were out in the field and saw one coming, then we   d come  in. But my mother always said,    Well the good Lord destroyed the Earth with  water once, and it   ll be by fire the next time.    Well, when they had all those  fires down here, and I looked at that on TV, I thought,    Well, Mother you   re  right      I never thought of that.  She always said that, God love her. She had the prettiest voice.  Did she sing?  Yeah, she   d sing. Wash on the board and hang out clothes, she   d be singing.  You could hear her all over the country. I said to one of my sisters,    I wonder  why she did that.    She said,    She did it to keep her senses.     Laughter   Maybe it took her mind off of things. What would she sing?  Religious songs.  Hymns and things like that?  Yes.  When the drought came and the Depression hit hard, do you remember  families moving out? Did you lose friends and neighbors? Did the town  shrink at all?  Oh yeah, the town shrank, I think. It was just a wide place in the road to start.  Now, there are hardly any families there that were there when we were there.  They all got big implements to farm with, and it was just too much.  So in your area a lot of people moved away, and you said that people brought  in large, really big implements and started     Yeah, they did. After my husband and I were married, we had the first tractor  that there was there.  When you were married     In    35.        35. When did you get a tractor?  Oh I imagine it was about three or four years after that. It was just a little  tractor. My dad had the first combine, too.  18  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  I   m just curious, how were you able to afford a tractor?  Dub and I? I think probably we sold enough cattle to get it or something  because we raised cows.  Do you remember what kind of tractor it was?  A little Ford. Oh, I remember something like that.  Fordson or something? It seems like a lot of people out there, their first  tractors were Fordsons. It was a Ford brand. So the town and the area lost  quite a few people.  Yes, they did.  Would you say it was more to the Depression or the drought?  No. I   ll tell you what it was. I think the kids just wanted to get away from  there and go on to college and all that stuff, so they just left. My mother was  way up in the forties when I was born. And my dad and mother moved to  Putnam. They moved into town, and my dad was just a hauler then. After I  was gone, they moved.  They didn   t ever consider leaving the area?  No. That was just their place.  They had been there too long.  And everybody in the country knew Bill Barr   that was my dad   s name.  William Wesley, but everybody called him Bill. And they used to call my  sister just older than I; the rest of them, my brother and father, were all over  six-foot and my sisters were taller too, other than the last two. We both had  bright red hair. It was the reddest hair you   ve ever seen. We were known as  the little red headed Barr girls  laughter . Everybody knew us by that.  Riding on the plows  laughter .  I use to stack wheat too, when we just had a regular binder that they drove  horses with. In fact, I used to ride the lead team on those tractors or on those  combines or whatever they were.  The horse-pulled binders.  Yeah, it pulled the binders, and then we   d get out and stack that into stacks.  Right. Then they   d come out and thrash it. Your dad, you said, had the first  combine in the area, which did it all together.  19  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Yeah, later on. It was just one of those small ones. He didn   t get out and do  that kind of stuff.  But still it   s pretty progressive, the thinking.  My dad could do anything. He could build a house. I remember he had a  truck one time, and it wouldn   t pull up the hill because we lived down on the  bottom of these real low hills, and we   d have to hook horses onto that truck  when he drove down a load of cattle or something. I rode along the road and  drove that while he was pulling that up the hill.  You   d drive the horses?  Yes. One time he got a truck and he tore the engine up in it or whatever it  was, I don   t know what, but he put what was called a Jumbo in it where he  could shift to make it go better and give it more power. He tore it up and put it  back together himself.  Maybe a lower gear or something. Sounds like a Jack of all trades. A lot of  the people we   ve been talking to have vivid memories of hobos and tramps  coming through the area and doing work and looking for food. Do you  remember anything at all?  No, I don   t remember any of them coming through. We never had a lock on  our door. We never locked it, never locked it. My sister and I were home  alone. They   d go just wherever they needed to go and never worry about it.  Everybody helped everybody else. If some woman had her baby, Mother was  there to help out with it. We all did that. If someone got sick, you were there  to help out.  It was a real sensitive community.  Yes, it was.  Do you think the hard times, the drought, the Depression tightened that sense  of community or did people move away and it lose some?  No. They didn   t move away too much.  So it didn   t really change that?  The same people that when I was born were still living there, the families, until  they just all died off and the kids got married and left. I think that   s what we  decided to do. W.A. was just helping his dad all the time, and he knew he was  never going to have anything of his own, so he got this job with Phillips  Petroleum in Tulsa. So we moved.  At the time that you moved you were 18, or no, you had lived there for a four  or five years.  20  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Yeah, I had three kids by that time.  Were you glad to get out?  In a way I was, and in a way I hated to leave my mother and dad, but I was  glad to leave.  When he came home and said,    We   re moving to Tulsa,    you were like whoo  hoo   Well, we had to go to Collinsville because we couldn   t get anything, but we  finally bought a house in Tulsa.  It seems like people had opinions one way or the other about Roosevelt and his  New Deal policies. Do you remember any of that ever coming into your  parents    lives, what they thought of Roosevelt?  Well, I don   t know. My dad, he was a real republican and W.A.   s dad was a  democrat. Of course, my dad was from the north and Dub   s dad was from the  south.  Your dad came in from Kansas.  Yeah, and boy when they were all going to be at the house together W.A. said,     For God   s sakes, don   t anybody mention politics.     Did his dad come from Texas?  Yeah, his dad came from down in there somewhere.  Yeah, that   s two different worlds.  Oh yes, they were just so different. No one ever smoked in our house at all. If  the boys smoked, now Dad didn   t smoke, but if the boys smoked, they smoked  out on the porch. Dub   s folks just smoked all over the house. It was just  different.  Kansas republican, not smoking. I   m just assuming his view of Roosevelt  probably wasn   t very high.  I don   t know. But now as far as my dad taking stuff the government, no we  never did. He wouldn   t have taken a dime. What he had, he did himself.  Do you remember a time when it came close? Like you maybe being younger  you thought, why can   t we take some of that food? Were you ever in that much  need of assistance?  No. We always had all we could eat. We always had good shoes at the  clothes store.  21  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Well, it sounds like you guys did all right.  They weren   t beautiful clothes, outlandish like people now, but they were  good clothes, and we were clean. Our house was always clean.  You did a lot of house cleaning?  Yeah, not a lot. My mother, she just did it. She didn   t have anything electric  to do it with. She never had any electricity until after she moved to town after  I was married. No water but she drew it out of the cistern.  The cleaning must have gotten a lot harder after the wind and dirt.  Yeah it was, but she kept it out.  Growing up out there what   s your most vivid memory, or something that sticks  out in your mind as something that was important to you, an important event?  I think they taught all of us kids to be truthful, to take care of ourselves and not  hold our hand out for handouts. They just never did. I never saw Mother or  Dad ever slap one of the kids or anything. But, we minded, we respected  them. We didn   t go up to the table and say,    I don   t like this food.    If we had  Dad would say,    You just get up and leave the table if you don   t like it.    He  called Mother, her name was Mildred, and he called her Millie. He said,     Millie   s worked all day on this, and you just hush.     Now it sounds like somebody at one time or another said they didn   t like that  food.  Well, they may have, but they didn   t voice it very loud because he   d probably  shake his head. Then they knew they better shut up. But he never whipped  anybody.  He didn   t have to.  I   ve seen him wrestle  laughing , the older boys and him wrestled. Of course  they were all about six-foot. Mother would say,    You guys are going to fall in  the cistern wrestling out there on the porch.     Just in fun.  Oh yeah, that   s what it was, was fun.  Well, we didn   t really go over your schooling very much. What was your  school like? Did you set with a lot of different grades in one room?  No. See, the other kids all went to country school, but the year I started my  dad had gotten it consolidated. I never did set in. There may have been two  grades in one room, but that would be all.  22  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kind of a modern school set up.  Uh-huh, but we didn   t have indoor toilets or anything like that. We still have  school reunions out there every once in a while.  Out at the same school?  Yes. Big auditorium. My older boys were all basketball players and two of  my sisters were basketball players. This one, she lives down here in Texas is  still alive. She played basketball. She   s right at six foot herself. She   s 91.  Just Putnam City Public Schools, is that what it was?  Yes.  So your parents instilled in you a sense of kind of self-reliance, and not  needing to accept handouts.  Just make it, and I guarantee you we did. Dub and I borrowed  10 and got  married. We haven   t asked anybody for nothing. What we   ve got is ours and  we paid for it.  And what would you attribute that to?  We were taught to work, and not go out and use a credit card and get deep in  debt like the kids do now. We paid for what we could, and paid cash.  So at the time, did the dust bowl, the Depression, or the drought make any  lasting marks on you at all?  No, really it didn   t because we knew what we had and we knew what we could  do. We didn   t expect anything greater. We all advanced real good.  Well, are there any last memories or stories you want to talk about or tell?  No. I thank God everyday for the raising that I had. I was taught to respect  and be nice to people.  It sounds like your parents were pretty good people.  They were, they were. I never remember seeing my mother and dad fight  about anything. Of course they have had a few.  Do your memories differ from your older brothers and sisters? The way you  recall growing up and your parents. Is that different than how your older  brothers and sisters remember things?  I don   t know whether it is or not. When I talked to my sister down here in  Texas, we talk each Saturday about an hour because she   s alone and so am I,  23  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  and we just laugh and cut up and talk about everything. Everybody out there  was in the same boat we were. We didn   t know any different.  That   s a good thing to talk about. Do you remember any families that were  poorer than you? Like going to school with people who didn   t have shoes or  families that were richer than you.  Oh yeah, some of them were rich, but I really didn   t notice it. Our dad used to  go to town and buy four or five pairs of shoes when they used to call those  nickel shoes. We always had good shoes and everything to wear. We were  always clean. I think my mother and dad just taught us how to live with what  we had to live with, and none of us were lazy. This is getting off the subject,  but now I have work I   ve done, and I use to work at Stillwater National Bank  for a long time. And now I could stand anything. If a kid couldn   t understand  how to work, I was head bookkeeper and all that stuff, and do things. You  could have time to talk with them, and if they   re lazy I just don   t have any  feeling for them. I just don   t know what it is.  Well, it sounds like an industrious attitude. Maybe something that was  instilled deep in you from your parents. You were brought up that way.  Yes it is, and if something didn   t work, well stop and fix it. Don   t just run and  get a new one, stop and fix it.  So you don   t recall any big difference? You remember some families were  maybe better off a little bit.  Well sometimes families were able to manage better and do different, but they  were all just practically like we were.  I was talking to a man and his wife out in Woodward the other day, and he  said that his fondest memory of that time, and he was really poor, was when  his dad saved up some money and bought the family a cold orange soda. It  was a hot summer day, and he took a drink out of that and he thought it was  the greatest thing in the world. That   s his fondest memory.  Of course, we didn   t go to town and buy ice cream cones. We milked the cow,  and had a freezer that we turned and made our own ice cream. Saturday  evenings Dad would bring home about 50 pounds of ice. We had a big two-gallon  ice cream freezer, and he   d chop that up. Mother would stir up this ice  cream, and boy it was good. We   d freeze that, and we   d eat most of that.  Then we   d freeze it in the freezer Sunday.  You   d make two gallons of ice cream on Saturday, and eat it all.  Yeah  laughter . None of us were fat. I   m fatter than anybody now.  Then Sunday you   d turn around and make two more gallons  laughter .  24  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  See, we had our own milk and our own cream. All you had to buy was sugar  and vanilla.  Well all right, I   d like to thank you for your time.  Well that   s all right. I don   t know whether you   ll get much out of it or not. I  still thank God for the raising that I had.  You were telling me about your wedding a little bit.  Yeah. I just took my schoolbooks and sold them so I   d have some money. I   d  always heard if you were married in brown, you   d live in town, so I got a  really light brown piece of stuff, and I made me a little dress. I made it myself.  On your treadle machine?  Yeah on Mother   s treadle machine. Then Dub and I went to Arapaho and got  married.  Borrowed  10?  We borrowed  10 from his granddad and got married.  And you ended up living in town.  Later on.  You went where and got married?  Arapaho, Oklahoma. We didn   t have a big wedding or anything like that.  So you sold your school books, bought material, made your dress, borrowed  ten bucks, and you were good to go.  Yeah.  Did both your parents and his parents go to the wedding?  No, we just took off one afternoon and went.  Did they know you were going to get married?  No  laughter .  Did they care when you came back?  No, they figured out that   s what it was. I think Mother had already figured it  out when I made that dress.  25  Kite  Holland  Kite  Holland  Kite  She knew you were making your wedding dress. But she didn   t say anything  about it?  Oh no, she wouldn   t say anything. They let us make our own decisions.  And stand by them.  We did too.  All right, thank you.  -------  -------
