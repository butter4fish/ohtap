Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Today is August 6, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum along with Juliana  Nykolaiszyn. We   re with Oklahoma State University and today we   re in  Guymon, Oklahoma to speak with Kathy Boyd regarding the Heard  Farm     Yes.     centennial farm, and this is part of our Oklahoma Centennial Farm  Family Project, so thank you for having us today.  Well thank you for coming. It   s an honor to be included on this.  Let   s start with having you tell us how the land came to be in your family  to begin with, and then we   ll just proceed from there.  Well my grandfather, Oscar Neil Heard, he went by O.N., was an  employee of the Florida Lumber Company. The Florida Lumber  Company established sawmills up and down the Mississippi River. My  grandfather went in once they got one established, got it up and running,  and then they would move him to another one. At the age of forty-one,  in 1903, he was told he had malaria and he was told he only had six  months to live if he did not get to a drier climate. He had heard about No  Man   s Land so he came out and checked it out. He wrote Grandma a  letter and in that letter he said,    There   s no mosquitos, it   s cool at night,  and I can see the stars, and it never rains,    so he thought he   d found  God   s country.  He went in, filled out the papers to file on the claim, and went back to  Tennessee to finish up business there. When he came back then, to build  his shack, he found out there had been a mistake in the filing. They had  actually filed him on section 3-4-14 and it was supposed to be section 4-  5  Finchum  Boyd  4-14 so he had to start the process again. They filled out the new papers.  He built a shack, ten by twelve, ten by twenty   something like that. Had  a cot and a stove and that   s about it in it. Stayed for six months, a  neighbor, Mr. Williamson, did come and break out twenty acres for him.  He started planting mainly fruits and vegetables and stuff. They had to  show that they were making improvements on the land. He had to be  here six months and then he could leave for six months. He stayed six  months, went back to Tennessee, and did work. During that time that he  was here homesteading, one of my cousins had sent information that  Grandpa had offer, after offer, after offer, from the lumber company to  come back to work for them. They just kept doubling his salary, and  doubling his salary, and doubling his salary. (Laughs) When he   d go  back those six months periods he would work for them and make some  more money and so he could come back.  Anyway in 1905, he chose to bring Grandma and their two daughters   Ruth and Elizabeth  out, but before they came he got a letter that, from  the neighbor, his shack had been stolen. You know if you think about it,  there   s no foundations, no plumbing, nothing. They go in, they jack it  up, put it on a sled, and take it off, and live in it somewhere else.  Grandpa came back and dug a half-dugout. Grandma didn   t want to live  totally in the ground, so he dug a half-dugout and built two rooms on top  of the ground. They came in 1905, later in the year, he brought Grandma  and the girls back. We do have a picture of the dugout that I think you   ll  probably want to take later.  And what was the wife   s name? And the daughters   ?  Okay, Minnie Reed was her maiden name. Minnie Lee Reed Heard was  my grandmother. The oldest daughter was Ruth, she was born in 1900,  and Elizabeth was born in 1903. That was the only two children at the  time that they came. Then they had two more boys at some point.  They  died as infants.  I   m not sure what years they were born. Flossie was  born in  1908 , she lived to be 102. My father was born in 1912 and he  was ninety-four when he passed away.  Anyway, my grandfather that had been told he only had six months to  live lived to be eighty-nine years old. He loved the country, he tried  several different things. They at one time had   in all of this stuff I  found   planted over 800 locust trees. Why? I don   t know. He also had a  large orchard he tried. Out of the orchard we do have one mulberry tree  left that was planted in 1905 to 1908; we   re not sure on that. It does put  on some mulberries and it   s out in the horse pasture and the horses love  them. (Laughs) They did cantaloupe, watermelon, one year. They raised  a lot of those. He would get up early in the morning, pick them, and take  them to town to sell them and everything. He didn   t make enough  6  money at it.  I   m not sure what year it was, but he read about hard red winter wheat in  the Dover   s Telegram. That was out of Kansas. He ordered in some  wheat and planted it, had a good crop, divided it among   his neighbors  came and helped him harvest it   divided it among the neighbors. My  father was told that Granddad is the first one on record to have had  wheat in this area. At one time Texas County was the largest producing  wheat county in the state of Oklahoma so it   s kind of an honor.  Granddad did try also before that he tried planting cotton. He had been  here and he thought, okay, this is beautiful. When he brought Grandma  back he also brought his cotton scales back from Tennessee. Had the  most beautiful cotton crop he had ever seen until the tumbleweeds  turned loose and picked all his cotton and blew it away. (Laughs) That   s  when he decided to try the wheat. That was 1905 and then through the  1920   s everything was going along pretty well.  In 1922 he did build a home and they   let me back up a little bit. He had  purchased the land north of the southeast quarter that he homesteaded  on. He had purchased the northeast quarter of 4-4-14 and for ten dollars  an acre in the late   oh probably 1918 in that area. There was a half-acre  on the north end of that and there wasn   t any church out here. They were  a long ways from the church or schools. They decided they   d put a  church/school combination in and Grandpa let them use that land to put  that. It was called the Eula School. It only went to the eighth grade.  Well, he wanted his children to have a high school education so he  bought a home in  Guymon  also. Grandma and the kids, during school  time, would live in town. Grandpa would go in on Friday, pick them up,  bring them back for the weekend then take them back, if the weather  was permitting.  Out of all the years that Daddy had twelve years of school, he only got  to attend Eula School one year because he had sisters in high school all  the rest of the time. He only got to attend   it was one-room  schoolhouse, approximately sixty students, one teacher. A lot of times  during the years the teachers lived with my grandparents. Many times  weather would get bad, they   d end up with a whole house-full of kids  because they couldn   t get home.  Anyway, the Eula School, I think it was 1940   I   m trying to go back,  1947 I believe it was when the Eula School disbanded. Then we all  went   everybody went to the Straight which is northeast of here about  seven miles   Straight School that was built. That building then was  moved and Grandpa took back over the land. We have a neighbor boy  that loves to do   has a metal detector   and goes metal detecting. He  found a token from 1912 up there, World   s Fair, on that site. We   re sure  7  some way somebody had been to the World   s Fair and lost that token.  Moving forward, things went pretty well for them in the farming until  the drought got so bad in the late 20   s and early 30   s. My father had  helped Grandpa here with the farming and he and my mother, Mildred  Baker, met in 1935. She was working at the court clerk   s office and  Daddy had met her. He saw she had a job and he didn   t so he married  her. (Laughs) Anyway, they got married and moved out here and were  going to live with Grandpa and Grandma. Right after they married he  was offered a position at Hough, which is three and a half miles  northwest of us, to have a Champlain  Bulk  station. He jumped on that.  His first check for a month was like six dollars and thirty-five cents.  They had rented a house up there, it was ten dollars a month for the rent  plus they had a grocery bill, so he didn   t know how that was going to  work. The next month though his commissions check was six hundred  dollars. His commission was half a cent a gallon on gas, one penny a  gallon on kerosene, five cents a gallon on motor oil. The price to  customers, gasoline was six and half cents a gallon, kerosene was four  cents, motor oil was thirty-five cents a gallon.  It was in 1928, actually, then that my grandfather bought some land  across the road. He borrowed two thousand from the state against that.  He had a note at the bank for six thousand dollars. The crash came in  1929, 1931 the bottom fell out and he didn   t know what he was going to  do. They kept hanging on and Daddy finally, after he got the job at  Hough, Mr. Gear, the president of the bank, agreed to extend the note for  one more year if Daddy would co-sign. My father co-signed the note and  really they hit pretty good working on the farm had a good year, good  moisture and made twelve thousand dollars on their wheat. They were  able to pay off all their notes.  My father never, ever, ever, had a loan for anything else. If he couldn   t  buy it, pay cash, you didn   t get it. That was his experience from what he  had gone through with Granddad. He stayed with the Champlain station  working, I   m not sure, into the 40   s but I   m not sure when, and then  farming too. In 1938 my oldest sister  Barbara  was born, they lived at  Hough. In 1940  another sister, Patricia, was born.  Then I was born in  1947. We all lived in Hough. In 1951, I think it was 1945, my  grandmother passed away. In 1951 Daddy was in the process of building  this house now for them to move down on the farm and just as the  basement had been dug, my Granddad passed away. We moved down  December,    51, so I was four and was raised here. After I left home I  lived in Guymon, so Guymon   s as far away from here as I   ve ever lived.  Hough was as far away from here as my father ever lived. He was born  in the dugout and neighbor lady had delivered him. That   s just the way it  8  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  was. Didn   t move. (Laughs) My older sister lives in Amarillo, and the  other  sister  lives in Lebanon, Missouri, but this is still home.  So you didn   t know your grandparents?  I can remember Grandpa. While they were working on the house here, I  stayed over there with Grandpa and I cannot remember, I should   ve  asked my older sisters, what the lady   s name was that came and stayed  with him. I can remember being there and of course then you ate lots of  beans, but you had to sort the beans. You didn   t just open up the  package, rinse them off, and cook them like we do now. I remember  sitting up on the   she   d set me up on the cabinet and have me help her  sort the beans. Grandpa would be playing the piano and that was right  before he died. He played by ear and he had played piano and sang. He  had a beautiful voice. I can remember that some. Other than that I don   t  a lot.  I   d ask my sisters about Grandma and really they said they don   t have a  lot of memories of her. She was very quiet person, I assume. Grandpa  was more outgoing. Grandpa was on the church board, he was on the  school board, he was also what they called   I can   t remember what they  called it. Sledgeville was the voting community and he was the head of  the bill, he would go out and holler at 7 o   clock in the morning that the  voting   s open and then at whatever time at night he   d go out and holler  it   s closed. He did all the counting of the votes and the whole bit. He did  that for several years. That was over close to where the Mueller place is,  is where the Sledgeville was.  And they raised primarily wheat during the whole time   after the  cotton?  Wheat and maize.  Maize. Okay.  Or, milo.  No cattle?  Grandpa always called it maize. They didn   t get into cattle. I can  remember we had some cows, but just enough to where you had some  milk and that you would butcher once a year. Chickens    Grandma was  big on chickens. I have her 1936 diary and in this diary, I don   t care  what was going on, she told how many eggs she got. What is today,  August the sixth? Uh oh, August sixth she actually didn   t write anything.  On August the seventh,    Elizabeth did a big washing today, she washed  9  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  quilts and blankets.    August the eighth,    They have gone to Hough and I  got two eggs.    Just most days she would write down like two eggs,  cutting weeds this morning. She was real good about putting down  everything that was going on.  Elizabeth was a daughter     Elizabeth was a daughter, yeah. She was the  second  daughter.  Grandma did lots of canning. They said she   winter time they never  really had to buy much of anything, flour at the store, that type of things.  She always had eggs, of course, with her chickens. They had the milk,  they had the meat, and evidently they cured the beef. I   m not sure how  they processed the beef at that point and then summertime they had full  gardens and everything. Daddy said, had told me, he said they hardly  ever had any grocery bills to speak of when he was a child. When  Grandma and the girls would go to town to live, well she   d take all of  the canned stuff with them. They lived about two blocks from the school  and the kids would go home at noon every day and eat.  I would assume they   d go back and forth by horse and buggy?  Yes, they did.  Or wagon?  Wagon. I   m not sure what year Grandpa got his first car. I don   t  remember. The first tractor they got in 1925. Anyway, after my  granddad died I honestly don   t know if the land had been turned over  into my father   s name before. I haven   t looked back at the deeds to see  at what point it became his. I know he purchased some after Grandfather  died. In 1974 my husband started working for Daddy. I think it was in     68 maybe that he put in irrigation. Of course it was flood irrigation and  it was on what   we   re on a correction line so we don   t have the full  number of acres a lot of people have. (Laughs) Approximately 600 acres  that he had flood irrigation for. In    74 my husband started working for  him, in    83 Mom and Daddy wanted to start doing a lot of traveling.  They retired and Jack and I leased the place. I had been working in CPA   Certified Public Accountant  offices since 1967. I wasn   t a CPA, but I  was keypunch and all of that good stuff, record keeping.  In 1983 then when he released the farm, I quit that. I became the  combine driver and Jack and Daddy were trucks, grain cart, all that.  Daddy still wanted to be a part of it, but he didn   t want the whole thing  on his shoulders. I don   t know what year it was that Daddy really had to  quit. He got to where he could hardly see at all. His sight was very bad.  We had to take his driving privileges away from him. That was hard.  10  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  My mother passed away in 2001 and then Daddy was able to stay at  home. We had a lady that was coming and helping with him. He passed  away in 2007. About three months before he passed away we had to put  him in a nursing home, because he got to be too much for her to handle  especially this far from town.  Well, when your parents were running the farm it was wheat still?  Yes.  And maize?  Daddy did wheat and milo.  And you lived here too at that time?  No.  No, after.  My husband and I lived in Guymon.  Okay.  We did not move out here until after Daddy passed away in 2007.  But you grew up here.  I grew up here.  And did you have chores?  Oh yes. There again, we always had chickens when I was a kid. The  chickens were the main chores for us girls. We helped in the garden, we  loved going out and   pulling weeds used to be fun. It   s not now.  (Laughter) And picking and canning. We were busy all the time. We did  have a lot of fun, too. I mean, their philosophy was you got up and got  your work done and when it   s done you played. Course we did get TV, I  don   t know, in the 50   s sometime. We had like one or two stations and  the reception wasn   t very good. We didn   t watch a lot of TV.  What would you do for fun then? If you could play what would     Well, we had   we played   in the summertime we played croquet all the  time out in the yard. (Laughs) We   d set up croquet and play that. Rode  11  Jackie Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  bicycles. There was neighbors around with kids and we   d set up  swimming pools and we   d swim. I   ve got a basketball hoop out in the  round top and we   d play basketball. Downstairs we have a recreation  room that   Daddy was insisting on having a room for kids to have fun  in. They were youth leaders at the church and we had lots of parties over  here. Have shuffleboard, we have ping pong. We played lots of cards,  lots of dominoes, lots of board games. If you weren   t playing, I mean to  us, playing and having fun was like baking cookies. It didn   t have to be  that you went out and did anything; it was just something you liked to  do.  My mother was a sewer, she could make anything. She made nearly all  of our clothes and they were beautiful. Then she got into quilting and  she made a lot of quilts. When she was in her 50   s she started taking  painting lessons. I   d never known she had any artistic ability to her other  than her sewing. Daddy bought a woodworking machine, and when I  was in the eighth grade, so that would   ve been 1960, he made a desk that  I   ve got. That was his first piece of furniture. We   ve got a baby cradle  that he made in 1965. It   s beautiful, won first place in the fair with that.  Nearly every frame that you see in this house and most of the pictures  that are painted my mother painted, my dad made the frames. They just,  quilt racks, all of the kids have quilt racks.  And grandkids and great-grandkids.  And grandkids yeah, grandkids   and quilts, she made quilts. Jackie was  small when   my daughter was small when Mama was quilting. What   s  the one with the little girl   s name with the bonnet?  Sunbonnet Sue? Is it Sunbonnet Sue?  Yes, Sunbonnet Sue, I think it was, is her quilt     That actually wasn   t my quilt.  Oh really?  She made me the double wedding ring, and I was so small that I  requested the Sunbonnet Sue quilt. (Laughter) It was supposed to be my  older cousin   s. (Laughter)  Anyway, all of the granddaughters had quilts. A lot of her great-grandchildren,  she was still alive, and crocheted, made things. She didn   t  go buy a wedding gift for anybody or baby gift for anybody. It was  something you made, some way.  12  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Did she pass that on to you? Do you sew?  Not to that extent. I   ve got lacks in that. My nieces and nephews, I do  cross-stitch things for them. Quilting, I never got. I tried and tried to  crochet, I couldn   t get it. Mama   s mother was left-handed so she told  me, she said,    I can teach you to crochet because I can sit across the  table from you and what I   m doing with my left hand you   ll be doing  with your right and you   ll catch it.    I didn   t. It just didn   t work for me.  A lot of that   yeah, liking to have things more personalized than just  buying in a store.  Well, were you involved with 4-H?  No, we weren   t. None of my sisters were. Straight School did not have  4-H, and I   m not even sure at Guymon at that point. I never did really  know about it. Now Mama was big into the extension club. She, for  years and years, she was in the extension club and they had a big  extension club out here.  Do you remember the name, what they were called?  The Willing Workers. The Willing Workers Extension Club. We   ve got  several pictures of all the ladies. I mean there were twenty, twenty-five  of them. When they went to their club day they dressed up to the hilt, big  time. I mean, the day before that they   d fix their hair and they   d get up  and wear their high heels and the whole bit. (Laughs) The women really  enjoyed getting together.  That   s something, really, that I miss now. Our communities used to be  much tighter as far as relationships with neighbors and the children and  the schools and everything. People would get together. We   d have box  suppers, we   d do fun things, just for no particular reason you   d just do it  and everybody would get together and have fun. Like the ladies group,  that they were so close. We don   t seem to have   I guess we   re too busy  now. They did everything   they did a lot more than we do. I mean, with  all the canning and the washing and ironing, and they didn   t have the  clothes you could hang up and let them dry and they looked good to put  on. They did it all.  Do you have any idea when electricity came to the farm, roughly?  I don   t   about electricity Jack, do you know anything about when they  may have got electricity out here?  No.  13  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  I don   t, I don   t have     Early 30   s, 40   s.  I   m guessing in the 30   s. I know my parents at Hough, they were renting  a little house and a lot became available to buy and Daddy bought it and  bought what they called a bungalow and moved in. That was in 1941, I  think it was. My oldest sister was three and my other sister was a year  old. Well a couple of years later someone moved in down there at the  house where they had first lived that had children and my oldest sister  went down there to play. She came home she said,    They   ve got the     that   s the neatest place to go,    and Mama said,    Why?    She said,     Because you don   t have to go in the house to use the bathroom.     (Laughs) They had the outhouse. Mama was so excited because they  didn   t have the outhouse anymore and Barbara thought that was a thing  that everybody needed. I   m thinking that Hough had electricity in the  late 30   s, so I don   t really know when they got electricity down here.  Well when they   d take their product to market was the closest place  Guymon?  Yes. Guymon was the closest. When Grandpa, when they first moved  here, he hauled all their water from the river that you went across when  you came out here from Guymon, but there   s no water in it. I   m not sure,  I think it was two or three years before they   or a couple of years before  they drilled a well. I know the well is in the   I think you can see the  well in the picture.  Did they have a windmill at that time, too?  The windmill, yes. He didn   t have to haul the water anymore.  And you were born in    47?  I was born in    47.  Right after the war. Did any of the members of the family have to go to  the war?  Daddy didn   t have to go to war because he was primarily involved in the  farming. At that point at least one son in every family would be exempt  if they were a family farm. Daddy did not serve.  And was the time in the 20   s the only time the farm was at risk of being  lost?  14  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  And up into the 30   s. It was after Daddy    in the 30   s   like    36,    37,  when the bank extended the note     Okay        because of his job with the oil company.  Well then fast forward a little bit in the 80   s when there were farm issues  all across Oklahoma. Was there a challenge in here?  We   ve had a lot of challenges. Our main challenge now is our irrigation  water is diminishing. We drilled a new well about a year and a half ago  and supposedly it was supposed to be a 500 gallon well. It   s maybe 100-  150 gallon well. We had to tie two irrigation wells together in order to  try and do the   we now have center pivots. We   ll run pretty good for  four or five days and then the water starts going down and you don   t  have much pressure. We   ve re-nozzled, gone through different pressure  nozzles and everything and it still doesn   t do good. We   re not sure if it is  the water level or if it was who drilled our well, because we had some  issues when the well was drilled, some of the procedures that he did.  There are a lot in this area that are starting to see a change in the water     And the drought hasn   t helped.     and the drought has not helped. The rain, so far, the last two or three  months has been wonderful. We are at this point, I think eleven point  one inches here at the farm. I   ve got calendars back for probably forty  years. My dad wrote down every day how much it rained on these little  calendars and I have continued that on, but we   ve got the whole box of  big calendars downstairs. (Laughs) I need to go back someday and pull  out some of the older ones and see. I think last year was actually worse  than any year that it   d ever been. We ended up the year less than, right  around ten inches for the year. This year we have had a little over eleven  inches at this point, which isn   t a lot, but it is compared to last year     And you primarily still do wheat?  Wheat and milo.  And how many acres do you farm?  Well we actually, of the original homestead, we have this half-section  here would be approximately three hundred acres of farming ground  when you take out the house, but then we have some other land that  we   ve purchased besides what was in the original farm. I think our total  acreage now is around seven hundred acres. A lot of that we   ve put into  15  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  CRP  Conservative Reserve Program  and some of it   s just pasture.  Some of it   s just for hay ground.  Do you no-till?  No, we didn   t transform over to the newer technologies because of our  age. In fact, we sold our 1983 combine last year actually to Panhandle  State University. They were tickled to death to have it because it had a  little bitty platform and they have these test plots and so they have the  little platform. (Laughs) It was getting to a point that if we had a  breakdown, in order to find parts for it it   d cost us about as much as to  hire someone to custom cut it.  Hmm, okay.  So no more   actually the farming acres we   re down to two hundred  acres that we actually farm. My sisters both inherited part of the land  from my father and they   ve leased it out then.  So since you and your husband have had it, has he worked off the farm  too or is his primary time spent on the farm?  No. His primary time   s spent on the farm. From 1983 to    88 or    89, I did  not work. Then H R Block, one of my friends that was down there, my  neighbor, and she talked me into coming to work for her. I worked then  at H R Block for nineteen years and then I   ve worked for CPA   s since  then, just tax season.  A little supplemental income.  Except this last year I think I only worked a total of three weeks.  (Laughter) I   m trying to get out of it.  Well has he had to have hired help to help him?  We haven   t had   no. Part-time like in the summers. One summer my  niece   s son, which would   ve been a fifth generation, he worked for us.  He lived in Amarillo and he stayed with us in Guymon, but he came and  worked for us I think. Tai was fifteen. Then we   ve had other boys that  helped in the summertime. We still have   I mean, if you look around  the place all this mowing, we had a couple of neighbor boys come over  and they helped us out. As far as the farming, farming, it   s mostly been  Jack and I.  And your daughter   s     16  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Yeah, she got to help some. What have you done over the years here?  All of it, at some point.  Yeah.  In the summers, not consistently. Just when there was one other thing  that needed done and something else needed done then I got stuck on the  tractor for the day (laughs)   and pipe. That was my     Yeah, moving pipe when we had all the flood irrigation. That was the  pits.  I started driving probably when I was eight or nine. I   d drive the pickup  when they picked up pipe and when I got big enough to pick up pipe we  switched off. I   d pick up pipe for a little bit, she   d pick up pipe for a  little bit and we   d switch off driving.  Yeah, we had pretty good workouts. You didn   t have to worry about  going to aerobics. (Laughs)  Because there were one, two, three, four, five, five different fields that  were flooded?  Four.  Oh four. Yeah.  Four fields of flood irrigation.  I   m not sure what that is. Do you want to explain a little bit?  Well you   instead of having a center pivot where a sprinkler goes  around   we   ve still got some pipe out here if you want to go look at it.  (Laughs) You had furrows that went straight down the field and you laid  pipe up across the top of it that had little gates that you opened. Every  day you had to open and close gates because your water would only fill  so many gates to flood. Not only laying out the pipe, but then  everyday    Jack really   oh, he did not like it. You had to go and bend  clear over to the ground to open and close these gates to let the water  out.  Manually open?  It was manual, yes, all manual.  17  Francis  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  And then keep record of it all. I mean every day you had to write down  what you watered and what you shut off and what you started on. Doing  a whole field  150 feet  at a time, that   s kind of how you watered a field  by flooding.  And they kept those records by hand?  Oh yes.  That was prior to computers.  You know I still keep a lot of records by hand. I do our books on  QuickBooks, but as far as like for insurance purposes, for the crop  insurance, you   re still are supposed to keep track how much you water,  when you put down fertilizer, what you put down, all of that. I just write  it down. If he turns on the sprinkler I write down    sprinkler on   , what  time of day, and then    sprinkler off   , what time of day. Then you can  figure out by the days it   s run and what the setting are how many inches  of water has been applied. I   m sure there   s probably programs I could go  in and do it all.  Has crop insurance been helpful through the years?  Yes and no. It has been   we had one crop year before last that we short  rated though. We ended up having to pay the full premium and we got  nothing out of it and it was a total loss. But yes we   ve, the last two years,  three years, really, crop insurance   the government programs, the  disaster programs, they had   three years ago. I don   t know if there   ll be  any going on; I think that only paid up to the year 2011 maybe. I don   t  know if there   ll be any assistance for    12 and    13 or not. My assumption  was that    12 and    13 were under the old farm bill, so there still may be  some government assistance coming in on those two years.  There was very little harvesting done in this area up until this year. We  didn   t harvest wheat crop this year because of the freeze. They assessed  our circle, irrigated circle, at one point four bushel so we didn   t harvest.  We had some neighbors that did good on the wheat this year and that  was about the first good crop they   d had in three or four years. So  hopefully things are turning around going the right direction.  You kind of have to plan ahead based on what   s happened.  Well what   s hard is knowing with the changes in the last two or three  years, especially with the government programs, we don   t have a clue  really what might be out there. Except under the CRP, if we have  anything in CRP  Conservation Reservation Program  we know for how  18  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  many years that   s locked in. As far as any of these other government  programs helping out with the crops, you don   t have anything. Which  ten years ago when you went in and figured out your estimate for the  next year, like you always got to give to the bank, you knew in October  we   re going to get X number of dollars and in March we   re going to get  X number of dollars. You knew it, because that was with the FSA papers  we had signed. Now you have no idea.  How do you keep up with all the different government programs?  Honestly, we don   t. You think you understand it they   and since this  new one has been implemented we have had no meetings, public  meetings, to explain them. Used to be every time there was a change  you   d get a letter,    We   re going to have a meeting such and such night  and we   ll explain it.    Evidently FSA  Farm Service Agency  is not  paying for them to do that anymore. You don   t receive anything in the  mail anymore. You get it on Internet and for us at this point that   s okay.  Something happens to me, my husband doesn   t even know how to turn  on a computer and he   s not going to learn. Honestly, probably 90  percent of the farmers in this area are that way. They   re trying to cut  back money here and there, but at the same time you don   t know. You  go into the offices and we have some very patient people at our office  about trying to explain. They really don   t know   can   t answer a lot of  the questions people have. It   s all pretty well up in the air.  Are most of your neighbors your similar age, similar age as you?  I think we   re the oldest ones in the community at this point. Half a mile  south, the neighbor down there, he grew up there. Carol   s, I think, five  years younger than I am. I   ve got pictures of us playing in the yard when  we were little kids. Yeah, we   re the oldest. Two miles west, the family  that   s there, the oldest one I think   s about five years younger than I am.  Those are the only two that are still in their parent   s home. Where they  would   ve homestead.  Right.  Everybody else has sold out.  Yeah everybody else around it   s all new families that have come in. A  lot of the places have sold two or three times. The house about a mile  and a half east here that you came by, the two-story house, that house  sold out of that family about six years ago I believe it was. Was Misty  out here before we moved out here or after?  19  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Right at the same time.  It   s been about six years   that was the Dixon family. In fact, the lady  that lived there, she delivered my father. She was kind of the nurse for  the whole community. (Laughs) That home hasn   t sold several times,  just the one time.  So what   s kept you here?  What   s kept us here? Well I guess the opportunity we had to go in   my  husband, when we married, he was a cowboy. He wasn   t ever going to  get on a tractor. (Laughs) He worked in feed yards. In fact he was  manager of a feed yard for a while. Daddy approached him about  coming to work for him and he wasn   t sure about it. For a while, when  he was working with Daddy in the winter, he did some cowboy work  still   checking cattle for people and pastures and stuff. He kind of got  away from it and got into farming. It never was his favorite thing but it  was something that he felt like was going to make a living for his family.  At this point, if the situation would   ve been what it is now with farming,  I don   t think we would   ve done it.  Well, what do you see for the next 100 years?  I don   t know. What do you see for the next 100 years Jackie? (Laughs)  That   s their decision to make, not mine.  Okay, but when it becomes your decision to make what decision are you  going to make? (Laughter)  I don   t know. That   s their decision to make.  Well, you   re going to live to 102, so you   ve got time   (Laughs) Yes  You know, that   s one thing though. You think about all  the things that we need to do out here and would like to do out here.  Then you get our age, do you really go ahead and put forty or fifty  thousand dollars in a place when you might not be here but another ten  years? Or what do you do? (Laughs)  Tough decisions, yes.  Anyway, I definitely would love to see this stay in the family some way.  I don   t know if that   s something that Jackie   s going to be able to do or  want to do. I   ve got a cousin that has children and grandchildren that  some of them might, at some point, come in, too.  20  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  So you only have the one child?  Yes.  Okay.  And the one grandchild.  Sorry to put you on the spot   That   s alright. (Laughter)  I think she   s got lots of good memories from out here though, when she  was youngster too.  Well, what   s your favorite memory of the farm as a child and now?  Oh my, my dad and I were so close. Daddy   the doctor had always,  before I was born, told him yeah he was sure this one was going to be a  boy and it wasn   t. So Daddy always raised me as his son. (Laughs) I   m  not saying my sisters didn   t help, but they didn   t seem to really have the  desire to be out working with him that I did. I just   all the time spent  with him. I was four years old and he had me driving the pickup while  he was putting wire up on the fencepost. It was right north of the house  here, he   d had the post in the ground, he   d laid out the wire, and all he  had to do was put it up and hook it on. He put me in the pickup and it  had this gear you could put it in and it would go on its own     Compound.  Compound  He put it in compound and told me to go to the other end.  He got way ahead of me and so I got   I couldn   t reach the foot pedal so  I get down on the floor and push on the foot pedal. I went through his  fence. He brought me to the house and was going to spank me and  Mama said,    Well, what do you expect giving a four year old to drive.     (Laughter) I say he was going to spank me. One time too I remember,  I   ll never forget this, Mama was really mad at me and Daddy said,     Well, I   ll spank her,    because he thought if she spanked me then she   d  probably spank me too hard. He took me into the back of the bedroom.  He told me to lay down on the bed and I was scared to death because  Daddy had never spanked me. He said,    Now I   m going to hit this bed  and you   re going to holler,    and he hit the bed and I hollered and we  went back out and that was my spanking. (Laughter) Mama, the times  with her just in the kitchen and it was just all precious time.  21  Finchum  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Francis  What was a favorite thing she cooked for you?  Hmm     Cherry cheesecake.  What?  Cherry cheesecake   Cherry cheesecake, yeah she was really good at that.  And fried chicken.  Fried chicken, she could fry chicken. I never got   never did get it down  like she could. Her mother was an excellent cook and Grandma Baker  never had a recipe. There is not one written recipe of Grandma   s. You  just put a little bit of this and a little bit of that and a dab of this and she  could bake cakes or make perfect pie crusts and breads and everything.  She never used a recipe.  Most of everybody else in the family, for Grandma, was Turk or Italian.  What was it, the Italian cake   what is it? Has coconut in it.  Yeah, I don   t remember what it was called.  Just a   that you get at the store, but all of the family loved that. I   m not  a coconut fan, so the cherry cheesecake was my favorite.  My sister   s and I are wanting to put together a cookbook with Mama   s  recipes. It   s going to get done someday and then maybe some stories in  it too, some pictures of Daddy, of Mom and Daddy together.  Well what were holidays like on the farm back in the earlier days?  Well we always had a live Christmas tree and the house smelled really  good, because of that. (Laughs) Lots of baking, lots of family     Baking.  Baking. Lots of family     By the time everybody had the kids, most holidays, every other year, it  was either Thanksgiving or Christmas, but everybody came and  everybody came.  22  Finchum  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  Here?  Yes.  All three daughters, with all of their children, with all of their children  are required to be here. So     Had a lot        it was   this table, sometimes the table in there, all these tables in that  room. We went all through the house depending. And by that point there  were, even when I was in high school, there were at least five great-grandkids  by that point.  So you have twenty-something to thirty people, yeah.  It was every other year, it was either Thanksgiving or Christmas. It  wasn   t necessarily here to open presents, but just here for a meal right  around one of those two days. Thanksgiving you typically have it on  Thanksgiving day and Christmas   if it wasn   t Christmas day, which  usually it was Christmas day at noon, it was the day after.  Christmas Eve we   d always have to read the Christmas story from the  bible. Daddy   they were both real strong in the church. When the Yula  church disbanded, over at Straight they were putting in a gas plant. It  was city service gas plant. School was built there and they had actually  determined they were going to disband the church and there was a  revival going on in Guymon. The man said something to Daddy about  how   s your little church going and Daddy told him what the situation  was. He said,    I   ve heard that they   re building a gas plant out there at  Straight, why don   t you go over there and build a church?    Well, the  same year they built this house in    51 they built the church over there. In  fact, it was before Grandpa died, because he   s one of the charter  members and we have a picture of him digging ground at the church,     51. We still attend there, but the Straight camp has closed down  because everything   s gone electronic. Now they don   t have the big gas  plants they used to have.  At one point in our church we had   it was Christian Church, but we had  every demonization there because of the camp and especially in the  youth department. There would be fifteen to twenty high school and that  many in the junior high and then the grades. The church was full. Now  we have an attendance of twelve to twenty people.  Total?  23  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Yes. Some of the people have said we just need to shut it down, but you  get to that point and then we have a large family come in that had had  some tragedies hit. They might not be there, but every two or three  weeks, but we   re needed. They don   t feel comfortable other places. They  feel comfortable there. They   re being served, but Mom and Daddy were  both big on working in the church. Daddy served on the school board for  I don   t know how many years, too, at Straight. He was very instrumental  in that school.  About how far is that from here?  About seven and a half miles. Daddy did   he attended one semester at  Oklahoma Panhandle State University. That wasn   t what it was called  then, but that   s where he went one semester     It was PU then. There   s a flag still here somewhere. It was PU.  Yes. Panhandle University.  PU Aggies. I can remember. He had a pennant     Yeah        forever. I can remember reading that.  Yes. Anyway, my oldest sister didn   t attend college. My next sister, she  did, she attended Phillips University at Enid and became a teacher. I was  in school over at Panhandle State a year and a half and I was working for  an accounting firm. My employer was actually a professor at the college.  He was the accounting professor at the college. Second semester he  called me into his office, I was just working part-time.    Can you please  just go to work full-time,    because the lady that had been doing the  keypunch, and I don   t know if you know what a keypunch is, keypunch,  all that. She had some medical problems and was going to have to quit.     You   re going to learn everything here that you   re going to learn over  there,    and he talked me into quitting. He was supposed to sign me out  over at the college. Well, I went and signed up for a class several years  later and I had all of these dropout things on my record. (Laughs)  Anyway, I just had a year and a half of college. Jackie did complete  college. She went to Clarendon for junior college and then she went to  OSU. What was your degree in? Ag communication.  Still farm related then.  Yes. My middle sister   I think all of her children graduated from  college. She had three and   well two. Two direct and one     24  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Two direct and one adopted.     step-child. My oldest sister, none of hers graduated from college I  don   t believe.  Some of them went, I don   t if they     Yes, I think they went, but I don   t believe any of them graduated.  Education, from Grandpa on down, was important. Grandpa wanted his  children   all three of my father   s sisters ended up being teachers.  Flossie, the one that lived to be 102, was a teacher and in 1935 she had a  child, Frankie, and he had water on the brain where the head gets real  big. By the time Frankie was five he had to be in a wheelchair because  he couldn   t balance to walk. They told them he might live to be ten years  old. It got to a point   well Aunt Flossie had had to quit teaching so she  basically homeschooled Frankie at home. He was very intelligent. He  lived to be fifty years old. He had ended up having to have both legs  amputated. She cared for him, never complained, nothing. After he  passed away, then she was able to get out and go associate. Now she and  my father in 1995 was parade marshal at Guymon, honored as parade  marshal. What year was that   Flossie was the queen, was the Pioneer  Day Queen. The year she was 100   no ninety-nine, the year she was  ninety-nine. That would   ve been in 19     It was after you moved out here, that   s all I remember.  I mean twenty   she was ninety-nine. She was born in    09. In 2008   is  that right?  Something like that, somewhere close to there.  Anyway, she was the queen. You know, I told her, I said,    God just  blessed you with all of this because of all the years that you spent with  Frankie, never a complaint, never poor me.    She raised other children,  had a good family, and they never had much at all, but they never were  in any way saying    poor me    or anything like that. We   ve had a lot of  really   been blessed with a lot of really special people in our family.  You can put it that way.  Sounds like it. Well describe a typical day for us, a typical day on the  farm today.  Today?  Yes. Not with us here, but if we weren   t here what would you be doing?  25  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Francis  It just depends on the day. Basically, what we   ve typically been doing,  since we   ve moved here in 2007, is to try and refurbish a lot of things  that have gone down. Go through and sort out things, we still have  closets full and barns full of stuff that   and boxes that we don   t have a  clue what   s in them. (Laughs) Some days you get up and you hit that,  some days we   re out working in the fields, and some days we   re off to  town. That   s the bad thing   when Jack and I lived in town we were only  two blocks from the grocery store, and I   ve got all kinds of groceries  downstairs and I can go to make something and I   m out of one thing.  (Laughs) I   m not as organized as my mother was, let me put it that way.  They made weekly trips to town on Friday. That was their weekly trip to  town.  Yes. Mama would get her hair fixed and they   d go to the grocery store,  and they   d do     There might be a part or something they   d have to go get another day,  but that wasn   t   you didn   t go run around town, you went to town and  then you got a part and then you came back here. Or one of them stayed  here and one of them went to town. There wasn   t just   go to town.  Now we got to town too often probably. (Laughs)  I give her   I tease her often       I thought you were only supposed to  make that trip weekly.    (Laughter) It   s not   it   s ten miles, but that was  just, they went on Friday. That was town day.  Mama was much more scheduled than I am. On Monday she did  laundry, on Tuesday she ironed, on Wednesday she usually cooked, on  Thursday she cleaned house, on Friday they went to town, and then  Saturday and Sunday was their free time. Sunday was church. That   s the  way you did it every week. I don   t do that. (Laughs)  How would she do her laundry?  Well we had a washer     Had a washer by that time.  She had a dryer she hardly ever used. In the winter time she used it,  mostly she hung her clothes out.  I can remember hanging clothes.  26  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  Yes.  She still did that.  Yes. I   ve convinced my husband, we still have one line up on our  clothesline, but there   s a lot of things that I really like to hang out. He  doesn   t like to mow under the line. (Laughs)  Well what does he do on a typical day?  Feeds horses, and goes through junk out in the barn. (Laughs)  He still has wells.  Yes, we   ve got wells to tend to and decisions to make on crops that are  failing or whatever. (Laughs)  Are most of the fences new or old?  No. What fences are out here we   ve got leased off pasture and so they  just put those up. There   s not   actually there   s nothing here other than  that mulberry tree, from the past. We tore down a chicken house that had  been built in the 40   s, about a year and a half ago. It was just ready to  fall down. That was hard. I was glad the day that it did come down we  were gone. We had a neighbor man that said he   d take it down and haul  it off. It would   ve been hard to see it being torn down. It was dangerous.  The roof rotted, there wasn   t any way to go in and fix it.  So when you and your husband took over the farm, did you add any  buildings?  No, now the red horse barn out here Daddy and Jack built that     I thought it was in    79.  Yes, about    79 I believe. He and Daddy built that. Now we   ve had  it   just siding put on it this   couple of months ago because the wood  was rotting out, a lot of it. They built that and Daddy wanted Jack to  have a place to put his horses if he needed to and so we built it and  didn   t have a horse out there for a long time. (Laughs)  I had them out here for a while and then other places. Now they   re back.  Yes.  What about the Quonset?  27  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  The what?  The Quonset.  That was built before the house. That was built in the 50   s, I believe the  date   s on it out there in the cement. It   s got the date I believe, but it was  in the 50   s they built the Quonset.  What was    51? There would   ve been    51 and then    54.  No, this is    51. We   ve moved in in December    51.  So then it has to be the 40   s wouldn   t it?  No, I think it was    50. I know my uncle, my dad   s oldest sister Ruth, her  husband, Melvin Short, came to help build. Uncle Melvin slept there  most of the time when the weather was nice because he didn   t want to  intrude on the family. We lived at Hough and Grandpa was having   not  having good nights and everything. So, Uncle Melvin would sleep out in  the barn. (Laughs)  Was there a particular reason they built the metal one versus a wood  one?  Probably because of the longevity. He was very smart and put metal  beams in it, where some of the neighbors around actually had wood  curved beams. Those are the barns that you   re seeing that   s doing this.  We   ve had very good luck. We had to replace the sliders on the doors  and that   s the   really the only thing we   ve replaced in that. Maybe the  skylights, I don   t remember. Some of them     Been along   Not a continuous thing.  I mean it   s   Jack would love to have the overheard doors that you  know, electric that push and it opens up. Then if you get anything too  tall you can   t get them in there. We haven   t gone to that. Daddy  built   he didn   t have this house built. He built this house. That room in  there they built on after     I guess 1983.  In 1983? Yes,    83 when they built that room on, but the rest, this floor, I  don   t know if you   ll notice the way it   s laid. My dad laid this floor. That  was one thing when we moved out here, Mama had carpeted over this  and I wanted to see this floor again.  28  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  I would have too.  It was neat.  And he taught himself as far as you know?  Yes. Daddy sang beautifully. One of Daddy   s favorite songs was A  Carpenter   s Son was Jesus. He always wanted to follow that line. Not  only being a follower of Christ, but live the lifestyle so he liked the  woodwork.  He never attributed to, but a lot of it they talk about. That room was built  with a lot of wood that came out of an old barn that my great-grandfather  had brought the wood from Tennessee, Missouri, wherever  he was at the time. They talked about the quality of wood that was used  for the foundation of that room and it was in that barn. I think some of  his love of it probably came from his father.  Yes.  Then he learned how to build what he could out of it.  Well, and Grandpa being in the lumber business and everything. He  taught him what to look for so he knew. They did a pretty amazing job  on this   I mean they had help. He had a guy that came in and helped lay  the brick and help do this or help do that. Daddy basically   him and  Uncle Melvin basically did it.  They were the contractors. (Laughter)  Yes, designed it. The kitchen mostly is all the same. They did add   put  up the brick on that north wall several years after we were here. A lot of  the wallpaper   it   s been here forever. The ceilings in there, I keep being  told that   s out of date but   . (Laughter)  But it   s home.  It   s home.  Where did this table come from?  This was Grandpa   this is 1922. This was out at Grandpa   s. When they  bought the house he bought this table.  In 1922.  29  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  In 1922. We did put rollers on it.  Do you want to tell us a little bit about the piano you were telling us  earlier?  Well the piano also is 1922.  Where is it?  Huh?  Where is it now?  Down in the basement. I took them down and showed it to them. You  know, I say that, but no they had that piano in the dugout because Aunt  Flossie, the song that I started playing, I had a book that was one of her  piano books and she got a gold star on that. The name of it is Melody of  Love. That was written the year that she was born. That was written in   1909 , I believe it was, Melody of Love. They had that piano in the  dugout, so I   m not sure what year it was.  But the piano never leaves the house because you can   t get it out.  The wall   Daddy put the piano downstairs   I didn   t show you the deep  freeze  We have a 1951 deep freeze down there that we   re still using.  (Laughs) He put both of those down before he built the wall across the   upstairs  utility room, which is at the top of the steps.  No way to get it out.  I guess if the freezer goes out I   ve got a good blanket box. (Laughter)  The piano, I don   t know what we   ll do. I guess if we ever for any reason  have to leave here we   ll take the wall out of the utility room.  Is everyone buried at the same cemetery?  My grandparents and my parents, yes. They   re at Guymon, at the  Elmhurst Cemetery.  They   re not in the same     Not in the same     Well tell them about Grandpa and Grandma   s plot. Why Grandpa   why  my grandpa and grandma are in that plot with all the babies.  30  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Francis  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Well, they had lost the two sons, babies that they had buried. Then they  have their   Grandpa and Grandma Heard   s is there. There   s another  grave in there, we don   t know where it is, but a neighbor child had died  and family didn   t have any place so because of that there wasn   t room  for Mom and Daddy   s to be in that. I had a son that had passed away and  when we bought his place we bought for us. Well, Mom and Daddy  bought next to us. We   re kind of on the south side of the cemetery.  Grandpa and Grandma   s on the north.  That was just something that Grandma would always talk about is the  babies. That   s just how she always referred to it.    Have to put flowers  out for the babies    and have to      There   s not room for us because the  babies are in there.     Babies are in there.  It was always just kind of   they always remembered that there were  other babies in that area of the cemetery.  Then there   s others over there that we don   t have and   there   s a  possibly Bernie and a possibly somebody else. They put flowers on  those.  On Memorial Day or just     Nobody knew who they were, but they needed to be remembered so we  always put flowers. We put, last year, we decorate at Hooker where my  mother   s parents and family are, and at Guymon, and then my husband   s  got two cemeteries with family in them down by Durham, Oklahoma. I  think it was forty-two graves last year that we decorated. That takes a  while.  That   s something that this current generation doesn   t do too much of.  Well I don   t know. Guymon and Hooker cemeteries always end up  looking pretty nice   well the ones at Durham do too. It takes a while.  We kind of cheat and go back and pick up a lot of flowers and reuse  them the next year. (Laughs)  But forty-two, that   s     But with that many it takes a while. That was something that my parents  were really adamant about and didn   t want it lost. We   re the only one of  the really close family that   s still here that does anything like that. Just  something we do. I don   t know.  31  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  I think a lot of Daddy   s courage and ours too has come down from  Grandpa and his   I can   t imagine being forty-one years old and moving  to a whole different place and going into a whole new occupation and  not knowing what was going to happen. He had a lot of trust in God and  he was just willing to pour his life into whatever he needed to do to  make things happen. Daddy was always that way. He just   it   s just  something he passed on that   it doesn   t matter what your circumstances  are, you   re going to get through it and it   s going to be better. Just  blessed to have that legacy, I am. Can you think of anything else?  That   s a very good note to end on if there   s nothing else.  I don   t know. I feel blessed when so many people don   t seem to know  anything. We haven   t really gotten into the genealogy, genealogy part of  it real heavy. We are having a Heard reunion in September in Arkansas.  Some of my cousins   or second and third cousins have done a lot of the  genealogy search. We do know   when Grandpa came out here, some of  the Heards cut him off pretty much, because he was leaving. It was  several years before then they kind of reunited on any relationships. I  guess one of his brothers was really mad because they thought he was  leaving their mom and dad so he didn   t have to take care of them. He  didn   t have to help with them. It took a while to get past that type of  stuff, but Grandpa, he stuck with it. My grandmother was a Reed. She  had a brother named Sam Reed. Sam Reed was an engineer for Casey  Jones. Got some pictures of Sam with a train and I   m not sure, Casey  Jones may be in the picture, I don   t know. We haven   t researched a lot  of that old genealogy either.  But you know your roots here though.  Yes.  I think you said when we first got here that you got married in this  house?  Yes. Jack and I got married in the living room, in front of the fireplace,  in 1970.  A lot of good memories.  Never thought about us really moving out here when that happened.  That   s what we did. It   s been   it   s fun, I dug out all this stuff and not  knowing what you would want and everything. Then going back through  it reminds you   I really probably ought to pick up the hobby of  scrapbooking so I can figure out how to put it all together in a book  32  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  Finchum  Boyd  (laughs) instead of having it marked like this.  You have some very nice things, especially the diary.  Yes. Well, my cousin sent a thing, too. She had another   they had  sorted out Grandma   s diaries years ago. She   d written down everything  that Grandpa was doing in the fields. I mean like, it was snowing and he  was out with his horses and he was plowing even though it was snowing  because he needed to get the ground ready. It was just neat.  Perseverance.  Yes.  Alright then, we will close out and thank you very much for sharing.  Thank you.  It   s been a pleasure.  Thank you.  -------  -------
