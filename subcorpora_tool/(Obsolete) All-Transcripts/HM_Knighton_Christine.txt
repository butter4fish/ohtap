Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight questions we always ask, because they're some sort of a warm up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: First one is:  Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  I have a favorite food.  My favorite food is sweet potatoes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color.  Red, purple--not really a favorite color.  I like colors, all colors.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year is fall.  You know, just like it because of the change of--change of seasons, right, and it kind of lets you know that winter's coming, right, and a good transition from summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I love to travel.  Most recently, Hawaii last year.  So a great location for just a family vacation is Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is:  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: One of my favorite sayings, among many, is "I can do all things through Christ which strengthened me."  And that has gotten me through life and throughout my career.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34439
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family separate from your father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then I'll ask about your father's side, then we'll try to put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother's full name is Annie Lee Knighton, A-N-N-I-E, L-E-E, K-N-I-G-H-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is November--I'm sorry.  Her date of birth is February 23rd, 1940.  And her place of birth was Cuthbert, C-U-T-H-B-E-R-T, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side, and do you know what they were doing?
Speaker 2: Right.  I can trace it as far back as my mother's parents, which were my grandparents, of course, which I did know both my grandmother [Mamie Ward Knighton] and my grandfather [Sidney Knighton].  And they were sharecroppers in Georgia, right, in the town, where in the place where I was born in, Benevolence, Georgia.  And I was actually born in their home, right, in Benevolence.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34440
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind the name of Benevolence [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Benevolence is--means "quiet," it means "peaceful," and it means "harmony."  And that is very indicative for the place where I was born, very, very small; very quiet, very quaint, right.  And not many people there right now, but the church that we attended when I was growing up is still there, right.  And most people have moved away, right, so it's very small.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about the racial makeup of the population?  Is it mostly black?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  During the time when I was born and when my mother [Annie Lee Knighton] was growing up, it was a very mixed population, right, probably equally balanced between whites and blacks.  Now, I would say it's majority black, right, those people that couldn't afford to move away or move anywhere else are still residing there.  And most of the whites have moved to larger towns or moved away altogether.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But there's not a story about why they named it Benevolence?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, right, not to my knowledge.  But, right, we've always just embraced the term and embraced the name, and it always feels good to say you're from Benevolence.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, then you say the town kind of exemplifies the name?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Right.  Yeah.  I think it was growing up, mostly--like I said, my grandfather [Sidney Knighton] and grandmother [Mamie Ward Knighton] were sharecroppers, and most of the whites that were there were farmers as well.  And I think with the decline of the farming industry within itself results in the decrease in the population that's there today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 34441
Speaker 1: Now, well, can you tell us your [maternal] grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My grandfather was Sidney Knighton.  That's S-I-D-N-E-Y, last name, Knighton, same as mine, K-N-I-G-H-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was Mamie, M-A-M-I-E, Ward, W-A-R-D, was her maiden name, and of course, last name, Knighton.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--so they were sharecroppers.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--now, did they have a chance to go to school or finish school?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was educated, meaning that she completed fourth grade.  Right, exactly.  So my grandmother could read and could write.  My grandfather, on the other hand, right, spent most of his life on a farm and wasn't afforded the opportunity to go to school, so he was not able to read or write, but he was a very bright and very intelligent man and a business man, as well as a sharecropper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, are there any stories on that side of the family from your grandmother or grandfather about, you know, what happened to your ancestors, about--stories about Emancipation or Reconstruction or [American] Civil War; any of those kind of stories passed down on that side?
Speaker 2: Right.  There were stories of mostly about family members and how we were connected as a family.  So both the Wards and the Knighton side.  And I can remember growing up as a young girl always sitting at my grandmother or grandfather's feet to hear stories about--about, you know, our family and about our ancestors; who they were, where they came from.  My grandmother was a lot open--more open about the past than my grandfather was, I think.  My grandfather's history and his memory of things were not as fond as my grandmother's, so he wasn't as open to sharing.  And I think that intentionally they sheltered us from some of the history, from some of the things that they didn't want us to know about, or they didn't care to carry the past on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  Some things that I've learned about, you know, later in life, right, and wondered why they didn't tell us about it.  Right.  Exactly.  For instance, you know, lynchings in the town square in Cuthbert, which is where my mother was born and which is what I refer to as my hometown now; and the way that they were treated, and a lot of segregation.  That took place during the time that they were residing in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Think they were just trying to shield you from those horrible kinds of things.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  I think that happened a lot in a lot of African American families.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34442
Speaker 1: So, now, did your mother [Annie Lee Knighton] talk about what it was like when she grew up [in Benevolence, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  She--my mother was educated, right.  She did go to high school.  She didn't complete high school, but she finished eleventh grade, and then I came along, right, a little unanticipated.  Right.  So--but, yes.  She would talk about what it was like growing up.  She'd talked about what it was like working on the farm, and she definitely wanted to get a college education--a college education, but again, like I said, wasn't afforded that opportunity.  She talked about going to school and she really enjoyed going to school and participating in school activities.  She was on the high school basketball team, and she also talked about the alternative to going to school, which was to work on a farm, right, which my uncles all did and participated in, but the girls were more afforded the opportunity to go to school more than the boys.
Speaker 1: The boys were needed for farm labor.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  The boys were more needed for farm labors and the girls were allowed to get an education.  I think that results in why my uncles all migrated away from Georgia and away from the farm.  Most of the boys migrated to Chicago [Illinois], and eventually, the majority of the girls migrated to the New York area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, do you know the name of the school your mother attended?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  It was Benevolence--it was Benevolence--I don't recall whether they called it Benevolence Elementary School or--I think it was referred to as training school.  Benevolence Training School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  So it was in the small town of Benevolence, and, of course, it was a segregated school where blacks went to that school and the majority of the students for all the way from first grade through the twelfth grade, pretty much, in the same building.  Yeah.  And I believe later she would go to school in Cuthbert [Georgia], right, to--at Cuthbert Training School, right, a little bit later when they closed the school in Benevolence, just due to the--by sheer--of population, and the ability to staff the school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She was in school in the days when they were supposed to be "separate but equal?"
Speaker 2: I guess they called it that.  Right.  Exactly.  I had also had that experience too--in the schools that I attended, in elementary school, were separate but equal, so, until I was in seventh grade.  And seventh grade was when those schools were finally integrated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And training seems to be like a code for the black, you know, colored school.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: Training school.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  I think it was more acceptable in the South, right, among--to a majority when you call it a training school, yeah, that they were actually getting an intellectual-type education.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, let me go on to your--so later, your mother--did she--you said she went back to school at some point?
Speaker 2: She stayed in school through eleventh grade--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and she did not go back to school after eleventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: Mostly worked in the factories, right, that were in around the Cuthbert area.  And she worked with my [maternal] grandparents [Mamie Ward Knighton and Sidney Knighton] for a very long time on a smaller farm when my grandfather moved from--away from sharecropping into having his own farm, so, right, own farm with, you know, fruits and vegetables, right, and mostly peanuts as far as the industry-type farming activity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34443
Speaker 1: Well, let me go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father's full name is Clarence, C-L-A-R-E-N-C-E, last name, Brown, B-R-O-W-N, and he is Clarence Brown, Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's a very good question.  Exactly.  His place of birth is Lumpkin, L-U-M-P-K-I-N, Georgia, right, and I believe my father now is seventy-five [years old], right.  And so, however that dates back, he was born in April.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So 1938, I think.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Right.  Yeah.  That sounds about right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So a little older than your mother [Annie Lee Knighton].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Couple of years.  Now, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: I know a little bit less about the ancestors on my father's side than I do on my mother's side, but I've learned more, you know, just from conversations that we've had in recent years.  I did know both my grandparents on my father's side as well and had an opportunity, you know, to spend some time with them when they were both alive.  But my grandfather was a carpenter as well as a farmer, right, and very well-respected in Lumpkin, Stewart County, Georgia areas.  So he was a farm man, owned his own farmland, right.  So I don't think he did any sharecropping to my knowledge, right, but--and they had, you know, lots of boys in the family, too, so they had the boys to sustain the farm.  So they were both farmers.  I think eventually when my grandfather built his own home in the town of Lumpkin, right, based on his carpenter skill, I think he got more into carpentry than he was into farming.  Yeah, so I think if you kind of look at it on, right, on a scale status during that era for Africa Americans, I think my father's family was probably more affluent because they were landowners--large--of large land and property and that my grandfather actually had a skill that he could use to generate income for his family, which were his carpenter skills.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So he was better off--better situated, I guess.  So what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Charlie Brown, C-H-A-R-L-I-E, last name, Brown, just like the Charlie Brown (laughs), yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Like the song and the comic strip character.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Right.
Speaker 1: Charlie Brown.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Lot of famous Charlie Browns around.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: We interviewed a couple.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  One played as a basketball player in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: So, and your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was Blanchie, B-L-A-N-C-H-I-E, right, Jones, J-O-N-E-S, Brown.  And I did get to know my [maternal] great-grandparents that were my grandmother's parents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So, right, when I was going to elementary school, right, in Lumpkin, they lived very close to the elementary school.  So between the time that the bus would pick us up to take us on the routes home, right, I would usually go over to my--and visit with my great-grandparents.
Speaker 1: And what were your great-grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: Will Jones.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, was my great-grandfather's name, and Mahalia Jones, yeah, was my great-grandmother's name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's only the second time I've heard the name Mahalia.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: Of course, you know, the great Mahalia Jackson.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: But your great-grandmother would have been around the same age, right, as Mahalia Jackson?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: Or a lot older.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Maybe a bit--maybe a little bit older, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So is there any connection at all between (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Not to my knowledge, yeah.  There may have been, but not to my knowledge.
Speaker 1: I don't know if it comes from the Bible or what.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I just don't know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 34444
Speaker 1: Were there any stories on that side [Knighton's paternal side] of the family that were passed down about what life was like in that area, you know, going back to, you know, the mid-1800s there?
Speaker 2: Other than the union of two families.  Right.  Exactly.  So--and it was actually a union, right, of a family with the same last name as my mother's [Annie Lee Knighton] and my grandparents of Knightons [maternal] and Browns [paternal], right.  So--but it was a different set of Knightons, right, than from my [maternal] grandfather's [Sidney Knighton] side.  But I think there may have been some connections as far as distant--distant relationships, right.  So we talked about, you know, how the Knighton and Brown family merged on that side before.  And recently, and I say recently, like within the last four or five years, right, there is a person from Benevolence [Georgia] who was researching his family history and thought that there may be some connection between the Knightons and his family.  Right.  Exactly.  And this person happens to be a white person from the area of Benevolence.  But we think that the connection is more to the Knightons that were on my father's [Clarence Brown, Sr.] side than the Knightons that were on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there's a story on your father's side that there was a--that the Browns at one time had Knightons in the family that were created by a union of Browns and Knightons back then?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  Back in the day which would have been my--which would have been my great-great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: And the white Knightons, if not biologically connected, the name might be connected to their family name during the slavery time.
Speaker 2: Right.  To the family name.  Right.  Family name--I had an aunt who was my father's aunt, from this marriage, right, not blood aunt, but from the merging of the Knightons, whose--her mother's name was Knighton.  And you know, I would ask her about--she just passed away last year at the age of ninety-nine, right, so she would recall that, you know, that there would be some whites that would come around, right.  And she remembered asking her father, you know, "Well, who's this person that always comes around?  Who's this white man that always comes around?"  And said that her father said, you know, "That's my brother."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So somebody in the family believe they--you are related to the --
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --white Knightons.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Yeah.  And the person that's doing the research now has done this research, recently has provided documentation that show that there was a connection between a slave owner and a slave, and there lies the name Knighton.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is so pervasive.  It's amazing to me that people--that we don't know--you know, in my family it's the same thing.  We got--there are white Crowes in Kentucky--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --same (unclear) town.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And nobody makes the connection--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: But it seems like it would--(unclear) say, this is more than obvious that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --something going on here.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, but--and it goes back maybe a couple of generations, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, maybe three or four generations, but it's some kind of connection.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Especially in a small area.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) so many names.  So, interesting, so--.
Story_ID: 34445
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father [Clarence Brown, Sr.].  Now, what his growing up like and what did he do?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My father went to--had some high school, right, but didn't graduate from high school, of course, right, because my grandfather [Charlie Brown] was a farmer.  He was needed on the farm like most of his brothers were and later migrated North to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] area and the Newark, New Jersey area, right.  So that's where most of the Brown brothers landed.  And the sisters landed in Massachusetts, in Springfield, Massachusetts.  So I think, you know, during that day, right, you saw factory work in the North or opportunities in the North, and they all started out working for the automobile industry, right, and that's how they ended up in the Philadelphia and New Jersey areas.  Right.  So my father is--still owns his own business, now; owns his own business now in the--right outside of Newark in Vauxhall, New Jersey, right, where he has a towing company.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's in Vauxhall, New Jersey.
Speaker 2: Right.  V-A-U-X--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and Hall, H-A-L-L.
Story_ID: 34446
Speaker 1: Now, here's the crucial question now.  Is there a story about how your parents [Annie Lee Knighton and Clarence Brown, Sr.] met and what happened when they met?
Speaker 2: Right.  I think they met when they were high school students [in Georgia].  Right.  Exactly.  Just to--right, for to--whatever means that high school students (laughs) met during that time, you know, without telephones (laughs) or anything.  But, like, my father's family had cars, right; whereas my mother's parents [Sidney Knighton and Mamie Ward Knighton] didn't.  So, of course, the boys were able to get out and probably date a little bit more than it would have been on my mother's side of the family.  So--
Speaker 1: Well, did your dad have a car?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So my dad had a car.  Right.  I think that was part of what you did back in that time, is that you worked hard, you made money, and the way that you were able to show that you had money was by virtue of owning an automobile.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your dad had a car, and your parents met in high school.  So, as you were saying, this was not a planned union.  I mean, they didn't get married or anything?
Speaker 2: Right.  They were both teenagers at the time.  My mom was seventeen [years old], of course, and my dad was, like, nineteen.  So, right, so, an unexpected pregnancy resulted.  Right.  But they never--they never got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories--did--was the intent of either one of them to try to get married or did they have, like, a mutual--
Speaker 2: No.  I don't think it was their intent of them to get married.  I think my grandparents, my mother's parents would have liked to have seen them married, but I don't think that was my mother's desire.  I think she still had ambitions of being able to pull her life together again and move on and do other things, and that in being married at the time just wasn't one of those things that she had for her life plans.  But they maintained a friendship up to my mother's death.  I always knew, you know, who my father was.  I always got to spend time with my father and they remained really, really good friends, right, until her untimely death.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So even at a distance and all that, you know, because he moves out all the way to New Jersey.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you got a chance to interact with your dad.
Speaker 2: Right.  I would spend most--from the time that I was six years old, I spent most of my summers, if not all the summer, some of the summers, with my dad in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34447
Speaker 1: When you consider your parents' [Annie Lee Knighton and Clarence Brown, Sr.] talents, their dispositions, their sense of humor, how they walk, how they talk, what they look like even, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  Right.  When I was growing up, I can remember my grandfather always said that I was just like my dad.  "You just like that old Clarence Brown," is what (laughs)--what my grandfather, my mother's father [Sidney Knighton], who would say, right.  So I think probably growing up, probably a lot like my dad, but I think as I've gotten older, I can even see that, you know, my mannerisms are a more like my mother's and looks are a lot more like my mother's.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So what characteristics do you share with, you know, either one of them?  And what do you--
Speaker 2: My mother was always happy and a friendly person and with an embracing personality.  Never met a stranger.  I don't think when I was growing up I was that much like her.  I was more skeptical of people, and, you know, not really judgemental, but I needed to really get to know you before I would open up.  But I think as I've gotten older, I've become a lot like my mom, right, in being able to reach out to people and embrace people just for who they are.  She was the kind that we said, you know, the type of person never met a stranger and had lots of friends wherever she went, and always found a way to communicate, right.  Was a big letter writer, you know.  So always maintained all the family contacts, and she was the person that if you wanted to know how someone was connected to the family, just ask Mom, right.  And, unfortunately, right, we didn't document a lot of our family history, so when my mom, you know, passed away by virtue of a car accident, we, you know, a lot of that history kind of went with her.  And we're constantly trying to remake those connections back again, yep.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34448
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about your father [Clarence Brown, Sr.], what kind of personality did your father have?
Speaker 2: My father was very quiet and easygoing.  Right.  I can remember my, you know, [maternal] granddaddy [Sidney Knighton] again, right, kind of talking about how quiet he was, and again that's why he would equate some my mannerisms when I was growing up to being a lot like my father's.  As I got to know my father more, you know, he is much more like my mother [Annie Lee Knighton], you know, than we would know back then, you know, as very friendly, very open, the kind of person who's everybody's favorite uncle, right.  So the ones that all my cousins kind of embraced, right, Uncle Clarence.
Story_ID: 34449
Speaker 1: Do you have siblings, brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  Right.  I grew up, like I said, in a single-parent household with my mother [Annie Lee Knighton] in Georgia, and I grew up with two younger sisters, right.  And we're three years apart.  So, three--I'm three years older than my middle sister, and my middle sister's three years older than our youngest sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what are their names and what do they do?
Speaker 2: Right.  My sister Winifred,	W-I-N-I-F-R-E-D, right, resides in Albany, Georgia, and she's a social worker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  So she's a social worker there in Albany right now.  My younger sister is Pamela, P-A-M-E-L-A, right, and she works with--she's a college graduate also.  They both graduated from Albany State University in Georgia, right, and she is a business major--was a business major, but she works with Public Assistance, right, in the city of Cuthbert [Georgia].  So she's the--although Albany is only like thirty-two miles away from Cuthbert, but Pam resides in the city of Cuthbert.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so she's also, I guess, a social worker of sorts, I guess.
Speaker 2: In--of sorts, right.  Exactly.  I don't think that was intentional.  It's just by virtue of the opportunities that are available there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  And there're--I have three brothers, right, that resided with my father [Clarence Brown, Sr.], right.  And I got to know them, all three of them, growing up.  We just came back from Las Vegas [Nevada] for the middle brother's wedding, first-time marriage, so, right.  And they all reside--all three of them reside in the New Jersey area.
Speaker 1: And what are their names?
Speaker 2: The oldest is Clarence Brown, Jr., right.  The middle is Kevin, right; and Kevin also has a military background, so, right, we were the two that went military; and although I flew helicopters, he was a Chinook CH-47 [Boeing] crew chief.  Right.  So we have that in common. And the youngest brother is Jeffrey.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So would see them when you would visit your father.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  We've been very close over the years.
Story_ID: 34450
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest childhood memory.  An earliest childhood--.  I have happy memories of growing up when, you know, we were poor but probably didn't know we were poor.  I think we were wealthy from the prospective of family, because we had each other, right.  And so I think those were, like, some of my fondest memories were probably growing up on my [maternal] grandfather's [Sidney Knighton] small, ten-acre farm, right, and just enjoying what we saw was a good life, in that we had everything that we thought we needed, and, you know, if there was more to be had, we probably didn't even know about it, you know, so.
Speaker 1: But was there an earliest one, an earliest memory of the very first thing that you remember?
Speaker 2: The very first thing that I remember, I do believe that I may remember when my middle sister [Winifred Knighton] was born, right.  I have early recollections of, you know, when I was no longer the only grandchild in the house (laughs).  Exactly.  And that there was another child that came aboard, which would have been my middle sister.  And I remember shortly after that was when we moved from that home into the home that my grandfather had built on a small, ten-acre farm.  So I remember that transition from that life as, you know, a family, a sharecropper family, to the family of independence as to where my grandfather moved out on his own.  And I can remember my grandfather being very respected for that, but I also remember him being envied for that, and people were saying, you know, what are you doing and how could you do this.  Right.  So I do have a--I do have early memories of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 34451
Speaker 1: So, how did he [Knighton's grandfather, Sidney Knighton bought his own small, ten-acre farm in Benevolence, Georgia] do it?  I mean, is there a story behind how he did it, because it was not easy, I know, to make that transition?
Speaker 2: I think my grandfather wasn't typical of the average sharecropper during that time.  I think he had a vision of doing something more for his family and felt that he could do it and that he would step out on faith and make a difference and make a change.  It's one thing to have faith, but it's another thing to have the courage to do it, too.  So I remember my grandfather having a lot of courage, not only from that early time of moving out, but right up until his death in his late seventies of being a man of courage, and a man that was respected for having the courage, not only to do the things that he did, but to say some of the things that he did.
Speaker 1: Now this is, I mean, even moving from a sharecropper situation required some courage in those days because I've heard so many stories about the landlord cooking the books--
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: --so that you always owe.  So you can't get out.
Speaker 2: My mother [Annie Lee Knighton] would tell stories about how they would always--at the end of the year is when he got paid, which was right around Christmastime, right, so, right, the way that they were held on a farm was that they always were in debt.  So at the end of the year, right, it was like, "Oh, I'm sorry.  You came out in the hole."  Right.  And every year it was the same thing.  So you were continuously indebted to the primary farmer, the person that owned the farm, which, for the most part owned the grocery store, so they ran a tab, right, at the grocery store and then to the end of the year when the books were matched, there was like, "Oh, wow, you owe more than you made."  So that forced you to stay on the farm as a sharecropper.  So I think my grandfather was tired of that, and at some point just said, "Right.  Okay.  Yeah.  We're going to cut our ties, and I'll step out on my own and do the best that I can for my family and I won't be indebted to anyone else," you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what kind of things did he say that you think took a lot of courage you say in those days?
Speaker 2: Right.  I think my grandfather was known, you know, as a gun owner (laughs), right, which, you know, during that timeframe, I guess not many, you know, African Americans were gun owners, because he was a hunter, right; he was a fisher, because you did those kinds of things, right, right, for your family.  But I think my grandfather was also known as a person that wasn't afraid to defend his family when he needed to, right, if he thought that someone was going to come around that meant his family harm, right.  And I think there're probably incidents that we, you know, I'm not totally aware of, where he has demonstrated that, right.  So he kind of had a reputation of being a person that would demonstrate it if he--if need be, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  It's interesting to me that he didn't--once he got up the funds, he actually purchased land instead of leaving, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: So many people left.
Speaker 2: He actually moved on to a farm that he inherited.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: So it was the ten acres, right, that was willed to him by--by an aunt, which would have been my mother's great-aunt, my great-great-aunt.  So, right, so that was the ten acres.
Story_ID: 34452
Speaker 1: And my mom [Annie Lee Knighton] remembers ordering the home that we resided in [in Benevolence, Georgia] until I was about fifth grade.  Right.  It was a Jim Walter home, right.  And I guess it was in a catalog (laughs).  Exactly.  So, right, so it was one of those kinds of--I guess would have been kind of pre-manufactured homes, right, that they assembled onsite, right, even for that day and time they did that kind of thing, so.
Speaker 2: I've heard of that, but I didn't know the name of Jim Walter.
Speaker 1: Jim Walter.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Jim Walter was the manufacturer of it, right.  Yeah.  W-A-L-T-E-R.
Speaker 2: A Jim Walter home.
Speaker 1: Right.  A Jim Walter home.
Speaker 2: And you look--you pick it out of a catalog.
Speaker 1: And she picked it out of a catalog, right.  I think it was three bedrooms, right.  Yeah.  But, still it was--it wasn't one with running water, right.  We didn't have running water inside the home, right, at that time.  So, of course, the facilities, bathroom facilities and everything were still outside of the home.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  Did you have electricity?
Speaker 1: We had electricity.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  Which was different from the home that we moved from.  That house did not have electricity.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  So that's the one that your [maternal] grandfather [Sidney Knighton] was renting.
Speaker 1: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 2: As a sharecropper.
Speaker 1: As a sharecropper.
Speaker 2: So it had no plumbing, no electricity.
Speaker 1: Right.  No plumbing, no electricity.  Lanterns were, you know, exactly.  The wooden stove, right.
Speaker 2: Now, this is in the--this is--you know this to be true from the late fifties [1950s] on--I mean from--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --the sixties [1960s].
Speaker 1: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 2: So, okay.
Speaker 1: So the time when a lot of places had these, you know, amenities--
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  In other places--
Speaker 1: (simultaneous)(unclear)--
Speaker 2: --right.  We were--there were still places, right, in Georgia, or in other places in the South that weren't afforded those types of facilities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34453
Speaker 1: Right.  I can remember when we got our first television, you know, a black and white television when radio was our means of, you know, getting the news and communicate.  And I think in '63 [1963], right, when President [John F.] Kennedy was assassinated, right, I can remember us getting the news about that assassination over the radio versus over--versus via television.
Speaker 2: So the first T.V. came after what?  What do you think?
Speaker 1: Right.  Probably around '65 [1965], '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  Timeframe for us.  Right.  And I remember '66 [1966]--'63 [1963] so vividly and the assassination because it was a few days before my sixth birthday, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, that was a big year for a lot of things, you know.
Speaker 1: It was--it was a big year, and a--my connection to that year and his--again, untimely death and assassination was--I remember, as a five-year-old-about-to-turn-six, and hearing all the discussion about, you know, the president just got assassinated, the president assassinated, and my thoughts were, "Okay.  Well, what's this going to do to my birthday party?" (laughs), right.
Speaker 2: Your birthday is on the 23rd?
Speaker 1: On the 23rd of November.  Yes, that's my birthday.  Yep.  And it's my birthday.  But then I can remember gathering, right, to watch on television at a neighbor's house, right, the funeral and it being told that Caroline Kennedy's [daughter of President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis; author, attorney and President Barack Obama's nominee to be Ambassador to Japan] birthday is like on the 27th of November, right.  She would have been turning six or she did turn six.  And I can remember how selfish I felt, right.  Here I was thinking about the impact that the president's assassination was going to have on my birthday party at six years old, and now here's a six year old, you know, one of my peers who wouldn't even have a father on her sixth birthday.  So, that was my first time that I kind of realized that, you know, you got to think about something beyond yourself and something bigger than yourself there, and this impacts a whole lot more than just you.
Speaker 2: You were very sensitive as a six year old.
Speaker 1: (laughs)  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so.  Now that's something.  I don't think--I don't know how many six year olds really think about others at that stage, just because it's a stage of immaturity--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but you thought about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I thought about that even then.  And it's kind of stayed with me, right, over the years.  And that's why I always remember Caroline's birthday being the 27th of November (laughs).  Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I think she was just appointed Ambassador to France, I think.
Speaker 1: Ambassador to Japan, I think.
Speaker 2: Japan, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's Japan.
Speaker 2: You're right.  You're right.  Japan.

Speaker 1: When you were a little kid, you were living out on the farm [in Benevolence, Georgia], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The rented place where--
Speaker 2: Right.  Until I was about--until I was about, I think I would have been about four [years old].  Right.  Four years old when we moved from--and my sister [Winifred Knighton] would have been one.
Speaker 1: So you really remember your father--your [maternal] grandfather's [Sidney Knighton] house?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  We grew up in my grandfather's house until I was about fifth grade.
Speaker 1: So this is the Jim Walter home.
Speaker 2: This was the Jim Walter home.
Speaker 1: And--now was it--now, he had, like, ten acres, right, of land?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  And he farmed peanuts, watermelons, corn, right.  And I just remember my grandmother [Mamie Ward Knighton] having the most beautiful and biggest garden that I've ever seen, yep, where, you know, about everything that we needed, right, she was able to raise, as far as fruits and vegetables.  I remember two apple trees, peach trees, right.  I remember sweet potato--a sweet potato garden that was separate, I guess, because of all the vines that came from growing sweet potato.  That was separate from her regular garden.
Story_ID: 34455
Speaker 1: When you consider the area you lived in and growing up, I guess, on that ten-acre farm [in Benevolence, Georgia], and going to school and the rest of things in the neighborhood, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Wow.  Church was big, right, and it's still big like it is in most African American communities.  But, I guess, right, the sound of Sunday morning.  Right.  Exactly.  The sound of Sunday morning would always start off with the radio, right, and listening to gospel music on the radio.  So that's something that I still do today, right, at home.  The first thing we do, right, on Sunday morning, is turn on the radio, a gospel music station, right, to kind of hear that.  And that was preparing yourself for Sunday school and preparing yourself for a day of church, because church was all day long.
Speaker 1: Now what denomination was it, and what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Right.  The name of the church that I'm a member of is--and still a member of today, is Mount Airy, A-I-R-Y.  Yeah.  Mount Airy Baptist Church, which was the church that my [maternal] grandmother [Mamie Ward Knighton] belonged to, right.  Now, my grandfather [Signey Knighton] belonged to--was Methodist.  So there were the mergings of the Baptists and the Methodists, right, I guess, when they got married.  So he belonged to the New Salem AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church.  And my mom [Annie Lee Knighton] joined a Baptist church, but a different one from my grandmother's, right, which is Benevolence Baptist Church.  Right.  And then Benevolence Baptist Church, from what I understand and from what I gained from the information that I've gotten from, you know, this distant family member who's Caucasian, right, is that the Benevolence Baptist Church, there are two that reside in Benevolence to this day.  And that one time these churches were combined.  So the whites and the blacks attended church services together, right.  But somehow, you know, they split into different churches.
Speaker 1: I think, way back before the [American] Civil War, black folks would go to a white church and sit in the back, and that sort of thing, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  Exactly.  So they just had, I think, it was 150 or 200--yeah, it must have been 150th Anniversary, right, Benevolence.  And he was encouraging us to participate with--you know, it was, like, you know, nobody that I know remembers that or nobody that's alive remembers that (laughs).  And I'm not really sure we'd be that welcomed, right, exactly, in participating, right, in the anniversary celebration, so we didn't do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  Sights and sounds.
Speaker 1: And sounds, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  Smells of my grandmother cooking.  Right.  Exactly.  And waking up to the smell of breakfast, right, eggs, or whatever that would be.  So, I don't eat a lot of pork today.  I still eat bacon and pepperoni.  Can't break away from those two, right.  I did it one time, but I'm back.  Right.  But, you know, when I was growing up, just about, like I said, everything we needed was on the farm.  So, you know, we raised hogs, right, on the farm, so, and the hogs were for slaughter.  Right.  So, we ate every part of the hog, like most African American families did, right, during that time.  So I can remember, you know, the smell of sausage in the mornings, right.  The smell of fresh baked biscuits, you know, in the morning and waking up to that also.  I also remember the conversation around the table, right.  And we all sat at a round table, right, and just the conversation that we would have about family and good times.  It was just a--it's a--it was a good time to be growing up.  Very innocent time to be growing up, but, right, just to kind of hear the voice and to respect the voice of our elders.
Speaker 1: Now, is that when you had three meals a day?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Right.  We would have breakfast, you know.  You'd have something at lunch, and then--we didn't call it dinner, we called it supper.  Right.  Exactly.  So--
Speaker 1: I know a lot of times down South they call lunch "dinner."
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Exactly.  That was probably--and then supper in the evenings.  Right.  And supper was a little bit later than what we call dinnertime now, and I think it was because that was when everybody was, you know, the sun was going down and everybody was out of the fields from working and working on the farm.  So it was more called supper than it was dinner.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now these are--were these, like, big meals?
Speaker 2: Breakfast was a bigger--was, you know, a pretty big meal, and supper was a pretty good meal because it was a family meal.  I don't remember a lot of lunch dinners, except I remember people taking lunch with them, you know.  If they were going to work in the fields, they would take their lunch with them.  Right.  So lunch wasn't as formal, right, as the other two meals, right, because breakfast was before they left in the mornings, right, early, and then supper was once everybody got back together again at the end of the day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 34456
Speaker 1: Other sights, sounds and smells [of growing up in Benevolence, Georgia].
Speaker 2: The sounds of cars.  Right.  Exactly.  And I can remember my [maternal] grandfather [Sidney Knighton] being very good at recognizing cars.  Right.  And he could tell, you know, whether it was a Ford or if it was a Chevrolet.  And by virtue of that, he could pretty much tell you who was coming, right, by virtue of knowing who had what kind of car.
Speaker 1: Could you recognize the car by the sound of it?
Speaker 2: Right.  By the sound of the car in the distance.  Right.  And not too far from where we lived, there was a very, very steep hill.  And the roads were not paved.  Right.  Exactly.  So it pretty much took--it took some power to make up the steep hill, especially if it had rained.  This was the Red Georgia clay hill (laughs).  Exactly.  So you would kind of hear the sound of the engine as it reared up to conquer this hill (laughs).  Exactly.  So from a distance, my grandfather would be able to recognize, right.  So we would always try to challenge him, you know, and be the first that kind of tried to recognize the sound of who it was, and you know, and where they were along the route, you know.  Sights, I remember dusty roads, right.  And that was a place you didn't want to be where--when a car came by.  Exactly.  Because we all ended up being redheads (laughs) at some point because you were covered in red dust, right, when a car came up and down the roads.  Sights, I remember washday.  It seem like my [maternal] grandmother [Mamie Ward Knighton] was always, always working, you know.  Either working on the farm, working inside the house, or working outside the house. And so one of my most vivid memories of her doing--on laundry day, right, and clothes hanging out on the clothesline, right, doing laundry in the pots, right.  Yeah, the big, black pots that had a fire up under them.  I can remember her making the soap, right, from lye [Sodium hydroxide], right, and fat that she used to do the laundry with, so.  The sounds of the animals on the farm, you know, pigs, right, exactly, on the farm, especially when it was feeding time for the pigs, in which they pretty much they got the scraps from the tables, right, for food; and then going out and watching the animals being fed, watching the pigs being fed.  We had chicken on the farm--on the farm as well, right; chickens that usually ended up on the dinner table at some point in time, and also going out and getting the eggs.  And I can remember my grandmother picking up the hens off the eggs, right, and getting the fresh eggs, right, to that--you know, was going to go on in the breakfast or go into her baking, you know, so.  Lots of sights and sounds.  There's one thing that I remember that I've always wanted to research.  I can remember a concept called "fireballs," right, like around the 4th of July timeframe where people would actually soak old rags that--and that was to wave--that was fireworks, right.  And so they would set these on fire and throw them up in the air, and those were our fireworks.  We didn't have, you know, sparkles or (laughs) all of the fireworks that you have today, the modern-day fireworks--
Speaker 1: So they would soak these in kerosene?
Speaker 2: They would soak these in kerosene, light them on fire, and throw them--and throw them in the air, so.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Seems like something that we wouldn't (laughs)--we wouldn't begin to promote today.  Right.  Exactly.  But I guess, you know, and, you know, you had enough space in order to do that.  Right.  And if you could get to it, you know, it was a wide-open field, so you got to it soon enough, to whatever little brush fire might have started, you put out.  So somehow that was worth the entertainment.
Speaker 1: Nobody ever got hurt that you know of?
Speaker 2: Nobody ever got hurt that I know of.  Right.  Exactly.  And I've never asked.  And I've got an uncle that I probably should ask, that's still alive, that I probably should ask, you know, "Hey, what was up with those fireballs that would going--going on then?"  I can remember radio stations, right, but I think the only black music that we heard during that time was the gospel music.  As far as other radio stations, jazz or soul or anything else that was ethnic, pretty much came out of Tennessee, and I think Nashville, Tennessee.  And I can remember taking the radio, transistor radio and going out near a power line, and kind of put the radio up so that you could receive the radio station out of Nashville at night to kind of hear the latest contemporary African American music.
Speaker 1: Did you get WLAC in--
Speaker 2: I think it was WLAC out of Nashville, Tennessee--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) (simultaneous) -- Gallatin, Tennessee or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --or someplace in Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Gallatin or Nashville--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Hossman [Bill "Hoss" Allen; radio jockey on WLAC] and all that.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: 'Randy's Record Shop' [WLAC show].
Speaker 2: Yes.  Randy's Record Shop (laughs).  You remember that too?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yep.  So it--but, you know, so I grew up with the, you know, Beatles, and Herman's Hermits, and-right, that's the music that, you know, that I was accustomed to.
Speaker 1: That you would get locally--.
Speaker 2: Right.  Because that's what we heard locally.  So I hear now people say, you know, Lionel Ritchie's doing Country and Western [genre of music].  And I'm like, in Tuskegee [Alabama], that's what he grew up with, you know, because that was the music we got to hear, and then, until the Beatles and Herman's Hermits and some them started to come on board, online.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34457
Speaker 1: Now, where did you start school?  What as the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Right.  I started school in Stewart County [Georgia], and it was Lumpkin Elementary and High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So--
Speaker 1: So this would have been in--oh, you were born '58 [1958], this is like --
Speaker 2: Right, '62 [1962] or '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Sixty--okay.
Speaker 2: '63 [1963], and it was--I started with first grade.
Story_ID: 34458
Speaker 1: So, Lumpkin Elementary School and High School [Stewart County, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in '63 [1963] in the first grade.  Now did you like school?
Speaker 2: I loved school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  I can remember my mom [Annie Lee Knighton] telling my dad [Clarence Brown, Sr.] once that, you know, I was very good when it came to schoolwork, but I wasn't as studious or, right, when it came to work around the house, doing my chores.  Right.  Exactly.  So I think I've loved school from the very beginning, was excited to be in school, was excited to meet new friends and new people, right, and just from a learning aspect.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is interesting because you're out on this ten-acre farm.  Now did you have close neighbors that you saw or did you--were you kind--or once you all were there you kind of--?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  There were close neighbors.  So right up against the ten acres was somebody else's ten or more acres.  So I guess it all goes back to that old concept of the ten acres and a mule.  Right.  Exactly.  So most of the African American farms were divided into, like, ten-acre kind of patches, I guess, along that way.  But there were some families that owned more.  Right.  I think it was because family members had combined their ten acres, right, to have larger spreads, but, you know.  So you could see in the distance the house that was, you know, and the farm next door.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So it was close enough where you could at least holler to 'em or something?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you have a favorite teacher at Lumpkin?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  My first-grade teacher was my favorite teacher and kind of stayed with me, right, Mrs. Martin, right, was my favorite teacher in elementary school, and she was my, in fact, my first-grade teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had two other neighbors that were teachers, too.  They lived out, you know, in the countryside where we lived, right.  And they were also teachers, but I never had them in--for a class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there any aspect of school life that you liked the best?
Speaker 2: I can't think of anything I didn't like about school.  I just--I liked being able to connect with other people.  I think in the--it also afforded me the opportunity to see other family members, you know, that were--lived in the city of Lumpkin versus us that lived out in the country, right.  So you would see them every day.  So it afforded an opportunity to connect.  I can remember also is, you know, taking my--an overnight bag and spending the night at my [paternal] grandparents' house who lived not very far from the school, too.  So you just--I would take the bus to school, spend the night there, and then take the bus home, back home the next day.  So I--my principal from elementary school, right, I was in contact with him until a few years ago.  He's still alive, Mr. Young, right.  And I can remember him and his personal touch.  It seemed like he knew every student, you know, that was in the elementary school and in the high school portion of the school as well.  And he would always have something to say and just really made you feel special as a person.  So even after we left this--Lumpkin and moved to Cuthbert [Georgia], right, and I went to a different school, I still maintained that connection with Mr. Young.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how large a school Lumpkin?  Was there at least a classroom for every grade?
Speaker 2: Right.  There was a classroom for every grade, I guess.  It was considered kind of modern, right.  It was a, you know, it wasn't the little one-room schoolhouse kind of thing.  It was a modern-day facility, which I think is still being used, right, for something in the public educational arena, right, in the city of Lumpkin now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 34459
Speaker 1: When you were a little kid, was there there Civil Rights [Movement] activity going on out there (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was a lot more going on than I knew about, right.  Yeah.  And now, as I grew up, I learned more about what was going on in the city of Albany [Georgia], and, you know, Martin Luther King [Jr.] being heavily involved in Albany.
Speaker 1: How far is Albany from where you were?
Speaker 2: Thirty-two miles--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --right, exactly, from Cuthbert [George], which is my home--what I consider my hometown and where I graduated high school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Albany, Georgia (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So there was a lot going on when the Civil Rights there.  And there is a portion of the King family, right, from Albany, as well.  So they are related to the Martin Luther King family, and they were really big in the civil rights in Albany.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  I'm trying to think--I think the Albany Movement was--there have been books written about Albany.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  I know he was jailed in Albany as well.  That was one of the--outside of Atlanta [Georgia],  I think it was one of the major movements going on at that time.
Speaker 1: I think it was like '60 [1960], '61 [1961] or something (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right.  That sounds about right.
Speaker 1: I think they talked about the Civil Rights Movement bogging down in Albany.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean in terms of Dr. King's activities, and he--it was in '63 [1963] in Birmingham [Alabama] when they kind of made another big splash, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Similar to the Montgomery [Alabama] bus boycott.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It actually made national news again and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --had a victory.  Yeah, but Albany was a tough, tough place.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Really, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So all of this is going on when you were a little kid.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And do you know if your parents were involved in any of the Civil Rights activities?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Not to my knowledge that they were.  I know of people, you know.  There were families in Cuthbert that were more involved.  And I'm not really sure why.  I think people who were outside of the city proper weren't as involved, right, in the movements as people that were, you know, kind of in the county seat.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34460
Speaker 1: You said you got T.V. around '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And did that make a big difference in how you saw the world?
Speaker 2: It did, right.  And, you know, another portion of the world kind of opened up to us.  Of course, it was black and white T.V., right, exactly.  And I think my [paternal] grandparents [Charlie Brown and Blanchie Jones Brown] that lived in Lumpkin [Georgia], right, in the city, they had television earlier than that, right.  And their color T.V. was that little--they had a little screen that they put on front of the T.V., right, exactly.
Speaker 1: (unclear) (simultaneous)--with the blue--
Speaker 2: Yes (laughs).  Right.  Have you heard of those?  Yeah.  Exactly.  (laughs).
Speaker 1: I had that.
Speaker 2: Really?  I was like, okay.  This is supposed to make it color.  Okay.  (laughs).  Right.  Exactly.  So that was what they had in front of their screen, so. (laughs)  You know.
Speaker 1: So the blue looked like the sky--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.  Had the different colors, blue, red, oranges, greens.  I was like, okay.  Right.  All this does is, you know, distorts what I'm trying to see here, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.  So.  Now, were you involved in activities like Girl Scouts and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I was not involved in Girl Scouts.  Most of my affiliation was with--was with the church groups, because of the transportation that was required to get to the city, right, in order to participate, you know, in those activities.  So we rode the bus to school.  So, it was about a ten-mile bus ride, right, to school and back every day; you know, ten miles one direction, ten miles the other, right.  So not involved in a--in elementary school, not involved in a lot of activities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34461
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, did you visit some of your relatives in the north in the summers?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Oh--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was spent--yeah.  Exactly.  I would spend the majority of my summers with my father [Clarence Brown, Sr.] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], right.  So I was very much aware of the difference and the culture, right, in northern cities and--versus the South.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your parents ever consider letting you live in Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: No.  (laughs).  My mother [Annie Lee Knighton] didn't anyway, right.  No.  It wasn't--I don't think it ever came up exactly.  It just, you know, right, I was going to be with my mom and that was just the way that it was, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because I can imagine in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] you would have some challenges, too, in terms of schools and--
Speaker 2: Right.  I think more of the challenges came kind of later, right, exactly, and not as many as--the only thing I remember about Philadelphia is the teachers would strike every time it was time to go back to school, so, right.
Story_ID: 34462
Speaker 1: Now, did you have middle school or junior high school [in Benevolence, Gerogia]?
Speaker 2: Right.  The schools were combined for the most part.  Right.  Exactly.  You had an elementary or a high school.  I remember those being separate, but, right, for a while, it was, you know, you would go to one school from first grade through sixth or seventh grade, and then eighth through twelfth was a different school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they divided it like that pretty much?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So.  All right.  So, now, do you remember--now you were--you were about ten when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Yep.
Speaker 1: And do you remember what you were doing and what happened?
Speaker 2: Right.  I can remember being in a classroom, exactly, when we were told that Dr. King was assassinated.  Right.  And I can remember the teacher that, you know, that made the announcement to the class, and I can remember teachers kind of running from classroom to classroom, you know, and the chatter around, right, the fact that he had been assassinated.
Speaker 1: Was there anything special done at school or in church to commemorate Dr. King?
Speaker 2: I think there was at school.  I don't remember a whole lot of details about it, right.  I can remember the funeral being watched at school, yep, so.  Right.  You know, I can remember what we now see.  And, of course, I probably remember the images more vivid now just by virtue of having seen the photos, you know, of the King children with their mother [Coretta Scott King] at the funeral, right, over course of time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know that the Baptist Church in those days was kind of split about it--you know--what the National Baptist Convention had, like, pulled away from Dr. King.  Was your church--
Speaker 2: Not to my knowledge.  And the churches that I attended were more of the rural churches than the ones that were in the city, right, and the town.  And I then for that reason, I think, you know, they were more into the Civil Rights Movement and more into Dr. King's--what Dr. King was doing for the Movement than the ones that were kind of the, right, the rural churches.  Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34463
Speaker 1: Well, in the eighth grade you switched schools then and went to--
Speaker 2: In fifth grade, actually--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --right, we switched schools.  And I think it was mid-year, right, exactly, over like between the Christmas break and, right, and coming back for the second half of the year is when we transitioned from Lumpkin [Elementary and High School]--public schools in Lumpkin, Georgia, to the public schools in Cuthbert, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were going to the Cuthbert--what they call, the Cuthbert--
Speaker 2: Right.  We were--it was Henderson Elementary and High School at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, in Cuthbert.  And it remained so until the schools integrated.  Right.  It was named for Fletcher Henderson, right, exactly, who was--and you may have heard of the jazz artist--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --Fletcher Henderson--
Speaker 1: Great, great musician.
Speaker 2: --exactly.  So the school was named for his father, who had been principal, and it was a primary educator, right, in Cuthbert for a very, very, very long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, was Fletcher Henderson then raised in Cuthbert?
Speaker 2: He was, right.  Young Fletcher Henderson--well, young, meaning the musician Fletcher Henderson was raised in Cuthbert, and there's a home that's on the list of National Historic Sites, the home that he grew up in is on the list of National Historic Sites there in Cuthbert.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, Fletcher Henderson was one of the great sounds.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Not a lot of people know about him, you know.  They know, right, about Satchmo [Louis Armstrong; jazz trumpeter] and, you know, Count Basie [jazz pianist], but they don't know that they pretty much all got their start with Fletcher Henderson.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  I mean, if you listen to that music now, it's just really--it really is, you know, recordings are not as clear--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as some of--but the music is just unbelievable.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  You're right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Fletcher Henderson.  So.  Okay.  So at Fletcher Henderson High school.  Now did you gravitate towards an interest there in high school?
Speaker 2: In any one particular area?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: History was kind--was what I gravitated to, right, during probably the middle school years, right, just by virtue of--we had a very dynamic teacher, right, that ensured that we kind of knew our history and African American history, and this was before integration, as well as knowing, you know, regular American history.  So I always tell people she taught us what wasn't in the books.  And during that time, the books that we got, right, at Henderson, were the books that were passed down from the white school on the other side of the railroad tracks.  So, right, I very rarely remember her staying, you know, sticking to just the lessons in the books.  There was always, right, the rest of the story and how we fit into American history.
Speaker 1: So what was your teacher's name?
Speaker 2: This was Ms. Taylor, and her name was Eva, E-V-A.  Yep.  Ms. Eva Taylor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I've heard that name before.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: On the--yeah.  I just had a--
Speaker 2: She was serious about instruction and serious about you learning, right, and definitely a very proud Albany State [University, Albany, Georgia] graduate, right.  So.  And really ensuring that we knew, right, of how we fit into American history.
Story_ID: 34464
Speaker 1: Now Albany State [University, Albany, Georgia] this is an historical black college [HBCU], right--
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: --in Georgia.  Funded by the state.
Speaker 2: So when I was growing up, you went to one or two colleges, right.  You went to Albany State or you went to Fort Valley State.  So.  And that would be the question.  "Okay.  So where you going to college?  You going to, you know, you're going to Albany or are you going to Fort Valley [State University, Fort Valley, Georgia]?"  Right.
Speaker 1: So it was cheaper to go to one or the other, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  State schools.
Speaker 1: If you were a Georgia resident.
Speaker 2: Right.  And being a Georgia resident.  Right.  So I kind of broke a paradigm, yeah, exactly, by going to-out-of-state, all the way to Alabama, which was twenty--and the state of Alabama was, like, twenty miles away from my hometown.  And, but, Tuskegee [Alabama] was actually ninety miles away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34465
Speaker 1: All right.  So when you were in your high school years, were you involved in--how were your grades?
Speaker 2: I had pretty good grades all of my high school career.  I didn't graduate at the top of the class, you know, not--among the top two, but I would graduate probably within the top 10 percent, right, of the class of 100 and--102, 103; however many we had.  So.  So still small by comparison, right, to other places.  But favorite subject in high school was home economics, which is what I would major in when I went to Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama], right.  And I started sewing for my family for the most part kind of out of necessity.  I made just about everything that we wore, you know, all, you know, all the--all three girls [Knighton and her sisters, Winifred and Pamela] and my mom [Annie Lee Knighton], right, exactly.  And that was kind of how I made extra money.  Right.  I had a talent for--developed that talent probably in middle school in about eighth grade when I was able to take home economics, right.  And I ended up being pretty good at it.  So, had a good instructor who had been the same instructor that my mother had, but--and my mother always kind of resented this teacher and had the opportunity to tell her (laughs).  Exactly.  So she told my mom, "Well, I'll make it up with Christine."  Yeah.  Exactly.  But my mom, if you recall, I told you that she went to school in Benevolence [Georgia] and then the school was--then bussed to the school in Cuthbert [Georgia].  And she always felt like this teacher had a preference for the Cuthbert girls, and that she didn't--although my mom wanted to learn home economics and how to sew, she didn't feel like this teacher devoted enough time to her; that she kind of treated them--didn't treat them as well as the Cuthbert girls were treated.  So she told my mom that, "I'll make it up with Christine."  (laughs)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she did.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: You had the talent.  Now, that's--not everybody--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who's taught to sew--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --can really sew.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  I was really pretty good at it.  Now, my husband and my son don't even know that I can really sew.  They don't believe me when I tell them, right, exactly, because I, just since joining the military, just didn't--haven't done it a lot, so.
Story_ID: 34466
Speaker 1: Now you say your mother [Annie Lee Knighton] was a basketball player in school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you play any sports?
Speaker 2: I was a disappointment when it came to that (laughs).  Right.  I don't know if my lack of coordination on the basketball court is just--I tried out for basketball, right, when I came of age, right.  I just wasn't one, right, that was on the basketball court nor did I spend a lot of time in the backyard shooting hoops like most of my cousins did.  So for--if you had the name "Knighton" in my hometown, then you were expected to play basketball and to play it well.  And most Knightons did, except for me and my two sisters [Winifred and Pamela Knighton] (laughs).  So.  Right.  My sisters ended up being cheerleaders, right.  And I ended up being the water girl for the basketball team.  So, I was the best water girl they had ever seen.
Speaker 1: I know there's a basketball player I know actually in Chicago [Illinois], Jesse Knighton--
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: --who played for the Indiana Pacers [professional basketball team in Indianapolis, Indiana].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: ABA [American Basketball Association].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Right.
Speaker 1: Six foot ten [inches; height; 6'10"].
Speaker 2: George Knighton, right, which grew up with my mom, right, a cousin of hers, went on to play in Detroit [Michigan], right, in the professional league.
Speaker 1: Oh, for the Pistons?
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  So, yeah.  Right.  So, like I said, if you had the name Knighton, you were expected to play.  And, of course, I had cousins, you know--I got a cousin who's still, a girl, who's--they retired her jersey and she still holds a record, right, in my hometown.  Everyone since then with the name Knighton pretty much plays basketball.  But my sisters and I kind of broke that (laughs)--broke the mold, right, for my mother.  I think my mother was a bit disappointed, right, exactly, but we did okay academically.  So she was happy with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that's interesting, because, see, I hear a lot of stories about black girls in the South playing basketball, having a chance to really play.  And it's a big thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  It is.  Right.  In, you know, my hometown, like, even now it's a big thing because high school sports is pretty much the center of whatever--so (unclear) talk in the hometown now that doesn't have a movie theatre, doesn't have bowling alley, you know, right.  Other things there, you know, others take for granted, right.  So if you're not into sports, it's like, "Well, what do you do?"  Right.  Exactly.  If you don't play sports, then what do you do?
Story_ID: 34467
Speaker 1: So did you run for class office or anything like that?
Speaker 2: I did.  Right.  Exactly.  So Future Business Leaders of America, I was president.  I was in the Future Homemakers of America, which, of course, and president of Future Homemakers for America, so.  Right.  So I was very, very involved academically.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now when it was time to graduate, was there--did you have any special honors or anything?
Speaker 2: Not to my knowledge any special honors.  I think the only one we emphasized was whoever was valedictorian, salutatorian, and then everybody else, right.  So no special honors at the high school level.
Speaker 1: And how did you manage to choose Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama]?  I mean, did you have good counseling or did somebody make a connection for you at Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Right.  So, two of the teachers that I admired the most were a math teacher, Ms. Presley (ph.), right, and her husband, Mr. Presley, who--I think both of them probably taught my uncles and aunts that were in the school system when my mother [Annie Lee Knighton] was there, too.  But Mr. Presley, or as they referred to him as Professor Presley, right, taught Ag [agriculture].  So he was an agriculture instructor.  And they both--had both received their master's degree from Tuskegee, right.  Ms. Presley kind of took a special interest in our family, right.  I think of it probably had to do with when I transitioned to high school and was in her classroom, I really wanted to do well, you know, going to my new school, right, and I made--I scored like a B plus on one--one the first tests that I took, which was in her class, and I think I cried because I didn't get an A.  Right.  (laughs)  I know.  I know.  So Ms. Presley from that day forward, yeah, exactly, "It must be something special about Christine 'cause, you know, right, she won't accept anything less than an A."  Exactly.  So I wanted to make a good impression, right.  I wasn't good at sports, didn't have the coordination for a whole lot of other things.  So this was--that was my way of showing who I was and how smart I was, so.  I needed to make As.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  So did they kind of--
Speaker 2: Right.  So--
Speaker 1: --pave the way for you to go--
Speaker 2: --so I knew that they went, but, you know, we never really talked about me going there.  But during the summers, you would--we would have these work/study jobs, right, at the CETA Program.  But I can't think of what CETA stands now, but it was program that afforded job opportunities for disadvantaged kids.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's Comprehensive Employment and Training Act.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Got it.  Right.  Yeah, so I worked, you know, applied and worked in the guidance counselor's office over the summers, right.  So the summer after my sophomore year of high school, my junior year, right, I worked in the counselor's office.  And then in my senior year, I had enough credit hours to graduate.  So I worked work/study in high school, so I only had, like, three classes, and the rest of the time I was able to work while I was in high school, and it was in the guidance counselor's office.  So Tuskegee was the university that I did the most research into, right, about the history of the university, Booker T. Washington, association of George Washington Carver with the university.  So Tuskegee was the only college that I applied to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Right.  And, thank goodness, I got accepted.  So.  Right.
Story_ID: 34468
Speaker 1: So on what basis did they [Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] accept you?  Did they provide you with a scholarship?
Speaker 2: Right.  The first year was pretty much, you know, taken care of by a scholarship, right.  That was the first year.  Right.  So second, third, and fourth year, little bit different (laughs).  Exactly.  So my first year was pretty much taken care of.
Speaker 1: I've heard people say that, that they thought they were going to get a full scholarship--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and they end up getting like part of it or something.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So I guess it was a partial scholarship, so.  You know, I don't know if that's the case with a lot of HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], but I know that some HBCUs do that.  They get a hook into--you know, and get you hooked, and then you got to figure it out the rest of the time that you're there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, so were your parents [Annie Lee Knighton and Clarence Brown, Sr.] excited you were going?
Speaker 2: Right.  Excited because, you know, this was starting to be the first generation of my immediate family, right, not only graduating from high school, but also entering into college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is 19--?
Speaker 2: This is 1975.
Speaker 1: Okay.  1975.  Okay.  All right.  So.  Okay.  So you go off to--now, did--how did you get to Tuskegee first?  I mean, did your parents drive you (simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So we went--I had never been on campus when I applied, had never seen the campus other than in pictures and what I was able to read about the campus, right.  So the summer before going, so right after I graduated from high school, you know, my mother, my father and my stepmother, we all drove to--they--we all went to Tuskegee for the first time to kind of get an idea of the--of what I was about to embark upon, and the lay of the land, what the dormitories looked like, how the campus layout was, etcetera, so.  And that was after having already been accepted.
Speaker 1: So were you impressed?
Speaker 2: Very much so.  And I think my mom and stepmother were more excited than I was, right.  It was, like, you know, this was their opportunity to be on a college campus and the--right.  So I just kind of remember one of the things that resonates with me is how excited they were, right.  They were like two high school graduates, right (laughs), like they were going off to college, so.  I was a little concerned about the layout of the college and where my dormitory was opposed to where my classes were, 'cause it's a pretty big campus, right, exactly, without, you know, transportation.  Right.  Exactly.  So, you know.  I think that was my--that was the thing that kind of stayed with me the most, like, "Wow.  This is a big campus, and I got to get from here to there."  It's not like the bell ringing and, you know, exactly, and changing and going to different classrooms in high school, so.  Right.  So a bit different kind of lifestyle and academic.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think Tuskegee may have more buildings than any other HBCU.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah.  Lots of buildings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36706
Speaker 1: All right.  Tuskegee University [Tuskegee, Alabama].  Now, who was the president when you got there?
Speaker 2: It was Tuskegee Institute at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was before, you know, we gained a university status, right.  And Dr. Foster was the president.  Luther H. Foster, which I think we had--was only like the fourth president, right, of the university at that time, so.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you thing about high school graduation.  Now the name of the high school you graduated from was--?
Speaker 2: Right.  When I was in seventh grade is when integration came about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So the name of the high school I graduated from was Randolph County Comprehensive High School [Cuthbert, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--it was different from Henderson [Elementary and High School, Cuthbert]?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So Henderson kind of went away once the schools were integrated.
Speaker 1: And that happened in 1970?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was, what, in seventh grade, I recall.  So what--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that means you--
Speaker 2: So, I was like, what, twelve [years old]?
Speaker 1: '69 [1969] I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It would have been about '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  So.  All right.  So you came out of actually Randolph County Comprehensive High School.
Speaker 2: High School.
Speaker 1: And this was--so this was an integrated school?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So the schools were integrated at that time.
Speaker 1: How did--were you among the first to integrate, you know?
Speaker 2: Before actual integration took place, they had--they gave some kids the option or you had the option to go over.  So I guess it was a little bit of an experiment, right.  And so there were some kids who had gone over to the other school, right, to the white school.  There wasn't--there weren't any white students that opted to go to the black schools (laughs), so, right, exactly.  So, yeah, so I think they were in my grade level, there were probably like three kids whose parents had opted for them to go to school at the white school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Prior to seventh grade.
Speaker 1: So they had the brunt of whatever, you know, conflicts, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Exactly.  Right.  Exactly.  But I think when integration did take place, and it was, you know, everybody else had to do it, right, it wasn't as new to them, of course, right, because they knew people, they knew the instructors, right, that were--and, you know, that where all of us were meeting for the very first time.
Speaker 1: I take it the staff was integrated, too.  I mean--.
Speaker 2: The staff was integrated, too.  And we lost a lot of good teachers, a lot of good African American teachers were lost during that process, right, you know, that one for--that were invited to retire if they were retirement eligible, right, that for fear of, you know, of teaching white kids or right, or parents that didn't, you know, didn't want these teachers teaching their kids, so.  And that's when you saw the rise in the population of private schools.  I think private schools had always existed in the South at some level.  So we saw a large population of white kids that opted to go to private schools, right, that--instead of going to integrated schools.
Speaker 1: Right.  And they started forming these Christian schools.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  Started forming, right.  So this school called Randolph Southern was the one in Randolph County, and it still exists, you know, to this very day.  And it's about to be a charter school, right, so.  I don't care a lot for charter schools for that reason, because I think now people who opted to be, right, in a private school setting, right, because they didn't want to be an integrated setting, will now be able to get charter school status and use public funds in order to do that, so.
Speaker 1: In order to segregate themselves.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So this is the beginning of that dynamic and--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you were--you started in '69 [1969] and went through '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So that's six, seventh--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  About half of, yeah, my education was at a high school--of elementary and high school education public school was in an integrated setting.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  That was almost lost on me there.  I'm glad I mentioned it.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Right.  Yeah.  I'm glad you went back there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36707
Speaker 1: So, in Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] now--so who was the principal your first year?
Speaker 2: The president was Foster, Luther H. Foster.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Luther Foster.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So how did you like it?
Speaker 2: Loved it.  Right.  Exactly.  It was different, of course, but, right, just to, you know, be on a campus that was so welcoming.  It was just a big family environment, right, to be among that many African American students from so many diverse places, and probably the reason I did so well in, right, in college, right, I think my grades in college were a lot better just because I was intimidated by the fact that, right, you had kids from all different areas, and here I was from, you know, the big city of Cuthbert, Georgia (laughs), right, with my small town education.  And it was like, you know, how am I going to measure up.  So my freshman year, right, I pretty much stayed in the books and either in my dorm room or in the library.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were determined to keep up.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was it that difficult (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It wasn't--.
Speaker 1: --with your education?
Speaker 2: It wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be, right.  I think it was--my perception was that I would be behind the power curve, right, that, you know, that my rural education wouldn't measure up to an urban education or an education from a large environment, you know, and that turned out not to be the case, so.  I think like my first--first semester was like a 3.83, and my second semester was like a 3.93, right.  So that's when I was invited to apply for an ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] scholarship, so.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36708
Speaker 1: So, at a land grant school like Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama], I've wondered, like, I know that the males are compelled to be in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They have to do it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for a couple of years at least.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But what about the female students, are they--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --they're not--
Speaker 2: That was not the case for a female student.  And when I got to Tuskegee, it was--ROTC was optional, it was no longer mandated, right, for the male or female students.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were there very many female students in ROTC?
Speaker 2: Not a lot, right, exactly.  But I think my class, right, when we went in '75 [1975], I think you had more female students in it than any other class, right, because the class before us was the class that had the first female students, '76 [1976], right--well, '74 [1974], right was the first year.  So then my class comes along in '75 [1975], was the next one.  So when I graduated in '79 [1979], our first females had graduated from the program in '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, this--probably the prospects in the [U.S.] Army or ROTC were probably better because of the end of the Vietnam War.
Speaker 2: End of the Vietnam War, and then the Women's Army Corps, you know, was-did--no longer was existing either.  So I think it was disbanded around that time, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they, at this point, they had decided to integrate women into the regular Army?
Speaker 2: Right.  Women into the regular Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So they offered you a scholarship (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, they invited once the ROTC cadre saw my grades (laughs).  It was like, "You need to apply for a scholarship."  And I'm like, "Well, I'm not sure.  You know, I just did this for the extra credits."  Right.  Not really sure that I wanted to make a career out of the military.  There's an obligation that comes along with this, you know, with the scholarship, right.  But I was encouraged--okay.  "We've never had a female to get a scholarship, so just apply," right, "to see if you get it and then you can always turn it down."
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you applied and got it.
Speaker 2: So I applied, went through the interview process, because you do a, you know, you do your paper application process, and then you do your interviews, right, with the members of the cadre and members of the faculty at Tuskegee, right.  So I was home between my freshman year and my sophomore year, right, and I got two letters on that same day; one came from Tuskegee, said, you know, "Congratulations.  You did well in your freshman year, and you're invited back to Tuskegee for your sophomore year."  Right.  "But bring some money with you."  (laughs)  Exactly.  So that was the one that said, you know, you need this much money to come back, right.  So, I'm like, okay, we don't have that kind of money, how am I going to go back to school, right.  So believe it or not, on that very same day, I get this letter from the [U.S>] Army, right.  And I opened the letter and it says, you know, "Congratulations.  You've been--you are the recipient of a three-year ROTC scholarship if you choose to accept it."  And they paid for everything except for room and board.  So I had a decision to make.  And so I looked to my mom [Annie Lee Knighton] and asked, like, "Mom, what do I do?"  And she's like, "You have to decide."  Exactly.  "That's not a decision I can make for you."  So the decision was, you know, do I go back to--the way I saw it was, right, do I go back to school, right, and how do I pay for it, right.  And here's a way to go back to school, right, and pretty much, you know, take care of all my tuition, right.  And, plus, gave me a stipend of $100 a month.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, now you still had to make up the room and board, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Still had to make up the room and board.  So I was able to do that through work-study.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So that seems like a pretty good deal.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know.  In later years, I think, you know, universities, if you got an ROTC scholarship, universities will pay for room and board.  So that was a way to keep ROTC students on the campus.
Story_ID: 36709
Speaker 1: Was Lionel Richie [singer-songwriter, musician, record producer and actor] around when you were in school [at Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Lionel Richie was around, yeah, when I was in school.  As a matter of fact, he was still enrolled at the university, right, in some courses, right.  I don't think he was a full-time student, but, right, 'cause they were just really kind of kicking off.  My senior year of high school [Randolph County Comprehensive High School, Cuthbert, Georgia] is when you first started to hear about Lionel Richie and the Commodores, and, "Yeah, I feel sanctified."  You remember that song, right, exactly (laughs).  So that was like one of the big songs my senior year, right.  That didn't influence me going, though, right.  But for homecoming my freshman year, of course, it was Lionel Richie and the Commodores, right.  Not Lionel Richie and the Commodores.  It was just the Commodores at that time, right, exactly, where they were the group that performed for homecoming that year.  So you would see them on campus, right, exactly, because they were enrolled.  And so they were just, you know, ingrained into the campus community, right, during that time before they really got big.
Speaker 1: And I've been told by some others that the Richies have a long history at Tuskegee.
Speaker 2: They do.  Right.  Dating all the way back to Booker T. Washington, right.  I think they had their--his grandmother's home, where he grew up, was right on campus, right, exactly.  And I think they were given that plot of land as a wedding gift, right, from the Washingtons, right, so, yep.  So, yeah, they're on campus.  He grew up on the campus of Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 36710
Speaker 1: Who were some of the, I guess, the other students and some of your mentors at Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Right.  The ladies in the home economics department, right.  I was very close to Dr. Robinson, who was a Fort Valley [State University, Fort Valley, Georgia] graduate, right.  And from Fort Valley, I believe, was the dean of the Department of Home Economics, right, so.  A very good, very vital influence.  Other instructors, I mean I enjoyed writing, and I discovered that I could actually write, right, at Tuskegee. I don't think I was given the opportunity to write that much until I got to college, right, when it was research papers and having to do the research, and I really enjoyed the research portion of it.  Educational psychology was one of my favorite classes, and that required us to do a lot of deep research.  History, again, was one of my favorite subjects.  And the English department and the history department would usually join forces in ensuring that we wrote, you know, something that was meaningful and that was tied to history.  I enjoyed freshman orientation, too, while a freshman.  That was all about learning and taking a deeper dive into history of the university and about the influence of our founder, Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver, too, so.  These were things that I didn't get in high school.  I did get some in elementary school, but it was kind of lost, right, when we--when the schools integrated.  You didn't get that much African American history anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 36711
Speaker 1: So, in terms of ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], did you have to go to an extended camp, I think--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I know there's some sort of--
Speaker 2: Summer camp, right.
Speaker 1: --yeah.  Summer camp.
Speaker 2: So, I didn't have to do basic camp because I started out as a freshman in ROTC.  You go to basic camp if you didn't do your freshman and sophomore year, and then you can go directly into your junior year.  So I did all four years and eight semesters of Army ROTC right there on campus.  I liked Army ROTC because it presented a challenge, and this is where I start getting my first training in leadership, you know, formalized leadership instruction.  And I actually realized that this was something I was pretty good at, and I think ROTC instructors realized that this was something that, you know, I was good at, too, and kind of was a natural in my leadership positions when I had those positions, and they always gave everyone an opportunity to shine in positions of leadership.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So this--so you start developing leadership skills as a trainer?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: All right.  So by the time you were a senior--now you graduated in--
Speaker 2: In '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: '79 [1979].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In 1979.  Did you plan--well, you had no choice but to spend some time in the military, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So I had a six-year obligation, right, by virtue of having a three-year ROTC scholarship, and four years were to be on active duty and two years of reserve commitment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything else about graduation we need to know, or did you graduate with special honors from Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: I did.  I graduated with top honors at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, one thing I know that was going on in '79 [1979], when you were graduating, was later on that year, in the fall, was the Iran Hostage Crisis.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  I guess--I don't know when that started, but I know it went on through the fall, through the beginning of 1980.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So I was in my basic course training at the Quartermaster School, so I don't think--because it was logistics, I don't think we were as attuned to, you know, the current events and how it would impact us, right, as most were.  You know, I think it would have been a little bit different for those who were in the combat arms arena at that time, so.  But when I was commissioned, I was commissioned in the [U.S. Army] Quartermaster Corps and that was before my--before I was accepted to flight school.  Yeah, so we knew of it going on, but we weren't able to relate it to how it would impact us.
Speaker 1: Now there was something I think you might have taken note of, if I'm not mistaken, and that's the crashing of a couple of helicopters in an attempted rescue mission, right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was called October surprise, I think.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So we knew about that too, but then, of course, I wasn't in aviation then, right, exactly.  So I would learn more about that later once I got to flight school at Fort Rucker [Alabama], right, because that's where it was really being studied.
Story_ID: 36712
Speaker 1: So, you were assigned as a Second Lieutenant in the [U.S. Army] Quartermaster Corps, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So when I got commissioned--when you are in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], you have to choose your branch at the beginning of your senior year.  You choose your preferences for a branch.  What do you want to do and what do you want to be.  And, you know, so by this time, we had cadre at Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama], which was a first for us.  We had some white cadre members. So, this was new, I think in my junior year is when we got our first Commission Officer, Caucasian instructor, right.  And we still keep in contact today, right.  He was an Army aviator, right.  Our PMS, Professor of Military Science was an Army aviator, and we also had another instructor that was--black instructor that was an Army aviator also.
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute.  Now, did they influence you to (laughs)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  (laughs)
Speaker 1: --think about aviation?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, what influenced me, when I went to summer camp--you mentioned summer camp, which was at Fort Riley, Kansas, is where we went to summer camp, and that, for me, that was the first time I would have gone--gotten on a commercial airline, right, exactly.  So Columbus, Georgia, to Atlanta [Georgia] was one of the small aircraft, right.  And I swore I would never get back in an aircraft again if I ever got my feet on the ground just because of the turbulence, right, from Columbus to Atlanta, right.  Much larger plane, of course, going into Kansas City, Missouri, out of Atlanta, right, had a much smoother ride, so, okay; we may be able to do this.  But at summer camp we were introduced, you know, different branches, right, the artillery, you know, the infantry, which females couldn't go into at that time; but you got an introduction of all the other branches, right.  And I got my first ride on a helicopter, right, which was the Chinook CH-47, in the back of that helicopter.  So by the time summer camp was over, I came back, and I told my mom [Annie Lee Knighton] I wanted to go to flight school.  And she was like, "Okay.  This is the person who was not going to get back on the airplane in Atlanta."  (laughs)  Right.  Exactly  Right.  "And you're telling me now that you want to fly?"  Yeah.  Exactly.  So she said, "If that's something you want to do, then you need to go for it, you know, do it."  So with her encouragement, right, and her thumbs up, or seal of approval--when it came to selecting branches, we had--they also said, "Well, what additional training do you want?"  And at time, aviation was a branch.  It was an additional skill identifier, right, just like airborne.  So, "Who wants to go to airborne school?  Who wants to do this and who wants to go to flight school?"  So when the flight school--when he asked for flight school, my hand went up, right.  And everybody else was like, yeah, right (laughs).  Exactly.  So you would think with the Tuskegee Airmen coming out of Tuskegee you would have had more hands going up.  But I think you did on the Air Force ROTC side, just not on the Army ROTC side, yeah, 'cause most people wanted to fly, kind of wanted Air Force ROTC.  Right.  So, right, the instructor, Major Marshal Ed (ph.) said, "Hey, Ms. Knighton, I need you to stay afterwards."  And so I stayed afterwards, and he says, "Don't waste my time."  (laughs)  Right.  "If this is something that you really want to do, you know, I'll help you and we'll pursue it.  But, you know, if you're not serious about it, then don't waste my time."  So I didn't waste his time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now history has shown that you have not wasted his time.
Speaker 2: Right (laughs).
Story_ID: 36713
Speaker 1: But tell me, was there any, at the time that you decided to go to flight school, was there any role for a pilot in the [U.S. Army] Quartermaster Corps?
Speaker 2: There was--the one instructor that we had there was Quartermaster Aviator.  Right.  But soon after, the Quartermaster Branch got rid of all of its aviators, right, that were--it was no longer a carrier branch for aviators.  Right.  And knowing that, you know, the branches that I put in for were Field Artillery, Air Defense Artillery, and Transportation was number three.  But the branch that I got was Quartermaster.  Right.  So it not being a carrier branch any longer meant, okay, you can't go to flight school, but this particular instructor helped me to kind of pursue that, which resulted in a branch transfer.  But branch told me we're sending you to Quartermaster School anyway, right, you go to Flight School, and if you pass, then we'll consider changing your branch to something else.  Right.  So I went to Flight School--I went to Quartermaster Training, right, and I took the shortest course, which was Supply, so that I could get to Flight School right away after graduating.  I showed up at Fort Eustis, Virginia, the home of Transportation, with Aviation Wings on, a Quartermaster Brass, and I thought they were going to die (laughs).  You know, it's like, "Who are you, and where did you come from?"  You know, and my branch manager, my new branch manager from Transportation drove down my change of branch right away, so they saw I was branch transferred to the Transportation Corps, which was a carrier branch.  And most women that were in Aviation during that time were in Transportation because we were test pilots, because we couldn't do the other missions that combat aviators did.
Story_ID: 36714
Speaker 1: You trained on a helicopter, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, did you start off on a helicopter--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or did they--
Speaker 2: Started out on helicopters.  And I stayed helicopters the whole time.  Right.  So you start out on a very small helicopter called TH-55, and then you graduate to larger helicopters, right.  And I graduated from Flight School flying a UH-1 Huey Helicopter, which is the one you see in most of the Vietnam [War] era movies.  Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: And then later during my career, I transitioned into the Black Hawk helicopter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had never really flown any other kind of plane before--well, you know, any other kind of--
Speaker 2: Well, the plan was to get my Fixed Wings Certification before I graduated college [Tuskegee Institute, Alabama].  So that was what the PMS, my Professor of Military Science, the lieutenant colonel had said, "So, okay, right, you want to go to Flight School.  We're going through this process with you to help you get there, but we need to get you flying before you get to Flight School, and that's going to be a big advantage for you."  But part of Home Economics Education and graduating in the educational field, I was required to do student teaching.  Wouldn't have been a problem if I had done it locally, but I got selected to participate in a student teaching program that was in Rochester, New York.  So I did my student teaching in Rochester, which took me completely, you know, away from the Tuskegee home base, right.  So, that--and that was my senior year that I would have been doing the flight training.  But I did get Ground School Training, right, from Chief Anderson, right; Alfred C. Anderson, who got to fly Eleanor Roosevelt, which helped get it started.
Speaker 1: This is--really.  The Chief Anderson?
Speaker 2: Exactly. (laughs)  Yes.  Right.  I know.  I know.
Speaker 1: And how old was Chief Anderson at that point?
Speaker 2: Pretty old.  Yep.  But he was still doing instruction, right, out at the air field.  He did that, but his job on the side, and most people didn't even know that he was, you know, unless you knew a little bit about, you know, Tuskegee Airmen and the history, you would have think Chief Anderson was just a little old man who ran a laundromat on campus, right, 'cause that's what he did.  Exactly.  But, you know, right, Chief Anderson, he was so much more than that, and not a lot of people knew that just because of how humble he was, right.  So he was one person at the air field, and he was a totally different person on the campus at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Gee whiz.  That's something.  Okay.  So Chief Anderson--I've heard lots of stories about him.
Speaker 2: Right.  So I did some Ground School Training with him, right, in preparation for taking the Flight School examination.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 36715
Speaker 1: How many weeks was flight training?
Speaker 2: Flight training at Fort Rucker [Alabama] is nine months long, right.  I tell people it'll take you as long to birth those wings as it does to bring a kid into the world.  Yeah, so nine months of training for aviation qualification.  To do solo, you can do your solo flight at or about ten hours, right; meaning, you get to go up all by yourself, right, after only ten hours of actual hands-on flight training, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And, let's see now.  You were the--were you the--I have a note here that you were the second black woman in the United States to get that kind of training?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.  So Marcella Ng graduated--Marcella Ng, Ng.  Marcella, M-A-R-C-E-L-L-A.  Marcella, Hayes is her maiden name, H-A-Y-E-S, Ng, N-G, is her married name.  Right.  Exactly.  So my Marcella graduated in July, I believe, and I graduated in August from flight training.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were basically at school at the same time.
Speaker 2: Right.  We were in school at the same time, yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, what was the most difficult part of Flight School?
Speaker 2: The most difficult part of Flight School?  I think instruments.  Learning to fly, you know, and trusting instrumentation 'cause it's--you know, flying by instruments is, you know, is totally different from what you are taught to do, right.  And, you know, you can totally get disoriented if you're not trusting your instruments, 'cause you're in the clouds for the most part when you're on the instruments, and that's the reason for it.  So flying by instrumentation versus flying by the seat of your pants and visually.  Right, so you've instrument flight rules, IFR, right, and you have visual flight rules, your VFR.  So, right, human nature tells you that VFR is the way to go, right, and when you're flying IFR, you will have to put your complete trust and faith into the technology itself.
Story_ID: 34479
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how were you treated?  You know I'm going to ask this question.  Now, you're a black woman, so you're a woman--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and often you kind of hear people say, "What is a woman doing trying to learn how to fly?"  And then you're black, too.  So did you get--this is 1979, so did you get like a--did anybody come at you like that?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was there, right.  But you got to remember where we are, right, for flight training we're in lower Alabama [Fort Rucker, Alabama] (laughs), right, exactly, which, you know--I think the biggest--my biggest fear going to school [Tuskegee Institute], in Alabama, right, the first thing that you see when you cross into--Georgia line into the state of Alabama was a big billboard of George Wallace, "Welcome to Alabama."  Right.  And all I could think about when I saw that billboard was, "Okay.  This is the man who stood in the door of the University of Alabama to keep black people out, so.  Right.  So, of course, you still have that same kind of attitude that kind of resonated around.  I was fortunate enough for my instructor, right; they took a volunteer to see who was going to train me (laughs).  Exactly.  So.  Right.  So, and the person that was my trainer, which I found out later, right, actually volunteered to, you know, to be my trainer, right.  But most people just wanted to see--because Marcella [Hayes Ng] and I weren't the first African American females to attempt to go to flight school.  We were the first two to successfully graduate from flight school, to complete it.  Right.  So, I think--
Speaker 1: So that means the others washed out.
Speaker 2: Right.  The others washed out, right.  So I think they probably all thought that, "Okay.  Right.  Here comes another one that's probably going to wash out, right, just like some of the other ones did, right."  But Marcella and I, you know, were fortunate enough to prove them wrong, right.  Right.  So the instructor that I had was--for my primary training was a very easygoing, kind of--he was your typical Vietnam-era, right, pilot that you think of, right.  Retired war officer that retired from--that retired from the military, and I called him "Daddy Barnes."  (laughs)  Right.  Exactly.  And he was a really good flight instructor.  And his objective was the same thing.  He wanted the same thing I want, right, was for me to graduate successfully and pass through primary training, right.  He said that he was--people didn't tell--told him that I probably wouldn't solo until I had fifteen hours of primary flight training.  So I think they had set the bar much higher and farther out for me than they did for the average students.  Student--most of the students were, you now, between 9, 10, 11 hours, was pretty much the range.  Right.  I soloed at exactly 10 hours.  Right.  And he--I found out later in conversation, people were like, "Do you really know what you're doing?"  Right.  "Why are you letting her go so soon?"  And it wasn't so soon, it was pretty much on par with everybody else, so.  So I was fortunate enough for my primary training to get a really good instructor.
Story_ID: 34480
Speaker 1: For my advanced helicopter training after primary, I wasn't as fortunate, right.  Exactly.  I had a military instructor, military war officer, because there was--there was a mix of--in advanced training, you had a mix of military instructors and civilian, Department of Army civilian instructors.  And I had an instructor who wanted to prove that, you know, black women couldn't fly or shouldn't be flying.  Right.  So, unfortunately, I was put up for what's called a--pink slips is what you get for--when you have a bad day of flying, right.  Usually when you have a bad day, you get a, you know, you get a pink slip and it tells you what you're doing wrong.  You have to--you get three pink slips in a row, then you're put up for what's called a "prog ride," a progressive ride to see if you're progressing to the point that you need to be at this stage of your training.  Right.  So it was wintertime, I wasn't feeling that good.  I went in, I told my instructor, like, you know, "Hey, I'm not feeling real good this day," but, you know, I don't want to go--you don't want to go on sick call because when you go on sick call, you can get set back two classes behind you.  Flight School, you wear different color hats.  So everybody tells you, right--so my class hat was orange.  So the motto is to keep that orange--whatever color hat you're wearing and keep that orange hat flying.  If you get set back, everybody knows 'cause you're in a different color hat.  Right.  So there's a lot of pressure to stay up and to stay with your class, right.  If you get prog rides, and you get so many, you can be set back to a different phase of training.  They can give you additional training hours, then you go to this class so you get the additional training.  Right.  So that same day that I told him I wasn't feeling that good, I didn't do that bad and I wish I hadn't said anything about not feeling good.  So we get back after my flight and he pulls out the pink slip, right.  So that was my first pink slip, and he says, "And, by the way, you're getting a prog ride tomorrow."  I'm like, wait a minute, the rules are, right, you get a prog ride after three pink slips consecutively.  Right.  Exactly.  It was, like, "You know, I thought you did so bad today that you should go for a prog ride."  Right.  So at that time at Fort Rucker, we had a pretty good network, and, of course, Tuskegee had made some connections, right, people knew that I was coming.  Right.  PMS [Professor of Military Science] had a relationship with Fort Rucker [Alabama] and with the base, so he called--had called some people to let them know I was coming, right, and these were people who said, "Hey, stay connected with us when you get there."  So I made a phone call as soon as I left the flight line saying, "I got a prog ride tomorrow."  And they're like, "Wait a minute.  Just saw you this weekend, you said things were going well.  How is it that you've gone from things going well on Saturday to this being Wednesday, and you're going up for a prog ride?"  And I told them what had happened.  And they said, "Well, you sound terrible.  How you feeling?"  I was like, "Well, you know, I've got a pretty bad cold."  And they said, "Go on sick call."  Right.  So I went on sick call, right, and got grounded for middle ear infection, right, that kind of set me back medically--so I got set back on a medical setback.  Right.  Went back to the class after the medical, right.  My new instructor was the flight lead in a different class, and I'm in the yellow hat now, exactly.  And I graduated ahead--from that phase of training, ahead of the rest of my class.  I flew with that flight instructor.  I went back, I reported to him and said, "Hey, I'm supposed to get a prog ride."  And he said, we're not giving you a prog ride."  And I said, "Well, I was supposed to get one before I left."  And he was like, you know, "It's a different set of rules here."  Right.  "And you're going to fly with me and we're going to advance you as fast as we can."  Yeah, so it was still there.  Right.  Exactly.  It wasn't as overt, right, probably as some people who had gone ahead of me, right.  But, yeah, because women were still new to aviation and still, you know, most black aviators all knew each other, right, still in the African American community.
Story_ID: 34481
Speaker 1: Now you were being trained on the Huey [military helicopter], right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  In the advanced training.  Primary is--they don't even do primary training in a different helicopter now.  You kind of start out in the same aircraft you graduate in.  Yeah, but we started out in a little TH-55, which is almost like driving--it's the difference between driving a manual car--a car, you know, with, you know manual shift versus automatic, right.  So that's how you start out, you know, because they really want you to get a feel for flying and for the technology, right, and what governs the aircraft, what governs the transmission, you know, the engine.  So a much, much less sophisticated aircraft, but very basic in teaching you hovering skills, landings, takeoff; all the basic concepts of flying.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What are some of the--what's the capacity of a Huey?  I mean in terms of--what can it do?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The Huey is aircraft that was used in Vietnam that you saw in mostly for troop carrier, right.  So it had the capability of being armed, right, and it was armed in Vietnam, so it was used as a gun ship, as well as being used as a transport aircraft.  But it's a Bell Helicopter product, right, and Bell Helicopter also produced the Cobra, which came on board also during the Vietnam Era and was the gunship.  So two-seaters, right, you have a pilot and you have a gunner, right, on board that aircraft.  The other Bell Helicopter product was a smaller aircraft called an OH-58, which was observation, used for cavalry missions and scout missions.  But the Huey could pretty much do all of those missions.  But, you know, because of the advent of the new tech--of what was then new technology and the types of aircraft, you specialize.  So most women got Hueys, right, exactly, to fly in the Hueys, right, for logistics purposes, because that's where we were kind of put into the logistics arena and not into the combat arms area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How does it feel to fly a Huey?
Speaker 2: It felt good.  The Hueys are, you know, it's a good aircraft, and it still flies.  They still have them right here at Fort Belvoir [Virginia].  They fly a lot of the people out of the Pentagon, VIP missions, so, right.  It's a workhorse, right.  I think it'll be around for a very, very long time.  And the joke that we had was about when the Black Hawk [helicopter] came on board, like, yeah, Black Hawk's great, it's new, it's sophisticated, right, you know, great technology, but when they retired the Black Hawk, it's going to be a Huey crew that goes and pick up the Black Hawk crew and fly them back to base, so, right.  So, I think Hueys will be around for a long time in some capacity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 34482
Speaker 1: So you finished your [flight] training [at Fort Rucker, Alabama] in--
Speaker 2: I finished the training in '80 [1980], right.  Exactly.  So I graduated from Flight School in '80 [1980] and attended my first Tuskegee Airmen Convention the day after I graduated, you know, from flight training.  That was in Atlanta [Georgia], right.  That's where they had the convention, and the commander, General McNair, at Fort Rucker was their speaker on that Thursday night, right, at the Tuskegee Airmen Convention.  And he came back on Friday, the graduation, saying, "Hey, they're asking for you."  (laughs)  "They're asking for you," at the Tuskegee Airmen Convention.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So had you ever met the Tuskegee Airmen before?  I mean a lot of them--I mean, you met, you know, Chief [Alfred] Anderson--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but this is all the Tuskegee Airmen that--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you get there, I guess--
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Exactly.  That was in 1980, and this was--Atlanta was big, you know.  Because whenever they do Atlanta, they get to go back to Tuskegee [Alabama] and go to Moton Field, right.  So you have a very, very large turnout whenever it's back anywhere close to Tuskegee.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, these guys are now--they're in their mid-sixties, I guess, Tuskegee (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: They still--they can still tell their stories--it's whittled--it's been whittled down now--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: --decimated, really; there are very few left.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: But then they were--
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  And they all had a story to tell, and they all wanted to share their story, right, about, you know, about aviation.  That was the first time where I saw Chief Anderson being honored and to see how much he really, really meant to that group of people, you know, en masse, right.  They--the general who was the first aviator, General Peterson from the Marine Corps--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --right, was at that convention.  He was still--
Speaker 1: Frank Peterson.
Speaker 2: --right, Frank Peterson--he was still on active duty then.  Right.  Exactly.  So I can remember saying, "Wow, he looks mean."  You know, he looked like a Marine (laughs).  Yeah.  Exactly.  So, yes, so it was all right.  It was a great convention and a great way to get my start.  We had chapter of the Tuskegee Airmen at Fort Rucker that General McNair really encouraged, right.  So it was only fitting for him.  We had--one of the Tuskegee Airmen was on the faculty and staff at Fort Rucker, Mr. Crenshaw, yeah, who was there and retired, right, and had been a part of the Tuskegee Airmen as well.  So we all knew that, and he a part of the chapter meetings that we would have down at Fort Rucker as well.  And there were some Tuskegee Airmen in and around Tuskegee; Herbert Carter, right, who was an instructor, just recently passed away.  Right.  Yeah.  I knew that he was a Tuskegee Airman when I was in school, right, and been a part of the Tuskegee experiment; or as the Tuskegee Airmen like to say, "The Tuskegee Experience."  Right.  Exactly.  So, I knew he was there, but what I didn't know was about his wife, right, exactly; Mildred Carter, who did some training with the Tuskegee Airmen, but because she was a woman, right, she was not allowed to be a part of the Tuskegee experience, right, and because she was black, she was not allowed to be a part of the Air Force experience with the women who did the flights between the main Europe and England, so.  Right.  So it wasn't until years later that I learned about her contribution in aviation, you know.  And as she was fly--learned to fly even in the '40s [1940s].  Right.
Speaker 1: That's something I wasn't even aware of (laughs).
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: You're telling me something--
Speaker 2: But Herbert Carter, who was a Tuskegee Airman, was her husband.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34483
Speaker 1: Okay, so with this graduation [from advanced pilot training at Fort Rucker, Alabama] and this great [Tuskegee Airmen] convention [1980] and stuff, you begin your career as a pilot.
Speaker 2: Right.  Begin my career as an [U.S.] Army Aviator, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, you were--from what I understand, you were assigned in '81 [1981] to the Transportation Corps, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So, when I graduated from Flight School, then the second phase of my training was the maintenance course, Aviation Maintenance, which required Ground School training and then the test pilot phase.  So, right.  So this was about the Hueys [helicopter].  So you go learn all of the systems, right, of the aircraft.  So, right.  So that was at Fort Eustis, Virginia, where that training took place.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think now it's down at Fort Rucker.  But, yeah, Fort Eustis, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.  So when this training was over, you were assigned to V-Corps?
Speaker 2: Right.  Fifth Corps--
Speaker 1: Fifth Corps.  All right.
Speaker 2: And my duty station was at Fliegerhorst Kaserne in Hanau, Germany; right.  Part of Fifth Corps.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Fifth Corps.  Okay.  All right.  I'm calling it V-Corps (laughs).
Speaker 2: Right.  Some people refer V as, you know, kind of slang for Fifth Corps.  There were two corps in Germany at that time; Fifth Corps and Seventh Corps.  And General [Julius] Becton [also a HistoryMaker] commanded Seventh Corps, right, and Fifth Corps was the other corps.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did you do in Germany?
Speaker 2: Right.  So I started out in Germany as a Flight Section Leader, so, right, and that--but in the battalion that I was assigned to, they had a small section of flight--it had two fixed-winged aircraft and had the Hueys that were assigned to the battalion.  But it was an Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Battalion, which was the highest level of maintenance before the aircraft came back to the [United] States to go to Corpus Christi Army Depot [Texas].  Right.  Right.  And I was assigned there as a maintenance officer along with a bunch of other lieutenants who were right out of flight school.  Right.  I think based on the authorization, those slots were actually captain slots, but because of the shortage of maintenance pilots, right, they assigned us right out of flight school, right out of training; and my battalion commander, I think when I got there, I was the last straw (laughs).  So, right.  So he wasn't very happy when I showed up to his battalion as one of his test pilots, so.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, what happened, what did--I mean, did they--
Speaker 2: Right.  So he--his assignment prior to being selected for battalion command and prior to coming to Germany had been at Headquarters DA, at the Department of Army Headquarters, right, working aviation maintenance issues, right, on the [U.S.] Army staff.  So he wrote a letter back, and he was, you know, he was kind enough-"kind enough" to share the letter with me that he was writing back to say, right, "I have these authorizations for captains which should be seasoned aviators not on their first tour of duty," right, "and you just sent me--and the Headquarters DA just sent me all of these brand-new second lieutenants right out of the Maintenance Corps, and I've got to--and I'm not equipped to train them."  Yep.  But he didn't choose to write that letter prior to my arrival; only after I got there.  So I used his letter to my advantage.  I didn't know I was using it at--to my advantage at the time.  It could have been to my detriment, right, and I wrote a rebuttal, you know, saying--right.  So he writes this letter, and then I'm supposed to get the training that I need, and I'm supposed to get blessed by, right, the instructor, right, that works for him, right.  So it appeared that I couldn't do anything right with this particular instructor pilot, right, once I got to my unit, even though I had passed both Flight School, right, Maintenance Corps, and the Test Pilot Phase, right.  But, if you would read--you know, what he would write up about me, you know it was as if I shouldn't even solo, like I was about at the ten-hour level.  So I used that to my advantage, right.  I wrote a rebuttal to his letter and told that, you know, my objective and goal in life was to be the best Army helicopter pilot and maintenance test pilot that I could be and that I didn't think that it was the right environment, and I requested a reassignment.  You know, exactly.  And, right.  And I walked that to one of my former ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] instructors who was at Fifth Corps headquarters, right, who knew someone in personnel, right, and was able to get reassigned outside of that battalion to a Line Company, not a Maintenance Company, right, as another flight section leader, which the primary mission of that unit was to fly the staff of Fifth Corps headquarters.  So I used that to get a reassignment and to work with the battalion commander who was much more welcome to having me within--in his command.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34484
Speaker 1: Now, there's some advantage--I've heard other people discuss when they work with a battalion commander, then you get a different kind of education, a different perspective that you don't get unless you're around them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  They're thinking at a higher level, and, right.  And I don't think--I think that the battalion commander had a valid argument.  It's just that I think he had a valid argument when the first Second Lieutenant got sent to him, right, not when number five got sent to him, right.  What happened between number one, getting there; and all of a sudden number five is here and you can no longer--right.  This is totally unacceptable to the point where you have to elevate it to--all the way back to Headquarters DA [the Department of Army headquarters].  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, unfortunately, what I didn't know at the time is the same situation that I was in in my command, Marcella Ng was in in the Fifth Corps, right, 'cause we went to sister battalions, right.  And I was astute enough, I guess, to say, "Hey, something's wrong here," right, "and this shouldn't be happening to me."  Marcella, on the other hand, was thinking, "Hey, this is the 1980s and I'm sure this is not happening to me because of my race.  Yeah, exactly.  So she wasn't--she chose not to fight hers.  So as a result, she stayed Transportation when Aviation become a branch, and she never got to fly again.  So.
Speaker 1: Well, that's terrible, you now, because she just--had she raised some hell--
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  And if we had had better communications between the two of us, right, I think we would have been able to, you know, say--right.  But when I talked to her, it was pretty much after the fact.  She had already--her wings had already been, you know, clipped, right.  She had already been permanently grounded, never to fly again.  But she fulfilled a twenty-year career and successfully commanded a Transportation battalion.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34485
Speaker 1: So where did you--where were you reassigned to?
Speaker 2: Right.  I was reassigned to 11th Aviation Battalion, which was in Frankfurt, Germany; right, and I became a Flight Section Leader, right.  And then shortly, thereafter, right, once becoming a pilot in command, I was signed off as a Maintenance Test Pilot, and I took over as an Aviation Maintenance Platoon Leader.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you're a platoon leader.  Now had your rank changed at this point at all?
Speaker 2: Only from Second Lieutenant to First Lieutenant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  And once I was a Platoon Leader for a while, I was promoted to Captain.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How long did that take?
Speaker 2: Captain was a little bit over four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, now is that about right in terms of advancement?
Speaker 2: At that time it was it, but I think now it's three years and something.  So it's changed a bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now this is 19--we're still--we're like 1980--
Speaker 2: Yeah, '82 [1982], '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: '82 [1982], '83 [1983].  Okay.
Story_ID: 34486
Speaker 1: Now what happened in '84 [1984], were you--well, yeah--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Where were you transferred to in '83 [1983]?
Speaker 2: '84 [1984], right.  Was it '83 [1983] or '84 [1984] that I became--I joined the staff of the battalion, became the Battalion S4.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So this is--you become an S4 in--
Speaker 2: Right, which is--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is the logistics officer for the battalion.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So--and this is still in Germany?
Speaker 2: Right.  This is still in Germany, and still in the 11th Aviation Battalion.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.  So--
Speaker 2: So that was in Frankfurt, and then the battalion moved.  Part of my responsibilities were--is to relocate the battalion to Wiesbaden Air Base [Wiesbaden, Hesse, Germany].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are your, you know, duties?  Are you flying?
Speaker 2: Right.  I still had the duties to maintain my currency in flight, so I did that.  At this time, Reforger exercises were big in Germany in return of forces to Germany, right.  So everything that you did, right, all year was pretty much in preparation for this big exercise.  And it would rotate between the Corps, Fifth Corps and Seventh Corps, right, as far as--in terms of maneuvers.  But for the--well, the aviation battalions, right, it was every year, because we would do the VIP missions on the years when we weren't doing our tactical exercises.  So, right.  Aviation maintenance was for the whole entire battalion as far as monitoring the status and ensuring, right, parts were available and helping out with some of the challenges that was my responsibility as far as all of the other logistics for ground vehicles and maintenance of facilities as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were in Germany until '85 [1985]?
Speaker 2: Right, until '85 [1985].  Right.  So my initial tour of duty was for three years.  At that time, the Aviation Branch was coming on board, right.  I did not want to be--I didn't want to go to Transportation Advanced Course, right, being an aviator, right, knowing that the branch was coming on board.  And I didn't want to be in the first two classes, right, of the Aviations Advanced Course because I knew they were the test classes, right.  So I extended in Germany for a year--and to be in the third class, right, which I felt would had been tested and proven by that time, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So.  So this is--so you're going to--
Speaker 2: So I would have come out in '84 [1984], and I extended for a year to come out of Germany in '85 [1985].
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Story_ID: 34487
Speaker 1: So Fort Hood [Texas], now, you are assigned to the 1st Cavalry?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  I got back to the [United] States, right.  My desire was to stay in Alabama to be close to home, because I only came home twice in my first year, and for three years I didn't return to the States, right, until I rotated back.  So, yeah, I'm from Georgia, of course, went to school in Alabama [Tuskegee Institute]; I thought, you know, hey, I want to stay at Fort Rucker [Alabama].  So that was what I put at the top of my list.  So I got a call from the branch chief, Aviation Branch Chief, who at that time happened to be a Tuskegee grad, right, Moses Erkins (ph.), and an aviator, and he's like, "What are you trying to do?"  And I was like, "What do you mean what am I trying to do?"  He's like, "Why you asking to stay at Fort Rucker?"  And I said, "You know, I just came out of Germany.  I'm glad to be home and I want to be close to home."  And he says, "Well, the only thing I have for you--", the only thing a maintenance officer does at Fort Rucker is monitor the contract, 'cause all of the maintenance was contract maintenance.  So he said, "You can go to Fort Hood, you can go to Fort Campbell [Kentucky], or you can go to Fort Bragg [North Carolina].  Pick one."  Right.  So.  (laughs)  So I go, "Okay.  All right.  Let's go for Fort Hood."  So I--that's how I ended up at Fort Hood in the First Cavalry Division.
Speaker 1: Okay, Okay.  So what were your activities there at Fort Hood?  What did you do?
Speaker 2: I did everything from Section Leader, again, in a Maintenance Company, all the way to Company Command.  When I left out of Fort Hood after four years, I gave up Company Command and then rotated to Korea.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34488
Speaker 1: Now, all right.  So Korea, now this is--you're with the 2nd Infantry Division--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --correct.
Speaker 2: You know, 2nd Infantry Division, 2ID, yeah.
Speaker 1: You're the Aviation Brigade Logistics Officer.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So similar to what I did in Germany, right, but at a different level.  Right.  So instead of one Battalion, it was a combination of the three Battalions that I made up the Brigade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you still a captain at this point?
Speaker 2: I was still a captain on the--but I had been selected for major, so I was--it was a major's position, and I was on a promotion list for major.  So I was captain promotable then the entire time--year that I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now any stories from the Korean tour?
Speaker 2: Tough tour.  Exactly.  Just, you know, I felt Korea, right, I had been in Germany for 3, 4 years, Korea would be a piece of cake.  But it was a difficult culture, right.  Different kind of mission, right.  Germany, yeah, I felt, you know, free.  I traveled, did different things.  Korea and the 2nd Infantry Division, you're on the border, right, exactly, between, you know, the North and South--southern Korean border, so, you don't have the freedoms that you would have.  And, you know, Asian culture is a lot different than European culture, which is a lot similar to American culture, so.  So it was a bit different, right.  Anytime you went outside of the perimeter of the airfield, you had to have permission, and that was different for me.  Anytime you walked out of your BOQ [Bachelor Officer Quarters] room, you know, you were saluted, 'cause everybody recognized you as to who you were regardless of which of the units.  You can stand on one side of the installation and see all the way to the other side of the installation.  So it was a--it was a different type of--different type of duty.
Story_ID: 36716
Speaker 1: Okay.  So any stories about--any other stories about the Korean Tour?
Speaker 2: No.  It was a good tour.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I mean, I learned a lot, right.  But I think one year was probably long enough in that environment.  You know, there are--some people--there's just a big difference between if you're in Seoul [South Korea], right, or if you're in the Division.  So being in the Division based on the mission of the Division, where you're on one-hour recall, so what if they--you have to make it back to duty from wherever you are, right, in one hour, you know.  The horn goes off.  So you know that it is real, you know, and it's real every day.  So for everyone serving in a Division, even to this very day, right, exactly, that one-hour recall still exists.  So you're there, and you're living it, right, and you recognize that any day, right, it could be the difference between peace and war, so.  So a very vital lesson in knowing the importance of what you do and being good at what you do.
Speaker 1: I know yesterday William [E.] Ward [also a HistoryMaker] was telling us about an American officer that was killed with axes because he got--
Speaker 2: Yeah, on the border.
Speaker 1: --around that same--around the time that you were there.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Yep.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So it's a real and present danger--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --even though we don't hear a lot about--
Speaker 2: Clear--right.  Clear and present danger.
Speaker 1: --the tensions (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  Unlike, Germany, you know, there was a, you know, big space, right.  I was in Germany when it was East Germany and West Germany, right, exactly.  But, right, you had to fly a ways to get to the border even from Frankfurt [Germany], you know.  Exactly.  But, you know, being in the Division, you are on the border unlike--in Germany you an ACR, an Armored Cavalry Regiment that was on the border every day.  And in Korea, you got an entire Division that's on the border for the most part every day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 36717
Speaker 1: After a year [in Korea] you came back to Gulfport, Mississippi, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  I came--
Speaker 1: --somewhere around Keesler?
Speaker 2: --no.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  I came back to Kansas.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  So.  Right.  I came back to Kansas.  I had been--in addition to being selected for major, I had been selected for Command and General Staff College [CGSC], right--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --at that point.  And that was in about '89 [1989], '90 [1990] time frame?
Speaker 1: That's '90 [1990].  You're right.  1990.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  In 1990 time frame.
Speaker 1: Now, this is--is this during the Gulf War?
Speaker 2: It was right at the beginning of the Gulf War.  So I made it out of Korea, I guess, before the [U.S.] Army executed what's called Stop-Loss.  Right.  So I was pretty much in transition when the Gulf War was starting to kick off, or starting to, you know, fester, right.  So I came back--I came to Fort Leavenworth to be prepositioned for the class of Command at General Staff College that would start the next summer.  So it was, like, November when I got back.  Right.  So I was assigned to a study group at Leavenworth in preparation for going to [Army] War College the following year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so.  Now is this--tell us about CALL.
Speaker 2: Center for Army Lessons Learned?  Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So the worst place for an officer who has felt like they've trained for all their life to go to the war that we envisioned, that was going to kick off in Iraq, is to be in a training base--at a training base or training institution.  So.  There are people who--or actually tried their best to get out of school, the school that they had been selected for, because, you know, hey the war has kicked, right, exactly; and I'm at school for a year and I can't go anywhere.  So I kind of felt the same way, you know, I had trained with this unit and the unit that I had done the majority of my training with was out of First Cavalry Division, right.  So it was a matter of, you know, how do I get to--how do I get to Saudi Arabia, how do I get to Kuwait, how do I get to Iraq to, you know, to be a part of this.  So the opportunity came with the Center for Army Lessons Learned, right, which was a rare opportunity for the people assigned to Fort Leavenworth.  But, because I wasn't in school yet, right, I could--I volunteered to be with the Center for Army Lessons Learned to work with the aviation units and collecting observations, which later became Lessons Learned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The benefit of that, right, versus being with one unit, I got to see every aviation operation that was ongoing, right, in the theatre of operations at that time.  So all the way from, you know, from Riyadh [Saudi Arabia] all the way up and to Iraq.  I did assessments on aviation units and captioned observations; what went wrong, right, what went well, you know, so that we could make aviation operations better.  And my focus, being on--based on my background, was on the maintenance side of the house, on the logistics side; what can we do better as far as the logistics is concerned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36718
Speaker 1: What were some of your recommendations, can you tell us?
Speaker 2: I think, you know, the way that we set up operations and the type of equipment that we use, of course.  The sand took--or was a real detriment to aviation operations, because in the Middle East, you have sand that's like--it's very, very fine, and it gets into everything, right.  So it can get into your gearboxes, it can get into your transmissions, right.  So we did a lot around, you know, how--you know, how to sustain aircraft for extended periods of operation, and where you could be doing your maintenance, which was different from California desert, right, and the sand in the California desert, which is not as fine.  And we--although we had done a lot of training there, preparations for potential operations in the Middle East or in--elsewhere, right, there was still, until we got there and on the ground.  So a different way of how--that we conduct maintenance operation in the field, what type of tentage even that you needed in order to do the operations there, impact on those kinds temperatures for a sustained period of time, right, on the maintenance of the aircraft as well.  I think, also, part of what came into play too was--we had already talked about, you know, a fighter management only from the perspective of the pilot and the copilot.  But, right, we started to look more at what that does to a maintenance crew to sustain an operations in the desert extended periods of time, right; what that does to the crew chief and what that does to a maintenance crew as well, so.  So it was a great operation and a great experience for me to be able to see everything from a--and I think we learned a lot of lessons from our sister services and the way that they conducted operations, too, in that you didn't necessarily have to be on the front lines in order to do aviation operations; that you could do it from a little bit--from a more stable platform, right, where you have access to more maintenance facilities.  Sort of like the [U.S.] Air Force does, because we now had helicopters that could do longer ranges than we did before with the Bell helicopters, the Huey, the Cobra, and with the OH-58.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, this is--now, what I was thinking when you saying that about the helicopter incident back in '79 [1979], when the attempted rescue was made--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in Iran,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I think the sand, that chocked up the--
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: --helicopter.
Speaker 2: Right.  It was sand.  And then our night vision goggle technology wasn't as advanced, right, conducting Operations at night, right.  And, you know, you can pretty much end up just flying, you know, an aircraft into the ground, right, without the proper training on night vision goggle equipment, and the sophisticated night vision technology that we have right now.  So right now, you know, you pretty much got your night vision right here on your helmet; whereas before, you know, you're weighted down a set of night vision goggles that can be used in the air or on the ground, right.  So.  So we've made quite a few advances since then, and had made quite a few between, right, that Operation Desert One and Desert Shield/Desert Storm.
Story_ID: 36719
Speaker 1: Now, Desert Shield and Desert Storm represented--I think there was a higher percentage of women in the service and with new opportunities, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  It did.
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: It did.
Speaker 1: --9.7 percent of the force, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --were women.
Speaker 2: Were woman during that time, yeah.  Exactly.  Which, in itself, I guess, presented some challenges based on the Theatre of Operations that we were in especially.  This was new for the Saudis, right, to have, you know, women in uniform, right, right, driving trucks, because this is a country where women can't drive, right--
Speaker 1: Cars, yeah.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  They can't drive cars.  Now you want your women--so there were exceptions to the policy to their culture in order that women could drive or be truck drivers, so.  So it's sad, you know.  Okay.  So your women can come but they can only drive the military vehicles, right.  Now, when I went there, we had contract vehicles, right, exactly, with the Center for Army Lessons Learned, so I actually learned to drive a stick shift just so I could drive my contract vehicle in Saudi [Arabia] (laughs), right, exactly.  So you'll get a checkpoint, right, and they'll look and they see that you're a woman, and it's like, they just wave you through  It's like, these American women, they're just going--they're going to ruin our country (laughs).  So, you know, there were places you couldn't go, you know, unless you were in military uniform or they, if you, you know, you were in uniform you had to be covered, so, you know.  Yep.  So I just wouldn't go anywhere that I had to be covered.  That was not my culture and not something I was willing to do, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, of that 9.7 percent of women in the Gulf War, 40 percent were black is what I hear.
Speaker 2: That's probably--that's a good assessment.
Speaker 1: This is a much higher percentage of black women than that are existing in the regular population.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: So.  I think black people are 11 percent of the U.S. population.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And black women would be, maybe, actually two-thirds of that, I guess, would be black women.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I think, you know, we probably had--well, not probably, but a lot of opportunities, right, are afforded to you in the military.  So where are you going to get somewhat, you know, equal treatment, right, exactly, and I think the military affords a platform for that, you know.  So equal pay for equal rank, you know, right.  If I'm a captain, if I use the service, I'm going to get the same pay as the other captain sitting next to me with the five years of service, right, so, yeah.  So you don't see--now, they may advance a little bit faster in rank than me, but--right.  But I know, by virtue of what the chart--the pay scale is, right, where I should be along that pay scale.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36720
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a problem with the conditions, the actual physical conditions in [Operation] Desert Storm [Gulf War]?
Speaker 2: I had a problem with the difference between the services and the physical conditions, right.  So the conditions that we were enduring in Desert Storm as an Army were very similar to what we endured in training, right, exactly.  Now, we've come a long way since then, right, on--you know, but I mean the [U.S.] Air Force had showers, the Air Force had--so we almost--if I was from another country, I wouldn't think that this was the same, that these were all Americans here, right (laughs), just by virtue of--in a difference in the quality of life among the different services.  So, you know, the [U.S.] Army made always made the joke about the Air Force, you know, is that they put the old club in first, then they doing their housing, and then they say, "Oh, we need money for a runway."  Yeah, exactly.  But they do have a real focus on, you know, the well-being of their service members and the quality of life of their service members.  And I think we got to see that when we were--when we were in Saudi [Arabia].  Right.  So it was like--so I started out in Riyadh, right, exactly, and the farther you got away from, you know, the city, you got in to Kuwait, and then you got in to Iraq, and, you know, the way you could find a unit was to look for, you know, the burning, you know, barrels, right, where waste was being burned.  Yeah, exactly.  So it did look like it was a totally different country.  Right.  And the closer that you get, it got foreign in the theatres, so.  So that was the problem that I had.  And I think it had started to get better.  So when I went to Somalia after that, it was somewhat better, right.  And then when I went to Bosnia, right, later on, the quality of life was even better, so.  And I would imagine on the deployments today, in talking to my husband [Bennie Williams, Jr.], who deployed, you know, the quality of life--so there's been a real focus on quality of life for long deployments, right, since Desert Shield/Desert Storm.
Story_ID: 36721
Speaker 1: One of the features of that war [Gulf War] were the--was Scud missiles.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What were--explain what Scud missile is and what it--
Speaker 2: Right.  A Scud missile is--it's not a very sophisticated missile, right.  But it can reach long ranges, and Iraq has had the capability for that, so.  So you would come under alert for a Scud missile attack if there was--if they projected that there was something incoming.  Right.  You know, they threatened to attack Israel, you know, to--and it is a way to kind of escalate and to keep people on edge at all times, so.  And then that was, in fact, the case with, right, with the techniques and tactics that the Iraqis employed.  I also think it was a distraction too because they know that they were no match for a force on force.  So it was matter of, you know, "Let's distract them," right, "with these Scud missile attacks so that we never have to confront them in a ground war."  And then--well, you saw what happened with the ground war, right?  It was supposed to last a lot, lot longer than it did and it didn't, right.  So my husband [Bennie Williams, Jr.], who was my boyfriend at the same time, had already deployed and was in Iraq, and he was with First Infantry Division, and he--they were actually the division that led the ground attack, right.  And his Company with him, as a Company Commander, was actually the Company that went into Iraq first, right, on the ground attack, yeah, exactly.  So it didn't--it was a war that didn't last very long.  So we learned lots of lessons, but we had to learn them fast because it was a--they didn't afford us the opportunity to learn very much, yeah.  There was a--it was a much weaker force than we anticipated.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think it was Saddam Hussein who said it was going to be the "mother of all battles."
Speaker 2: The "mother of all battles," yeah.
Speaker 1: But the U.S. basically, unless I'm wrong--correct me if I'm wrong here, basically crippled the state of Iraq, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Crippled its ability to attack--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and punished it and then left.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then that's what we did too with--right, I think the deployment of aviation too and the ability of helicopters to go long ranges, right.  So 'cause we led that ground attack with an Apache helicopter, right, in conjunction with the assets from the Air Force.  So I think we, you know, pretty much made an impact before the--before we ever crossed the line of departure, too, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The only thing--I just remember the pictures of long lines of Iraqis with their arms in the air.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They gave up, right, because it was, like, they had no idea what they were going to be confronted with.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36722
Speaker 1: So where were you deployed after the Gulf War?
Speaker 2: After the Gulf War, I came back to [Fort] Leavenworth [Kansas], became a part of the Aviation Study Group that I was assigned to, and then I did Command and General Staff College, which was a year long.  After Command and General Staff College [CGSC], I was assigned to 101st [Airborne Division] at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I think that, meanwhile, in that same time frame, there is a repeal on the law banning women from flying on combat missions, right--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in '92 [1992]?
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So for maintenance purposes, even in the unit that I was in, when I initially got assigned to Germany, we had, like, one of the first Cobra [helicopter] pilots, but she could only be--she could only do it for maintenance purposes, right.  Exactly.  So, the repeal of the law for, right, for women in combat units were deployed except for Special Ops Aviation.  Of course, I saw that being implemented after Fort Campbell more or less, and when I was assigned to the Human Resources Command and making assignments.  So, now you have more flexibility on where you can assign women to, right, than you did before, right.  It was before--it was--so you had to be very careful what women could go to what units, right.
Speaker 1: Now, who pushed for that for women?  Did women in the [U.S.] Army (simultaneous) and [U.S.] Air Force push for (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I think part of it was women themselves, right, exactly, doing that.  Right, I think part of it was women who had retired from the military who were able to advocate for us in a way that we couldn't advocate, right, for ourselves, still being in uniform.  I think there were some congresswomen who advocated for it also.  So, I don't know.  I think throughout history, even with the integration of forces, is that America kind of follows what the Armed Forces does, right.  I think we saw that with the integration of the Armed Forces; we saw that with women initially coming in to the military and being accepted as a part of the regular Army and not the Women's Army Corps.  So, I think industry and the private section would kind of mirror that.  And I think with the disbanding "Don't ask, don't tell," right, and bringing in homosexuals--homosexuals being able to openly serve, right; I think, you know society is more accepting, right, of that population because the military is now more accepting of the population.
Speaker 1: At the time, though it seemed like the "Don't ask, don't tell" was an advance from "If you tell, you're going to get kicked out of the Army" (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  It was an advance.  And, you know, I think--when I think of "don't ask, don't tell," I think of, you know, General [Colin] Powell, and that being among his era.  And I think it was the right policy for that time, right, exactly.  But I think the right policy for this time is exactly what we have right now; is anyone is free to serve regardless of their sexual orientation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, you're in favor of women flying on combat missions?
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  I'm still in--but I still applaud that, you know, we can--have opened it up even further, right, within this last year, right.  So part of what I've seen on my deployments is being deployed with Special Ops Aviation on the same airfield, right, but women not being able to be a part of Special Operations Unit just because they're Special Operations Unit, right, no matter--but, as an--you know, in Somalia, for instance, where that was the unit, they were one of the units I supported for Intermediate Level Maintenance, right, but I was not able to be assigned to the unit on paper, even though we were on the same--we were both at Mogadishu [Somalia], right, just in different hangers, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now did you know any women that said, "Oh, no, I don't want to be assigned to combat"?
Speaker 2: No.  Not a one.  (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.  (laughs)  Okay.  So all of the people that vehemently--
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: --you know, opposed it (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: And plus, I think the lines are blurred, you know, right.  And I think Iraq and Desert Shield/Desert Storm [Gulf War] kind of blurred where are the frontlines, you know.  When you got missiles (can that?), or targeted at--rear area operations, then who's in the most danger?  Right.  Exactly.  'Cause, you know, you can be a target anywhere on the battlefield, right.  So unless you're back in the United States, right, you're not really safe, right, supporting the combat operations from being corner spaced, then you're at risk regardless.  So why not train and equip women as well as men, right, to be able to be, right, on the frontline--in a frontline unit.  And to be honest with you, you know, there are some women that I've served with, right, exactly, they're a lot tougher than a lot of men that are serving (laughs) in combat units.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So.
Speaker 1: I think that's true in life in general.
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.  Exactly.
Story_ID: 36723
Speaker 1: Now, [Command and General] Staff College [CGSC].  Now, Staff College in Fort Campbell [Kentucky], now, is this preparing you to be a major?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Right.  The Command and General Staff College is for preparing to be a Field Grade Officer, right, and so that's what I did at Fort Leavenworth in preparation for going to Fort Campbell [Kentucky], right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  Yep.  So I served there as an Operations Officer for Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Battalion for the 1-0--, and we supported all of the aviation maintenance in all of--and all of 101st [Airborne Division], rather, right, for 101st Aviation, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are you a major at this point?
Speaker 2: Right.  I'm a major.  I got promoted to major prior to going through Command and General Staff College, and I think it was--it was before I actually deployed to Iraq with the Center for Army Lessons Learned.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  You were appointed maybe in 1991?
Speaker 2: Right, '91 [1991].  Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Story_ID: 36724
Speaker 1: Now, in '93 [1993] you assumed command of H [Hotel]-Company of the 159th Aviation Regiment.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  It was still part of the 101st [Airborne Division], right.  And it was still part of that same battalion I was in.  So I went from being the Battalion Operations Officer to being a Major Company Commander, because the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Company still had majors as commanders; unlike, you know, captains as regular aviation units.  So just by sheer virtue of the number of people you had under your command, the value of the equipment that you had within--in your unit as well.  So the day that I changed commands, right, my battalion commander whispered to me, "Come see me, you're getting ready to deploy."  Right.  And I'm like, "Deploy where?"  Right.  And so I deployed the Company to Somalia in support of United States--U.N. Operations, United Nations Operations--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --right, for Operation Restore Hope.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, 1993 is the year of the Black Hawk Down incident in Mogadishu [Somalia] run.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And that was with the Special Operations Unit that I was there in support of, so.  I was in Mogadishu and on the same airfield, right, as the 160th Aviation during the Black Hawk Down incident, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us what happened.  I hear that the crew was surprised by the--
Speaker 2: They were, but they shouldn't have been. Right.  Exactly.  Because we had had an aircraft that had been shot down from the 101st, the sister Company that was there with me from the 101st, they had had an aircraft that was shot down less than a week prior, you know.  Exactly.  So, right, their tactics were very--were not very sophisticated, right, but, you know, every now and then they got a lucky shot or, you know, they got lucky with something, so.  I think, you know, they welcomed us with open arms in the beginning when we got there, but we didn't really understand the culture, right, of the Somalis, right.  I think we said, "Oh, wow, you know."  When you look at television, look at CNN and you see all of these starving people, you know, and it's like, "Oh, wow, let's go feed the Somalis."  We didn't realize what was behind, right, the starving Somalis, and it was the fact that one tribe was starving out another tribe.  But I think as Americans, we just see black and white.  We don't see that there is a difference in people of the same color, right.  And just like, you know, we got racial differences, their tribal differences run a whole lot deeper than much of our racial differences here.  Yep.  So they're willing to starve out a whole different tribe as we saw in Rwanda, right, which kicked off shortly after what was going on.
Speaker 1: Right.  And before, right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  Right.  During that same time frame, yeah.  Right.  So we didn't have a good understanding of that, and I don't think we understood the extent that they would go to, you know, to prove themselves as being warriors, right.  They didn't look like very much.  They didn't dress in formal uniform, right.  The way you told one tribe from another is that one tribe would roll up their pants leg.  Yeah.  So, you know, we couldn't figure that out.  They all looked black to us, and they all came on the [U.S. Army] Installation during the daytime and worked, and then they went out on the night--that night and probably shot mortars back over, right, onto the base.  Right.  So.  It was a different kind of operation, one that we weren't prepared for.  And I think this is really when you start to see that, now, we know, right, the trailing edges of al-Qaeda starting to--right, starting to peek his head and raise his head in support of--in support of one tribe or the other.  It was just a great training base, and it's only become a bigger training base as the years have gone along.
Story_ID: 34498
Speaker 1: So in 1994, you spent the beginning of two years at the Army Personnel Command as the Assignments Officer for Aviation Majors and Lieutenant Colonels.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So I was assigned to Aviation Branch for a two-year period to do assignments--for the most part for my peers, right, to give them assignments to different units.  And that was those who were coming up on rotation, meaning they had served either two, three, or four years and had had what we call branch-qualifying jobs and were ready to move on to new duty stations and new responsibilities.
Speaker 1: Now, there's a rule that was dropped that year.  The [U.S.] Army dropped a rule prohibiting women from filling positions with "substantial risk of capture."  These changes opened up 90 percent of military jobs to women for the first time.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  And I was at the Human Resources Command when that was being implemented, right, also.  Not a real big impact on Aviation Units, right, because Aviation Units kind of had led the way for that, but they did open it up in a lot of other different areas, like, Military Intelligence Units.  So now women who were Military Intelligence could serve, like, an Infantry Unit as the intel-officer, whereas they hadn't--were prohibited from being in those assignments before.  Yep.  So I think aviation had led the way with that and kind of helped to be on the trailing edge of opening that up to all other women.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 34499
Speaker 1: In 1996, this is a historic year for a lot of reasons, right?  Now, you got married [to Bennie Williams, Jr.], when, in--?
Speaker 2: I got married between [Fort] Leavenworth [Kansas] and Fort Campbell [Kentucky].  So Fort Campbell was our first assignment together as husband and wife in the 101st Airborne Division, right.
Speaker 1: So that's like 1990--?
Speaker 2: That was--well, '92 [1992] we got married, right, and we stay at Fort Campbell [Kentucky] until '94 [1994].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now 1996 your son [Tre Williams] is born, right?
Speaker 2: In '95 [1995]--actually, December '95 [1995], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So this was kind of rundown time, right (laughs).  So I had two years of "woo," you know, take a breath, right, exactly, before rolling up your sleeves, you know, and going back out to the tactical Army.  So, yeah, so that was a good time to think about expanding our family, and we were able to do that, so.
Story_ID: 34500
Speaker 1: So, in '96 [1996] is when I went to--Tre [Knighton's son] was born in December of '95 [1995], and '96 [1996] the--I got a phone call saying, "Hey, where's your preference statement for where you want to be assigned if you get selected for battalion command."  This is when I was on maternity leave.  And I was like, "I didn't fill out one." (laughs).  And my desk mate was like, "What do you mean you didn't fill out one?"  And I was like, you know, I looked at the battalion command, you know, my competition.  I know that, you know, there are 32 battalions coming open.  We have 20 officers that are below us all, that leaves 12 battalions.  I looked at how many--I looked at the files of the other people, right, and, you know, I didn't figure I had a really good chance to get picked up for a battalion command, right.  Exactly.  But he was like, "Hey, I need your preference statement right away."  So that kind of gave me a clue that something was going on.  Right.  Exactly.  So I did, in fact, get picked up for battalion command.  My preference was to go back to Fort Hood [Texas] where I had command of a company, and that company now had been combined and become a battalion.  So.  The person who followed me in Korea to become the logistics officer was now in command of that battalion, right, at Fort Hood, and so that was the battalion that I put as my number one pick.  And fortunately, I was able to be slated to that battalion.
Speaker 2: Now this makes you the first woman, not the first African American woman, but the first woman in the history of the United States Army to command a tactical combat arms battalion.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So this--because don't get that.  That's why we're saying this.  You're the first woman--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to do that.
Speaker 1: Right.  Exactly.  I didn't know that then, and I think it was by virtue of, right, of just timing, right.  This battalion was a battalion that was coming up early, right, by virtue of when the person had gone in before.  So this was November of '96 [1996].  Most of the battalions were being slated for the summer of '97 [1997], so--and Fields, who--General Ann Fields, now retired, right took command the following summer, right.  I took command, like, six months prior to her.  And I think there was another woman who was selected also, right, as an Air Defender who's now a general also, right.  Yep.  She was slated for the following summer.  But, by virtue of the--my getting chosen for my unit of choice, right, and being on that same command list with them, and the way the slating worked out, I went into command about six to seven months earlier than the other women that were chosen, right, as Combat Arms Battalion Commanders.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Well, this is something, so.  You say you didn't really realize it at the time (laughs)?
Speaker 1: Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I didn't realize it, you know, at the time.  Exactly.  And I don't think it was until there was a big press release that came out about the Air Defense Artillery woman being the first female coming on as Battalion Commander.  And then people, like, well, wait a minute.  You know, Aviation Brass was like, "Hey.  Not so fast."  Right.  We--well, you know, this was like the June or July of '97 [1997] and Aviation Branch said, "Wait a minute, Army Times, we've got a woman sitting at Fort Hood and has been sitting there in command now for, like, seven months.  So, right, so we need to do some fact checking here."  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now at this point, your rank is--are you a colonel by this time?
Speaker 1: I'm a lieutenant colonel.
Speaker 2: Lieutenant colonel.
Speaker 1: Right.  Exactly.  I'd actually got promoted to lieutenant colonel, right, in August of '95 [1995].  So in the midst of my pregnancy, yeah. (laughs)
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 34501
Speaker 1: So, not only is it a first [becoming the first woman in the history of the U.S. Army to command a tactical combat arms battalion], but you were apparently doing a pretty good job.  In 1998, your--the 2nd Battalion was selected as the Aviation Unit of the Year?
Speaker 2: Unit of the Year, right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who selected--
Speaker 2: Right.  So Army Aviation Association, right, of America, right, they were selected, right, but the award wasn't given until after I was gone, right.  So, the unit, you know, was the only Assault Helicopter Battalion, right, in all of First Cavalry Division, and it supported all three brigades.  So that meant you were very busy.  You were always in a state of training or recovering from training or its date of deployment, so.  Right.  We so--NTC [National Training Center] rotations were a way of life for the battalion, so.  So it was a very, very well-trained unit, you know, that flew the most hours of any Aviation Unit, and then deployed, right, and continued to that same type of operational tempo, so.  So, you know, it was just a great unit to be a part and a great unit to take part in, and it was well trained and probably one of the best trained units in all of Army Aviation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were known as the Lobo Battalion, and everybody knew the Lobo Battalion, you know, because they seem to be everywhere.  You know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and that's quite an honor, you know.  So, yeah--yeah.  So, there was a lot of accolades that come through this and everything (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So--yeah.  Right.  I wasn't there.  There was someone else who had replaced me, so, you know, they got the high-fives and the pat on the back, but I get the satisfaction for knowing that I put them in the position to be selected, right, as the Aviation Unit of the Year.  So that was--that's a whole lot of satisfaction for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Right.  And I think the people that were there, they knew, right, how they got there, and they know the leadership that was there that led them to that award.
Story_ID: 34502
Speaker 1: Okay, so you relinquished that Command [of the 2d Battalion, 227th Aviation Unit] in November of '98 [1998].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you went on to the Pentagon, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Yep.  Exactly.  I came in to be a part of another study group that was looking at OPMS-21, how to restructure the officer systems, so I was back into the Human Resources Command arena again, right, in the G-1 arena looking at personnel issues and how to structure an Officer Corps for the future.
Speaker 1: What changes were made--I mean, what significant changes do you remember that were made in (simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right.  Functional areas was the big thing that came out of that, so before it was--an officer had to become proficient in their primary branch and stay proficient in a functional area, right, so.  Right.  When I was on the aviation desk, we were called, you know, Functional Area people.  If you were missing a file, you knew that the Functional Area had snatched your file.  But I called them by--we had a nickname for them, Body Snatchers, you know.  "Where's my file?  No."  You know, 'cause it was time for that individual to go into a Functional Area assignment; for instance, you had an aviator who may have been a Foreign Area Officer by, you know, on the side.  So now they got to stay proficient, you now, as an Aviator, right, compete for aviation assignments and for Command.  But they also need to stay proficient as a Functional Area, meaning, language qualifications, right, and all the things that goes with working, like, with the embassy in a particular country, and with the [U.S.] State Department.  So the big thing that came out of that was people can make a choice, right, exactly.  Now they can make a choice of whether they want to stay with their Basic Branch or stay with the Functional Area.  And now, there can be career development for them on both sides of the spectrum, right.  So, right, because it still was just too hard, right, to try to stay proficient and be good in both areas.  So we would have, like, ambassadors that would say, "I don't understand why this person is having to get out of the Army.  They're like the best 'FAO,' Function Area Officer, I've ever seen."  So I get a good Function Area Officer, but they're getting promoted based on being a good aviator, right, and they haven't done very well at that.  You couldn't get promoted in your functional area.  You got promoted in your basic--basic branch.  So that was the biggest change that came out of that, is that you can make a choice when you get to the point of major on which career path you want to pursue.  And we left it to the officer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 34503
Speaker 1: Now, in 2000 you were appointed as Director of Training and Development for the Soldier Support Institute at Fort Jackson [South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Right.  Okay.  Let's see.  Right.  I went to [Army] War College before that, though.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  So it was--I was assigned to--I was selected for War College during the time that I was in battalion command.  Right.  And I came to that study group again, right, waiting for War College the next year.  And so November I came out of command, right, and was assigned to the Pentagon, right, and went to War College in 1999, and graduated from War College in 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right. Yeah.  So the Centennial Class, right.  So this was National Defense University, National War College, which is the same War College that Colin Powell [former Secretary of State] graduated from.  So this is the top level--top level of training for uniform personnel, right.  And that's at Fort McNair [Washington, District of Columbia].  I don't know of you guys have seen Fort McNair since you've been here or--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --done anything there.
Story_ID: 34504
Speaker 1: So, I did that [graduated from the Army War College] and then came to work on--at the Office of the Secretary of Defense, right, for a Joint Assignment, right.  So [U.S.] Congress mandates that a certain percentage of your Officer Corps become Joint-Qualified, right, and that requires an assignment at a Joint level, either on the Joint Staff or on--in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, or in one of the Joint Commands.  So I worked in the Office of the Secretary of Defense doing Officer Assignment Policy, Officer Management Policy, right, for three years before going to Fort Jackson, South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So at this point, now, are you promoted again?
Speaker 1: Right.  Exactly.  So I got selected for promotion shortly after graduating from [Army] War College, and I was promoted while I was on that three-year assignment, right, at Office of the Secretary of Defense.
Speaker 2: So are you a brigadier general at this point (simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 1: No.  I'm a colonel.  I got selected from lieutenant colonel now to full colonel.
Speaker 2: Full colonel.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.  Okay.  All right.  So did you like being at the Pentagon?
Speaker 1: The Pentagon was an interesting duty, interesting assignment, you know.  It's a big transition from being in command, right.  So when I went to that assignment, they were like, "Oh, welcome.  You're going to lead the Officer Policy Section."  So I went to look for my section and found out I was a section of one, right.  So you get a cubicle, right.  You're an Action Officer and everybody's the same, regardless of what rank you are for the most part.  So it's very, very flat structure there, so.  So that was probably the biggest transition, you know.  Here I am deploying an Aviation Unit all the way to Bosnia, right, exactly.  Right.  And now, you now, I'm flying a desk in the Pentagon, so (laughs).  So that's why most people don't--most, you know, we tactical combat arms officers don't like, right, Pentagon duty just because it takes you so far away from what you enjoy doing, and what you've been trained to do.  So I call it, you get promoted out of having fun (laughs).  Exactly.  So you know, the higher you go, the further you're away from the frontlines and from working with soldiers.
Story_ID: 34505
Speaker 1: Okay, so were you in the Pentagon on 9-11 [September 11th, 2001; terrorist attack on the Twin Towers in New York City, and the U.S. Pentagon]?
Speaker 2: I was in the Pentagon on 9-11; yes, I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell us your story, what happened?
Speaker 2: I had come to work on, you know, September 11th, just like, you know, every other day.  We had--but you know, Tre wasn't--yeah, Tre was still in pre-school then, so he wasn't in school actually.  So, right.  Every year before that, you know, every year, when--before then, we would visit my in-laws and my dad [Clarence Brown, Sr.] in New Jersey, and we always spent some time in New York.  So we had just left the World Trade Center, like, the week before, right, Labor Day Weekend, right, exactly, you know, just doing our normal New York out-and-about touring.  So that day was like any other day; come to work, right, at the Pentagon, right, go to your cubicle, drop your stuff; and on this particular day I had a dental appointment, right.  So I left my desk, right, went to--was going to my dental appointment, right, was walking by the lab and they had the television on, and you see smoke coming from the World Trade Center.  So, you know, I kind of stopped, you know, like, "Okay.  Are they showing from the World Trade Center from when, you know, the bomb--." There was a bomb that had gone off there earlier, right, like, a year or so before, right.  And then I see 'Live'.  This is CNN live.  So, it's like, no, this is happening right now.  So I go on to my dental appointment, right, and I'm like, you know, the television is on back there, and I'm like, "Oh, my God, you know, what just happened?"  And so at this time you didn't know what type of plane had hit the building, so you're thinking maybe it was something smaller than a commercial jetliner. Right, but the commentator is saying--is "No, it was larger than a private plane.  It was actually a commercial jetliner.  I heard the noise of the plane."  Right.  And that's what got my attention because we don't have those size planes going, you know, flying over the city.  And so my thoughts were, you know, I hope it's not terrorism.  And I communicated that to the lady behind the counter, and she's like, "You think it would be terrorism?"  But everyone, I think, after [Timothy] McVeigh, and what happened in Oklahoma City [bombing], right, when everyone jumped to the conclusion that it was terrorism right away--nobody wanted to do that because it could have been domestic in nature.  So I think everybody was very sensitive about calling stuff terrorism, right, exactly, before you could validate it.  And so I said, you know, hey, this is--this is not good.  And so I go and I start filling out this--and I--in the meantime, I called my husband [Bennie Williams, Jr.] saying, "Hey, go turn on the television."  I called back to my office and said, "You guys need to go next door to the conference room, turn the television on, a plane just flew into the side of, you know, one of the buildings at the World Trade Center."  And then I go to filling out my form.  And at the same time with the ear on the television, and you hear, "Oh, my God, oh, my God.  Here comes another one."  Right.  And that was where we witnessed on television a second plane flying into the second building.  Right.  And you're thinking, like, this is probably not a good time to be in a government facility or government building right now, right.  But operations continued.  This was a short--this was just an annual checkup.  I wasn't getting any dental work done.  So it's like, okay, let me get this out of the way so I can get back to my building.  So I--and I was talking to the dentist, and I'm like, "You know, all right, I think, you know, that this is, you know deliberate.  I think that there are more buildings that probably are going to come under attack," not knowing that the Pentagon was a target, right.  "And it probably would be a good idea to evacuate government facilities right now."  And he's like, "You think so?"  (laughs).  Yeah.  I was like, "Yeah, I think so.  Right.  I was like, "Well, hurry up so I can get out of here."  Right.  So we finish up my appointment, and I'm headed back out, and there's a nurse running down the hall, it's like, "Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You guys didn't hear."  And I said, "Hear what?"  Because the dental clinic is kind of underground, right, in the Pentagon, so you wouldn't hear what happens on the other side of the building.  And she says, "We're evacuating the building."  I'm like, okay.  Good idea.  I was like, well, let me go back to my office 'cause my cell phone is there, my purse is there.  All I had was my Pentagon badge, right, you know, no head gear or nothing, right, 'cause I was in the--I'm in the building.  All right.  So I get ready to go back out and the Security Guard is saying, "Nope.  Everybody go this way."  Right.  "Go this way."  And, you know, at this time, I'm still thinking we're evacuating because of a precaution.  And then there was this lady runs by me and she is like, you know, smoke, right, the clothes are dirty and the whole works, and she's hyperventilating, and I'm like, you know, "What just happened?"  And she says, a bomb went off on the other side of the building."  Right.  Right. So that was my first indication that the Pentagon had actually been hit as we were exiting the building, right.
Story_ID: 34506
Speaker 1: So I saw one of my [Army] War College buddies, and my first thought that the side of the building I was leaving out on was the side of the building that has--had the Pentagon Daycare Center.  And my son used to be in the Pentagon Daycare Building, so my thoughts were, let's go.  I grabbed my friend, I was like, "Let's go help them get these kids out of the building, right, to wherever we need to be, but not--away from the Pentagon right now."  So.  So we went and did that and pretty much we're on the north side of the Pentagon, right, exactly, on the northeast side of the Pentagon and kind of just watching activities unfold, kind of watching people that had evacuated the building that were on the side of the building that had been hit that were being, you now, over in that area, so.  So it was probably the most helpless I've ever felt, exactly, because you weren't in a position to do anything about it.  You know, the people that were needed were all First Responders, right, you know, the fireman, right, the medical people, right.  So all you could do is just kind of watch, right.  No cell phone, right, and people who had cell phones, they didn't work because we clogged up the network.  That was before texting, right.  So you just want to kind of get word to people that you're okay 'cause you know your family is worried about you if they're watching that the Pentagon got hit.  Right.  So.  So it was probably three or four hours, right.  My husband wouldn't evacuate his building 'cause he was trying to get in touch with me to find out.  So finally I was able to get a call through on a borrowed cell phone, and let him know that I was fine, you know, so.  We finally left the Pentagon area, right, headed to--and I got dropped off at our townhouse, which is not very far from here, right.  Still had no house key (laughs).  No car key or anything.  So, right, and was just trying to wait to get away to get to my son [Tre Williams] 'cause it was like at that point, all you want to do is, like, you know, hug your family members, you know.  So, I got to--finally got to the daycare center.  I think it was after closing, right.  Everybody ran up and hugged you, you know, 'cause they knew you worked in the Pentagon, right (laughs).  Exactly.  And they're, like, you know, "We were wondering what was going to happen with our military kids, you know, if--what it was, they had heard from parents they hadn't heard from, so.  Yeah, so that was the kind of day that that was.  So I spent the rest of the evening like everybody else, right, just kind of watching replays of what had just happened, and you know, we heard about the first, second, third plane hit the Pentagon; we heard about the fourth plane in Pennsylvania, right, by virtue of radio when we were out in the parking lot.  And we heard that there were other planes inbound, so.  Whatever that meant.  So you weren't allowed to go back into the building until the next day, right, when the Secretary of Defense said, "The Pentagon's open for business.  Come back to work."  So I'm taking my son out to daycare again, and he's like, "Mom, where are you going?"  I'm like, I'm going to the Pentagon."  He's like--he looks at the TV, said, "But it's on fire.  Stay home."  And it was still smoking, but we went back to work that day, the following day.  Yep.
Story_ID: 34507
Speaker 1: Do you have any thoughts about what could have been done to prevent it [September 11th, 2001; terrorist attack on the Twin Towers in New York City, and the U.S. Pentagon] or--?
Speaker 2: What could have been done to prevent 9-11--could have been prevented--to prevent it from happening all together?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Not really.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I mean, not and remain the country that we are.  Right.  Exactly.  Because, you know, these were--guys that were here as students for the most part, right, that are free to do the kind of training that they needed.  They want it done, and I don't think anybody suspected why they were, you know, doing the Aviation Training.  I think if there had been a collective way to say these people only want to know how to land the aircraft (laughs), you know, exactly, then they may have been able to put some things together.  But, because the way that we train in aviation right now, anybody can become a pilot, right, anywhere.  And I think because they were so dispersed, right, all over the country receiving their aviation training, that it never really came together until this was investigated afterwards.  Right.  So I think, you know, to remain a free country, you know, people are up in arms right now because of the monitoring of, you know, private phone calls, right, exactly.  So they believe that to be an invasion of privacy.  Right.  But we don't know, right, how many attacks that has prevented from happening by virtue of, you know, monitoring phone calls that may be suspect.  So.  So I think you have to give up a little bit of freedom in order to be able to protect the country.  I've seen that in other countries that I've been deployed to in Germany, right.  I know that, you know, Germans have given up a lot to fight terrorism, and they were fighting terrorism, you know, much, much longer than we have, right.  Remember the Olympics?  Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the bombings.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Right.  So I think they are much better, right, at being aware, right, and sensitive to, you know, terrorism even when it's domestic terrorism, right, than we are as the United States.  But what makes us the United States is the freedoms that we afford the average American citizen, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34508
Speaker 1: So how long did you serve in the Pentagon?
Speaker 2: Right.  Okay.  So that was a three-year assignment, right, a Joint Assignment.  And then I--my husband [Bennie Williams, Jr.] got selected for battalion command, right, and was slated to a Command of Battalion at Fort Jackson [South Carolina], right.  And we are in the Army Married Couples Program, so it was time for me to rotate shortly after he rotated, right.  And there was a position available at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and a colonel's position, and I was assigned, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that program--now, this is something--is something that it was new then, the--
Speaker 2: The Army Married Couples Program?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's been around for a little while.  You have to actually enroll in the program in order to be a part.  And you can, you know, you can break faith with your own enrollment if you choose to do so.  So I wasn't enrolled in the program when I was a battalion commander, exactly, because my husband was assigned to Fort Leavenworth [Kansas] and then again to Fort Carson [Colorado], and then we finally ended up back together again, right, back here in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia], so.  So if two careers are going extremely well, right, it's very hard to--for one career to follow the other, if you know what I mean.  So you really got to kind of do the things that are going to help you to advance and develop, and he's got to do the things, right, and sometimes the two shall meet, and sometimes not.  So, as a result of that, we spent about three and a half years, right, of separation after I went into command and Tre [Williams; Knighton's son] was with me.  Our son was with me, right, and he was maintaining household in Kansas and Colorado.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you were at Fort Jackson for how long?
Speaker 2: Right.  I was at Fort Jackson for two years.
Story_ID: 34509
Speaker 1: Okay.  Ma'am, tell us about the National Defense Authorization Act in 2006, and it was--I believe it had some features that were aimed at refining the role of women in the military.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Can you tell me a little bit more about--2006, I'm trying to think where was I in 2006 and when this came about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you were in Jackson--Fort Jackson [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: 2006, I would have been coming out of Fort Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So 2003 I went to Jackson, 2000.  So I was--yeah, I was actually out of Fort Jackson; 2006 I would have been back in the Army Human Resources Command, right, working in Training and Development.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think it's a law like--well, details that the Ground Combat Exclusion has been implement, not by law, but by military personnel policies.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So it's not a law that prevents women from, you know, serving in Ground Combat.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Exactly.  So the law wasn't there, but the policy was there, right, exactly, and the policy is what we just lifted, right, I guess a few months ago.  Right.   Exactly.   So, right, again, like I said, military is kind of on the leading edge of everything, right.  So I think there were people out of uniform and maybe some that--in [U.S.] Congress that had served before, I think it was, like, okay, this is the last ditch effort, right, to kind of keep some of the units, you know, confined to being male-pure, right.  And then--and that's the--kind of the Combat Arms arenas of infantry, armor and special operations.  But for the most part, all the other branches had women serving in them already.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So that's the policy that was in place, right, in the 2006 time frame.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34510
Speaker 1: Now you retired [from the U.S. Army] in 2008, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what did you do the last couple of years of service?
Speaker 2: The last couple of years of service, I was the--like the Chief Learning Officer, I guess is the way to equate it to the civilian sector, right, for the Officer Corps, the Army Officer Corps.  So I worked as the Chief of Leader Development Division and insuring that people that civilian education--Officers got the civilian education that they needed, right, that they got the military--slated to the military education courses that they needed as well in order for their personal development; personal and professional development.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Are any highlights of that period of service you want to tell us about?
Speaker 2: Right.  It was, you know, a very good job.  And we also worked the slating of commanders, right, for battalion commanders and for brigade commanders at the 05 and the 06 level lieutenant colonels and colonels.  So very rewarding job, exactly.  So now I was on the other end of what had happened to me before when I got slated, right, for battalion command, and able to see that for the whole entire Army.  The thing about the slating too is to kind of be able to look at demographics and see who's slated where and who's getting the command where, because usually where you're slated as a battalion commander, you may end up back there as a brigade commander.  We brief the Chief of Staff of the Army and get his approval.  He's the person who reviews the slate.  But we put the slate together in conjunction with the members of the different branches in preparation for the Chief of Staff of the Army's approval.  So demographics, very important, where are the women being slated to, you know, where--are you being slated to by virtue of, you know, what racial and ethnic background as well, so; that we're not sending all of our black commanders to Korea, right.  That they're getting the opportunity to Command in the 82nds, the 101st, the 1st Cavalry Divisions which we know that--know those commands to be the places where they go to develop them to become the general officers of the future.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was a very important job, right, exactly, with a high level of visibility.
Speaker 1: Now were you the first African American in that position?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I don't think I've ever been asked that question, and I don't think we've ever, ever looked into it.  I don't even--I don't know if they ever had a woman to be in that position either, so.
Speaker 1: So you might be the first of them both?
Speaker 2: Maybe.  Yep.  Maybe.  Now that you asked the question, I never even thought about it prior to you just asking the question just now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that'll set--whoever's watching this to do some research (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right (laughs).
Speaker 1: As you said, it's a significant and important position.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  Exactly.  So we started out.  General [Michael D.] Rochelle was the G-1, and, of course, to Human Resources Command, fell under his leadership, so he would be the first person that we would brief after the commander of HRC to get his approval and to answer any questions that he would have and address any concerns about the slate.  And, of course, and then it would go up to the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army for his review, and then finally the Chief of Staff of the Army would come and bless the slate.  So it's the Army succession plan, right, for all of its commanders, yep, and from that pool of officers would become the next general officers that would lead the Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know we've interviewed a few that expressed some grief over, you know, their assignments in those, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: --that something didn't happen as they were in it--you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 34511
Speaker 1: Now what led to your retirement [from the U.S. Army]?
Speaker 2: Right.  Okay.  So I retired with about twenty-nine years and four months.  I think it equated to being, right.  So mandatory retirement is at thirty years.  But when I was at Fort Jackson [South Carolina], I applied for a Superintendents Training Program.  So I think, well, you know, you start--when you're getting--approaching that thirty-year mark or whatever you set as the mark for retirement, you start to think about, what am I going to do next, and how do I prepare myself for a future.  I always knew that I'll probably get back in education at some level, but wasn't sure at what level.  So I applied for this program--a Superintendents Training Program called Broad's Superintendents Academy, guy named Eli Broad out of the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] area, right, which--he made all of his money for the most part in the housing industry, construction, right.  And his way of giving back, right, other than to the University of Michigan, was to invest in public education and specifically in urban school districts.  So what he decided to was, "Let's look at leaders that are coming out of industry, right, and let's look at leaders coming out of military.  How can we give them the development they need and the education they need to--about public education and transfer their leadership skills into the areas of our urban education."  So went through that, got selected for that program, went through the year-long training with them while I was still on active duty.  Right, so you have an obligation with them, right.  You say, that, hey, I will go where I'm needed, right, when the time comes.  So my plan was to do my full thirty years and then become a part of urban school education.  But a position became available at Prince George's County Public Schools, which is right across in the state of Maryland, right, right across--I could actually look into Prince George's County from where I was working, right.  Right.  They're in the Hoffman Building, which is right along the Potomac [River], and I was heavily recruited, right, to take a position as the Chief of Human Resources for Prince George's County Public Schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34512
Speaker 1: So how long did you stay with the PG [Prince George's] County [Public Schools, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Right.  I stayed with Prince George's County for about--approximately eighteen months.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were some of the challenges in that job and what were the successes?
Speaker 2: Challenges first, right (laughs).  A very, very large school district; 130,000 students was the population at that time.  Unions, nine different unions, right, exactly.  Everyone was unionized, including the people that worked for me in human resources.  The only people that weren't a part of the Union were the ones that were on the Executive Staff.  So a lot of negotiations, right.  A lot of people with a lot of different interests, of course.  So how to balance those interests and still fulfill the needs of those 130,000 students and their families was always a challenge.  Right.  So I was constantly asking myself, you know, right, everyday, right, you know, are we doing the right thing for students; is this the right thing to do, right for kids.  So it's probably the hardest I worked, right, and the hardest I've had to work for a very long time, exactly, because I think you had people that had grew up in a system that were accustomed to doing things a certain way and had not seen them done any other way.  So as far as they were concerned, and with all good intentions, they may have assumed or thought they were doing the right thing, and it could not be the thing that's the right thing to do for children, so, right.  So a tough job.  Tough position.  I admired superintendents.  They really, really have a tough job.  I served under two superintendents; superintendent who recruited me and hired me.  I came aboard in July, right, of 2008.  In November of 2008, he came and told me that he was leaving to go do something else, right.  Exactly. So it's like, okay, I gave up a military career.  I still had a few more months left, right, exactly (laughs).  Right.  And he went to work for the Gates Foundation, right.  But he's now the currently sitting superintendent for L.A. [Los Angeles, California] Public Schools, so he did get back in public education, right, as a superintendent, but just not at Prince George's, right.  The superintendent I followed was the deputy superintendent, which we had a really good working relation.  I had a really good relationship with him, but I think he had a different idea about who he wanted to serve as his Chief of Human Resources, so.  So I worked with him for about a year, a little bit more than a year and decided that it was time to do something different.
Story_ID: 34513
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Next I--my husband [Bennie Williams, Jr.] deployed, so I left the school system, right, and August of 2000--okay.  I'm kind of losing track of the months now; 2000--it would have been August of 2009, I think.  Nope.  It would have been later than that.  Yeah, I officially left in December, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my husband was deploying in December to Iraq, right, so that was a good time for me to make, you know, to kind of make a clean break, right.  School was back up and in session and starting, and all the teachers were in place, and we were just about starting our recruitment for the next round of teachers.  So we were--I was still living in Virginia.  My son [Tre Williams] was going to school in Virginia, and I was commuting to Maryland every day and really working some very long hours, right, with School Board Meetings at night, etcetera, so.  Next, I went to Georgetown [University, Washington, District of Columbia].  This was my Plan B, was to become an Executive Coach or Leadership Coach.  So I went through Georgetown's Leadership Coaching Program for a period of six months.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--okay.  So after you finished the program--well, what did the program consist of?
Speaker 2: Right.  The program consist of, you would meet--we would meet for instruction on how to become an executive coach and actually do practice coaching for one week out of a month, right.  And because I was between job opportunities, that allowed me and freed me up to be able to do that.  We were also charged with doing pro bono coaching, right.  I chose to coach school superintendents and entered into an agreement or program with the University of Pennsylvania out of Penn [unclear], right, and so I coached a very new superintendent who had just become superintendent, and I did leadership coaching for a superintendent who was transitioning out of his third superintendency position into the private section, so.  We were required to do pro bono coaching for three different clients.  And in the process, I set up my own company called 'Winners' to be able to continue with the leadership coaching and executive coaching, right.  In the meantime, after the program was over, I started doing some work with a company called Logistics Management Institute, which is a government contractor where I do Human Capital Management, and we're looking at how to develop the civilian workforce of the future, and how to develop a career-civil service workforce that would be competitive for senior executive service.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 34514
Speaker 1: So this is--this brings us up to--
Speaker 2: Today.
Speaker 1: Today.  Okay.  All right.  So today, I guess--let me ask this question first though:  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Hopes and concerns for the African American community today.  I guess, you know, I think as a part of anything, complacency.  Right.  I don't--I hope we don't get complacent, right.  And I think there are things that will happen, right, that will cause us that kind of, you know, focus and to kind of look internally to see what's going on; for instance, you know, just the most recent events with the Treyvon Martin incident and the George Zimmerman incident.  I think we can start to take for granted that we don't need to teach our kids, right, to be attuned and alert to certain things.  And I think as a parent of an African American male, that concerns me very much, that, you know, he can be very naive when it comes to how he operates on a daily basis, and I think take a lot of things for granted, right, and we can't be with them at all times, right, but I think we have to continue to make him--keep them sensitive and keep them aware of that everyone does not have their best interest at heart, right, exactly. Even though we've tried to the best of our ability to make a better life for them than we have for ourselves, and leveled the playing field, is that American society doesn't always see that playing field as being level for everyone, right, and does not value their lives as much as they may value, you know, the lives of someone that looks differently.  So that's one of my concerns, right.  I think too--I think even in the military, I think the young officers need to be sensitive, too.  I came out of a historically black college and university [HBCU], so, right, you kind of know some of the things just by virtue of the background and environment that you grew up in and that you were developed and educated in.  But I know that there're younger--a lot of younger officers, you know, who have graduated from the West Points [United States Military Academy], right, and have graduated from some of the majority schools that aren't necessarily prepared for some of the challenges that they will face as African American officers, right, in the Armed Forces today.  So when things hit them, it really catches them.  It takes them off guard.  And a lot of them don't want to hear the stories.  "I don't want to hear what it was like," you know.  They don't want to hear what it was like then.  Right.  "Things are different now."  And quickly, they are taught that it's not so different, right, and that you need to be sensitive to some of the challenges that people have had that--whose backs that, you're now standing on to be in the position that you are.
Story_ID: 34515
Speaker 1: Now, if you look back at everything that you've done to this point in life, are there any major things that you would change if you could go back and change them?
Speaker 2: Probably not, you know, and even the bad things that happened to me, right, because I think I learned a lot from them.  The challenges I had with Flight School [Fort Rucker, Alabama], the challenges I had when I got to my first battalion, I think those all made me the person that I am.  It made me stronger along the way.  I think if, you know, the first time I experienced discrimination was when I was an [U.S.] Army colonel, it would have been way too late, and it would have probably completely floored me, right.  But just kind of knowing, right, all the way from my days as a, you know, second lieutenant, right, throughout kind of knowing what to be aware of.  Situational awareness is very important.  We do a good job of teaching that, right, in the military, you know, when it comes to tactical operations.  But I think it's very important to be situationally aware in your own personal situation, right.  So kind of know when something doesn't feel quite right, and when, you know, I need to reach out to someone else and see if this is happening to them, too, or you know, is it--am I--is it me or is it this other person, right, or just what's happening.  So, I think that's being key, and I think the experiences that I've had, like I said, they all make me who I am today, and I wouldn't go back and change any of those, not knowing what I know now, right.  When they were happening to me?  Exactly.  Did it feel good?  No.  Did I want to be in that situation?  No.  But it made me a much better person for having endured that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34516
Speaker 1: Now, today, I was reading this statistic that 31 percent of the [U.S.] Army--I mean of the U.S. Armed Forces, 31 percent of the women in the U.S. Armed Forces are African American women, which is like this over twice the representation that they have in the U.S. population.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: While I think, like, there are like 53 percent of the white women who are--which is much less than their representation in the U.S. population in general.  So the question is like, why are black women enlisting in the Army and or the Armed Services at such a high rate?
Speaker 2: Right.  I think it is a position--it's a place where you can excel, you know.  And I think that our old slogan, which we don't adhere to anymore in the Army, "Be all you can be."  I think it is a place where you can come and actually be your best self, and be the person that you know that you can be.  And I think it starts, like, for the Officer Corps, I think it starts at ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  Right.  And I think the recruitment efforts.  I would think if you look across HBCUs, the majority population, right, in ROTC units are a majority African American women at HBCUs.  I think, you know, there are several reasons why it's not men, right.  I think African American males that are in college have far more opportunities, right.  If they're in college and they become a college graduate, then they're heavily recruited, right, by, you know, the private sector and not necessarily the military anymore.  So I think it's a good place to be.  I think, you know, you have officers that have gone before us that have excelled and kind of paved the way.  You know, you have the Hazel Johnsons of the world, you have, you know, the Clara Adams Ender of the world--
Speaker 1: (unclear) generals.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Exactly, that have made general.  You have the Velma Richardsons of the world, you know, who have excelled and have shown us, that, hey, this is a good place to be and that you can, you know, you can aspire and not only aspire to be a general officer, but you can actually attain the position of general officer, right.  And, like I said, everything that, you know, is afforded to you along the way in the way of training and leadership development, even if you only did a four-year, right, commitment, I think, you can't even put a dollar value on the training that you get from your Sections Institutions, the West Point [Unites States Military Academy] ROTC, right, and the four years of experience that you get.  It makes you much more competitive than your counterpart when you decide to do something differently.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 34517
Speaker 1: And, once again, if you look at your career from the beginning to today, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: What would I consider to be my legacy?  Yeah.  I can tell you what I think would be the greatest opportunity that I've had.  I think my best opportunity is to be able to serve alongside the sons and daughters of America--America's most precious resource.  You know, you don't get--it doesn't get any better than that.  And I've served with some outstanding, magnificent Americans.  I can say, you know, some of my proudest moments, or I get a phone call, right, when I'm in Company Command, that my brother is in the hospital.  I'm like, my brother is in the hospital, and this is coming from Temple, Texas; so, actually one of my soldiers, right, one of our Crew Chief had listed me as his next of kin, right, exactly, and put it as I was his sister.  Right.  So, you know, to me that was a compliment, you know, that he would care enough about me as a leader, right, that I would be the person that he wanted notified, right, in case anything ever happened to him, right.  So, you know, that's precious, right.  That's just, you know, it's--there are some outstanding people that are wearing the uniform of an American soldier, and I wouldn't give anything for having served.  Right.  If I could have gone beyond thirty [years of service], I probably would have.
Story_ID: 34518
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about your family, now.  You have a--you've been married since 1999--
Speaker 2: '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  Twenty-one years.  It's been a fast twenty-one years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  So my husband [Bennie Williams, Jr.] is still active duty, military.  He has dropped just--dropped his retirement papers to retire at thirty [years of service], right, so he'll retire next fall, right, at thirty years of military service.  We have a seventeen year old, who's--his claim to fame is--says, "I can't believe that I'm a military brat that's never been overseas," right.  So most of our overseas time since his birth have been deployments and not assignments, so, right.  So he's seventeen years old and has pretty much grew up Northern Virginia except Texas and South Carolina, so.  Was born at Fort Belvoir [Virginia], right, and goes to school here in the Springfield-Burke area.  Yep.  Exactly.  So he'll--he's a rising senior and will graduate from high school next year, so.  But, you know, in the military, I think, you know, you saw--I saw--witnessed, you know, different generations of women in in the military.  So when I first came in, you know, women didn't get married, nor did they have children, you know.  It was all about, you know, the military and my career, right, exactly.  So then, you know, West Point [United States Military Academy] came along, I graduated in '79 [1979] from Tuskegee, the first women graduated from West Point in '80 [1980].  So with the women graduating from West Point, you saw marriages, right.  They, you know, cadets or former cadets marrying other former cadets.  So it was, like, okay, it's acceptable to be married, right, as an [U.S.] Army officer, a woman, right.  And then, you had the generation that--and I think I was on the leading edge of that generation, not only can we get married, but we can have families, too.  Right, we can raise a family, too.  So I have friends who, you know, made choices, right, to, right, not be married, right; you know, that their career came first.  I have friends who made a choice, "Well, okay, I may be able to be married, but, I'm not going to raise a family or have children because they will interfere with my military career," right.  But my husband and I, we wanted both.  We wanted both the military career and wanted a family.  So when I showed up at 1st Cavalry Division to command an Aviation Unit with an eleven-month-old on my hip, I know it was--I know that it was, you know, it was groundbreaking.  So that was probably just as groundbreaking as having a first woman go into a battalion command and into combat arms.  But not only is she a woman, but she's a mother with a toddler (laughs).
Story_ID: 34519
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, is there anything I haven't mentioned that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Is there anything that--you've asked a lot of questions (laughs).  I don't know if there is anything that--I could say, you know, my family is very proud of what I've done, right, and of my accomplishments, and a family, everyone everywhere from, you know, my mother [Annie Lee Knighton], right, who was very proud and was with me at every major event, right, during her lifetime, in my lifetime.  My sisters [Winifred and Pamela Knighton], who are very proud, you know, who take every opportunity, you know, "Hey, this is my sister, and guess what she did," or, you know, "Guess what she's done."  I was, like, you know--but I'm equally as proud of them, right, exactly, and just as proud to you know, to be Tre's mom and Bennie's [Bennie Williams, Jr.] wife as I am of--as of the military accomplishments that I have made also.  So, I--and I am very concerned about the--about people coming along behind me.  Right.  So I think in my military career, I have spent a lot of time, right, ensuring that the legacy continues, right, and that, you look behind you, or you look to your left and right there's nobody beside you, and you look behind you and there's nobody coming behind you.  So, and it is a concern to me, especially for African American women in aviation.  So, right.  So those that come into aviation, most of them get out after the rank of captain, right, and don't see it through.  So it's a concern to me of how do we get them to stay and to make a career out of it, right, and stay much longer, and a lot of them will tell you, because of the treatment that they get not from their superiors, but among their peers, right, who don't think that they should be there, right.  So we're in the 21st Century, right, exactly (laughs).  And so I'm still amazed about some things that still continue to happen.  And a lot of the thinking, right of, you know, a progressive nation and people who live in our progressive nation in this 21st Century, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 34520
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but it's a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The question is:  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh.  You know, someone said--I answered the phone today and the person was just, you know, very excited to hear from me, and, right, I didn't expect, you know, them to be as excited they were, and she said, you know, "Hey, what I remember most about you was your smile."  Right, exactly.  She was like, "I still remember that smile, and when I think about your smile, it kind of makes me smile."  And I thought about that, and I was, like, you know, that's the thing that you can be remembered by, by, you know, bringing joy to someone else by virtue of what, you know, what I can offer, just if it's a simple smile; then that's how I would like--that's how I would like to be remembered.  I would like to be remembered as a person who helps people and who can help them to be the best possible person that they can be in whatever they're doing.  I think that's the reason why I kind of went into coaching, right, because you help a person to become their best self, right, to take them to the limits of what they think they can be and what they think that they want to be.  I think I've done a lot of that in the military with those who I've coached and I mentored as well.  So, and I tell those in the military, I believe in the leapfrog effect.  Right.  I don't want to be the one that's always known as be the first, right, of anything.  I believe you need to come along, you know, and jump over, right.  Whatever accomplishment I made, jump over that to be the next level, and hopefully, you're bringing someone else along with you that can jump over that, right, to become in to the next level.  And I think it's pretty sad that in the 21st Century we're still having firsts, right, exactly; firsts of anything, right, in the African American community, especially when it comes to the military, so, right.  Bring someone along.  And I would like to be remembered as someone who is, you know, maybe blazed some trails, but, you know, didn't burn the path (laughs) behind me, right, exactly; blazed that trail but left it open so that others could come along and jump over; you're in the process of blazing their own trail.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much for spending the time with us.
Story_ID: 34521
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is a photograph of me at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  This was my class photo from the CGSC [Command and General Staff College] Class of 1992.  And this is the photo that appeared in the yearbook, right, at Fort Leavenworth.  All right, got it.  This is a photo of my host family when I did my student teaching, right, as a student at Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee, Alabama] in 1979.  This was my host family, John and Mary Cotch (ph.) out of Rochester, New York.  Yeah, this is one of my unit photos from out at the National Training Center, so this is one of the companies that was deployed with my battalion to Fort Earl in California in preparation for training and deployment.  This photo is at my promotion ceremony to lieutenant colonel.  So I was promoted by our division chief, which we refer to as our Cad-Dad, Colonel Tony Buckles (ph.) and my husband [Bennie Williams, Jr.] also doing the honors or promoting me to lieutenant colonel, and I was about seven months pregnant with our son, Tre.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a photo of--with my instruction pilot for primary helicopter training at Fort Rucker, Alabama.  This is the Department of Army civilian, Ernie Barnes, right, who was a Vietnam-era helicopter pilot and a retired war officer.  This is a family portrait that we took that appeared in my husband's Command and General Staff College yearbook, right.  This is when I was a lieutenant colonel, he was a major, and our son, Tre, was one year old.
Speaker 2: And your husband's name?
Speaker 1: My husband is Bennie Williams Junior.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a photo that was taken at Tuskegee at my Commissioning Ceremony, and this is Major Harold Marselayas (ph.) who was one of my role models when I was in the Army ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], and one of our instructors, and we still keep in contact.  This is a photo that was taken at my Change of Command Ceremony when I took battalion command of then 4th Battalion, 227th Aviation, which later became second of the 227th Aviation, 1st Cavalry Division.  This is a prom picture from my junior year of high school, right.  So that would have been a prom picture that was taken in 1974.  Wow. This is a photo of me when, I believe I was in seventh grade, right.  So it looks a lot like my son right now (laughs).  Right.  This is from in an Army--this is an Army brochure that was done when I was in Flight School.  Right.  That was part of the Army advertisement campaign for aviation and specifically women in aviation.  Right.  This is--after we were married at Fort Bend in Georgia, my husband and I were featured in--my husband, then Captain Bennie Williams and me, Major Christine Knighton Williams, were featured in the 'Jet Magazine' after we were married in 1992.  You can take it out if you want to, if it's easier just--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) We don't have to take it out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  This is a photo of me and my very favorite teacher from high school, Ms. Susie Toots, who wasn't much younger--much older, rather than most of us high school students.  She was on her first teaching assignment after graduating from Fort Valley State [University, Fort Valley, Georgia], and one of the persons that influenced me to pursue a career in Home Economics and Education.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That is a photo of me with my first class as a student teacher, right.  They were a great class, and they were celebrating my completion of my student teaching at Schrader (ph.) High School, right outside of Webster, New York.  That photo is taken at Tuskegee University, right, on the campus in front of the George Washington Carver Museum.  This photo is from Tuskegee University, taken at the statue of Booker T. Washington, who was the founder of the Tuskegee [Institute], as he lifts the veil of ignorance from the black man.  And this photo is when--from, I believe 1981 when I selected to be Grand Marshal of the Homecoming Parade at Tuskegee Institute, now Tuskegee University.  This photo was taken in Germany, right, in West Germany looking over into the border of East Germany when the border was still between the two countries, and it is in an area called the Fulda Gap.  The Fulda Gap, and I was a Second Lieutenant flying VIP missions on the border.  Right.  This is a photo of me when I was in Company Command in 1st Cavalry Division, commanding Delta Company 227th Aviation, and that's the photo that appeared in 'Glamour Magazine' when I was selected as one of Glamour Magazine's Ten Outstanding Working Women in America.  This is a photo of me with Dorothy Height [also a HistoryMaker], when she was being honored as being a part of the original DACOWITS [Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services] Committee, which is still in effect and looks at the role of women in the military, and it's had an impact on all of the combat rules regarding women in the [U.S.] Army.  She was appointed by Eleanor Roosevelt and recently passed away at the age of ninety-nine, about a year or two ago [2010].  This is a photo of me with Lieutenant Colonel Retired Charity Adams Earley at the groundbreaking ceremony of the World War II Memorial.  She was a World War II Veteran, which led a group of women that worked in postal operations during World War II.  And I was honored to be her escort to the groundbreaking ceremony.
Speaker 2: What is this (unclear)?
Speaker 1: That's the Superintendent's Training Program that I went through.  That's the cohort that was in the program.
Speaker 2: Should I show this?
Speaker 1: It's up to you (laughs).  Exactly.  So this is a group that I transitioned with into public education after retiring from the military.  This is my cohort of Broad (unclear) Superintendents Academy, Class of 2007.
Speaker 2: This one (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: And that is a photo of me as a captain when I was serving in 1st Cavalry Division also.  This is a photo of me and two--actually three of my closest friends that served together with me in Germany.  Exactly.  And we're playing around and we were trading hats.
Speaker 2: I thought that was (unclear)--just a minute.
Speaker 1: This is a photo at my promotion ceremony, my promotion to colonel along with two of fellow Tuskegee graduates.  I graduated from Tuskegee in 1979, they finished the ROTC Program in 1978 and were two of the first women to graduate from Army ROTC.  So I've always considered them my role models.  This is the headliner from 'USA Today' that appeared in the newspaper after 'Glamour Magazine' selected me as one of the Ten Top Working Women in the United States.  This is the photo that appeared in the 'Killeen Daily Herald', right, and actually, the article was done by a good friend of my, Karen Cary (ph.) when I made Glamour Magazine.  So, Fort Hood, Texas, is in Killeen, Texas.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this is another photo that appeared.  I believe that was the Post Magazine, right, this particular photo appear in after selected for--as a Glamour Magazine Top Ten Working Woman.
