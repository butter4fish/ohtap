Speaker 1: All right, now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as kind of a warm up.  And they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, virtually all food is my favorite, but the typical Southern cuisine, turkey, collard greens, fish, chicken, sweet potatoes, barbeque.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Purple, gold, red and white.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?

Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, there are a number that comes to mind, but the one I like best is, "When times get tough, the tough get going."
Story_ID: 24765
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, I'm gonna ask about your family history, and I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side first so we don't get 'em mixed up.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Eunice Hester Mitchell, E-U-N-I-C-E, H-E-S-T-E-R, Mitchell, M-I-T-C-H-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her place of birth is Oxford, North Carolina, but her date of birth, I did not commit to memory.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: November 5th, but the year, I'm not sure of.
Speaker 1: You think it was in the 1920s?
Speaker 2: Yes, it would have been early '20's [1920s].
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll say circa 1920 or so.  All right.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?  Do they have another family origin other than Oxford or what were they doing in history?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, I am aware of my great grandfather who was Ned Hester.  I am aware of my grandparents, William and Mary Hester.  They lived in Oxford, North Carolina, and the family's original is in the Creedmoor area.  My ancestors were working-class people, and my great grandfather actually migrated to Baltimore [Maryland] and worked there for many years, sending money back to the family.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so this is your grandfather, Ned Hester, I mean, not grandfather, I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: My great grandfather was Ned Hester.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: William Hester is my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, and he's the one who went to Baltimore?
Speaker 2: The great grandfather actually went to Baltimore.  My grandfather actually worked in Oxford, North Carolina all of his life, various odd jobs and also a factory worker.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any stories about the end of slavery or Reconstruction or--
Speaker 2: Well, my ancestors as far back as we can trace were actually free.  That's for my great grandfather on my mother's side.  No stories about my grandparents on my father's side because they passed away when my dad was very early.  And he was raised by an uncle on my grandmother's side.  So, there were not very many stories that were passed down to us.  And my parents didn't really talk about their childhood that much.
Speaker 1: Were they raised in a rural setting in Oxford?
Speaker 2: Well, Oxford was a small city, actually, a small town.  So my mother was raised in a small town.  My dad actually was raised in a rural setting, and, in fact, he worked on a farm.  They did sharecropping for a significant period.  And so he didn't talk about his childhood because it was not really a pleasant time.  He worked mostly on a farm, was not able to get an education.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about your mother?  Was she able to go to school?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother graduated from Mary Potter High School in Oxford, North Carolina.  She had aspirations for attending college and went to Durham, North Carolina, where, fortunately, she met my father, and I was born, and that was an event that precluded her from attending and finishing college.  But she had formal training as a nurse and worked on a number of factory-type jobs.  I really didn't start talking to my mother until after my dad passed away.  And that's when I learned that she had been the Valedictorian of her high school.  And that's when I learned also, and became aware of how and why she was such a great influence on our lives.
Speaker 1: Okay, was she the only member of her family that, to get an education like that or was she like part of a family that valued education and went to school?
Speaker 2: My mother was one of ten children.  She was about the sixth.  And so while none of her older sisters or brothers got college educations, they did have high school educations and were very informed, motivated individuals who went to different places outside of North Carolina in order to obtain the best opportunities for employment.  They were, my uncles and aunts were all like second mothers and fathers.  The family was exceptional in terms of the relationships that they had, and the care that they provided for each other.  And that family tradition actually was passed from my grandparents through my parents and from us to our children today.
Speaker 1: That's quite a legacy.  And in those days, if you finished high school, that was quite a, you know, that was an accomplishment, quite an accomplishment for people.  You know, lots of people didn't have a chance to go to high school in those days.  So, now, so your mother had nursing training.  Did she aspire to become a nurse or a medical practitioner at some point?
Speaker 2: Well, she always looked for opportunities to enhance her professionalism and the economic status of the family.  So nursing, she thought was a route to do that.  She completed the training, but actually, she never pursued the medical profession.  Instead, she worked in curtain factories, textile factories and the tobacco factories in Durham, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are there any stories from that side of the family that have passed down that are, that you think would be significant?
Speaker 2: The one story that I remember, my great grandfather, Ned Hester, my mother indicated that when he went to, to work in the North and sent money back home, it allowed his family to live reasonably well.  And that once he retired, he came back home, he had mason jars full of bills and also silver dollars, and that he buried these jars on the family land.  And actually, no one ever figured out where they were after he passed away.  So that's the one story that I recall, and, in fact, we probably should go down on that land with metal detectors to see if we can locate any of the silver that he supposedly hid.
Speaker 1: Now, that's quite a story.  So, yeah, 'cause your mother came up partially during the [Great] Depression where money was scare, and I know they wish they could have located some of that money.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 24766
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, let's go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name Willie Lee Mitchell, W-I-L-L-I-E, L-E-E, M-I-T-C-H-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Again, early '20's [1920s] he was born, and I did not commit his birthday to memory, but the year, but his birthday was January 5th.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was it?
Speaker 2: He was born in Orange County, North Carolina, and was raised in the rural areas around Rougemont and in Orange County.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what are the stories from your father's side?  First of all, how far back can you trace that side and what were they doing?  Are there any stories from the slavery period or Emancipation or any stories about the Indians [Native Americans] there or any of that?
Speaker 2: My dad was one of two children.  He had one brother, but his parents both died when he was about seven from small pox, he indicated.  And he was raised by an uncle on his mother's side.  And he had a very difficult childhood because they lived in the rural areas, and he was not allowed to go to school, only partially and part-time because he had to work on the farm.  And so my dad's stories were one of a difficult childhood, but encouraged by the fact that a future was going to be available to him and without a formal education, he finished about the seventh grade.  He was a very accomplished individual, a leader in his unions in the factory, a leader in the community and the church, a stalwart in terms of encouraging people to vote and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he didn't hand us many stories of his childhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you think he didn't know a lot about his parents after they, you know, since they passed away so early?
Speaker 2: I'm fairly certain he did not know a lot about his relatives.  Some aunts on his mother's sides who were Bullocks, he was familiar with.  And he had what they called at that time, a half sister that I knew as an aunt when we grew up.  So there was a few reunions on my dad's side that I also attended, but I believe he had a limited knowledge of his family.  I never knew the great grandfather on his side.
Speaker 1: Okay, was he alive when you were around--
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: His great--your father's grandfather?
Speaker 2: No, no, they had all passed away when I was born.
Story_ID: 24767
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your father [Willie Lee Mitchell] was raised on a farm, and didn't have much schooling.  But he met your mother [Eunice Mitchell] in, in Durham [North Carolina], right?
Speaker 2: Met my mother in Durham--
Speaker 1: So how did he, I mean did he move to Durham for work or what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, Chapel Hill [North Carolina] and Rougemont [North Carolina] are not far from Durham, probably only fifty miles or so.  So I imagine that he visited Durham which was one of the larger towns at the time.  And he had joined the Navy.  And so he met my mother when he was in the Navy, and they got married.  And he spent five years in the Navy, then became an enlisted man and worked in the tobacco factories in Durham, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there a story about how your parents met?  Do they tell a story about how they, you know, met in Durham?
Speaker 2: You know, I never had that story told to me.  So I'm not aware of how they met.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so, but they met when he was in the Navy and they got married shortly thereafter?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mom had gone to Durham because she was going to enroll in college at North Carolina Central, but somehow fate had it that she met my dad, got married and I became the product of that, the first product of their marriage.  And so sometimes, other people's plans are intervened, and it becomes your blessing.
Story_ID: 24768
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, okay, well, when you consider your parents' [Willie Lee and Eunice Mitchell] personalities and their talents, their hobbies, their habits, their dispositions, their looks, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: It was, I believe I was twenty-eight before I fully realized the influence that my mother and my father had on my life.  They were extremely disciplined individuals, believed in religion as an important component of your life.  They provided structure, had excellent expectations of performance from you until you could expect it of yourself.  They provided the discipline, the character, the role models and the inspiration that any kid, if they were experiencing that would have the belief that they could accomplish anything.  So my mother and my father were hard-working individuals, God fearing, and they believed that you could accomplish anything if you were willing to work at it.  And they had nothing but the highest level of expectations for the performance of all of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I am the product of their desires, their motivations, their inspirations.
Story_ID: 24769
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were raised in Durham [North Carolina], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And was there a name for your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, I lived in Durham all of my teenage years.  We moved from place to place within the City of Durham because my mother refused to live in the country.  And East Durham is where I spent my elementary school through high school years.  So, yes, we lived in East Durham.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is Durham like a, I know some cities vary in how they do it, but there's a, in some towns, there's a whole black side of town.  That's where black people live and other, other towns, there's little pockets in the town, you know.  So how was Durham stratified?  I know it was segregated.
Speaker 2: I was born in the segregated South in 1942 [sic, 1943], and Durham was a reasonable sized city, so, yes, it had a black side of town which was East and it had a black side of town on the North.  So North Durham and East Durham was populated principally by African Americans.  But if one were to select a place to be born in a segregated society, Durham, North Carolina was an excellent place if those circumstances existed.
Story_ID: 24770
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm gonna ask you about Durham and some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in a minute, but I wanted you to tell before that a little bit about your family.  Now, you're the eldest, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tell us how many brothers and sisters do you have that follow you?
Speaker 2: I was the first born of five in my family, with four younger sisters.  It turns out I was the only male, and because you were the first child, you experienced the economically most difficult times in the family, especially in a period in which my mother and father were separated for about seven years.  So as the first born and male child, there were a number of challenges, economically, but they reinforced the fact that a future was going to be better for me than the present was at that time.  All of us, the siblings did very well in school.  My second sister was a Valedictorian of her class.  I finished in the top ten in a large class of 365 and my other sisters did quite well in school as well.
Speaker 1: Now, are your brothers and sisters right behind you in terms of their birthdates?
Speaker 2: Yes, the first sister is two years younger.  The next one is four years younger and there are two years between the other two as well, except the last sister was born maybe fifteen years after I was.
Story_ID: 24771
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you said there was a gap of seven years when your parents [Eunice and Willie Lee Mitchell] were separated?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then they actually came back together--
Speaker 2: Yes, from--
Speaker 1: --now, this is interesting, there's got to be an interesting story here.  So--
Speaker 2: At eight years old, my mother and father separated.  My mother was wise enough to never say one negative word to her children about our father.  She said he's an excellent man, and one day he will be back.  And we heard nothing but good information from her about our father.  So therefore, we respected him even though he was not in the home and we were economically challenged.  But those years actually had a great influence on my life because it indicated that I had to take responsibility for myself in terms of having jobs to earn money, responsibility really as a big brother for younger sisters.  And so those seven years actually provided the strength and the character that I needed to be able to endure anything on my way up.
Speaker 1: Now, did you see your father during this seven years?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was in the same town and periodically, would stop by the house.  So, yes, we continued to see our, see our dad and to know of him.  And on holidays, he would show up sometimes and provide money for the holiday meals that we were served at school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They remarried when I was fifteen.
Speaker 1: So did they actually get divorced?
Speaker 2: No, never got divorced, but remarried to reaffirm the marriage when I was fifteen, and they were together for 50 years before my dad passed away.
Speaker 1: Now, I know that in those days, adults did not talk to children that much about their business.  But do you have any sense of what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, not really any specifics.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he came back and everything seemed to be fine.
Speaker 2: Yes, there were conditions that my mother had for him returning home.  Up until then, we had rented houses, but she said, we have to buy a home, and they did.  And I think that was the primary condition for him returning.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her primary condition for him returning.
Story_ID: 24772
Speaker 1: All right, now, let me go back up here to when you were a baby.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory, first thing that you remember?
Speaker 2: First thing I remember is I had an accident when I was about two years and how a boy is trudging through the leaves and falling down.  There was glass in the leaves, and I got a bad cut on my right leg.  I went home to mom [Eunice Mitchell].  She looked at it, sterilized some scissors by heating 'em in a flame, cut the flap of skin off that was laying down, provided whatever home remedies that she knew about for healing.  I never saw a doctor, never got infected.  The wound today is the same color as me, so her home remedies worked in terms of curing that situation.  That's the earliest memory I have of my childhood.  But I remember lots of things that happened in my life before I was six years old.
Story_ID: 24773
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is the time to tell them (laughter).  What were, we always ask this question this way.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the sights really were communities, the communities I lived in had excellent people, excellent character.  The only thing was missing was a great deal of economics.  We didn't live in affluent neighborhoods, but they were excellent neighborhoods in terms of the character of the people who were there.  The neighbors all looked out for each other and for each other's kids and children.  We had excellent times as children because of the camaraderie that existed between the kids in the neighborhoods and the other individuals in the neighborhood.  The grownups had great expectations for you and as well as your parents.  And we respected all adults at that time because they commanded respect.  The smells that I remember the most, the smell of tobacco in clothes of my mother [Eunice Mitchell] and father [Willie Lee Mitchell] when they returned from the factories.  Both of them worked in the tobacco factories.  I have never smoked and never will because of the memories of tobacco smoke that we had in the homes.  The most enjoyable times as we got older was around the holidays when unbelievable amounts of food were available at my uncles and aunts houses and also in my family as well.  Not so many sounds, except each year when the new automobiles came out, we had a favorite game.  We would sit on the porch in the afternoon and the first one there would say, all the cars from that direction are mine, and so the other person had to take the cars from the other direction.  And we had the greatest fun pretending that that new Duce and a quarter [Buick Electra 225], I owned it (laughter).  So those were some of the pleasant memories.
Story_ID: 24774
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: I started school in Durham, North Carolina.  I went to Pearson Elementary School.  There were only two elementary schools on the side of town where we lived, the segregated black side of town.  So I only attended Pearson School one year.  The next year I transferred to Burton Elementary School, both in East Durham [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Now, something I forgot.  I don't know if you know the answer to this, but when you named the school your mother [Eunice Mitchell] graduated from in Oxford [North Carolina]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I just wondered who it was named for.  If you knew who it was named after?
Speaker 2: No, I, I'm not familiar with the Potters where she, which the name was taken from for her school.
Speaker 1: You know I asked because all those names are usually some black person that started, helped start a school and do something, you know--
Speaker 2: Could have been.
Speaker 1: --in the community.  So, and I wonder who Pearson and Burton are, you know, but--
Speaker 2: I'm not familiar who those individuals were either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's something I'll look up--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they often do--
Speaker 2: --after this interview.
Speaker 1: They don't always have a significance to the black community.  But they, you know--
Speaker 2: I believe in this case, they did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Burton Elementary, so, now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Loved it, every day, every year.  And part of the reason was that my mother [Eunice Mitchell] informed me during the time that she and my dad [Willie Lee Mitchell] were separated, she said, son, if you're serious about your education, you can live better as a man than you're living now.  My mother didn't have to repeat that statement to James Mitchell twice.  If education was gonna provide a better life for me as a man, than I was enjoying economically as a boy, then my decision was bring me all the education there is, and I'm going to assimilate it.  So I loved school.
Story_ID: 24775
Speaker 1: All right, so school, now, so did you have a favorite subject or activity in school?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I always enjoyed mathematics and science and, in fact, I took all of the subjects seriously, but mathematics and science were the most interesting.  I enjoyed athletics.  I played basketball in junior high and high school.  And it provided beneficial habits and so forth for me.  It reinforced that there were rules that you had to conform to, that teamsmanship (ph.) was important and that there was an authority called the coach and that you obeyed that authority if you wanted to be a part of the team.
Speaker 1: Okay, what position did you play on the basketball team?
Speaker 2: I played forward and guard.  I was an average player.  I didn't get to be a very good player until I got into college, but at that time, I was not on a college team.  This was intramural basketball, played basketball until I was thirty-eight years old, can't imagine anything that's more enjoyable than that was, to get paid what pro-athletes get paid to do today (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you stopped at thirty-eight, you say?
Speaker 2: Yes, played every Monday and hopped every Tuesday because of a knee I had injured, so I finally decided to it was better to be able to walk than to play (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I gave it then and did other things like bowling and still could do softball and tennis, things of that nature.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, now, did you, were there--when you look back at yourself in school, were you a teacher's pet type or--
Speaker 2: No.  But the teachers knew that I was an academically high performer, so they had great expectations for me.  I did not get any special privileges.  The teachers at that time had great expectations for everyone who could do it.  And I was encouraged by virtually all of them, from elementary school through high school.  And obviously, there were teachers who were proud of me and proud of the fact that they had something to do with instilling in me the love for academic competitiveness.  I had the counselors, the male counselors in high school, the male mathematics teachers and science teachers all spoke to me about my performance and encouraged me to continue it.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have a favorite teacher at--
Speaker 2: I had teachers who were--
Speaker 1: --elementary school for now.
Speaker 2: In elementary school, my second grade teacher named Mrs. Whittit (ph.) actually helped me very much.  I recall an incident in which I had to the measles.  And for two weeks, I was out of class, and by the time I got back, most of the other kids were reading.  And I had missed that two-week period and was not a very good reader, but made the decision that I wasn't going to be a dummy.  And Ms. Whittit provided me with additional reading lessons and capabilities that allowed me to catch up.  In elementary school, the principal, Mr. Majet (ph.) was a second father figure, and was a person that I looked up to the years that my father was not in the home.  And that provided inspiration for me as well.  High school, there were the science teacher, the mathematics teachers, Mr. Smith, were all very inspirational.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you were elementary age, what were your, some of your favorite activities?  What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I participated in, you know, they taught kids dancing in physical education.  We all had these little stage presentations and having a part in some of the plays were enjoyable.  We participated in, every morning, there was devotion.  Believe it or not, in the school systems in those days every morning we had devotion, said the Pledge Allegiance to the Flag, had prayer said in the classroom, and we looked forward to that, because that kind of structure and respect for the country and gave a dimension that was very beneficial, I believe, to every young child at that time.  So I enjoyed all of the things that you would do as young adults.  The recess periods, the physical education where you had baseball and softball and other things that you could participate in were all very, very enjoyable in elementary school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Durham's [North Carolina] really a baseball kind of town in a lot of ways.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you play a lot of baseball?
Speaker 2: I played, in little league, I was less than average (laughter), but had an opportunity to play for three or four years.  But then once I, I got to the age for going out to basketball, I put all of my time really in horseshoes.  I used to pitch horseshoes with the grown men in my neighborhood because one of the neighbors taught me how to be his partner.  And so horseshoes, basketball became the sports that I participated in mostly.
Story_ID: 24776
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you, a lot of engineers and people in science like to build things and put things together and take 'em apart and that sort of thing.  Did you have that talent when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had the experience, the only bicycle I ever owned growing up was one that my friends and I put together from parts that we collected from different places.  A boy frame, well, a boy frame of a bicycle here, the back rim, the front rim, the seats, we collected the components and put together the first bicycle that I owned.  And, in fact, I've never purchased a bicycle, even to this day; made a lot of things from the woods, made bow-and-arrows, by cutting the appropriate trees and fashioning these utensils because we couldn't, didn't have the money to buy them.  So I learned how to make them.
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned that, and I know some kids, I grew up in a city, but I knew some kids that actually went out in the field and made bows and arrows and actually could shoot little animals and stuff with 'em (laughter).  Did you make a real bow, did you make the real thing?
Speaker 2: I had the equivalent of a bow that could be used for hunting with, but I only did target practice with it.  My friend and I who literally was the only brother I ever knew growing up, spent many hours in the woods because there were lots of areas that were not populated in East Durham [North Carolina].  And after your chores were done and your mother knew you were a responsible kid, the rest of the day was yours.  And so we spent many hours in the woods building things, making things, building a tree house and so forth; didn't have anything other than popsicle sticks actually to fashion little things from so we collected popsicle sticks and were able to make literally houses and log cabins and so forth by stacking popsicle sticks.
Speaker 1: So I take it you didn't have a lot of store bought toys and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Never had a large number of store bought toys, only got toys at Christmastime and a limited number there.  We knew that it wasn't possible to economically afford a lot of things, so therefore, we attenuated our desires and what we asked for.
Story_ID: 24777
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you frequent, you know, downtown Durham [North Carolina] much in terms of--I know it was segregated, these were days of segregation, real hard segregation.  What was downtown Durham like?  Did they have the signs up and that sort of thing or--
Speaker 2: Yes, Durham had an actual downtown area with a significant number of stores.  Obviously, they had the segregated signs for the bathrooms and the water fountains.  But you were allowed to go into all of the stores and shop.  And so I spent many hours shopping with my mother.  She would go to four or five stores, each floor on every store, and then go back and select (laughter) the best bargains.  It wasn't a lot of fun for me, but I (laughter), went along and was able to go to the theater downtown.  There was a segregated theater that we were allowed in.  And there was also a black-owned theater that we could go to.  So, you were able to see the things that other people were able to afford.  And it only reinforced what my mother [Eunice Mitchell] said, be serious about your education and anything in later life you wanted to afford, you should be able to; enjoyed the downtown area and seeing it.
Speaker 1: And were there any significant movies or books that you remember growing up that influenced you?
Speaker 2: The books that I read actually I read later in life as, in college and even after finishing my Ph.D. degree.  And so books didn't influence me that much as a child.  The influences were more parents and teachers' expectations of excellence of performance from you that influenced me when I was younger.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, we were talking earlier, and we were talking about heroes, and I think you were saying that you didn't really come across a lot of heroes until much later in life, besides your father [Willie Lee Mitchell], you know, there weren't a lot of others.  But when you look back, were there any, you know, role models or heroes that you admired when you were little?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was in my childhood, actually, my dad was a great influence because I only learned one thing from him, and that's the only thing I needed to learn.  He cherished education, and he said, I didn't have an opportunity to attend school, but you do.  And so you should take your education seriously.  The other thing I learned from my dad was, he said, if you desire to accomplish something, and you're not working on it, it's not going to happen.  And so my dad always had two jobs.  And so I learned from him that you had to be willing to work to accomplish whatever it was you were pursuing.  So my dad in that sense was one of my heroes when I was very young.  Now, as I grew up there were other people who became mentors.  I'll never forget when I learned what Jackie Robinson had accomplished.  I experienced Martin Luther King, Jr.  I was greatly influenced by learning about Paul Robeson's life, and I was a grown man before I became aware of Paul Robeson.  And then there are people like Granville T. Woods who was an inventor of great fame and performance.  I learned of him later in life too, and knowing that other people had accomplished great things when it was really difficult, reinforced in your mind that there couldn't be anything that should get in the way of being an impediment to you achieving whatever it was that you wanted.  Folks who were also influential, a Dr. Pendergrass, an undergraduate chemistry professor at North Carolina A and T.
Speaker 1: Now, I didn't wanna get you into college yet, but we, I just' gonna try to--
Speaker 2: Okay, we'll stay with the childhood,--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 24778
Speaker 1: --my Sunday school teacher, Ms. Mattie Markham, who I cherished.  And she provided many, many years of knowledge about religion and what it could do in one's life.
Speaker 2: Well, tell us, I didn't ask you about your church yet, but this is a good time to talk about it.  What was the name of the church your family attended?
Speaker 1: My mother's [Eunice Mitchell] and father's [Willie Lee Mitchell] church was Gethsemane Baptist Church.  The children's church was Ebenezer Baptist Church.  Now, my parents were smart enough to allow us to go to a church that had more children our age and had young adult programs and so forth that were better for us to be involved in than the environment of their church which was an older group of individuals.  So--
Speaker 2: So Gethsemane is the older church, but they put you all in, and let you attend--what was the name of it?
Speaker 1: Ebenezer Baptist Church.
Speaker 2: Ebenezer Baptist, and--
Speaker 1: Gethsemane was on one side of town and it's where they had worshiped for many years.  But when we moved to East Durham, Ebenezer Baptist Church was closer to where we lived, and therefore, we went to Sunday school and joined Ebenezer Baptist Church, and that was allowed by my parents.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's interesting.  Okay, so you said, Mrs. Mattie--
Speaker 1: Markham.
Speaker 2: --Markham, she was the Sunday school teacher at Ebenezer--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --I guess.  Okay.  Now, did you, were you cultivated to, you know, to assume leadership as a youth, you know, in the church?
Speaker 1: Well, church was a component of our life.  My parents were, deeply believed in religion and respect for a supreme being, and it was therefore a component of our life.  You went to church every Sunday, and it wasn't because they regulated it.  After a while, we loved the participation in the church and went because we enjoyed it.  And many of the principles that you learned about in church, I believe are necessary for all children to be indoctrinated in some type of religion because when there is a void of religion in one's life later on, you can be misled and follow someone's principles who are incorrect.  But having been experienced in and exposed to religion, it provided that base and background of knowledge that we could build on.
Speaker 2: Okay, so how much time would you spend in the church, say on a Sunday?
Speaker 1: From Sunday school to the end of church service, 8:30 to 1:30, so we spent about five hours every Sunday in the church.  And choir practice, another one hour during the course of the week.  So, about six hours during the course of a week we were participating in something in church.
Speaker 2: Okay, and I ask because there are some families, they're there for the evening service and the prayer meeting on Wednesday and, you know--
Speaker 1: My parents did it, but they didn't impose that on us because school was what they, high performance in school during the week was our job.
Story_ID: 24779
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, let me, did you have a middle school or a junior high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was the name of your junior high school?
Speaker 2: Whittit Junior High School, from the--
Speaker 1: Now, is that the same Whittit as your teacher, Mrs. Whittit, same family or--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know you had a teacher named Mrs. Whittit.
Speaker 2: Yes, Ms. Whittit, second grade teacher.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a connection.
Speaker 2: It might have been.
Speaker 1: An educator that probably preceded her, you know.  Interesting, so, Whittit Junior High School, okay.  So this is like sixth, seventh and eighth?
Speaker 2: Well, well, no, it was actually, eighth through--no, seventh through the ninth grade was the, was our middle school at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, seventh, eighth and ninth.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now, this is the, when you were in junior high school, this is the era of what used to be called Rock and Roll music, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --beginning, which was taking the place of big band music.  And, now, were you a part of that cultural transition or did you stay with the big band sound (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, no, every red-blooded American boy (laughter) enjoyed the music of those days.  A big pastime was we had a recreation center, both in East Durham [North Carolina] and one on Fayetteville Street.  And so on Friday nights, as a teenager, the recreation center was open and we had dances there.  So all of the music, you only had to hear it once on the radio, well, several times on the radio, and you knew the words and so forth.  So, yes, I loved the music and the dances that we had as teenagers in the recreation centers.
Speaker 1: So it was, that's the age of Chuck Berry and--
Speaker 2: Yes, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, James Brown were the entertainers of the day.
Story_ID: 24780
Speaker 1: Okay, you mentioned like Durham [North Carolina] had a, sort of a strip in the black community.  What was the name of the street that most of the entertainment venues were on, the movie theater and--
Speaker 2: Pettigrew Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There, trying to think of the name.  There was a nickname for this neighborhood, but that's where the theaters and the pool halls and the restaurants and so forth were in Durham, North Carolina.  And then Fayetteville Street [Raleigh, North Carolina] had more of the college culture.  North Carolina Central was located there, the library that we had was located there, and other cultural activities and buildings were on Fayetteville Street.
Speaker 1: Now, did that area influence you and your family?  I mean were you influenced by the college strip?  Did you ever go to the college to hear a lecture or something like that when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, growing up, I never attended any of the events on the college campus except the junior year in high school.  At the time, NSF [National Science Foundation] sponsored math, science and biology training and workshops for about eight weeks during the summer for academically inclined students.  And I participated in that event as a junior in high school that had a great influence on my life in a choice of my career.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were in high school when National Science Foundation actually had a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, a summer research programs at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, summer research at North Carolina Central [University]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, all right, now did you attend any of the shows, did they have live shows on Pettigrew Street?
Speaker 2: Live shows, but it wasn't anything that your parents allowed you to participate in (laughter).  The pool halls were on--this section of town was called Hayti (ph.) (laughter).
Speaker 1: Hayti, okay.
Speaker 2: Probably a carryover from Haiti.
Speaker 1: Haiti, yeah, yes, sir.
Speaker 2: You know, we pronounced it Hayti.
Speaker 1: Right, was it spelled Hayti?
Speaker 2: Like that, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause that is actually, and a lot of black communities were called Hayti or Haiti, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --after the Haitian Revolution of 1791 or after the, they won the revolution in 1804.  But they, Pittsburgh's [Pennsylvania] black community is called Hayti.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, in the 19th Century, not now, but then, back then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, ours was, where there were the clubs, the pool halls, the theaters and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting.  So, but you, you said you were raised to avoid that kind of (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, off limits.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was twenty-two years old before I ever entered a pool room because of what my mother [Eunice Mitchell] said went on in pool halls, and partially, what she thought was true.  There were the gamblers and the other people who were not necessarily pursuing virtues in the pool room.  But I later learned at the pool tables at North Carolina A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University] that it was a very enjoyable game and was a family game as well.
Story_ID: 24781
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did--now, you were the only male sibling, right--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you're the eldest and you said you had to work, start working early.  What did you, what kind of work did you do and when did you start?
Speaker 2: I have had a job for sixty-two of my sixty-nine years.  The first job was at age seven.  I shined shoes at a shoeshine stand for a man that had such a business, not very far from where I lived.  I earned two cents a pair, and it cost fifteen cents at that time to have a pair of shoes shined.  And I earned money to buy things at seven years old, and other jobs along the way.  Any job that paid honest money was an honorable job.  And so I held many of them on my way up.
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever work with your father [Willie Lee Mitchell] on a job?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father, during the summer would sell wood and coal.  He worked at a tobacco factory in the regular season.  But on the weekends, he drove taxis sometimes, and he sold wood and coal and watermelons.  So I used to work with him on the truck, selling wood and coal to people in the black neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I figure you probably did.  I just--I'm glad, okay.  So that kind of kept your bond with your father going, I guess, even when he was gone.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 24782
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, okay, so junior high school.  Now, any teachers in junior high school that stand out?
Speaker 2: Junior high school, I remember Mr. Packingham (ph.).  He was the biology teacher at that time, and he encouraged me to participate in the science fair when I got to high school because he said, you know, you do very well in my classes.  And I believe that you have the inclination and the aptitude to be a scientist.  So make sure you participate in the science fair when you get over to the high school.  And I appreciated that input from Mr. Packingham.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, so you were a good student, I take it, and all through school--
Speaker 2: From the day that my mother [Eunice Mitchell] said it was a route to a better life, I was an A student from that year until I graduated with a Ph.D. degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So performance, academic performance became a component of my life.  My mother had the aspirations for us until we had it for ourselves.  And so once it clicked, and I believed what my parents said, then that was the path to the future for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: High school was Hillside High School.
Speaker 1: Hillside, okay.  How many black high schools were there in Durham [North Carolina] then?
Speaker 2: In the City of Durham, there was one black high school, Hillside High School.  There was a second high school in the rural areas, Mary Moore High School.  There was one junior high school in the city, and that was Whittit Junior High School.  And the benefit of there being one segregated school, was that I was able to go to school with children whose parents were doctors, lawyers, principals, teachers and so forth.  So I was able to witness the difference economically in what they could afford, and what I couldn't.  And that also became the evidence of the fact that the future could provide something that the present didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, okay, so if you could, I guess you figured if you could get as good a grades as or better grades than the middle-class kids that had money--
Speaker 2: Then I would have money as an adult.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It makes sense.
Speaker 2: Believe it or not, it was a truth at that time.  An investment in an education would be a payoff in the future.
Story_ID: 24783
Speaker 1: You were telling me about something that's remarkable to me, but may not be remarkable for people from North Carolina or other parts of the South.  You were mentioning something called "book rent".  Can you explain how that works?
Speaker 2: In elementary school, you acquired the books that you needed for your classes by paying a $2.00 book rent fee.  And you didn't get your books until the $2.00 were paid.  And I never had my $2.00 the first day of school.  My parents would somehow come up with that $2.00 before Thanksgiving, and up until that period, the teachers allowed you to look on the books of your fellow students who had their book rents paid.  And I don't recall anymore for high school, but I don't recall buying books.  So I believe the fee for books to be rented persisted even though high school in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Well, it's interesting that you, the way you give the story, you can't even conceive the books being free.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: They were not free.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, free in Ohio and Michigan and other Northern states, Illinois, I, it's just, you know, it's hard for me to conceive of somebody having to pay for their books, rent 'em or buy 'em--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, in, at the public school level.
Speaker 2: That was the rule in Durham, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: That's a cultural thing I never, never heard that before.
Story_ID: 24784
Speaker 1: Okay, but, all right, so Hillside High School [North Carolina], you said you played basketball.  You started in the tenth grade, right?
Speaker 2: What, playing--10th grade, yes, high school started.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I played basketball in the eighth grade in junior high school, started.
Speaker 1: Yeah, junior high school, and then you continued over--
Speaker 2: Carried over, yes.
Speaker 1: --through high school.  Oh, I was asking you about work.  I didn't wanna interrupt that.  But you, you said you worked all, at some kind of job all your life basically.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you were working in high school as well as--
Speaker 2: Yes, in high school, I had a job on the weekend at the carwash and also I worked on a laundry truck.  There was one man, Mr. Scott, who drove a laundry truck to customers in the black neighborhoods, and I was fortunate enough to be able to be hired by him to work after school and on weekends.  And then I had various other odd jobs in high school, cutting grass for neighbors and relatives.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so you start high school basically in tenth grade, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is, now, this is the, you're fifteen, yeah, in the 10th grade, right?  Is that true?  That should be about right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's about right.
Speaker 1: And this is nineteen, what?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I graduated in '61' [1961], so that's three years before that.
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-eight [1958]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '58' [1958].
Speaker 1: Yeah, '58' [1958].  Okay, now, this is the year your parents [Eunice and Willie Lee Mitchell] got back together too, right?  You were fifteen?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was fifteen when my parents remarried.
Speaker 1: Now, how did, I mean from your perspective as a teenager, how did this take place and then what did it mean to you?
Speaker 2: Well, my dad had been away during the period that I literally became a man.  And so when my mom indicated that they were going to remarry, she said, I'm going--your dad and I are going to get back together and remarry.  What do you think?  I said, mom, I don't need him now.  I said, but, you do.  So go ahead.  By that, I meant, I knew how to make it on my own at that point.  But, and so I had no animosity about my dad.  I always respected him, unlike my sisters, who grew angry because he wasn't there.  I never was angry because he wasn't there.  But his coming home provided a home that we owned for the first time, which was a benefit that we never had before.  And so he also still was a fantastic parent and a fantastic parent is one that has common sense and uses it on your behalf so that you will believe that you can accomplish anything.  And so from that perspective, my dad was a fantastic parent, and he and my mother getting back together was a blessing for them and for the family.
Speaker 1: Did it kind of give you a boost after that, I mean I know you told her it didn't make any difference now, but did it kind of give you a boost in high school to have your dad come back to the household?
Speaker 2: Well, not really.  By then, I had learned to have confidence in me.  And while it was a significant event for my mom, and she was happy about it and so was I. But I was an independent man at that point, still respecting my father, but it did not provide--their getting back together didn't really provide any boost for me.
Speaker 1: That's interesting 'cause I would guess, I mean being a teenager is a sensitive time, and you know how people, other teenagers are and how your peers perceive you and all that.  Having your parents actually remarry in a church seems like it would be significant, I mean in terms of, you know, publicly, you re-bonding your family and all that sort of thing.  You didn't feel that way?
Speaker 2: No, because I was the only boy and the male child.  I had assumed really the perspective of sort of an adult for a long period of time, take care of yourself, have a job, earn the money, do what was necessary to prepare yourself for your future, and at that point, I guess the foundation that had been laid by my parents, the dad with the principle of work, with the principle of being, taking advantage of your education and the mother with the expectations of a great performance at whatever you were to do, the foundation had been laid for me.  And so from then, and the underpinning of a religion which allowed you to know that there's a power that you can depend on that exceeds any abilities that you have, and so those things made me prepared for the rest of the world.  And so I was glad that they got back together, but it didn't really provide a personal benefit for me.
Story_ID: 24785
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, I know when we first started the interview you said that you, when I was asking you about your mother's [Eunice Mitchell] background, you said you really didn't become close to her until after your father [Willie Lee Mitchell] passed, which is some years later.  What was, I mean, was--so growing up, I mean I don't know.  In my mind, it kind of I see it as isolated in some way.  Your father's not there, and you're not as close to your mother, but you've got to work, and you've got to struggle and all that but you spend a lot of time in school.  I mean how did--
Speaker 2: Well, let me try to explain that.  When I say I didn't really communicate with my mother until my dad passed away, by that I meant I spent time at home on the holidays, bringing my family back to them, but you really didn't talk very much.  You enjoyed the meals, you said your hello's, you enjoyed the time that was there, but I didn't talk to my mother about her life until after my dad passed away.  And so growing up, there was daily conversation between you and your mother.  I mean there were rules that had to be obeyed.  There were responsibilities you had to execute.  So the communication was there growing up.  Everything you needed in terms of the support that she could provide for you, she did.  My mother was miraculous in terms of the things that she did that she knew would influence our lives, and she did those things.  I won't go into details, but she did all of those things, and she also was the bottom line.  You had to answer to her for the things that were not accomplished in the way that she expected them.  So I had all of the intricate communications that you needed in a family life even with a single parent at the time, all right.  So, no, my life was not devoid of parental influence, communications and what was necessary.  That all occurred.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I think I understand you.  You're saying that on a role level of mother and son, there was a strong relationship, but you didn't really know a lot about her personally until later.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 24786
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, high school, now, did you take a leadership role in high school?  You're an honor student--
Speaker 2: Yes, I always participated in the student councils.  I had leadership positions in the student councils.  I was in the honor societies.  I was voted "Mr. Most Likely to Succeed", and so you participated in all of the activities that were expected of an academically performing student.  You know, the safety patrol.  My mother [Eunice Mitchell] was able to buy me a uniform when I was in the sixth grade.  And so class officers and so forth.  I had those kind of positions during the various years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, let's see, okay.  So, and you mentioned earlier the science, the summer science program at North Carolina A and T [State University].  Now, when did this take place, when you were a junior, you said, a junior in high school?
Speaker 2: Okay, when I was a junior in high school, the National Science Foundation [NSF] all over the United States sponsored summer programs in mathematics and science on the historically black college campuses.  Now, North Carolina Central University was in Durham, North Carolina where I grew up.  And that's where I participated in this workshop.  North Carolina A and T was my undergraduate school.  So during the summer of my junior year, about thirty-five students from all across North Carolina had the opportunity to participate in mathematics workshops and to select either chemistry or biology.  And these workshops were taught by PhD professors.  So we were exposed to mathematics and science experiments that our high school teachers had no knowledge of.  They were extraordinarily inspirational, stretched our imaginations and our abilities and provided us with a preview of just how enjoyable science and mathematics was.  And that summer played an important role in my decision to earn a doctorate in science.
Speaker 1: Now, who were some of your instructors?  Do you remember who?
Speaker 2: There was a Dr. Zinnerman (ph.) that had designed the chemistry laboratory experiments that we performed.  I'll never forget his showing us how to make a lead sulfate battery, to put together the components and to light a light bulb with this fluid and some metal that was suspended in it.  I remember the single crystals that we grew out of a saturated solution with a seed suspended in a closed jar.  Those were extraordinary experiments for me at the time, that reinforced that I was gonna become a chemist or a chemical engineer.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this is for that one summer.  They didn't do it again, then after--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was probably done each summer.  But the next summer, I was graduating from high school, so on my way to college  So I only had an opportunity to participate one year.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, did you meet during that summer any black PhDs that were in science?
Speaker 2: Well, North Carolina Central is a historically black college--
Speaker 1: I know, but during that program you mentioned Dr. Zinnerman.  I assumed he's not--
Speaker 2: In that program, there were other people, but his name is the one I remember because his experiments just excited me so much.  But, yes, the person that taught us mathematics was a PhD also, but I don't remember that person's name.
Story_ID: 24787
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, your senior year in high school, were there any special honors afforded you or did you take any special responsibilities?
Speaker 2: Senior year in high school, let's see.  I was in the Honor Society, and I had won, you know, a number of the awards that they give to seniors, but I don't recall them.  I'd have to really go look at my yearbook to determine the ones that they were.  I remember being voted "Mr. Most Likely to Succeed", but there were others that I don't recall at the moment.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, but you were in the National Honor Society.  Now, did you, do you remember participating in a science fair.  I know your--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In the tenth grade, you had the opportunity to participate in a science fair and it was voluntary.  It was not mandatory.  I recall what Mr. Packingham had said and so I entered, I actually fabricated an entire human body out of paper Mache and I put all of the internal organs in this paper Mache, fabricated human body.  That was the first project I did as a science fair, and the next year I made homemade soap, different types.  I had seen my grandmother make soap when I was five years old in the backyard, and so I read about the components that you needed to execute saponification, that's what soap making was called.  So you needed a source of fat, a source of base.  And I literally fabricated about six different types of soap and entered that in the science fair in the eleventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, that's interesting, okay.  So, were you Valedictorian as a student?
Speaker 2: No, I was number six.  I had, I had great competition (laughter).  It was a large high school (laughter), and there were a large number of very performing student.  There were four girls that finished one through four, and my friend, a male, finished fifth, and I was number six, out of a class of 367.
Story_ID: 24788
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so you already knew--now, did you have counseling about going, where to go to college or did you just naturally think you were gonna go to North Carolina Central [University]?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew I was going to go to college when I was in elementary school.  Education, so high school education couldn't do it.  So I knew I was going to undergraduate school then and made the decision that I was gonna get a PhD degree when I was a junior in college.  I was going to college even if there was no economic way to get there.  My mother [Eunice Mitchell] indicated that, well, you know, son, I can't afford to pay for you to go to college.  I said, Mother, I'm going to college if I have to work a year and go a year.  But I also had the resolve that I was not going to North Carolina Central College in my hometown because I'd still be living in the same house that they had, didn't even apply to North Carolina Central (laughter).  But at the time, I got a small scholarship, a loan and an on-campus job at North Carolina A and T in Greensboro, and that allowed me to live off campus.  And, fortunately, at that time, anyone who had the aspirations to go to college could get there through a loan and work-study programs.  What is unfortunate today, college is so expensive that not everyone can afford that as a benefit.
Story_ID: 24789
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so you went to North Carolina A and T [State University]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for undergraduate school.  And, now, this is 1961, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You start in the fall of '61' [1961].  Now, this is right after the historical sit-in's, right?
Speaker 2: That was just before them.
Speaker 1: Just before them, okay.
Speaker 2: My wife and I, along with 2,000 other students at North Carolina A and T were arrested for protesting segregated lunch counters and theaters.  And we spent the equivalent of about a year in a jail.
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry (laughter), a week (laughter)--
Speaker 1: A week, all right (laughter).
Speaker 2: --in a jail (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (laugher) tough.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Not a year.
Speaker 1: Now, let's go back a little bit now.  You've already given us the end of the story, but what's the beginning.  Now, how did you get involved and were you, first of all, as a high school student, now, you were in high school during, in middle school and high school during the days when Montgomery Improvement Association, Montgomery Bus Boycott was going on.  And that was in the news.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The Richmond Improvement Association in Richmond, Virginia was doing stuff, but it wasn't in the news.  There were other towns where, were doing sit-in's and demonstrations and bus boycotts, Florida, different places, but a lot of this wasn't in the news.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But we do know about Montgomery--and I'm not sure how much it was publicized in the South, you know, too.
Speaker 2: Well, we were aware of it.  Television provided information to us about what was going on at the time.  When we were student at North Carolina A and T, the four young students that actually sat-in at the lunch counter and were arrested, galvanized the entire campus and so--
Speaker 1: Well, did it take you by surprise or did you know they were gonna do it?
Speaker 2: They did not announce to anyone that they were going to do that.  It was just done.  And so after the fact, and after they were arrested, virtually the entire campus went down to picket the theaters, the segregated theaters and the lunch counters because we knew that the education that we were acquiring could not be fully utilized as long as segregation existed.  And so all of us made the decisions that while our educations were extremely valuable, our ability to live lives as full Americans was even more important.  And if there was a sacrifice at that time, then so be it.  But we also didn't believe that our participating in protesting the evils of civil rights would lead to preventing us getting a college education.
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute now.  I'm sure somebody said, now, hold on, you know.  It's been like this for a long time.  What do you think going downtown's gonna accomplish?  You know, it's just gonna go right back the way it was.  Didn't you hear that kind of talk?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, there were individuals--
Speaker 1: You guys will ruin your education.
Speaker 2: --and even some people, some professors on the campus who attempted to convince the students to stop the protests and come back to campus.  And we ignored that.  We were cognizant enough to know that if segregation continued to exist, our lives would continue--our lives and those of our children would continue to be attenuated and would not allow us to have full access to what Americans could have.  So that entire campus of 2,000 kids, I believe, all had the same faith and determination that we were gonna do what was necessary to help end segregation.
Speaker 1: Now, once again, now, you're going against the rules and you were telling me earlier how important it is to follow the rules, and I'm sure there were people said, wait a minute.  Now, you all are breaking the rules.  What would make 2,000 students--
Speaker 2: After a while, you realize that there is a basic right that you've been denied.  You've lived your entire life, the segregated facilities, the signs, the negative images.  And at some point, you begin to realize that unjust rules don't matter, that it becomes a responsibility to protest them.  And we had all gained the confidence at that time that it was our responsibility to protest them.  And, therefore, if there were to be consequences, prison information on our records or arrests information on our records, then so be it.  But there were so many participants in the Civil Rights that there were never, we were never brought to trial.  There were never any trials.  There were, charges were all dropped when the protests had stopped.
Speaker 1: Tell us your story in terms of what you saw, what made you go down there, and then you said you and your, your future wife--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, went down.  Where did you go?  What happened to you?  What happened to--where did they put you in jail and what was your whole experience in jail overnight?
Speaker 2: Right.  At that time, Jesse Jackson [Rev. Jesse Jackson] was at North Carolina A and T [State University].  He was two years ahead of me.  We were in the same fraternity.  Jesse had always been the public student leader type, and we heard the information that he had to say to the students.  And we had witnessed the previous TV expositions of the mistreatment of African Americans, and after a talk that he gave to the students that were listening, we all knew that it was our responsibility to protest segregation.  And so the decision was made.  It was something we were going to do.  We didn't consider any consequences.  If it would interrupt our education in some way, so be it.
Speaker 1: So did he speak on campus or in a church or--
Speaker 2: No, he was speaking on campus, just to a group of students who were listening.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that partially gave us the inspiration to participate, and, in fact, he and smaller groups had already been down protesting.  And this is when the mass of the campus then followed suit.  What I was thinking, segregation is wrong, and I have a responsibility as an individual to do what I can to help end it.  And this was what we were going--I was going to do personally.  We were taken down and placed in an abandoned hospital.  I learned later that it had been an old polio hospital.
Story_ID: 24790
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute.  I don't wanna get too far ahead now.  Now, first you had to go to the point of where you're arrested, right?
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, we were arrested on the sidewalks outside of a theater downtown in Greensboro [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All individually, some loaded on buses, other loaded into cars and taken to this holding place.
Speaker 1: So what, did they tell you all to disperse and--
Speaker 2: Well, yes, disperse or you will be arrested for trespassing.
Speaker 1: Were you all standing or sitting?
Speaker 2: No, we were moving.
Speaker 1: You were moving?
Speaker 2: Walking, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, at the time, you were supposed to be able to protest and not block the entrance of places by continuously moving.  But we were arrested.
Speaker 1: Were you singing?
Speaker 2: Well, there probably were, "We Shall Overcome" and other songs of that particular nature that we knew at the time.  I'm pretty sure we did.  But we were not, but there were so many of us that we were never individually booked or photographed or fingerprinted.  We were just placed under arrest, taken to this abandoned building and held there for three or four days before we were all released, without charges.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, how many students were there?
Speaker 2: At the location where I was, there was probably 600 but they had other places that they took other students as well.
Speaker 1: So the total number--
Speaker 2: Total number, there must have been at least 1,500 that were taken to these places and held.
Speaker 1: And I suppose they exceeded the capacity of the jail, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, the jail capacity had by far been exceeded.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And I actually have, I took notes about what happened during the course of that.  I have the paper towels that I fully wrote maybe ten pages, front and back, I have the notes that I wrote.  I found them, looking through my memoirs about six months ago.  I'm going to see if I can get the museum to accept them as a part of the exhibit that they have of the Civil Rights demonstrations in Greensboro.
Speaker 1: Now, were you motivated to write to share with future generations or what was your thinking at the time?  Did you think it was historic or--
Speaker 2: I just thought it was necessary to record what went on, what the administrators at the University said, what the law officers said, the discussions that we had within the room of about twenty students who were collated together in this abandoned building, the conversations that the men, the boys had with the girls.  They separated us, but we were able to pass notes back and forth.  And so I just thought it was necessary and would be beneficial to record that, and I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were any of the students hurt?
Speaker 2: No, fortunately, at that time there were none of the cruel acts done to us in Greensboro and to our college students.  Later on, there was a protest at North Carolina A and T [State University].  I think this was during the Kent State era, where a student was killed on the campus by National Guardsmen.  But we had none of that to occur in the earlier demonstrations.
Speaker 1: Did the police exhibit a lot of vitriol or hate towards you all?
Speaker 2: They didn't.  Fortunately, for some reason, that didn't occur with the officers who arrested us.  You know, there were none of the guard dogs, vicious dogs that you saw on TV further in the South.  There was, "You all, if you don't disperse, you will be placed under arrest", very cordial engagement.
Speaker 1: Okay, and students basically complied and didn't--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you were held overnight.
Speaker 2: Oh, about three or four days.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they provide any blankets for you or bedding or anything or facilities or--I guess there's a facility--
Speaker 2: The first day there was not very much provided.  I think about the second day, there were blankets, and extra snacks in terms of food and so forth.  We were treated as well as could be expected under the circumstances.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And under what circumstances were you released?
Speaker 2: Well, after it became clear that the court system couldn't handle that many people, and that they just couldn't blanket individually arrest everyone because our lawyer said we all wanted a trial by jury.  And so essentially, legally, they couldn't process that number of people.  So the charges were dropped, and we were released back to campus.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is what month during '6l' [1961]?  This is--
Speaker 2: It was not cold, so it was probably April, May.
Story_ID: 24791
Speaker 1: Okay, so no charges were brought against you, you were saying?
Speaker 2: No charges were brought against any of the students involved in this Civil Rights protest at that time.
Speaker 1: What about the school administration?  Who is the president of North Carolina A and T [State University] at the time?
Speaker 2: You know, his name is escaping me.
Speaker 1: Well, how did he react--
Speaker 2: Dr. Dowdy, I believe, Dowdy--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --was the president at the time.  And he first attempted to persuade the students to come back to campus immediately after the protest.  But the student leaders and the folks who sort of assumed leadership positions in the locations where we were held all decided that we were not going to voluntarily end the protest until something was done.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were there any recriminations on campus when you got back, anybody suffer at all?
Speaker 2: No, all of the teachers allowed for that circumstance to have interrupted us not taking finals.  And we were not penalized for that.  I can recall that I was awarded the grade that I had earned up to that point, essentially, not counting the--did not negatively count not participating in the finals.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so the adult leaders on the campus knew that we were doing the right thing also.  They just had to assume certain positions because the authorities over the college were indicating that they had to do certain things.  And so while they could be threatened with losing a job as the president of the college if you didn't encourage the students to return, the students really were not penalized by any of the faculty or the administration.
Speaker 1: Yeah, just so people understand that North Carolina A and T is a state school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Even though it was a segregated black school, the authorities, ultimate authority over the school is white--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --segregated North Carolina officials.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So they would try to dictate their terms to the president of, the officials at North Carolina A and T, which were black, right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I believe that was the situation.  It was a land grant college, federally funded, and run by higher-level officials in the state.
Speaker 1: That's right, okay.  So was that, did, was that the final demonstration?
Speaker 2: Those were, yes.  Those were the last demonstrations that had to be done in North Carolina.  After that the ruling came from courts, eventually that all public facilities had to be desegregated and allow everyone to have access.  That went for lunch counters, theaters and any other business that was open to the public.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you look back on it now, do you think that the segregationists in North Carolina, hadn't drawn the line that hard in the ground in the first place?  They were just kind of following custom or do you think that they, it took a lot to dislodge them?
Speaker 2: Well, no, segregation in the South was the rule.  It was the order of the day for those who were in charge of state legislatures, the governors, the centers--the senators and everyone, segregation was the order of the day.  And it was only because of Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King and the Greensboro Four that we ultimately got the legal banding of segregation in public facilities. So there were people, as entrenched, North Carolina has had some of the staunch conservatives even up to seven years ago (laughter), all right.  So we were as much as a state engrossed in segregation and its right for supremacy as any state in the South because there was a black middle class, however, Durham had afforded the African American community to ascend to ownership of insurance companies, banks, theaters and many other businesses, and because there was a significant number of African Americans who were well educated with B.S. and doctorate degrees, etc., it was possible that with that intelligency existing and that ownership, and ability to be in charge of at least that segregated portion of the town that you were allowed to own, that we had the aspirations and so forth to protest and make the Civil Rights passages laws of the land.
Speaker 1: And I just, I've thought, you know, since I've been doing this job, that there are, and after coming back from North Carolina, that there are a significant number of black colleges in North Carolina, maybe more than any other state.  I'm not sure, but--
Speaker 2: I think we have more than any other state.
Speaker 1: Charles Livingston, you've got--
Speaker 2: There's about--
Speaker 1: A and T Central--
Speaker 2: And a plethora of smaller places.
Speaker 1: And it seems like it's a lot of 'em, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that maybe that's, I hear what you're saying in terms of the--
Speaker 2: Well, broadly, education--broadly educating the African American community is also what allowed our entire culture to move forward and advance in this country.
Story_ID: 24792
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in terms of your studies now, in school, who were some of the professors that influenced you and what were you--you were majoring in chemistry, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Well, if we're speaking about the B.S. degree level--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --the influences were provided by a Dr. Cecile and Gerald Edwards.  Dr. Cecile Edwards was funded by the National Science Foundation from the '50's [1950s].  She was a nutritional scientist, and she provided undergraduate educational experiences for chemistry majors.  That's where I was exposed to research, learned that I could do it and made the decision that I was going to pursue a research career.  Her husband, Gerald Edwards, was the chairman of the chemistry department.  He made an extraordinary decision that actually changed the course of my life.  I was going to add ROTC, advanced ROTC in the eleventh grade.  I'm sorry, in my junior year--
Speaker 1: Of college.
Speaker 2: --and I went to him to change my schedule to add advanced ROTC because the $50.00 a month they paid was three times what I made in my little library assistant job on campus.  I took the form to him to add advanced ROTC which meant that I would, upon graduation become an officer, a first lieutenant.  He looked at the form, and said, I thought you told me you were going to graduate school.  I said, I am.  I said, but I might get drafted, and it would be better to be an officer than an enlisted man.  He said, I agree with that.  He said, but I'll tell you what.  I'm not gonna sign this form today, but if you bring it back, I'll sign it.  I never brought it back.  The guys who went into advanced ROTC were on the first boats as second lieutenants going to Vietnam [War, 1959-1975] and many of them never came back to the shores of America.  So his wisdom literally changed the course of my life.  Additionally, Dr. Pendergrass was the one that provided me with the undergraduate chemistry experiments that just were so enjoyable and exciting that I knew I wanted to pursue that profession as a chemist or a chemical engineer.  Those were the people in college that dominantly influenced my life.
Story_ID: 24793
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did, now, you were a fraternity member.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What frat were in?
Speaker 2: I joined the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, as a sophomore.  I had no intensions of joining a fraternity, but I had looked at all the fraternities on campus, and if I were going to join one, the Omegas were the fraternity that I would join.  Three of my homeboys who also went to North Carolina A and T came by one night and said, we're going to pledge.  I was studying.  I said, pledge what?  They said, a fraternity.  I said, which one?  We're gonna join the Lam Porters club.  That is a preliminary group for the Omegas.  I said, okay, that's the one I was going to join too.  So I went with them.  They all quit.  I never started something that I wasn't going to finish, and what reinforced that, the night that we were introduced into the Lam Porters Club, you had to give your name, your classification, your subject area and your grade-point average.  I said, I'm James Mitchell.  I'm a sophomore.  I'm a chemistry major.  I have 3.94 GPA.  That's out of 4.0.  Somebody in the back room said, you can't make this fraternity, you're too smart.  I was in the fraternity that day, didn't say that, but in my mind, in the fraternity that day, and nothing you could do to keep me out.  I enjoyed every day of my fraternity life.  I enjoyed every year of school.  I enjoyed everything as an undergraduate that a young man on a college campus should enjoy.  The movies, the ballgames, the dances, I was there at them all.  But I had my academic requirements done either before I went or I knew that they were going to be done.  Never forget why and what is the most important job as an undergraduate, to prepare yourself for whatever the career is you're going to follow.  That's my message to my young brothers today.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I take it that you were a disciplined student and had a routine, I guess, that you established for yourself?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I had on-campus jobs.  I participated in the entertainment that you should as an undergraduate.  I had all of my academic requirements taken care of, never missed any assignment, never late for any assignment, prepared all the time, every time, for the exams.  I never forgot the reason that I was there and what my mother had said about taking your education seriously.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wondered if, now, did anyone ever--did you know anything about Percy Julian when you were in school?
Speaker 2: Yes, we all had African American month in the high schools and also in the college.  And so I was aware of Percy Julian and what he had done, became more aware of him as an adult chemist because I read about his life and his accomplishments.  He was an extraordinary man, and was one of the people whose lives I read about who allowed me to have the confidence to know that I could accomplish as a chemist as well.
Story_ID: 24794
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have any, did you participate in any programs that you--in college or did you have a chance to go overseas or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, never had a chance to travel or anything.  My summers in college were consumed by a short period of undergraduate research for about six weeks.  And after that I had jobs in Atlantic City [New Jersey] as a busboy as a way I earned money to be able to come back to college and afford the few new clothes and other things that I needed during the course of the academic year.  So there was not the ability to travel and participate in cultural things during the summer.
Speaker 1: Tell us something about being a busboy in Atlantic City [New Jersey] 'cause I've heard before that it was a lucrative--
Speaker 2: It was.  The only job I could get in Durham, North Carolina, after working a week and paying social security, I cleared about twenty bucks.  And I said, mom, I can't stay here and work for this kind of money.  I'm going to Atlantic City with my friends, and we did.  Ultimately, I got a job as a busboy at the "Knife and Fork Inn".  Based on tips, I earned between a hundred a $120 a week, and that was a significant amount of money.  And I was able to save most of that to use for my expenses back in college.  So at the time, the owners of the Knife and Fork Inn where I worked, once they learned I was in college, they told me, all you have to do is write us a letter two weeks before you want a job, and we'll have one for you.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, to put it in perspective, in 1962 or three [1963], $120 a week would be about what a General Motors factory worker would make.  That's, that's pretty good money for a college kid, you know, in those days.
Speaker 2: Yes, it allowed me to afford a significant number of things.  The Knife and Fork Inn was the most exclusive restaurant in Atlantic City, and owners required the waiters and the waitresses to put 10 percent of their tips in a pot, and that was split by the busboys.  And so that was a significant living for me at that time, which supported expenses in college.
Story_ID: 24795
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, well, when it came time for--now, did anything else happen in college we need to talk about before I get you graduated?
Speaker 2: I think we've covered pretty much college.  I made the decision that I was gonna get a doctorate degree after having the laboratory classes with Dr. Pendergrass.  He was a Ph.D. chemist.  And so that reinforced in my mind that I was going to graduate school.  I also had another professor who encouraged me to apply for a summer job at North Carolina--well, summer job at Oakridge National Laboratory.  That was an experience that also had an extraordinary impact on my life because I got to see science at a large facility in the way that it is done in the large research organizations in the world.  And that further reinforced the fact that I wanted a life of that particular style.
Speaker 1: Now, where is Oakridge?
Speaker 2: Oakridge National Laboratory is in Oakridge, Tennessee.  I spent the summer before going to graduate school, after I graduated from college and before going to graduate school, I spent a summer at Oakridge.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, who--did Dr. Pendergrass help you make your graduate school connection?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did, and also a professor named Dr. Samuel Von Winbush and Dr. Cecile H. Edwards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They provided me with information about the quality of the schools that I applied to, and because two of them had earned degrees at Iowa State University and they recommended it highly, I attended Iowa State for my doctorate.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the professors at Iowa State were familiar with Dr. Edwards and Dr. Winbush?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 24796
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's, okay, that's the way it ought to happen.  So Iowa State University, now, before you fully out of North Carolina A and T, now, did you graduate with honors and did you make any kind of presentation at the graduation?
Speaker 2: I graduated summa cum laude but was not the top student.  I was the top chemistry student, but again, my, my roommate and I were excellent students.  He was an engineer.  He bested me in college too (laughter), finished two spots ahead of me.  But there were, the accolades were taken--
Speaker 1: Who is he?  We have to get his name now.  He keeps--
Speaker 2: His name is Dr. Reginald Mitchner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We went, grew up in Durham [North Carolina], went, you know, to the same schools, became fast friends in high school, determined that we were gonna be roommates in college.  And we were for four years because we had the same academic aspirations and habits and so forth.  We were very compatible roommates.  But he was an extraordinary intellectual kid as well, mechanical engineer.
Speaker 1: So I just--this may seem like a question peering in, trying to peer into something that's obvious, but does it help to have a roommate and a best friend that's a scholar as well, I mean someone who's competing for the highest level?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, because we had the same aspirations and the same discipline.  We didn't have to worry about being interrupted by some voicetrous roommate who wasn't on his way up. We were always cognizant of each other and what we needed to do.  And so we didn't drink.  We weren't out all times of night, and so we were very compatible.  We traveled together, back and forth to the university.  We reinforced each other, fast friends, I meant, and it certainly helps to have someone that is of the same caliber, motivation, aspirations as you are because you spend a great deal of time with whoever your roommate is.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know sometimes you hear students complain that they have a, they have great friends that are--but they're doing the wrong thing or they're doing, you know, the--it helps to have someone on the same page.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, just wanted to make that point.
Story_ID: 24797
Speaker 1: All right, so Iowa, this is Iowa--
Speaker 2: Iowa State University.
Speaker 1: --State University.
Speaker 2: In Ames [Iowa].
Speaker 1: Okay, in Ames.  All right, different from University of Iowa, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was that, now, this is the--is this your first trip, so-called North?  I mean, how North is Iowa in terms of its attitude (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Iowa was a fascinating place.  I experienced only excellent people.  The graduate students, the people in the housing complex where we lived, all of my professors and so forth were among the most cordial people you could meet.  I never personally witnessed, myself, any incident that was of a racial nature.  That went on in some of the other cities in Iowa, and there were protests and so forth on the campus, even at the undergraduate level.  But we never experienced that, and my wife and I never experienced that in the church or the communities where we participated on the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, something I didn't ask about.  We, we talked about your future wife, but you actually got married then before you graduated?  Is that it?
Speaker 2: Yes, I met my wife in the freshman chemistry class at North Carolina A and T [State University].
Speaker 1: And what's her name?
Speaker 2: Alice Jean Mitchell.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was a Foods and Nutrition major and we actually both worked for Dr. Cecile Edwards, doing research in her lab.  And the first day I saw her, I knew that there was something about that young lady, and I was gonna get to know her.  We were married the summer of my junior year, actually.  She continued to live in her dorm.  I continued to live in mine the senior year.  And we lived together as husband and wife on holidays at her place and my mother's place.  And we lived together as a family when we graduated our senior year, and went to graduate school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got married in '63' [1963], is that right?
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964], okay.
Speaker 2: June '64' [1964].
Speaker 1: All right, and you graduated in 1965?
Speaker 2: Yes, the next year.
Speaker 1: All right, so 1965, Iowa State University.  Now, is your wife going to school too?
Speaker 2: For a while.  Our daughter was born in '66 [1966], well, December of '66 [1966].  So my wife stayed home and took care of our daughter for about a year.  Then she pursued a master's degree while I was working on my Ph.D.
Story_ID: 24798
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right, so you said you had a pretty--now, is Iowa State [University] the same school that George Washington Carver graduated from?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: George Washington Carver got his doctorate in botany at Iowa State and so Iowa State had a history of graduating African Americans with Ph.D. degrees.  So it wasn't strange for them to know that we had the capability to earn doctorate degrees.  And the chemistry department that I was in had had four other African American graduates prior to me getting there.  And there were seven of us there at the same time.
Speaker 1: Seven?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's something for those days, and even for today, seven Ph.D. candidates, I mean Masters degree candidates on campus at the same time in a major state university.  That's, I mean that's a--that would be remarkable today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the time that was a significant number of African Americans pursuing their degree at the same time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in a state like Iowa where there aren't, there weren't that many black people, right, at Ames?
Speaker 2: Yes, most of us who were there at the time were out of state, admitted to Iowa.
Speaker 1: And so there's a historical commitment at Iowa State, I guess--
Speaker 2: There had been.
Speaker 1: Had been?
Speaker 2: There were a number of professors there who had had African American Ph.D. students and there's an organic professor, and I'll remember his name at the moment, Henry Gilman.  But Henry Gilman had learned that African Americans work as hard for Ph.D. degrees as anyone else.  And he'd had a history of African Americans earning Ph.D. degrees from him.  I learned after I graduated that my major professor had also had a previous African American Ph.D. student to complete his group.  And so then I learned why I had such an excellent opportunity in his group.
Speaker 1: Now, who was your professor there?
Speaker 2: Dr. Charles V. Banks.  He was a full professor when I was assigned to his group at Iowa State.  He knew that I needed the time to assimilate all of the knowledge and everything else I needed in order to be successful at Iowa State.  And for, I had a research assistantship.  And he did not require me to execute any research experiments for nine months because for fourteen hours a day, my head was in a book or I was in a classroom.  And he knew that I needed that.  He's an extraordinary man, gave me the opportunity to select whatever projects I wanted to do, allowed me to independently become a scientist and to learn how to do research.  And as a result of the way he handled my doctorial training, I've never had any difficulty determining what to do, why to do it, how to do it and succeed in doing it in a research or technology development arena.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a time of intense studying and research.  So, did you take time to celebrate a Master's degree at all or--
Speaker 2: No, I knew I was gonna get a doctorate degree.  And so in chemistry, you were allowed to qualify for a doctoral program and you were not required to do a Masters.  In some fields, a Masters is mandatory.  It wasn't in ours and so I did not write a Master's degree.  I did a project that I completed and wrote a research paper and then switched to another doctorial project, but did not write a Master's thesis.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was your project about and--
Speaker 2: My Ph.D. problem was Synergic Solvent Extractions of Rare Earths Using Mixed CayLay Complexes.  There was separation science involved in separating the rare earths using this chemical extraction system and also, making the extracted elements and compounds where they were elements converted to compounds, have the ability to be volatilized in gas chromatograph.  And so I worked out the chemistry that was associated with those systems to make these elemental species to be changed into a neutral molecule that then was volatile and could separated by gas chromatography.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a way you can break that down for the uninitiated?
Speaker 2: Yes, in aqueous solutions, if you were to dissolve salt, sodium chloride, it would dissociate into a sodium ion with a positive charge and CL minus anion with a negative charge.  Well, iron can also exist with also exist with a positive charge.  I was able to react a positively charged iron, I-R-O-N, with other molecules that would neutralize it.  And now, you could transfer this charged particle from an aqueous phase into an organic phase, organic, being, vegetable oil is an organic phase.  And then you could take this neutral molecule now and be able to separate it from other molecules, based on the volatilization of them.
Story_ID: 24800
Speaker 1: So at Iowa State, you were telling us about your, this is your PhD dissertation.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so, what's the significance and what's the practical use of your research?
Speaker 2: Okay, for the doctorate degree, the research actually allows you to learn how to execute research.  And so the project that is selected is one that no one has done that before or they haven't done it the way that you have pursued it.  You've gotten additional information.  You either had a practical problem to solve and explain or you had some fundamental science that needed to be elucidated, and you are responsible for designing the course of experiments that led to the generation of this fundamental understanding of a particular phenomenon.  And so, at the time, the rare earths are a series of elements that all have very, very similar chemical properties.  And to be able to separate them from each other was a significant challenge.  And it had only been accomplished before by something ion exchange separations.  And so the science then became available to convert these charged elements into neutral molecules that were volatile.  And so now, if the molecules were volatile, there was a different medium in which you could subject them and now separate all of the rare earths without doing this complicated, long, detailed ion exchange chemistry.  And so my job was could we synthesize a neutral molecule of all of the rare earths, simultaneously form all of the molecules, place them in a suitable medium that will now allow you to accomplish this separation by gas chromatography, another convenient way to separate molecules that had similar properties.  And so I had to work out the aqueous phase and organic phase chemistry for forming these molecules that would allow this separation by a new technique.  So that was the significance and the objective of the research at the doctorate level.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what are the "rare earths"?  Can you just break down what they are?
Speaker 2: That's a group of the elements, and they're called rare because their abundance in the universe is low.  You take something like silicon, sand, it's extremely abundant, okay.  You take nitrogen in the atmosphere or oxygen in the atmosphere, extremely abundant.  The rare earths' abundance are in the few percentages in terms of their comparison with the abundance of all of the other elements.  So that's why they were called rare earths as a family.
Speaker 1: So can you name 'em for us?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, Neodymium, Europium, Gadolinium and a number of others.  There are nine of the, those particular elements.  Thorium is, has functions sort of like rare earths, but it's not in that particular group.  But Europium and Neodymium are the famous ones.  Neodymium in terms of magnets that can be made from them.  Erbium. Ytterbium has, well, Ytterbium has properties similar to rare earths and can be found with rare earths, but are not one of the rare earth themselves.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, I thought you were gonna say something that I was familiar with (laughter).  But those are, yeah, these are the rare earths that you were separating?
Speaker 2: Right.  And some of 'em are used for imaging, NMR [nuclear magnetic resonance] imaging is a very prevalent use for Gadolinium and also Europium is a fluorescent rare earth that has a number of applications.
Story_ID: 24801
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so when you were looking, now, did you do a post-doc, yeah, where did you do your post-doctoral work?
Speaker 2: I also decided that I would not do a post-doctorate.  I believe that the four years of training that I had prepared me adequately to pursue a professional degree, a professional career with a doctorate degree.  Once I decided that I was going to select a corporate research job over a job as a professor, then I didn't really need to pursue the-- a post-doctorate.  It was possible to work at a corporate research facility that allowed you to acquire even more than you could as a post-doc.  So I decided that if I were to enter academia, it would be later in life, where the original selection of a career allowed me to do and provide evidence that I had done what was necessary to be included into a college as a professor.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you graduated, you got your PhD in 1970, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, now your advisor was, was that Dr. Banks?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, Dr. Charles V. Banks.  And you went on to Bell Laboratories which, directly, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: From the University of Iowa [sic, Iowa State University].  Now, how did that take place and how was that hooked up?
Speaker 2: Okay, there are some things you don't have control over in your life, and there are many things that you do.  One of the things that you don't have control over is the job market at the time that you are interviewing.  I interviewed in the fall of 1968 with expectations that I would be graduating with my doctorate a year later.  There has never been a time in, since the '50's [1950s] that was a better time to be interviewing than the fall of 1968.  The economy was wide open, and there were corporations looking to hire every place.  I had fourteen interviews and thirteen job offers.  And the following year, the economy was shutting down, and there were virtually only a handful of corporations that were even interviewing.  And some of my cohorts were slowing their doctorate degrees because that was the only employment they had.  And so, I was blessed with seeking a job at one of the times when it was the best opportunity in America to be looking for work.  And so Bell Laboratories was, I learned after the interview that it had the reputation of being among the best corporate research facility on Planet Earth.  And I made the decision that if that was true, that's where I was supposed to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, just a word, now, do you think that the political climate of '68' [1968] had something to do with the, 'cause I know a lot of black people were hired for the first time after the riots of '68' [1968]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --after Dr. King's [Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination.
Speaker 2: Yes, it could have been influenced significantly by those prior events, yes.  But it was just a marvelous time to be, for anyone to be looking for employment at that time.
Story_ID: 24802
Speaker 1: But in terms of Dr. King [Martin Luther King Jr.], you said something earlier, you know, about, maybe an hour ago about a personal experience with Dr. King where he--tell us about that.  What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, all of us who grew up in that period were extraordinarily impressed and admired Dr. Martin Luther King because of the positioning that he had caused our complete era to be aware of and his galvanizing along with others, the cognizance of the fact that segregation was wrong.  I had the opportunity to hear a number of his speeches.  He was a profound speaker.  At the Knife and Fork Inn where I was the busboy, I had the opportunity to witness he, his wife, Dr. [Ralph] Abernathy and several others of his colleagues ate at the restaurant.  I was able to bus their tables.  So I got to see the man in person.  And so, he was just an extraordinarily impressive person who was doing something that America and African America needed.
Speaker 1: So, did you have a chance to say anything to Dr. King or Abernathy?
Speaker 2: I had a chance to speak to him, and he obviously spoke back.  But I didn't want to (laughter) interfere, and didn't.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can just imagine that he would have welcomed the chance to speak to you.
Speaker 2: He would have taken the time and would have welcomed the opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's something.  All right, now, so you were actually in, you were working on your PhD when Dr. King was assassinated.  Was there a special program or how did it affect the people at Iowa State?
Speaker 2: Well, everyone was actually devastated by that event, and most of us don't want to contemplate that his death was a planned event by people who probably have never been brought to justice because of it.  So the world was denied the influence of Martin Luther King and John and Robert Kennedy.  And it was no accident that those men were deleted from America.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you really think it was a plot or it had a, it was no, it wasn't just a--do you think it was a single person that did it or do you think, do you have a--
Speaker 2: I do not think it was a random incident, done by just an ordinary, isolated person who decided to do that themselves.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, do you have--we probably shouldn't get that deep into it.  But who do you think did it?
Speaker 2: Well, when history is about to be changed, and it is clear that it is about to be changed, drastically and significantly, there are those who will alter that history if they can by taking a specific action.  And I believe at that time history was positioned to be drastically changed in America, and so there are folks who believe that they can control the incidents and influence history.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you don't know who, idea about who--
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 24803
Speaker 1: Okay, so, and so, after graduating in 1970, so you joined Bell Labs [Bell Laboratories].  Now, this is, as you said, Bell Labs has been touted by the people we've interviewed as one of the greatest places to work.  Of course, the culture is destroyed now, but at that time, it was a scientist's dream.
Speaker 2: It absolutely was one of the best corporate research facilities on Planet Earth.  It was run by managers who had first been accomplished scientists themselves.  You didn't get to be a manager at the AT&T Bell Laboratories Research Facility unless you were an extraordinary researcher first.  And so the people in charge of the place understood what was necessary in an environment in order for it to be essentially perfect from the standpoint of supporting, fostering and allowing scientific and technological excellence to take place.  I had the blessings of enjoying Bell Laboratories for thirty years.  It was the type of environment where you couldn't believe that you were paid to do something that was so enjoyable and to do it under conditions that were so excellent.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's hardly anyone that says something like that, but that's, those who talk about Bell Labs do speak that highly of it.  So, for instance, what made it such an enjoyable place to work?
Speaker 2: Well, it was such an enjoyable place to work because money was not an obstacle to accomplishing the impossible.  If a young person had an idea about something and it had a finite probability of being feasible, the only thing you had to do was convince the manager of your organization that this idea concept was worth pursuing and that if brought to fruition, its scientific impact would be extraordinary, and it was possible for you to do that.  That could be done in a conversation and on one page.  It didn't require a 300-page research proposal.  So you could pursue extraordinary research ideas and so forth without exhaustive inputs and justifications before the fact.  You had colleagues on your hallway who were experts in virtually all aspects of science and technology.  You could learn in a thirty-minute conversation with one of your colleagues what would require you three months of digging through the literature and research in order to acquire the knowledge.  You could almost instantly generate a collaboration with anyone, excellent people will collaborate at a finger snap with other excellent people.  And you had access.  If you indicated that you worked at Bell Laboratories, that almost immediately gave you access to collaborations with anybody else in the country.  And so it was just an amazing place where the money, the infrastructure, the intellect, the vision and all of those things came together that allowed important science to be done.
Story_ID: 24804
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what were some of your, I guess key projects at Bell Labs [Bell Laboratories]?
Speaker 2: Okay, I'll talk about the science ones first, and then others next.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I joined Bell Laboratories at a time when optical wave guide technology was just beginning.  And a challenge at that time was to be able to fabricate optical fiber which is glass component with sufficient purity that you could allow electrons, you could allow photons to be transmitted through the fiber in order to carry telecommunications information.  And so my first project that I volunteered to take on was to develop the analytical methods that allowed the purification of glass-making components and the identifications of the impurities that had to be absent because they would absorb photons and prevent you from being able to use optical fiber for telecommunications purposes.  So that was the first project that I worked on.  And I worked out some of the earlier analytical chemistry techniques, methods and instrumentation for determining ultra low levels of impurities that would preclude optical fiber technology from being developed.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Other projects were chemical engineering related where we produced an electro-chemical system that at the flick of a button, you could produce extraordinarily toxic gasses that were essential for doping semi-conductor wafers.  Prior to that time, you had to store these toxic gasses in compress cylinders and if you had an accident with a cylinder, a catastrophe could occur because these dangerously poisonous gases could be released into the atmosphere.  I, with a group of my collaborators, developed a chemical engineering system where we didn't store these toxic gasses any more.  We used metal and appropriate reagents that when you turned electricity on, you generated the toxic gasses and you could use them in real time for semi-conductor applications.  Those were the most important projects I had at Bell Laboratories.
Speaker 1: Can you give me a timeframe for these projects?
Speaker 2: Oh, the optical wave guide technology, I started in March of 1970, and I worked through about 1985 in various aspects of the ultra purification of optical wave guide and analytical reagents and developing the analytical chemistry that laid the foundation for allowing optical fiber technology to be developed.  The In Situ Generation chemistry was done about 1990 to '93' [1993].
Story_ID: 24805
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you work for AT&T Bell Labs, do you get any, are you allowed to patent anything as a, and get--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had five patents at Bell Laboratories.  One of them was this In Situ Generation chemistry that I talked about.  A second one was associated with generating cylene.  That first one was associated with generating arsine.  I also have a patent for the electrophoretic deposition of diamond to provide patterning on silicon wafers.  And there were a couple of others that also were associated with the microwave plasma deposition of diamond.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you see any, will you see any personal benefit from those patents, I mean in terms of--
Speaker 2: Well, at the time, because AT&T Bell Laboratories was owned by a monopoly, AT&T, all patents that occurred at Bell Laboratories were assigned over to AT&T and made available to the public.  Individual inventors did not reap any of the benefits from patents that were awarded at Bell Laboratories.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so it's not a time period where it'll revert to you or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  But Bell Labs pays pretty good money.  That's what I understand (laughter), right.
Speaker 2: Yes, the salaries were excellent, and you move through the managerial ladder, the salaries and compensation became even better to the extent of being extraordinary.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so when a youngster asks can you earn a significant living in science and technology, I say, absolutely, but you wanna make sure that if you want the compensation to continue to increase for a lifetime, you have to get promoted and take on the responsibilities of management.
Story_ID: 24806
Speaker 1: Okay, now, it says here that in 1981--I'm sorry, in '78 [1978], the Journal of Analytical Chemistry appointed you as an editorial advisory board member.  In '81 [1981], you received the Percy Julian Award from NOBCChE [National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  And did you join NOBCChE while you were working on your--it was formed, I guess, in the early '70s [1970s], is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yes, let's see.  Where was I when NOBCCHE--I was at Bell Laboratories when NOBCCHE was first formed.  I participated in some of the earlier discussions and knew some of the founders of NOBCCHE at that time, had met them, in, as a chemist at different places.  I've been a member of the American Chemical Society ever since they allowed you to join as an undergraduate and NOBCCHE from its inception and many of--there are nominal things you do as a scientist.  You belong to certain organizational societies.  You participate in certain kinds of events.  You look to be included into things like the National Academy of Engineering and fellows in other societies.  So, yes, we have done those and service, service to many organizations, we've done over the years.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, '82 [1982], you and your research team received the IR-100 Award for developing the first laser intracavity spectrometer for practical quantitative analysis, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was a system that for the first time, we demonstrated that you could put together an instrument using the laser intracavity effect and you could do high accuracy, quantitative determinations with it.  We didn't invent the intracavity effect, but we reduced to practice the concept so that on a bench, you had an instrument that allowed you to apply it to quantitative analysis and we measured iron at extremely low, subpart per billion levels, quantitatively with accuracy, using that technique.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's see.  Now, in '91 [1991] 'Alternative Starting Matericols', is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: For industrial processes?
Speaker 2: Right.  Chemists look for ways to generate dangerously toxic or environmentally dangerous chemicals In Situ.  That means real time.  Is there some way you can produce these chemicals as you need to use them rather than producing large quantities and storing them.  And so I worked out a number of procedures where you could take some dangerously toxic commodity-based chemicals and generate them as you needed them.  And the periodical put out by the National Academy of Engineering actually published that work that we did.
Speaker 1: Okay, also, now you worked on another paper about the deposition of diamond films on semiconductor substrates, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was one of the patents--
Speaker 1: Patents (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --that I mentioned.  Diamond is a high-performance material that has a matrix of extraordinary properties that exceeds that of any other material.  And we were looking at the time of ways to selectively deposit diamond as an insulating layer on semi, on a semiconductor chip.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, in 1993 you received the "Black Engineer of the Year Award" by "U.S. Black Engineer Magazine".
Speaker 2: Yes, the, that group, BEYA, as it's called, "Black Engineer of the Year Awards" has reached a phenomenal level in the community, recognizing individuals all across the country and in many different media, including the military as well as scientists and provided, provides extraordinary motivational information for young aspirants.
Story_ID: 24807
Speaker 1: All right, '94' [1994], reverberating back to George Washington Carver, you were named Iowa State University's first "George Washington Carver Lecturer"?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was a surprise, and a--well, pleasurable situation to be selected the first lecturer.  And I enjoyed going back to the university.  I gave two lectures, one open to the student body at large and another one was science based.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, it says here also that you, also, in addition to working at Bell Labs, you worked with Lucent Technologies?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, actually, Bell Laboratories started as AT&T Bell Labs.  AT&T owned the company, and then after the AT&T conglomerate was separated, Lucent Technologies became the owner of Bell Laboratories.  So it became Lucent Bell Laboratories.
Speaker 1: But was that, now, some have said, I've heard people say that that was kind of like, when AT&T was split up that was sort of the end of the era for Bell Labs?
Speaker 2: Well, not for, not immediately.  When it was separated into the long-distance telephone part of the corporation and the manufacturing and science part of the corporation which became Lucent Technologies, then that broad-based economic support provided by a monopoly no longer existed.  The manufacturing and science-based part of the company then had to go out in the marketplace, establish businesses and compete in the market sectors where we had manufacturing companies and so forth.  And so the revenue from the telephone part of the business no longer was able to support the broad-based science and technology that Bell Laboratories had been able to afford previously.  And so we became a competitive corporation.  Our money earned in the marketplace was in competition with the other providers of hardware and the software that went along with providing telecommunications, photonics, power system businesses and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So in a sense, the broad-based support of research and technology development no longer existed in the same abundance as it did when AT&T owned Bell Laboratories.
Story_ID: 24808
Speaker 1: Okay, now, there are other activities of yours at Bell Laboratories aside from research that you wanted to highlight.  You said they are even more important.
Speaker 2: Yes, Bell Laboratories was the type of place that once you established that you were able to execute the caliber of science that was expected, you could also influence other aspects of the corporation's business.  For two years, I only did research at Bell Laboratories.  But each summer, I had an African American student to work in research in my laboratory.  The third year there, Bell Laboratories formed an affirmative action committee.  I was invited to join the committee, and as a result of that, I was able to convince the research organization to support a summer research program across the entire research area for African Americans.  That was expanded to include females as well, but during the course of my career in Bell Laboratories over 1,700 juniors, African Americans and females were able to have opportunities to work side-by-side with bona fide research credentialed scientists and engineers, to obtain an indication of what the lifestyle of a scientist or engineer could be like.  I personally was able to convince the corporation to do that.
Speaker 1: So what year was this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-two [1972]--
Speaker 1: That's early on.  So--
Speaker 2: --was about the year that we started that, '73' [1973].  I worked for two years before doing it, so '73' [1973], '74' [1974], that we established that summer, undergraduate research program.
Speaker 1: How long did it last?
Speaker 2: It lasted until the year, about 2004, when AT&T, well, when Lucent [Technologies] was finally merged with Alcatel.  That's how long that program last.  The other thing that was important, the reason for that summer program, it made a difference in my life about deciding to be a scientist, the summer I spent at Oakridge National Laboratory.  The other thing that I was able to do at Bell Laboratories, because they were interested in excellence in science and technology, and because they had seen examples.  An individual named Lincoln Hawkins, there prior to Jim Mitchell who had been excellent since 1942, because they had evidence that African Americans could participate in science and technology like anyone else, at the level that anyone did, they supported a PhD fellowship program.  The Cooperative Research Fellowship Program began in a preliminary phase in 1972.  I was able to act with a number of other colleagues and to convince the research area to support a full PhD training, including mentors, and summer research jobs if the graduate students needed them for more than 470 African Americans and females in those programs.  They earned degrees at the best institutions in this country.  The, most of the student were, pursued degrees at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], [University of California] Berkley, Stanford [University], the significant universities in the country.  They finished those schools with extraordinary records and led to a significant increase in the number of American Americans and women who were hired in the research area at Bell Laboratories.  Those two opportunities, I consider to be more important than anything I've ever done scientifically because it contributed to the lives of thousands and the opportunities for many hundreds to pursue the same career path to become a scientist and engineer that I decided to pursue.  And it provided them with tremendous opportunities to pursue those careers.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you say this is even more important than the research in the sense that--
Speaker 2: To see and allow hundreds, I saw hundreds of kids that came in the Bell Laboratories, more talented than I ever was, at the same point in my career, with the opportunity to be able to eclipse anything that I've ever done.  And I believe it is our responsibility to do something while we are here to make it easier for others who want to pursue the same path to do so.
Story_ID: 24809
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you left Lucent, it was then Lucent Technologies when you left--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right, in 2002, was it?
Speaker 2: Yes, I retired in 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay, retired in 2000, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, the company was downsizing, the research area and other areas, and they offered something called a "Golden Parachute" (laughter).  Upper-level managers were able to retire with the same health benefits and with significant salary for a period of time and access to the corporation's offices and so forth.  And so I retired in 2000, flunked retirement in 2002 and joined Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So you flunked retirement, and how does that--before we leave Bell, who were some of the people at Bell that you remember that were significant because you did some great things there.  But who were some of your colleagues that really stood out?
Speaker 2: There's a man named Walter L. Hawkins, had a PhD degree in polymer chemistry in 1942 and post-doctoral experience at McGill University [Montreal, Quebec, Canada].  He joined Bell Laboratories in 1942 and had been in the research area contributing all of those years when I showed up in 1970.  The fact that Lincoln Hawkins was as extraordinary as he was and had the record of accomplishments that he had, paved the way for me to be able to join Bell Laboratories many, many years later.  He was an extraordinary man.  I watched him.  I had the opportunity to talk to him about the challenges that he had, and I knew talking with him, there was no way that I would be anything other than successful at Bell Laboratories.  There were other individuals, not African Americans who also were extraordinary.  A fellow named Warren Falkner (ph.) was a director who supported my aspirations to have other programs in the company that benefited African Americans.  There were individuals, too numerous to name but a vice president of research named Arno Pensias, a Nobel Prize winner, who played a significant role in my upward mobility at Bell Laboratories.  There were other individuals who were Jewish who had upper-level management positions and understood my conversations about the fact that the company needed to do something to advance opportunities for African Americans.  It was such an extraordinary place with extraordinary people.
Story_ID: 24810
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, in 2002, you joined Howard University [Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wanted, I didn't really want a job.  I wanted a consulting contract.  I thought, as an outsider, I could evaluate the engineering college and the science organizations, chemistry, mathematics, physics.  I'd had an extraordinary span of responsibility at Bell Laboratories that goes across all of the engineering fields, computer science and so forth.  So I thought, as an outsider, I could come in and do an external review of the programs at Howard University and provide a perspective that wasn't available by people who had just been professors.  Well, it seemed like I was the only one that was interested in that at the time (laughter).  So that contract didn't appear.  So I volunteered in the latter part of 2002, just to be around here and to do some things.  I then wrote a research proposal and got a nano-technology research center funded by NSF [National Science Foundation], and then made the decision that I would spend the rest of my career working with undergraduates to give them the benefit of my experiences so that they would have the opportunity to make decisions to pursue science and technology careers and to also, if I could, import or transport a fraction of the Bell Laboratories environment to the College of Engineering at Howard University so that the best young faculty members who joined Howard University could see themselves executing their best science at Howard and would stay here for a lifetime, rather than using Howard as a training ground to gain tenure and to move on to some other place.  So those are the reasons why I flunked retirement.  And am now into my tenth year of a second career.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you started volunteering so when was your first employment at Howard, as such?
Speaker 2: Oh, the College of Engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The dean, James Johnson, had known me and for, oh, probably twenty years.  I had given lectures here.  I had recruited here, and so I sort of had an informal standing offer, that if I ever wanted to join academia, be sure to keep Howard on the list.  And so that's how I rekindled the ties with Howard, and a friend of mine, Dr. Clayton Bates, who's also a HistoryMaker, knew me and encouraged me to come here with him to help provide an environment to produce individuals that could eclipse us.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you entered, were you, did you come in as a full professor or--
Speaker 2: No, when I entered, I was an adjunct professor, had office space and so forth.  And I became a full tenured professor in January, 2003.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you've risen to dean now, so (laughter), I mean--
Speaker 2: Yes, two years ago, well, actually, it's three and a half years ago, a canvass occurred for a new dean.  And in the first canvass, I did not participate because I really hadn't decided--I was going to commit myself to working with undergraduates and graduate students in a one-on-one to see if I could regenerate myself many times over through the influence of kids that were smarter than I was at the same point in my career.  But then after the first canvass, they did not, were not, weren't satisfied with the applications and there was a second canvass.  And I decided to put my credentials as an application because if I won the job, I believed that there were some things that I could accomplish as dean of the College of Engineering that were even more important than working one-on-one with undergraduates and graduate students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I won that job, was appointed by the provost and the president and have had that job for two years.
Story_ID: 24811
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's 2009.  Now, so, just tell us about what you're doing as dean here and what your prospects are as well as for the college?
Speaker 2: As a dean, I believe the most important responsibility I have is to put in place the underpinnings and the structure of the College of Engineering such that in the next century we are able to implement, establish and grow entrepreneurships, intellectual property, technology parks and businesses.  Howard University is not going to be a greater university than it has been until we have done what the other universities do, establish technology parks, establish intellectual property and have a gigantic foundation with funding sufficient for us to accomplish anything on our own, if necessary.  And so I see my greatest goal is to lay the foundation for pursuing that long-term goal.  And so we have, are in the midst of restructuring the college to pursue that.  We are in the midst of working with the faculty to recruit entrepreneurial professors, individuals who see the business aspect of science as important as the knowledge aspect of science and who want to operate in both arenas.  And my job is to hopefully work with the upper-level management here and transform the environment from one of teaching excellence with science done in addition to it, but one of scientific and engineering excellence that even surpasses by far the teaching legacy of excellence that we have.  And so that's the unfinished job that exists.

Speaker 1: Okay, what's the greatest obstacle, I guess, to what you're trying to do here?
Speaker 2: The obstacles to advancement economically is that there has not been a legacy of establishing a business side of the academic enterprise here.  We have a fantastic business school, all right, that has excellent engagements with other corporations in America, but we do not have the on-campus presence of a business center.  The people whose responsibility it is for creating small businesses, for exploiting the intellectual property that exists, we're just now emerging into that arena, thinking about how do we establish a technology park and so forth.  So the obstacle in a sense is, there isn't a history of that, and so we are creating the foundation for this to become a historical component of Howard University.  The willingness to invest in a business arena is something that we also must learn to do because there isn't a foundation of that.  So our higher-level administration has got to become aware that investing in the business enterprise is in the future of--and they do recognize that that's in the future, of Howard University.  So putting all the infrastructure in place, the patent attorneys, hiring people who form businesses, hiring individuals who recognize where the opportunities are in the world, and getting us in the middle of those types of activities, other challenging that exists.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, one question we always ask is, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: There are a number.  The African American community that exists at the large scale in urbanized cities do not have the fullness of the encouragement and the fullness and the enrichment of the environment I grew up in.  My neighborhoods, my school systems, my parents were extraordinary in terms of their expectation of performance for you, in terms of their, the requirements for your responsibilities, in terms of parents, extended parents and relatives who provided support systems for you.  The entire, my entire environment encouraged me.  It wasn't an environment that distracted from and put negative things in your pathway.  I had all kinds of positive signals and opportunities for me and good people in my life, and in large places, we have lost a lot of that.  Parents and teachers and relationships that parents and teachers had at the time, that fostered aspirations and motivations among large numbers of students.  My parents didn't have to be educated for me to be motivated to be, to pursue education because the teachers did that and had that expectation for me.  I'm mindful that we've lost a lot of that in the large African American communities that exist today.  The sustainability of the African American culture and of African Americans in America is not yet assured.  We, those of us who understand what's necessary for a culture and a people to survive as a group and a people, independently, have not yet come together to foster the plans and to put in place the infrastructure, the connections, the networks, that we are sustainable as a people.  I'm concerned about that.  I'm concerned that not enough African--boys, African American males are seeing what's necessary or internalizing it and assimilating it at an early enough age that they become aspiring, contributing adults who are pursuing worthwhile lives, and who have the capability as fathers to perpetuate that in future generations.  Those are some of my concerns.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I believe that if I am successful in my goals, my legacy would be, he pursued a path that provided opportunities for a significant number of other individuals, especially African Americans, to pursue careers in science and technology if they were so inclined, that above all, I believe the responsibility to do something on the planet so that others will have greater opportunities than you, is something that you are put here to do.  And so I hope the legacy will cause that to be what people think of me.  And finally, in the next few years that I am associated with this job, I hope a hundred years from now, the people who will be examining the second century of Howard University's dispensing of engineering and science education will say, Jim Mitchell did something to lay the foundation for this fantastic business enterprise that Howard University now owns.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's work still to be done before that would be a part of the legacy.
Story_ID: 24815
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at what you've done to this point, again, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I believe the only thing I would do directly is perhaps in my late thirties, I might have made the decision to establish a company, a corporation or a business rather than to continue to pursue a career as a managerial scientist.  I think the impact could have spread over a larger number of individuals and a larger number of sectors, had I decided I wanted to pursue a business at an earlier point in my career.
Story_ID: 24816
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us something about your family.  You told us how you met your wife, and you told us about the birth of your first child, I believe.  How many children do you have and how are they doing?
Speaker 2: The only other blessing that's greater than the two great parents I had are the children that my wife and I have been able to bring into the world.  My wife, as I mentioned, earned a Masters degree in Foods and Nutrition.  She pursued that as a career in a corporation for many years.  She also balanced that between real estate and other jobs that gave her the opportunity to be there when the children needed her to be at home.  My first-born, Veronica Mitchell Antoine, is an M.D.  She operates a pain clinic in Hawaii with her husband whose a Colonel in the Army and also an M.D.  We have an extraordinary grandson from that pair.  My second son is an M.D., PhD.  He and his wife, Michelle, have two fantastic grandsons for me.  He is an extraordinary kid who works at Duke University in Cancer research and surpasses his dad by far in intellect and eventually accomplishments.  My third daughter is a lawyer, summa cum laude graduate from Georgetown [University] and is the brightest person in the family.  My wife and I have been extraordinarily blessed.  But we also like who we are and we reproduced the things that our parents used on us, that we believed helped to create who we became.  And we threw away the rules that our parents had that didn't make sense--and, man, I lived by a lot of 'em, but you don't reproduce those (laughter) for your children.  And then you have to formulate new rules for the times that your children are growing up in today because they are confronted with things that you were not, and you have to help them be prepared for those.
Story_ID: 24817
Speaker 1: All right, now, is there anything I have not asked you about--well, I didn't ask you this.  How did your parents [Eunice and Willie Lee Mitchell] react to your success?  Did they live long enough to see you get your PhD and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My parents were extremely proud of their family.  The glowed everyday as we successfully won awards and graduated from high school, college and the PhDs.  My parents both were alive for many years after my PhD, were able to read the magazine articles and so forth.  My dad would go into the barbershop and nobody ever had a greater time than my father, bragging about his son (laughter) to his colleagues in the barbershop.  So, so yes, they lived to witness, the grandchildren.  Yes, my mother attended the graduations of my children from college.  She lived long enough to do that and to bathe and bask in the success because our success was her success.  And my father didn't live to see all of my children, but he--the first two, he was able to witness.  So, so, yes, they were very proud of the accomplishments.  And we had celebrations for my mother in her eighties where the family came together and reminisced about what she had done to mold our lives.  And so that was something that I didn't mention about my mother's family.  They were an extraordinarily loving family, took care of each other, networked.  That was a legacy from my grandparents which has been passed down through my mother's family and through my family, a great legacy of a family that had extraordinary relationships and concern for each other.
Story_ID: 24818
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I think you've pretty covered everything.  Now, there's something that I usually talk about to young people, and that is about what they have control over in their lives and what they don't have control over in their lives.  And sometimes we have to be aware of the fact that you don't control everything in your life, and some of the most important things that happen to you are beyond your control.  You don't control the quality of your parents.  So you have to be the most excellent parent that you can be for your children.  You don't control the job markets when you're looking.  You don't control who the first boss is.  You don't necessarily control the opportunities to break through the glass ceiling.  You later learn that the performance must be there, but somebody who's above the ceiling must see you as someone who could successfully operate there, and they eventually control whether you get the opportunity to go through the glass ceiling.  So those kinds of things you don't control.  You do control your performance and your competitiveness and your character and what people think of you and the way that you project yourself.  All of those things you do have control over and you must exercise those at the point where others who have to create situations and opportunities for you are willing to do that, and the relationships you construct with your colleagues, your peers, with people who are subordinates and with superiors are as important as the quality of your performance in terms of your overall success.
Story_ID: 24819
Speaker 1: Okay, our last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered by my family as a father who did what was necessary to provide advantages and opportunities for his children and his grandchildren.  I'd like to be remembered by the individuals who reported to me as a man who was fair, who was able to make decisions that made sense and who treated individuals in a way that he would prefer to be treated if he were in the same position.  I'd like to be remembered by my colleagues, that is, my science colleagues and others as a person who was serious about science, committed to performance, but enjoyed life and every aspect of life that one should enjoy and be successful in, the family relationships, the adventures, the enjoyment, the leisure and so forth.  I'd like to be remembered as a well-rounded individual and science was something he decided to do, but a total human being was what he aspired to be..
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.  Thank you.
