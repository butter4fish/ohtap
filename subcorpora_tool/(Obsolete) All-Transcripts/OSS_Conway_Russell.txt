 Gill, and today is January 12, 2010. I   m visiting with  Russell Conway on the Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Russell, I appreciate you  taking the time to come visit with us today.  Thank you. I   m glad I could do it.  I want to talk to you about your OSU experiences, but I want to start  first with where you grew up, a little bit about your early life, your  family. Can you share some information with us?  Well, I have quite a bit to share. (Laughs) It might take too long.  Actually, my family, John and Alma Conway, had nine children. We  grew up on a small farm, and we had a high school   we went to Victory  Elementary and Junior High School, and then we changed to Lang High  School near Tipton, Oklahoma. We all worked hard. We knew what  hard work was, and we developed some of our long-range plans while  we were still at home. My dad was always encouraging us to get an  education. The thing that happened about that time was we had World  War II, and World War II was a war that really required all the soldiers  they could probably draft, and I was, along with three other brothers,  drafted into the Army Air Force. We had two in the Pacific and two in  Europe, European Theater of Operations. That   s where I was for about  two and a half years. Then we had a younger Conway coming along, and  he was too young for the wars, but he went through ROTC  Reserve  Officers    Training Corps  here and ended up being a First Lieutenant  and was stationed in the United States for that entire time.  Then, thank the Lord, we all came home without serious injuries.  Immediately I started thinking about working until this semester started  here at OSU. A brother and I started out with our parents    permission to  5  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  come to OSU and just to see if this is where we really wanted to attend.  We both came here, and my brother actually had pitched baseball lots in  high school, and then he pitched some for the Marines after the war was  over. So, he had an appointment set up with Toby Greene, who was the  baseball coach then. Toby Greene told him he didn   t have a scholarship,  but he would surely like to have him as a key player and he would  probably use him both in hitting and as a relief pitcher. So, Lloyd did  that for about three years, and he injured his arm pitching in cold  weather.  From that point in life, it all really became OSU. I started here in 1946,  and Beth, who is my wife and has been now for about sixty-two years  plus, she and I got acquainted here at OSU, and we married in 1947. We  have had a very good married life. We   ve had children that have come to  OSU, along with brothers and sisters who have also come to OSU, so  we   ve had a large number.  Russell, can I take you back to your early life? Your dad, I guess, raised  a lot of cotton, being down in southwest Oklahoma?  And wheat.  On a small quarter-section farm, I guess.  That   s what it was.  Can you tell me a little about your brothers and sisters and your family,  what life was like growing up and maybe some of the lessons and values  you learned growing up in your family?  Yes. We realized the value of hard work and that it was necessary hard  work. I had four sisters and four brothers, and I was right in the middle.  Around an old farm like that, we all had things to do. We had little  assigned jobs, milking the cows or doing this or that. Of course, when  the cotton needed chopping or picked, we were part of that. Then we  were a part of wheat growing and the combining and so forth. So, I think  we really grew up understanding the value of some of the qualities like  hard work and good character and a good reputation and so forth. I think  that was all a part of us. We were actually pretty lucky. We had good  health. Even during the Depression, we were fortunate that we had lived  on the farm because we had food, food grown on the farm, to the hogs  and beef cattle that my dad raised. I remember several funny things. I  remember my dad telling us that he didn   t have any concerns about the  food, but he did have concerns about placing new shoes on nine  children. (Laughter) We always thought that was funny. It was just a  good life, because we did get along with each other. Then, of course,  6  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  World War II changed everything for our family, and that   s when we  were away from each other for quite awhile. Nevertheless, since it   s all  over now and over then, we did have a lot of learning experiences in  that, but not a single one of us in this family wanted to stay and continue  the farm work after we returned from the service.  You talked about education was valued pretty highly in your family.  Yes, it was.  Many of your brothers and sisters went to college, afterwards. Could  you talk a little bit about that, and was your father on the rural school  board there, as well?  Yes. That was back when I was born, which I can tell you a little bit  about that. Part of the community wanted to consolidate the two little  one-room schools and have better buildings and so forth. This particular  day and night they had the voting, it was a tied vote, and my dad said,     You know, one way, one vote difference, and then one vote difference  the other way.    So, when, finally, the last time they all agreed on the  count, they agreed on the count to consolidate, and then they wanted to  know what to name the school after they consolidated it. I was born that  very night, so my dad said,    Well, why don   t we just name the school     Victory.       So, that   s what my middle name is. (Laughter)  Russell Victory Conway.  Spelled with a y. Russell Victory Conway. Well, things were, I   d just  say, very interesting, and we all had to work so hard, we didn   t have  time to do very much. We did all play ball. As my dad said, as long as  we were playing ball, we were staying out of trouble. So, he had us help  build a baseball diamond and a little temporary football field, as such.  We played a lot of ball on Sunday afternoons, and that was when the  community would gather around our house, and we   d divide up and  sometimes we would actually have eighteen players to play baseball.  Then dear little sweet Mother always thought about after the game was  over, and she would have us to help freeze (or we   d usually do this in  advance) three freezers of ice cream. We had plenty of milk. That was  always one of the things that we were remembered for in that  community, because everybody did play ball. We even learned how to  play tennis there. My sister actually taught tennis at Southwestern  Oklahoma State for awhile.  Russell, you graduated from high school in 1941, right? Obviously just  before the war started. You were wanting to enroll in Oklahoma State  University, but of course the draft board caught up with you. Can you  7  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  talk a little bit about that?  Actually the draft boards, they sent continuous notices to young men  that they were going to be drafted. My dad realized that,    Hey, if we  could get Russell enrolled at Oklahoma State University and get him in  ROTC, he could at least come out with an officer   s ranking.    So, that   s  when we talked about it and drove up here to Oklahoma State  University. My dad, growing up in that part of Arkansas, knew Dr.   Henry  Bennett real well. They were actually kind of close friends. My  dad and I went into Dr. Bennett   s office, which incidentally was in  Whitehurst Hall then, also. My dad asked the lady there, the assistant to  Dr. Bennett, if he could see Dr. Bennett. She said,    No, not without an  appointment.    My dad said,    Appointment? No, we haven   t made an  appointment, but let me just have a piece of paper.    (Laughs) So, he  wrote on this piece of paper,    Henry, John   s out here and surely would  like to say    hello    to you.    Dr. Bennett came out just immediately. We  talked, and ROTC said it was impossible to get me in since it was that  close to the draft. So, that was just a funny little experience in our lives.  Russell, now if I understand, your father and Dr. Bennett grew up in  Hope, Arkansas?  Somewhere, wherever that was, in that region, yes. Then they talked to  each other after I got back a time or two. (Laughs)  Russell, can you share how long it was before you were drafted and  maybe talk a little about your World War II experiences?  Actually, I use the word    drafted,    but I was told by the draft board about  when I would be drafted. So, I talked to my mother and dad, and I said,     Well, you know, I   d just as soon go ahead and volunteer and get into  the service now.    So, I remember that all of those in that Frederick,  Tillman County, community that were being drafted were sent to  Oklahoma City. So, very quickly I was in the service. My first  experience was meeting at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. We stayed there and got  our clothing and everything else that we needed. I don   t remember  whether the weapon was given to us there or not. I doubt it. Anyway, we  had, I think it was three days that we had there at Fort Sill, Oklahoma,  and we had to get ready to go to   they immediately assigned us to  California, and they asked us all kinds of questions and interviews of  what could we do and what had we done. I just couldn   t come up with  anything because my work had been on the farm. I remember so well  when they came to me and said,    Mr. Conway, what is your skill? What  have you done?    and so forth. I said,    Well, I   m a concrete finisher.     We   d never built a building.  8  We went to March Field, and they started doing basic training. I found  out later that the United States military was really desperate for air strips  in France and Germany and across that country. They immediately  formed this company that we were all told that we would be in, the  aviation engineers. I think it was the eighty-seventh or so day that we  had had our basic training, and they told us to get prepared to go  overseas and we couldn   t leave the base and all those kinds of  restrictions. Then we were on a troop train from California to   we left  from the East Coast on the Queen Elizabeth. That was quite an  experience. I think they had, good lands, 16,000 or 17,000 soldiers, and  we were all rookies. We went to Scotland, and they did give us an extra  day in Scotland. Then I recall so well that they   you know, the Germans  had control of the air at that time, so they told us that we were going to  England. We left Scotland at night, and it just kind of looked like some  of the cars were cattle cars, and they put seats in those, but I don   t know  whether you want me to tell just a funny thing or two that happened  along the way.  We were in this troop train and no lights except for fire coming out from  underneath. We stopped at this place, and the soldiers all jumped out of  the train. They were all so happy to do that, and soldiers will be soldiers.  We were just freezing to death. So, some of the guys went into the  offices, (this is hard to believe) and they took out those little coal stoves  and brought back two or three of them and put them on the trains. That  didn   t go over very well. (Laughs) They searched the trains, and then we  started leaving and there were two or three that hadn   t gotten back there  when the train started leaving. This was so funny. They just went on; our  troop train just took off. Somewhere, about an hour or two hours later,  an engine caught our train and brought the three or four guys that were  missing in action, and they got on that train.  We went to Chelmsford, England. I never will forget that. We arrived  there about seven o   clock in the morning, and just immediately the air  raid sirens started going off. That, to me, was very frightening because  I   d never heard anything like that before in my life. Then the officers  had us dog trotting with our heavy duffel bags and getting out of the  train station, because they said the Germans would be coming there. So,  we all got out and did get on trucks. They drove the trucks just out in  some apple orchards just to kind of hide them. Thank goodness, at that  particular time, the German planes did not come over our particular area.  But, anyway, that was at Chelmsford, England, and we stayed there, and  our clothes came on a different ship. We didn   t have any kind of dress  clothes as such for, I guess, two weeks before they actually came to us.  That was a great experience, and then (I just want to connect here) we  were told the next day that we were going to help build our own Nissen  9  Gill  Conway  huts. Then, they came around and asked, from that interview that they  had with us in California,    Private Conway, can you tell us what your  specialty is? What have you done as a job?    They said,    We see here  where you were a concrete finisher?    I said,    I think I did say something  like that.    But that was funny because everybody laughed. They put us  all to work, and we did build them all. We very quickly took some more  basic training, and then we had long hikes, and you could just tell that  they were really bonding that company and the different soldiers  together. We were assigned to help extend an air base in England so that  they could have more space for their big bombers to land and take off.  That was hard work for everybody.  What year was this?  This had to be in 1943, I believe. Anyway, many things happened there,  Jerry, like for every soldier. We had experiences of the German planes  draping our areas, but I don   t think we were ever blown up with bombs  or anything like that. We were not. That was just a part of being in that  war. I don   t know whether you want me to go into this or not, but  finally, when they were ready to invade France, that was really quite an  experience. We had to get ready, and we had to train. We had to put our  equipment on the ships, and then we had to take it off, and then we had  to waterproof the engines over and over until we got so we could do it in  the dark. Then, there   s one or two more experiences that I would like to  make a connection.  One is my older brother was already in Europe when I got over there,  and he was in the Air Force. I had been put in charge of the Regimental  PX  Post Exchange . We had got our supplies from the United States  Army supply dumps. I got a strange letter from my dad. He was always  figuring out how he could communicate. You know, everything was  analyzed. Anyway, my dad   s letter sounded funny, so I thought,    Here  he   s trying to tell me where Clyde is,    because they wouldn   t even allow  soldiers to know where somebody else was. So, when they said,    Okay,  Conway, you get your crew, and you   re going to take some of the  supplies back to the supply dump because we won   t be able to take them  overseas as they are and so forth, going from England to France,    I told  this driver, I said,    I have a brother here, and I don   t know where he is.  So, let   s just see if we can ask questions.    So, we asked questions at  several different Army places. Sure enough, I got two or three leads, and  we drove there and they let us in.  When we got there, we really had   all the food was in big cans, so it  was waterproof. We even asked questions of an officer, and he told me  right where my brother was. So, we went in and when we started to  leave, I told this driver,    These Air Force people don   t have enough  10  Gill  food. I think I can leave them just three or four cans.    I   m talking about  cans of this size. So, I did that, and some of them were the cans of  cookies. You   ve never seen a group so thrilled in your life, and that   s the  last I ever heard of that.  We crossed the Channel. I think the big invasion was June the sixth, and  it was several days after that before we actually left England. Things  happened in a hurry. I remember that we were delayed at Saint-L  ,  France, for several days because the Germans still had complete control  of the airways. One morning, it was just a beautiful morning, and we  kept hearing these planes, hearing these planes and hearing these planes,  and our infantry troops were also delayed. They were stopped. (Laughs)  But, to make the story short, here came over our big bombers. I mean,  they were dropping those bombs in different places. We were still  several miles from there, but you could see it just like you were right  close to it. That was an unusual day because we had some planes  knocked out of the air, shot out of the air. Then, at the same time, you  could tell when our fighter planes started cleaning up the places where  the Germans were concentrated. Three or four days in, maybe a week,  we were actually able to get away from there and go on into France. We  also (and this was before we got too far into France) were given an  opportunity to see the fortifications where the Germans had the big guns  and they could shoot out across the sea. That was really fascinating to  see all that. That   s where, really, the big battle during the invasion took  place.  Anyway, I   ll kind of summarize this. We built 108 airstrips across  France and across Germany. We were close to Munich, Germany, when  the war started really winding down. We, by this time, had gained  complete supremacy of the air. We encountered a few Germans who  were raring to give up at the end of the war. Our company had a few  prisoners to take. We normally didn   t have those prisoners, but that was  one time that they were, I think, ready to give up because they made it  pretty easy. We were told that we were going to go home. This was after  the war was over. Then they told us that they needed to keep troops there  for a while and that we would be in the occupation forces for a while. I  would say this: we ended up being in General Patton   s battlefield region,  which was a big one. You might appreciate this. The first week that we  were told that we were in his big division, we got this notice about all  the restrictions and all the rules that we were supposed to live by. That  was just before General Patton was killed in a truck wreck. He and the  driver were killed down close to the south side of the Rhine River. So, I  don   t know how much more you want me to go into that. I could just  keep on rattling here.  In    46 you came back to Oklahoma. Then did you enroll in the fall of  11  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  1946 at Oklahoma State University?  Sure did. And, you know, that   s when most of the soldiers had been  discharged, and we were crowding the universities pretty fast.  What influenced you to enroll at OSU?  Well, I think it was just because, in those days, I think agriculture  probably was something that was mentioned often. I really think that my  brother and I decided   he had an invitation to go to the University of  Arkansas and play baseball. He and I talked about it on our way to OSU  from our parents    house, and we both said,    Well, we   ll go there  knowing people at OSU.    Also, I would like to just say this: when I did  come back to OSU and enrolled and got started, we were given GI   Government Issue  benefits, a lot of help in paying for the tuition and  so forth, which I always appreciated that action on the part of our  government. We had some real good experiences when we first started  at OSU, and then my brother also got married. So, I   d just say that  everything worked out well, and I always appreciated that so much.  Later, Jerry, as you well know, after I had graduated we actually had the  opportunities to go into ROTC if we wanted to. So, I did go through, but  I was allowed to go through it in the upper two years. I ended up being  the Cadet Lieutenant Colonel. In those days, we had 5,000 troops. It was  a marvelous experience, and I just enjoyed it so much.  What was your major at Oklahoma State?  Well, actually, I started out, because I didn   t know anything else,  thinking that I was wanting to be a coach, but then I changed my mind  that first year. I really went into history and just general-type subjects.  Then I did my master   s in education administration.  So, your undergraduate degree was in history; you got a BA degree in  history?  Yes.  Did you go straight on to your master   s after you finished your  bachelor   s?  I did, but part time because I went to work in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as a  teacher. So, I started along with four or five others, and we drove from  Tulsa to Stillwater. That was a good experience, too. We were all  working on our advanced degrees.  What were your impressions of OSU right after the war, and of the  12  Conway  Gill  Conway  Stillwater community?  Well, that was interesting. I have thought so many times about that,  Jerry. When we came to OSU, they were using Quonset huts in many  places. The difference between then and now is not describable.  (Laughter) I mean, it   s just not describable. I even think of, sometimes,  just the lights around the campus. You know, in those days, everything  was dark. I mean, you were very sensitive to that when you   d go out at  night, especially if you had a date. I look back and I think about what all  has been done at OSU. You know, you and I enjoyed what the reputation  was across the state for OSU. Even in the schools where they didn   t  have many people coming to OSU, they still respected the overall  programs at OSU.  Were there some individuals you remember, some professors,  administrators that were important to you and influenced you in your  times as a student?  Well, I   m sorry to say I won   t be able to answer that fully. I was in a  good job with the Oklahoma Education Association after I had my  degree. I taught and was a principal for eight years, but I taught four  years. I had several of them. Right now, their names are not coming to  me, but I really came to my life being a student in graduate school.  That   s where I really realized, you know, it was hard when I first started.  I used to tease Beth all the time. She   d make the As, and I   d make the  Cs. (Laughter) My real first acquaintance was when I was with the  Oklahoma Education Association, and Dr. Kamm started asking me if I  would be interested in interviewing for a job here as Director of High  School and College Relations. I at first told him,    No,    that I just really  didn   t   I had a good future there and told him,    No.    So, he said,     Before you tell me    no,    I want you to come up and talk to us.    So, I  did that about three or four times, and that   s when the teachers and the  State of Oklahoma (this is not anything that I couldn   t tell, because it  was all in the open) started forming groups against the administrators,  which was very foolish, because we work together as a team when we  have administrators and teachers together. Dr. Kamm, he and I got  acquainted, and he wanted me to meet all the vice presidents and so  forth.  Jerry, the first thing that I realized, and it kind of embarrassed me, I  thought,    Well, here I   ve got three children and they   re all junior-high  and high-school age.    So, I told Beth,    Let   s just pack up today and go  up to Stillwater, and let   s look around for some houses. I haven   t said     yes    yet, but I think I   m about to.    So, we did that, and Dr. Kamm   I  answered directly to him for about two years before I went into Dr.  Poole   s administration. I always appreciated Dr. Kamm so much. As you  13  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  and I both know, he stayed with us even after he had retired. He was a  great man, a great leader, and his wife was the same.  Russell, let me back up if you don   t mind, because I want to tie some  other things together with your comments.  Please do.  First of all, so, you met Beth when you came back in the first year, the  fall of 1946. In what year did you get married?  We got married in August of    47.  Now, did you live out in Vet  Veterans  Village?  Yes, we sure did. (Laughter)  Do you want to describe that experience?  Well, at that time, Beth and I looked everywhere in Stillwater for just a  small apartment or anything we could find. We didn   t find anything, so  when we were told that the university was going to, I guess, start  building Vet Village   they had started it, then they had some meetings  with us and told us that they would try to have apartments that would be  livable. We painted ours on the inside when we did finally get in there.  Then my brother lived in Vet Village. I   ll tell you, that was a good  experience because we met so many good people. We had a real close  relationship with Berl Watts and his wife. They lived right across the  hall from us in that little old barracks apartment. He was the head of the  poultry department at LSU. We really became close friends, and he was  working on his doctorate. Beth and I tell this often, but he would come  and knock on the door. You had about that much square footage.    Beth,  do you still have the coffee pot on?    and he   d come in to visit for an  hour. (Laughter) I really appreciated several professors but more so after  I got into graduate school, as I said.  I hear it could be pretty cold in the winter and pretty drafty and pretty  hot in the summer.  Yes.  Like, if you left out a glass of water in the wintertime it was liable to be  frozen in the morning.  It would be.  14  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Have you got some stories you could tell about that?  Oh, not   you know, I didn   t consider that very high priority. We just  went along with the weather. (Laughter) We expected that. It was really  not a bad experience. We were just happy to have some place to live,  and the university did what they could to get things in order. Oh my  goodness, that Vet Village was always full because they had so many  soldiers returning. I really have looked back, Jerry, so many times, and I  say this openly, and I say it with all the appreciation that I have for OSU.  This was the best professional job I ever had, was right here at OSU, and  I loved it. We both worked together, and I   ve looked back many times in  retrospect and thought about how we met and how it all came together,  and you served as a very good assistant. I remember Dr. Poole asking if  he could borrow you so you could do your dissertation. They really  needed that. (Laughter) I said,    Oh, Dr. Poole, I don   t know whether I  can get along without Jerry or not.    I said,    He   s running the travel show  completely.    He said,    Well, we sure do need him.    It was your history  professor that was      Henry Faulk.   Yes. Man, he was 100 percent for you doing that. Actually, I just  consider that OSU has meant everything to me.  Russell, picking up on that, I want to fill in the gaps between when you  had your conversation with Dr. Kamm. Can you share a little bit of your  career after you left Oklahoma State? You went into teaching in the  Tulsa school system. That would have been in    50?  Yes, starting in    50.  Okay, then at that time, you were also for the next couple of years  driving back and forth finishing up your master   s.  We did.  Was that to get your administrator   s certification that you were going  back? Can you tell a little about your experience there in Tulsa, where  you were?  At that time, Tulsa had Dr. Charles C. Mason as superintendent, and he  was recognized as one of the better ones in the United States. Even  Congress talked to him about his good school system of about a hundred  and some odd schools had about 81,000 students at that time. After that  is when they had the integration and things changed. Broken Arrow and  Bixby and some of those places took quite a few of the students after  15  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  they had the redistricting. But, I would say I met some mighty fine  administrators.  What school were you in at that time?  Well, actually I started at Cherokee Junior High School, and then I went  to Lincoln Elementary School and then to Franklin Elementary School  as principal. I was assistant principal at Cherokee for one year, and that  was a good learning situation for public schools. It was on the outskirts  of Tulsa.  Did you do any classroom teaching also?  I did. I did for about four years, and I just really   I   m going to just say  two or three things. When I went into teaching, I   d finished my work  here, and I was assigned to this Cherokee Junior High School, and at that  time we had, oh my goodness, we had close to 1,800 students, I believe.  Way too many students, so crowded, oh my lands. It was in a  community that was still struggling economically. There was a new  principal who came in, and he laid the law down, and he said,    The first  thing we   ve got to do is gain control of this school   s system here.    So, it  wasn   t very long until he was asking me, because I had been in the  service and all, to give him a lot of help in trying to get this under  control. I learned an awful lot. Dr. Mason used me so much when they  had these different events and when they had criticisms and so forth. I  learned an awful lot because they sent me on several of those different  situations where they needed some help. Actually, it was hard for me to  leave Tulsa because I was getting along well with the administration,  and Dr. Mason and two or three others encouraged me to go back and  get a doctorate. He showed me how many principals he was going to  have retiring, and he needed new principals coming in. So, I appreciated  him.  Russell, how many years did you work in the Tulsa school system?  Twelve years. Four years as a teacher and eight years as a principal.  Did you ever serve directly on Dr. Mason   s staff?  Like I said, not directly on his staff but he used me a lot.  As a troubleshooter?  Yes. Good word.  So, then you left there in what year? It would have been about    62?  16  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  That   s right. Ferman Phillips came in my office   he was at that time the  executive secretary of the Oklahoma Education Association. I had  served on the OEA board for eight years, two-year terms. Then before  the principalship, I was elected to be president of the Tulsa Classroom  Teachers which was a marvelous experience. I think we had 1,300 or so  teachers. It was a good experience. I left there and went to Oklahoma  Education Association, never thinking I   d leave the Tulsa schools.  Russell, you had a unique career there. I   m just trying to summarize  what I think you said. You were a classroom teacher, and then you were  president of the Tulsa Classroom Teachers Association, then you did  administrative work as assistant principal and principal. You were then  working as sort of a troubleshooter within the district for Dr. Mason.  Then you served on the Oklahoma Education Association Board for four  two-year terms.  Right.  So, what a great experience there.  I tell you what, I   ve been so fortunate to have good experiences in my  profession. I   m very grateful to the leadership that saw there was hope  for me. (Laughs) I really did appreciate all of my experiences, and  actually, I had some good experiences with the Oklahoma Education  Association.  Can you talk a little bit about that? Dr. Ferman kind of recruited you to  come to the state?  Yes, he did. He said,    I need you so badly in the legislature that I want  you all to move to Oklahoma City.    We loved Tulsa. I   m not just saying  that, because we really did. Anyway, when I went with the Oklahoma  Education Association, there were about ten of us on the staff there, and  we had the responsibilities of going out to the school districts when  they   d have their county meetings. OEA was divided in the seventy-seven  counties. That   s where they had their broad leadership, which was  not too effective, but they later changed and that became effective.  Those were different experiences, and I very quickly learned about  legislation. I had some good teachers, because Ferman Phillips had been  in the legislature for, I believe, two terms.  We had to take care of everything. We took care of the teachers    need  for salaries. We had worked on the retirements. We were just kind of the  general staff that had many responsibilities and then going out and  making speeches when we were asked to. We made a lot of speeches. I  was in the legislature every day that that legislature was open for   I was  17  Gill  Conway  Gill  not there but three years and something. I think one of the big things that  we accomplished is that we decided we were going to have to make  some changes in the school laws and then the school financing. We had  a tremendous petition drive, and I think we had to collect something like  118,000 or 113,000 signatures, about five different petitions. We had to  first get those passed in the legislature. That all happened, and then the  disappointment was that all happened, and we thought it was going to  help in the general financing of our public school systems, but it didn   t  last too long. Our experiences there were very interesting, and we met a  lot of good people in Oklahoma City and Tulsa and other places. I   m  talking about not just teachers or administrators, but people who felt the  need to have a better education system. I appreciate my experiences  there, but I liked OSU better.  Russell, before you came to Oklahoma State, one of your last things was  that you helped the counselors form a department within OEA.  I sure did. Really what happened is   earlier, I mentioned the teachers  decided that they wanted to take care of everything without the  administrators, and they really wanted to form their own statewide  association, and they did that. We changed the system of our districts  from counties to actual districts, and we set up all new rules and  everything like that for the convention-type delegates and association.  Well, when that did pass   their legislation or their resolutions did pass,  and so the first thing they did was to set up their own little organization,  and they left the counselors out of the organization because they said the  counselors were too near being administrators. So, they left them out.  We met that night in Oklahoma City, in that old meeting ground before  all the new things they have now. Ferman Phillips said,    We   ve got to  keep the counselors in with the teachers. There   s nowhere they are going  to be connected as administrators in real life.    So, I made the speech for  the counselors, and I had some really good support, because I  communicated on the telephone quite a bit with the counselors in  different parts of the state. They all wanted to be in with the classroom  teachers. So, that night, actually, we had debates whether they should be  or should not be. Jerry, that   s the reason you and I got along with the  counselors so well. The word got around that I really battled for them  that night. I had gotten to the point that I knew in my mind that  counselors had to be in with the Classroom Teachers Association. It was  a good experience, and then after that, when I came to OSU, I mean, we  had opened doors to counselors    offices.  They stayed within OEA. Didn   t they have a department or an  organization under the umbrella of their own as well? That was what  you   d helped set up.  18  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Yes, right.  It was still part of OEA, but they had their own counselors    organization  under the umbrella of OEA.  Yes, they sure did, statewide. But as far as the big decisions like they  had to make, laying down the rules and getting the districts formed and  so forth, they were a part of the whole state Classroom Teachers  Association, but they did have their own counselors    statewide  association, and you remember that. They had a pretty good one.  So, then, what year did President Kamm contact you for a position at  Oklahoma State that you mentioned earlier? It was in sixty-     Actually, nineteen sixty-    Let   s see. I left the Tulsa public schools in  1962, and then that was in 1969.  Russell, in between that, you were in insurance sales? Am I missing  something in your   you were with OEA and then     No. Well, I was actually helping to run the show as far as our insurance  benefits. That was an experience, but that was still a part of OEA, and  then after I retired I did some retirement work in the legislature. I was  considered the chairman of the Insurance Benefits Committee, which  was a tough job.  You were approached, I think, by one company to go to work with them,  were you not?  Yes, after about three years I had been with OEA, the American Fidelity  Association offered me the Assistant Director of Education Benefits or  something. I don   t remember. It was a good experience, and I really got  acquainted with the business world. I   m glad you mentioned that, Jerry.  It kind of slipped my mind. That was a great experience, and like, Mr.  Cameron, C. W. Cameron, was more or less the owner of American  Fidelity, and his son C. V. Cameron was Executive President, which  later, he was actually killed in the plane crash in Colorado.  Did you ever actually work for the company?  Yes. Three years.  Did you go back to OEA, then, from there again? I   m trying to get the  sequence here. Tulsa, OEA and then     Actually what happened is that I had been with American Fidelity for  19  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  three years, and then I just kept thinking about education, education.  You know, I   d be sent out to Kalamazoo on a plane, and I   d just think,     My future life should be in education.    (Laughs) So, Ferman Phillips  says,    Well, if you would come back, you could be my associate  executive secretary.    So, in the meantime, had I stayed at   well, when I  finally got the retirement letter in to American Fidelity, Mr. Cameron, C.  W. Cameron, called me on the phone and said,    I want to take you to the  Beacon Club for lunch.    So, we go to the Beacon Club, and he says,     Why are you leaving us?    And I said,    Well, I just really have to be  honest.    I said,    I   ve learned so much with an insurance company, but I  really feel my future should be with education.    He said,    Well, I  understand, and I appreciate you telling me, but I   ll tell you what,  Russell. I had two positions open for you this very year. One would be a  large-district manager in California, and another one would have been in  Austin, Texas.    I said,    Well, there   s just one thing I   d like to say to  you. Thank you very much for considering me for those, but if things  change and I stay with your company, I   d rather go to Austin, Texas.     (Laughs) I   ll never forget him. He says,    That   s what I would expect  you to say.    (Laughter) But that was just a little sideline.  So, you were really the number two position in OEA, then.  Yes. See, it   s been reorganized so much now that they have several  associate executive secretaries, but at that time I was the associate  executive secretary.  I assume you were being groomed to actually move in when Ferman  Phillips stepped down, to probably be the Executive Director of OEA. Is  that right?  Yes, and that was within about two years. That   s the reason it was really  hard. I just really prayed and prayed about that decision, and finally I  thought to myself,    Ferman Phillips is within two years of retirement,  and this classroom teacher situation might still be in the background.     And then Dr. Kamm was calling me about that period of time. That was  in 1969. Then I got to thinking, Jerry. Here I have these children, college  age. I talked to several people here and they said,    Well, you need to be  in a university city,    and all that. So, I was satisfied there, and I had a  future that I thought would work out. They had the seventeen members  under their new organization, and I felt like that I had at least fourteen of  those who were strong supporters for me. But I didn   t even try to figure  it out. Once I started thinking seriously about OSU, I thought,    I   ve been  selfish. I need to just talk to Dr. Kamm from the standpoint of actually  going to work there.     It was called then the High School and College Relations position that  20  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  President Kamm was visiting with you about. What was attractive to you  about that position?  Well, to be real honest, I was puzzled as to what it really did mean. I had  that opportunity, as I said, to meet with Dr. Kamm and all of his vice  presidents, and we had quite a two-hour session. They started telling me  about how OU  University of Oklahoma  was so far ahead of us in  enrollment in all phases, the freshman enrollment and the enrollment in  their main body. They started telling me about what   they really felt  like, competitively, OSU needed to have this office, and Dr. Kamm said,     I   ll just tell you openly. I   d rather you know it now, but there is quite a  bit of opposition to us organizing this office because there   s not enough  money for the other parts.    Anyway, that got me to thinking about that,  and there were so many things that happened in that period of time.  Once I made that decision, I   ve never looked back. Never looked back.  What do you recall about the budget and the staffing for High School  and College Relations at that time? You said you were having to create  the office that first year you were there. What was your staffing like and  your budget?  There was a reporter that got a hold of me from The Daily Oklahoman,  and they wanted to make a comparison of our budget to OU   s budget,  and these words just came out. I said,    I really know that we are  operating on a shoestring budget, and I don   t have the knowledge of  knowing what OU is doing.    Anyway, it was a tough first year, but I had  several, several superintendents that said,    We need you in that office,  we need you in that office.    Superintendents, if you could get their  support, that was good.  We were talking about your first year when you came to Oklahoma State  as Director of High School and College Relations. What was your staff  like? Did you have anyone else helping you?  Well, I think I only had two full-time people and maybe two part-time  people the first year I was here.  So, you had an administrative assistant and then there was one other.  Was there another traveler in your office?  Yes. We changed people several times, but I had a very small staff.  And a small budget.  And a very small budget. (Laughter)  21  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Where was that first office located? Was that in Whitehurst?  Yes, I was right next to Dr. Boggs    office then.  First floor, west end, northwest corner.  West end. Well, when I first came to OSU, Dr. Kamm said,    I want you  to become acquainted with the whole university.    He said,    I am going  to invite you to come in every time I have a leadership meeting. I want  you to be here. You   re not going to have any votes. I just want you to sit  here, take notes and be able to talk about OSU from any level.     What was President Kamm like to work for?  Well, I   ve worked for some excellent leadership, and I   ve always been  grateful to the people that I served under, and that includes Dr. Poole. I  have complimentary things that I remember about him. Actually, Dr.  Kamm was a very level-headed person that knew how busy I was  because he gave me a lot of information, and he was so busy himself that  several times he   d call me on the telephone and say,    I just don   t have  any appointment time with you. Would you meet me on Saturday  morning, maybe seven-thirty or eight o   clock?    because he usually had  meetings on Saturday, too. (Laughs) He was very good about that. Then,  when we would go to any kind of a leadership meeting like I was  describing awhile ago, he was always very quick to introduce me and  tell about his feelings about having this office and so forth. He   d tell me  openly,    I have people here who are fighting this like everything. Not  you as an individual, but they don   t want us to create this office.     Russell, can I interject? Feel free to answer this if you want to, or not.  Part of that, too, was, in addition to the cost to have an office, was  should it be housed in admissions, or should it be a separate office?  Wasn   t that part of the philosophical disagreement, too?  I honestly will say     Is that a fair assessment?  That   s a very fair assessment. As long as I was at OSU, that was there.  Then, obviously, they finally just put the Office of High School and  College Relations under admissions. So, anyway, that   s something I  never could figure out. I thought we gave them the very best we could,  and yet we would have things like that.  Russell, kind of set the stage. I mean, there was a reason that President  Kamm was wanting to create a separate office. Things weren   t going  22  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  real well. We were getting clobbered by our competitor to the south, for  one thing. As I recall, there were some problems with our image around  the state with teachers and counselors. We even had the title Flunkout U  at one time. We had all the baby boomers coming through. Part of the  perception was,    You   re not doing a lot to help them. Once they get  here, you   re kicking them out the back door as fast as you get them in.     Maybe that   s an exaggeration, but can you try to set the stage? What  was that environment when you came in as head of this office?  Yes, and I would like to include you in this because you and I both know  that what you just said there about this became known as Oklahoma  State Flunkout University. I talked to those counselors, I talked to the  principals and I talked to even the superintendents about that. And I had  a lot of feedback. I had a lot of feedback. I told Dr. Kamm,    You just  don   t know how much I   m picking up out in the field because of this.     But, yes, that was a problem. So, they invited me then to sit on some  committees with the deans and with others, which I appreciated. I  always enjoyed learning as much as I could from the leadership. That  was more of an irritating situation than anything else, but it was  definitely there. Then, Dr. Kamm just kind of took over, and I don   t  remember that expression exactly that he used in his literature and  everything else that we were going to be more of a people university. He  was really concerned about that, about what you just described.  It was his people program emphasis.  That was it, yes.  So, you had two issues at hand that you and Dr. Kamm worked. One was  internal, trying to get the university more coordinated, to look at the  importance in priority of student recruitment and retention working  within the university. Then you had the challenge of going out around  the state and visiting with the superintendents, principals and counselors  and getting their feedback and talking about what were they looking for  in the way of relationships with the university, what were the concerns  and issues, what do we need to do. Isn   t that part of what you spent that  first year or two doing a lot of?  Yes. I was learning as much as I possibly could and picking up on things  like that. Then I realized,    Well, hey, this is pretty serious here.    Then  another one that we handled (and you helped to handle this one also) is  some of the community colleges said,    Well, we think we have students  who want to go to Oklahoma State University, and yet we don   t have  any cooperation to help get these students, being able to change their  majors or their subject matter and being able to accept OSU. Why are  you not accepting our credits?     23  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  The university really didn   t have any articulation agreements at that  time.  No. No, no, no. That was good. That was a really big issue in itself, but  we finally did make headway. Several of us met with our counterparts at  OU, and we discussed that over and over, about not accepting all the  credits. Then OU claimed they did, but Raymond Girod backed them off  on that because he knew their curriculum, oh my goodness. He knew  theirs and knew ours.  Those first two, three or four years that you and President Kamm had  talked about this, what were your immediate priorities and goals for  High School and College Relations?  I   m glad you asked me that, and I hope I can remember the exact words.  I went in myself   this was after that several months I   d been here, and I  kind of had the picture. I asked Dr. Kamm, I said,    You know, Dr.  Kamm, I would like to know what you really have in mind for us to  achieve in the High School and College Relations office.    He didn   t  even hesitate. He said,    Well, number one, their student body enrollment  is larger than ours. Quite a bit.    Then he said,    Number two is I   m  personally taking a lot of criticism because the OU freshman enrollment  is larger than OSU   s enrollment.    Then he said,    One of the major  objectives above these other two, even, is the fact that I want us to have  a good reputation, an honest reputation, a reputation that we are with a  great university. I don   t want you to exaggerate that we have something  and we don   t have it. I want you to actually be as level with the people  as you possibly can. We want to make sure that we have a reputation  across the state as being a great university.    And, so, that was part of  what he really emphasized. Then, of course, you know that we actually  achieved all three of those big objectives.  Russell, what you began is part of the reason why President Kamm  recruited you. He knew you had all the contacts and relationship with  the counselors, principals and school systems across the state, so part of  your duty was to go out and visit and, as you said earlier, to gather  information from them. What kind of feedback were you picking up out  in the field?  Well, the Flunkout University was one of the big ones. And then, some  of the counselors and administrators told me that they would send  students up here, and they were not given enough personal information  to know what to do after they got here. That one was a tough one for  OSU to swallow. I   m talking about some of the people who worked with  the new people, the new enrollees. I really think   and I say this just  from observations that I made there   I really think that most of the  24  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  counselors and most of the people really had great confidence in this  university, that we could straighten those problems out. Anyway, several  things like that. I attended two or three of the statewide meetings of  community college administrators. We had them here twice. We kind of  got the picture of what they were complaining about, and, thank the  Lord, that   s when the program to recognize the interchange of our  credits and things, articulation agreement.  Russell, after a couple of years of reporting directly to President Kamm,  then he rearranged his administration a little bit and brought in as one  of his new vice presidents, Richard W. Poole, who had been Dean of the  College of Business Administration, into that vice presidency position,  and then moved High School and College Relations under that  organizational structure. Can you talk about the policy and strategy of  coordinating student recruitment that was implemented under Dr.  Poole? How did the units work together and interact with other  university functions to support and enhance student recruitment?  Well, of course, one of the best supporters of the High School and  College Relations program was the Alumni Association. The Alumni  Association, with their big banquets and with the other things, to me that  was the best connection that we had. Then you invited us to go with you  on many occasions. There is not any doubt in my mind   you had big  crowds, and you had good people explaining this and that, and you were  very well organized, and so, to me, that was very positive. Very positive.  Of course, both offices were so busy that we didn   t get to do as much of  that as we would have liked to have, but we still did enough that we  started building this relationship of a better reputation.  Can you tell a little about the other units? Like there was Public  Information that helped create some of the publications that we created  and worked with. Was that one of those synergies?  Yes, and there are more, too. I   m sorry that I   m not thinking properly  right now. That definitely was true. Jerry, I really appreciated the  professional colleagues here at OSU. That included the deans and some  of the professors. We took some of our complaints that they had out  there directly to a professor. I did, several times. They also started  recognizing the need to make us look like we were a university that had  strength and a university that believed in each other and a university that  could do a good job with our students.  Taking some of the things, and to help you kind of jump in here in that  coordinated role you had, you had Public Information to help you with  the publications. You had the coordinated ACT letter-writing program  for all the deans and the departments to all coordinate their letters. That  25  Conway  Gill  Conway  used to be at a random. I want to say some might contradict another,  but, then, together you developed scholarship programs with the  Foundation, which was under that. There was the Alumni Association  you mentioned, where it tied in and brought people from High School  and College Relations out to the banquets. Are there some of those  things that stand out in your mind that you remember specifically that  were important that we were able to leverage on behalf of the university  about coordinating?  Well, I would definitely say yes to that question. I would also say that  we had to accept the fact that we were limited in our budgets and so  forth. Nevertheless, I saw several components within the university and  several components with your alumni people out in the areas that also  helped us in different situations. I felt like you could consider them as  one of the better components. Really and truly, as I have looked back  many times, I have really, personally, appreciated the support we had  and the people who really got involved with us now. We had people on  the staff levels who really gave us good support. You   d see all that also  coming together when we had, like, the first week or so that we always  schedule for different activities, different ways to bring the students into  more knowledge of the university and how they could receive help. I  saw lots of improvement over a period of a few years. I saw lots of  improvement with our community college people.  I just want to add this to these thoughts. When I retired, I immediately  thought,    Where can I continue doing work-related       So, I joined the  Retired Educators Association. We also had many opportunities to know  what had taken place before us. These were people who had gone  through OSU, and some of them were teachers, and some of them had  been at OSU as staff and faculty people. I want to make that connection  because I did everything I could do to promote the Retired Educators,  but also to connect them with OSU. Of course, when I got on some of  the state offices, I had to be a little bit more sensitive to what we were  doing as far as teachers in Cleveland County and at OU and so forth. But  as I look back, I am really appreciative of all the components that did  enter into helping us to get our enrollment up and helping us to make  many changes. I mean, not our office necessarily, but some of these  things that really started happening with OSU.  Do you remember the annual objectives that you developed each year?  I do. Well, I mean I don   t remember them such as I could quote them. I  do remember Dr. Poole really believed in those objectives. I learned so  much from him. I told him one time that I believed that after I   d been  with him three or four years that I could qualify for a higher level job.  (Laughter) He laughed and I laughed. I said,    Because I have learned so  26  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  much from you.    That was true. He was really a top-level administrator.  He approached things differently, but you learned from him.  As I recall, the objectives would have a specific, perishable objective,  and it would identify the resources, the timeline when it was going to be  done. They were pretty specific. You   d have these whole sets of different  things you were going to do. That would sort of help   the idea was to  utilize resources to the best extent possible, as I recall.  Yes, I remember him working with us with long-range objectives, five-year,  ten-year, whatever.  And the annual objectives, and then there was the five-year objectives  that you wrote each year, right?  That   s right.  Russell, how successful was OSU   s coordinated student recruitment  efforts that were kind of spearheaded by High School and College  Relations? Are there some major goals and milestones that you recall?  Like, remember when Bob Kamm heard about beating OU in  enrollment, for example?  Yes. Well, I   m sure that that did happen, Jerry, and I think he gave us  five years to do that. I knew we   d do better than that.  About    76, along in there somewhere, as I recall.  We actually   I think ahead of that     Can you talk a little bit about the philosophy and the approach to  student recruitment that was so effective at OSU during your tenure? I  think, probably, it was very successful in terms of results, in terms of  enrollment, in terms of utilization of resources. It was very successful in  a lot of different ways that you measure. Could I ask you about some  areas, and could you talk about our relationships with the school  counselors and the administrators and how important that was? We  alluded to that earlier. What were some things that you did that were  effective in working with the counselors?  Well, I mean, I think that our staff was very sensitive to meeting with  the counselors and the principals when we could and occasionally with  the superintendents. I just placed my position in with our total staff, and,  you know, we had some pretty good people working for us that worked  for us for practically nothing because they just wanted to have the  association with OSU. I really think that it was more that we started  27  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  working better inside Oklahoma State University   s faculty and staff and  alumni. People both on the staff and our office and so forth, I think we  were all coming to realize that we had a lot to offer at Oklahoma State  University. I really feel like Dr. Kamm   s leadership and Dr. Boggs and  Dr. Poole, I think that they also saw this, and they started having their  special committees and their special support. I just really always felt  good about that they all started looking long-range. Here   s what we   re  going to need to do, we   re going to need to do.  Russell, with the counselors and the principals at the smaller schools,  particularly, you took about the first three or four weeks of every fall to  go by and see every high school, to drop off packets, to have personal  business with the counselors. How effective was that?  Very effective. Very effective, and even the small schools that we felt  like where we didn   t get any of their students, we made sure that we sent  them   we called them, we wrote them letters.    We love you even  though you   re a small place, and we   ll send you whatever you need.  We   ll send you out the catalogs and the degree requirement publication  and things like that. If you need more of these whatever,    and we   d  explain to them we were limited on our budget.  But, as I recall, Russell, you   d go out and visit the counselor, and you   d  talk about what   s changed in the way of admissions requirements,  scholarships, programs, and you   d go over them in detail. So, what you  were doing was sort of helping them do a better job of counseling for  OSU by giving them good information?  I appreciate you bringing that up, because that was very important. That  was a very important positive when we did that, because a counselor is,  most of the time, a very busy person in a public school. I think that when  we did that, the counselors realized,    This makes it much easier for us to  know about this information.    We made it a point to try to point out the  changes, and we concentrated big time on that with the community  colleges.  Once a year, then, you had a principal/counselors conference here on  campus, is that right? Could you tell me about those?  Well, of course, I think that was one of the best ways we had of  communicating with the principals and the counselors where they could  see what we were attempting to do, and, also, I think there was a little  camaraderie there. I think that the counselors and the principals realized  that we were doing our very best to help inform them. We used the  words    disseminate information.    We didn   t use the words    recruiters.     We were here to disseminate information.  28  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Those issues and concerns in areas of importance to counselors, as I  recall, you   d have university administration speak to them. Raymond  Girod in admissions would come over. Somebody out of the Scholarships  and Financial Aid office would come over. It was part of it that you had  speakers lined up to give them a chance, to give them information about  OSU, but also hear directly from these people about what their concerns  were, what their issues were.  I would say, most of the time, that that was a very successful way of  having the two-way communications. All of them, I think, realized that  we had to have those group-type sessions because it was just more than  we could handle with a small staff. Of course, you know, all the time  Larry was here, he had so much more money than we had. Larry was a  very good director.  Russell, speaking of some of your philosophy and approach tips, part of  your approach was relationships with the counselors and principals,  visiting them, giving them correct and accurate information, helping  them be informed, bringing them on campus and hear from  administrators and letting the administrators hear from them. You  touched on market segmentation. Dr. Poole was very big on this. Can  you talk about the philosophy, how we decided to leverage our resources  and to allocate them, (you had limited resources) and how it best used  that market system?  Well, as I recall, we analyzed our staff with the help of the admissions  office and the registrar   s office, but we analyzed the high schools that  had been   we had them categorized, more or less, by if we had received  a bunch of students from     How many students? Like, average students over the last five years or  something?  Yes, I think we used that five year as a goal. I really look back, and I  think that marketing we tried, and with the help of Dr. Poole, we finally  got the marketing done, and with our different levels of different  numbers of enrollment coming from schools and the enrollments that  they would have and what our possibilities were. But, see, that allowed  our staff, then, to be doing some marketing, also, like if you were in a  small situation or if you were in a medium-sized situation. I think this  helped us even with the counselor/principal conferences, and that, to me,  was a part of our marketing plan.  Russell, you   d have, like, a high-market, good-market, average-market  and low-market school that you   d say would fit in one of those four  categories. Would you provide different services at each level?  29  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  I think we were more sensitive to what we said on the low level. We  knew that some of the places where we went, the students had never  heard of this or that, they   d never heard of credits.  Like at a high level, you   d go out for your fall visit; you   d have a one-on-  one visit. You   d go to their college-night or college-day program.  You   d come back in the spring. You might visit them three or four times  in a year. So, say, for a good market, you go out there maybe twice a  year. For an average market, maybe once, and a low market, only if they  ask you to come out would you go see them. I   m just trying to  understand, is that part of that segmentation?  Yes, it definitely was. Well, I think that all of us who knew anything  about the students within that school, it would be pretty easy to make  some observations. I think that we   by doing that, sometimes the  counselors then would specify,    Well, go over there and talk to this  young man right here or this young lady right here and help them out.  Help me out.    Then, of course, you and I were lucky when we got to  work more in the larger schools, because the counselors, just being  honest, had done a good job in most of the places. I felt the same way  with the community colleges. But I think when we started that marketing  system, that it helped us to realize that,    Hey, we have these limited  resources, and we   re going to have to do the best we can where we go,  and we   re going to have a limited time, so we   re going to have to  schedule properly.    That entered into it, you know. We would say,     Well, we can schedule you in this school and this school and this  school in one day, and that helps us out.    We had to do that because we  just didn   t have the staff to do it.  You had an actual schedule that   instead of everybody scheduling  themselves out there, we had one scheduler that would schedule all the  travelers out in the field and be sure that they put them together and  sync them together to see how many schools can they see while they   re  out there on the road.  Yes, that   s right. And I thought an awful lot about the schools in the  Dallas and Fort Worth system and so forth, and there was no way that  we could go in every time. June Keenan and her daughter helped us an  awful lot, but I thought that the marketing really helped us to do a better  job with our schedules and a better job with our budgets. We did finally  start getting a little bit more revenue for our budgets. I didn   t go to a  large number, but I did go to quite a few small schools, and I would  deliberately change the level of my presentation. I would do more  explaining what this meant and that meant and so forth, but I tried to do  it on such a low key that it wouldn   t be insulting. I don   t know whether  that worked or not, but I tried that, and I know you did.    Well, I   m here  30  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  at this little school, and I just want to make sure that the kids understand  what so forth.    I know that Dr. Poole encouraged that, and he was a  businessman.  What I hear you saying the philosophy was, that there was only X  dollars. It might increase incrementally each year, but really wasn   t  enough to cover everything as much as you wanted. So, how many  resources   and we keep saying    resources    so people would  understand maybe, by listening to this tape, Russell, you   d send a  representative out to a high school and they might spend the night,  maybe spend three days and two nights out. What schools were you  going to see? How many times are you going to see those schools? How  much gas were you going to burn? How many miles was motor pool  going to be out to do that? How many printed materials and resources  were you going to give? How many staff people could you get out there?  It was all about, you have limited resources and how could you leverage  those and put them to where you can get the best return on enrollment  back. Is that kind of what that coordinated marketing strategy and the  market categories were about?  I would say yes, and I would say that that component could   we can  delegate our staff, and we could schedule a lot better and more  effectively when we started doing that.  Russell, I   m going to give you a little bit of a compliment if you   ll let me.  A lot of people felt that the importance and the success of High School  and College Relations was about the service attitude and the strong  work ethic. For example, any time a school had a problem or wanted  someone to come out, we would come out, regardless. Kids would come  in with parents from out of state, and they could only be here on a  Saturday or Sunday, and you   d come down and give them a tour of the  campus and work with them. Can you speak to that a little bit?  Well, I felt like that, as director, when that took place (and it took place  pretty often) that I should do that, because I was in a position that I  could control my schedule. When I did that, I felt like I didn   t want to  impose. See, our staff had to work on Saturday mornings most of the  time. So, that was another component that entered into this relationship  business, and I think that the way that we   and sometimes you do that  on a Saturday morning. Sometimes we would go and help the football  coaches, and we   d go over and make little speeches to them and get the  students acquainted. I just felt like, in my own mind, that that was the  boss    responsibility to help out in these special cases.  This brings me to a thought. One time, I had this little project that came  through OSU at Oklahoma City. They wanted me to become acquainted  31  Gill  with one of the generals from the air base in Texas. He called me, and he  said,    Russell, there is no way.    He said,    I have a pilot that takes me  wherever I need to go,    and he said,    I have to do this on Sunday  morning or I won   t be able to come with my son.    So, I said,    I   ll be  glad to meet you anytime you say.    He was just so thrilled over that. I  mean, we went through residence halls, we went through classroom  buildings. Just remember, now, this is Sunday morning. I took him to  some residence hall, and I was shocked myself when we   I don   t even  know who set that room up for us to go in and visit with this person, but,  anyway, when we got in there, Jerry, I bet there were twelve or fifteen  beer bottles in there. (Laughter) I will never forget this. I was trying to  make apologies, and this general said,    Oh no, oh no. You don   t have to  apologize to me. You should see what we put up with all the time, so  please don   t take this offensively.    (Laughter) That general was so  inquisitive about everything, and his son stayed here two years before he  transferred to some place.  That general called me one morning, and he said,    Conway, I surely  would like for you to serve on a very special committee at  Lackland Air  Force Base in San Antonio .    He said,    I would like for you to fly down  there, and I want to use you on a special committee to help us evaluate  how we   re relating to our new people and what you might be able to  suggest to us that would help us to do better.    Well, I went down there,  and I was actually just in shock, in awe, that they had so many things set  up for about three of us. They showed us this and that. They gave us a  beautiful picture of everything that was going on. That was an all-day  visit, and then he had that plane to bring me back to Tinker, and then I  had my own car there. That was one of those situations where that  general contacted me at least three more times. I   m talking about on the  phone or in a letter. He said,    We   ve visited eight or ten different  colleges, and this is just an example of what a really good relationship  can do.    Anyway, I just told that because that was one of those really  exciting things. (Laughs)  I think what you   re saying, it seems like at that time, for many years,  High School and College Relations had that positive reputation that  they   d go the extra mile when someone was coming out here. I  remember, I think it wasn   t unusual for you to give tours on Sunday  afternoons. Occasionally when you couldn   t, I   d come down, but I think  that   s important. The other thing is, it seemed like you were really big on  integrity and accuracy in the information. I   ve heard you even saying on  more than a couple occasions to students and their parents,    We need to  talk about what   s best for you, not best for Oklahoma State University. If  we don   t have the program here that you need or the benefits here, then  you should go somewhere else.    I   m not sure that very many people in  admissions counseling had that integrity and approach to it. That  32  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  reputation began to get out there to people.  It really did. That was something that I really felt personally about. If we  wanted to bring students to Oklahoma State University, or if they came  on their own, then it would be our responsibility to make sure that we  gave them accurate information about the university and to make sure  that we convinced this young man or young woman,    We have people  here that will really treat you well.    That   s what Dr. Kamm and I talked  about. He was a strong believer in relationships.  I think that feedback from High School and College Relations in those  days and the perspective that people had about it and the reputation that  had dealt with relationships with counselors, market segmentation in  terms of utilizations of resources and refining and putting resources  where you got a return on the investment, there was a service attitude  and that strong work ethic that we talked about.  Thank you for using that    service attitude.     Knowledgeable about OSU, generally. That   s where all the staff would  go through about a couple weeks every fall, where you   d set up for  training for new student workers who   d come in, as well as our  continuing staff, to go out and bring people in. Went through it every  year. For something like eight straight years we went back to the same  training, but to be sure that we had accurate information, good  information each year.  Well, I appreciate you saying that. We did really concentrate on that  component.  How many years did you serve as Director of High School and College  Relations? You started in    69?  Yes,    69.  Then you came back and worked some more, and later retired as a  director.  That was actually in    85.  In your mind, how did High School and College Relations evolve and  change during your tenure here in all those years in terms of resources,  staffing, technology     Well, not much changed in that big word    technology,    but I think we  started without any knowledge of what you should do, except Raymond  33  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Girod, every now and then, he   d go out and help out, not with us. He  stopped that immediately. I think we saw some big changes in how we  approached this big area of recruitment and how we could spend our  time out visiting with more students. We did a lot of things to improve  internally what we were doing inside the office. I think everybody  improved with us. I think, more and more, even counselors that had the  OU backgrounds were nice to us, too. I said to someone,    I   m not  interested in asking you to challenge what I   m saying about the student  or anything else. What I   m interested in is working with you and the  student. If you tell us you don   t want to hear any more of that, then our  conversation can end. We want to help. We don   t ask questions about,     Well, where are you going?       Well, I   m going to OU.    That   s fine.     You know, I told them,    That   s fine. That   s your choice. That   s fine.     Well, a counselor appreciated that, from OU. We got along with them  pretty well. I had numerous ones say,    Well, you know, I   m really more  so going to OSU now than I   ve ever been.     But I think to answer that big question, we had some very good positives  going on to help us to do a better job, and I think our staffs were pretty  much interested in doing that. I look back at   we had to work in a  limited situation, but we always had many planned events when you  look back at our long list of things, and other staffs since our time have  improved that, I   m sure. Some of them haven   t, but some of them have. I  really think that to answer that question that you ask about what all took  place, we all know within our staff and within Dr. Poole and Dr. Kamm  and Dr. Boggs    realm of leadership and deans, (I must remember the  deans in this) we had good support from a lot of people, Jerry. Good  support from your leadership and good support from the leadership of  your alumni associations. I think that they all realize if we work together  as a whole out here and we really believe in OSU, whether a student  comes or not, that student just may help us with somebody else. You  know, we used to feel that way.  Russell, you worked tirelessly. I mean, sixty- and sometimes seventy-hour  weeks for many, many years.  Yes.  How were you able to put so much passion and caring into your work?  What kept you going all those years?  Well, and my goodness, I look at myself, and I know what the good  Lord says in the Bible. (Laughs) You know, if we think too highly of  ourselves, (not exactly His words) we can get whittled down in a hurry.  In the first place, I do like to associate with people. I do like to associate  with any level of people. I can talk to ones who are digging our ditches  34  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  or anybody else. It doesn   t bother me. Then, sometimes, I remember  going to some little school in the southeastern part of Oklahoma that I  thought,    I better dress down today a little. Watch the tie I   m going to  wear, the suit I   m going to wear,    but when I get there, here this  principal is in a sharp suit and tie, and I thought that was a good lesson  for me.  I would just say that I enjoyed the people, and I enjoyed trying to  distribute this information. But, first of all, I really felt like that  Oklahoma State University had a very reputable invitation. They really  tried to   you   d be humbled, so that   s the way I feel. I really can say  that, and I   ve told so many people in the retired world and so forth that I  really liked OSU, and that made it easier for me to really support this  university. I don   t mean this like it sounds, but I had two or three big  offers to leave here. Under no circumstances. I told one good person  who spent two or three hours with me that I really appreciated his  invitation, but I just have no reason to feel like I want to leave OSU. He  appreciated that. But I felt that way, and then I felt like this is an  opportunity for me personally to help people do this or that and help  them to be better.  Can you recall some special OSU memories during your lengthy tenure  at OSU? Are there some that stand out maybe more than others?  Well, there were so many, I really am not sure I could. I could if I had a  fresh mind and all that, but I would just say, to look at that question  quickly, we had several, several opportunities that made us all feel like  we had been successful, and I think that that was the group planning and  organizing and so forth. I   ll just say, personally, that I really appreciated  you, and I showed all my family the letter that you sent to me. That was  just one of my high points as far as administrators are concerned. That  you used the word   it just made me feel so good. I told you that Kevin   s  wife, Cheri, had that laminated and then framed. (Laughter) Then we  were having a family gathering for those that could come by. My oldest  son said,    Dad, do you mind if I read this in front of our family here?     (Laughs)    Well, don   t believe half of what you hear here.    We did, and I  really appreciated that, and I always appreciated the loyalty, and I never  had to worry about you under any circumstances. You knew what you  were going to do, and you knew that you wanted to help out. We worked  together and had a good relationship. I felt that way, strongly.  I appreciate it, and this interview is about you, now. (Laughter) Russell,  looking back on your long distinguished and productive career, how do  you hope people will remember Russell Conway?  Well, I would like to be remembered by some of the things that we have  35  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  Gill  Conway  said. I don   t mean to be boastful in anything that   s happened because I  always believed that others were helping and the good Lord was helping.  I would really just like to be remembered as a good person who was  willing to help others. That   s my philosophy of life. My families and  young people that we never knew, and we didn   t get to know personally,  and yet I have had probably fifty or sixty letters through my career that  made me feel real good. I   ve enjoyed life. I   ve enjoyed my family life,  and I   ve enjoyed my professional life. I   ve really enjoyed my  professional life, and people who complain about,    Well, I   ll never go  back there again,    I haven   t had that problem. I   ve accepted the fact that  things are not going to always be like I would like to have them, but that  hasn   t upset me about anything. Well, I mean there was one or two  things that didn   t go over well. (Laughs)  Is there anything else we haven   t covered? Anything we forgot about  that you   d like to mention?  Well, we   ve done a pretty good job of covering the waterfront, so to  speak. (Laughs) And I would just like to say to you, personally, I don   t  know why you interviewed me for this particular situation, but  somewhere in there, somewhere in the long range, I   m very happy that  this has been done. I can see maybe friends or relatives, somebody might  say,    Well, hey. This guy was a little better than I thought he was.     (Laughs)  Well, Russell,  what you did  certainly was a great blessing to this  university.  I look back at myself and laugh because I was reluctant, you know,  because I really thought Ferman Phillips was going to retire. He told me,     You   re my first one, now, when I retire.    I really just thank you.  Russell, thanks. I appreciate it very much. It was a great interview. I can  see people years from now coming back and listening and understanding  where OSU was, so thank you so much.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
