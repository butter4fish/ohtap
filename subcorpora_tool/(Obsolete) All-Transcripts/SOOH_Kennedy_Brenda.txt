 Little Thunder  Kennedy  This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is September 29, 2011, and I  am interviewing Brenda Kennedy for the Oklahoma Native Artists  Project, sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at  Oklahoma State University. Brenda, you are Citizen Potawatomi. You   re  perhaps best known for your paintings of powwow subjects, but you are  a versatile artist who   s been involved with Indian art for over thirty  years. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me.  Thank you, Julie.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in El Reno, Oklahoma, but I lived all my life  as a child  on a  farm west of Geary, Oklahoma. My mother was a schoolteacher, and my  father was a farmer and also a carpenter.  Did you have any experiences with art in primary or secondary school?  I was always interested in art, but I really didn   t consider becoming a  professional artist. I actually had planned to become a writer. I majored  in English, journalism, and Spanish when I was at Southwestern  Oklahoma State University. I just gradually found that art was taking  over my life. (Laughter) I didn   t have formal studies in college in art. I   d  had two elective courses, and I honestly can   t say that  they provided  much  background training in art at that time.  When you were a child, do you remember your dad drawing, or anybody  around the house? Did you like to draw?  Yes, I always drew things. I guess I taught myself to draw by copying  pictures out of the big dictionary we had. It had all those nice black and  5  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  white little cuts, and I would copy them. Then I started copying any kind  of art that appealed to me. I think that   s a really good way for somebody  to learn initially.  There is  a long tradition of artists copying the great  master works in the museums.  Do you remember when you saw your first piece of Indian art?  I didn   t have much exposure to Indian art until I was college age and  then after I got married, actually. My husband and his  father  were  always interested in Indian art. My folks rather discouraged my  promoting the Indian heritage, so I really didn   t concentrate on  it  until  that time, but I was always interested. Our farm at Geary was at one time  a campground for the Cheyenne-Arapaho tribes. When my folks were  both younger, right after they got married, they remember when the  Indians actually camped on that site where the farm is now. We still find  relics  with a metal detector  out there today. My husband found a little  pistol that dated 1932, a pistol that must have belonged to some of the  children back then.  You   re  Citizen  Potawatomi on your dad   s side, correct?  Right.  You didn   t really go to any doings when you were younger?  No, I didn   t. Not at all.  But is was only because I did not want to  disrespect my parents    wishes.   But your dad did take you and enroll you.  Yes, yes. I wanted to be enrolled. They weren   t going to  allow  that for  a long time, but they suddenly decided, well, maybe I had a right to be.  How old were you?  Now, you   re going to be counting up my age. (Laughter) I was married.   I got married at nineteen, after I graduated from college though.   Oh, you were already married. So he didn   t enroll you when you were  younger.  No.  In fact I instigated the enrollment myself. He only provided the  background information on my lineage.   This was something that you asked for when you were a young adult.  You grew up in a part of Oklahoma where there was a lot of racism  6  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  against Indians.  Absolutely.  I was just wondering what your memories of that     My memory is that I didn   t really see all that much overt racism because  I was sort of isolated, living out on the farm. I was, being an only child,  pretty much by myself in the summers. I remember every Wednesday  we would have a Merchants Trade Day at Geary. That   s when I saw  most of the Indians come into town, and I remember there were quite a  few of them, actually. I remember the women sitting on the street in  their very beautifully colored blankets. Yes, I was always fascinated  with Indian culture.  And your dad just really didn   t speak about it?  Not too much, not too much. At the time, as you say, there was rampant  racism, and he just felt it was better not to explore that part of his  heritage.  You met your husband at Southwestern. What was he studying?  He was  studying to be  a registered pharmacist. He graduated from  Southwestern.  So he was majoring in pharmacy. You were interested in writing. You  were a really good student, I guess, because you graduated at nineteen.  How did you manage that? (Laughs)  Maybe they were ready to get rid of me. (Laughter) Well, let   s see. I  skipped my senior year of high school. The last two courses that I lacked  from graduating, I took by correspondence from Southwestern. One of  the professors there agreed to be sort of an advisor to me. So I finished  up there, and then I guess I just took a large class load. I went every  summer, and I usually took, I think, about twenty-one hours.  You didn   t live on campus, then, or in town, or did you?  I did. I stayed over there. I had a room  in a dorm .  Tell me a little bit about your first jobs which were in publicity, I guess,  but none of them really involved any artwork at all.  No, it was just writing for the public relations office at Southwestern. I  7  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  worked on the school newspaper, as well. We put out an annual every  year in the  spring . More in the summer than any other time we wrote  feature articles about the different teachers around the state that were  attending the summer classes. I got a lot of good experience in that. It  was always exciting when one of the stories would be picked up by the  United Press or Associated Press at that time.  Were you also looking at art with Kenny? Were you guys starting to visit  any museums?  Oh, yes. We visited any museum we would possibly find, yes.  He knew of your talent for drawing and painting.  Yes. Yes, he was very encouraging.  At some point you moved to Muskogee.  Yes, that was his first job as a pharmacist.  Okay, and you joined the Muskogee Art Guild. Do you remember  approximately when that was?  That would   ve been in the    70s sometime.  Both Joan Hill and Joan Brown were in the Art Guild. I   m wondering if  any other Indian women painters were in the Guild at the time you  were?  I don   t believe so, not in the art guild, no. I know they had an Indian  women   s club there at Muskogee called the Dakota Club, and I know  they were in that.  Yes. Did you get involved with that at all?  I wasn   t involved with the Dakota Club.  They helped with the Five Tribes Museum.  Yes they did, absolutely.  What kinds of instruction did you get at the Art Guild?  We had nationally known teachers come in to give workshops. I think  that was a big opportunity to have something right there in our home  town,  so  we wouldn   t have to pay to go hundreds of miles and have the  8  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  expense of that. I think the Muskogee Art Guild was very valuable to  me.  What were some of the best workshops that you attended?  Well, one of my favorite people was an artist named Milford Zornes. He  was a nationally known watercolorist. He died within, I think, the last  two years. He was in his nineties when he died. I got well acquainted  with him because at the time I was president of the Muskogee Art Guild.  We also had a juried show. He judged that while he was there. It was  just interesting to hear of his many experiences because he has been so  well known.  What particular areas did that workshop help you with?  Well, I think always what I   ve gotten  the most  out of workshops,  is  to  watch demonstrations by other people, more than actually participate  in painting something of my own. I feel like I don   t ever accomplish  much on my own when I   m in a workshop. I just like to see what  somebody else is doing.  And how they approach it.   Zornes  was an excellent teacher.  Did you win any awards at the Art Guild competitions?  We had a juried show, and I won the grand award.  Wonderful  Do you remember what your painting was?  It was of rocks. It was a landscape, a close-up of a lot boulders and  rocks.  Very realistic, kind of?  Yes,  but it emphasized abstract design .  You went to your first Philbrook annual Indian art show in 1974?   I had attended several of the Annuals, but 1974 was the first time I  competed.   I think they had it up to 1979.  Was it? Well, I won the grand award at that competition the very last  9  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  year they had it. I   m confused, maybe, on my dates  but it  was the very  last show they had. I never understood why that ended because it was so  popular.  It was a wonderful show. Well, good, we   ll come back to that in a  minute. Let   s go to the first time you went to that show. Was it the first  Indian art show you   d been to?  It was the first one I participated in. Let   s see. I won a prize on a  painting and also on a drawing there, so that really spurred me on about  as much as anything because I was a bit reluctant to compete at an  Indian art show because I thought maybe I wasn   t really qualified.  Did you get to visit with any of the artists at that first show that you  entered?  Yes. I remember Ruthe Blalock Jones. She   s always been a favorite of  mine,  who  went on to become the head of the department at Bacone  College. Let me see. I   m trying to think of somebody that stands out.  Bert Seabourn was in the show. I didn   t really visit with him at the time,  but I had read about his work. I was happy to see them there.  What style were you using when you first entered? Were you trying that  flat style?  I was experimenting with a little bit of everything, as I always have. One  of those paintings was a painting with collage, totally abstract. I  remember the art critic of the Tulsa World, Maurice De Vinna, at the  time, showed a picture of that in the paper as one of the winning pieces.  He didn   t really say as much, but I think he was implying that  it  was a  bunch of hocus pocus at the time. (Laughter)  Oh my goodness  So you got a lot of PR on that. (Laughter)  But then the other painting was extremely realistic. It was totally the  opposite.  Yes, there were a lot of strictures at that time, unofficial strictures, about  what you could do and what you couldn   t do as an Indian artist, but  definitely the abstract Indian painters were breaking out with these  abstract styles. Did you start doing any particular research as you got  into Indian subject matter a little bit more? Were you exploring Plains  subjects or Potawatomi subjects?  I   d say it was more sort of a compilation of many different tribes. There  are so many intertribal powwows where it   s not a powwow by just one  10  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  tribe, but other tribes are invited. I started going to the powwows at our  Shawnee tribal powwow grounds. That   s where I took many, many  pictures. I also like to do photographs, so I got thousands of research  photos there that I am still using to this day. Thirty years later, I still  have material that I use, putting  it  together for different paintings.  So that was your first time you went with Kenny to a powwow, a  Potawatomi Nation powwow. Did you also go to a Colony powwow? It  was close to Southwestern.  I didn   t go to a Colony powwow until several years later. I had to learn  what all was available. It was quite a bit after that. We moved back to  Oklahoma City, and that   s when I was able to go to more things in this  region.  I see. Did your parents get to see some of your paintings with Indian  subject matter?  Yes. Yes, they did.  How     Well, they came around. (Laughs) I had a one-person show at the  Southern Plains Museum. My father was deceased at that time, but my  mother came. She went several times. I know she was pleased, anyway.  I guess you were always working with a combination of styles, but when  did you decide you were going to go in a more realistic direction?  I can   t place it at any one particular time because I   ve always  experimented with many different styles. Today, what I think is most  me, is a more impressionistic style, and I have decided to concentrate on  that more than anything else because it   s what appeals to me.  One of the ways you did your research which, again, involved taking  photographs was that you would do road trips. Can you talk a little bit  about those trips? Did you always pre-plan everything?  No, I didn   t always pre-plan everything. (Laughs) That doesn   t sound  like an artist too much, does it? Actually, I did pre-plan to see where I  could get the photographs that I thought would be most beneficial to me.  But we almost always went to Santa Fe for Indian Market. I did not  show at Indian Market, but I loved to be out there, see all the other  people and the art work. That was the highlight of my year, going to  Santa Fe.  11  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Did you and Kenny mainly just go to powwows? Was that the research,  or did you sometimes go to different parks or places?  We traveled all over Oklahoma. We liked any kind of history, actually,  and any kind of local color. I like to see as much of our home state as  possible. I feel like there   s still a lot missing, towns that I haven   t been  to. Anything that I can do to focus on Oklahoma history, well, I   m  happy.  Did you ever do any on-site sketching?  I did more photographs. I did some sketching, but it was very sparse,  just maybe notations about different coloring and lighting.  When did you start dealing with galleries, approximately?  Let   s see. My first gallery was with the Oklahoma Art Center. Imogene  Mugg was a woman who owned the gallery at that time. I enjoyed  working with her. I guess she had seen some of my work at different  places and asked me to join. I always thought that was a very fun,  enjoyable show.  They had lots of people who would turn out for that.  Yes, absolutely. That was my first place.  How many paintings, typically, would you put into that?  Oh, maybe five. Yes, every artist out there   and there were quite a few   had at least that many . It was a  big  show.  Then you also dealt with Indian Territory Gallery, I guess.  Yes. I was at the Trail of Tears competition at Tahlequah one year. I  hadn   t met Shirley Wells, the owner, before then. She came over and  said one of my collectors had asked her why didn   t she get some  paintings in by me. (Laughter) So she came and made my acquaintance.  I was very flattered. We worked with Shirley for as long as we possibly  could. I was so sorry to lose her.  She asked for an exclusive on you, actually.  For a while, yes. She did a good job. She about worked me to death,  though. (Laughter) I think that was the only problem. She could get  more things for me to do than what I could accomplish.  12  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Was it in terms of getting paintings that she was turning so fast?  I   m not really a fast painter. I pick around on it too long, more than  necessary. I am really not used to working rapidly, but I really admire  the people who can. She was very good about getting commissions for  all kinds of things. She even got me on the cover of several phonebooks  one year with one of my paintings.  Oh, neat  Oklahoma phonebooks?  Yes. She was a wonderful person and a wonderful gallery owner.  You did do a number of commissions. That was an important part of  your gallery work.  Yes, and commissions are the thing that I least like to do because,  as  I  say, I just go on and on and on. I probably should   ve quit months before,  but I   m constantly trying to improve it, and it never satisfies me. I am  not the best person to recommend for a commission, I wouldn   t imagine.  (Laughter)  Sometimes getting the business part of the art business is the most  difficult, and it   s a two-person deal, too. I don   t know if Kenny handled  a lot of that, or did you?  No, he didn   t really handle the business part except to be a great helper  to me. He encouraged me in everything.  When you were doing booth shows, you were selling originals. Was  there a time when you were ready to get into prints, and how did you  make that decision?  For myself, I   ve never been that interested in making prints. I have made  some, but I think it   s really difficult to store them. If you have a big  inventory of anything, where do you put  it ? That   s been one of my  problems. Still, I would prefer to just do  mainly  originals.  However,   you might not make near the money you would if you sold a lot of  multiples.  In the    80s, for example, booth shows weren   t as important to you?  No. In fact, the only booth show I do  now  is Red Earth, and I haven   t  done it for several years. I vowed that I would go back and do it this   past  year if it killed me. I didn   t really have the inventory that I would  like to have had, but I made myself go anyway because I like to support  what we have locally.  13  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Yes, and all the artists were glad to see you there, too. You have been  involved in that show since it opened, Red Earth?  I don   t think I was in it the first three years, but then I was in it for a  number of years. I   ve won a total of eight medals there. A lot of years I  just didn   t go  because  Ken was sick at that time.  What was your most important art award, do you think?  Well, I think some of the top awards that I have won at Red Earth and at  the Trail of Tears were important to me. I won the grand award at the  Fort Smith, Arkansas, art center six-state competition. That was a good  award for me.  Was this in the   80s?  Yes. I can   t remember the exact dates off-hand.  When you won your first grand award, how did that feel?  Well, that was really amazing,  but  I guess the most important award   to me  was the grand award at the last Philbrook American Indian Artist  competition. That was a powwow scene. It was mainly material from our  Potawatomi powwow with other things interjected. I believe that one  meant the most to me.  Wonderful. How do you think the Indian art scene changed between the     80s and the    90s?  I think a lot of the younger artists are more open to experimentation.  They   re doing a lot of subject matter that isn   t all totally Indian. They  feel free now that they can do whatever they want. Because they are an  Indian artist doesn   t mean everything they do has to be  an  Indian  painting. I like to see the different styles coming out, but I like the old  traditional, also.  When you were looking through your scrap, getting ready to pick a  dancer or a group of dancers or a couple of spectators to focus on, what  kinds of qualities do you look for that you think are going to make  interesting subjects?  I   m always interested in people   s personality traits, their gestures, how  they   re sitting. I think I   m interested more about Indians as individuals,  rather than  Indian stereotypes . I find that individual personality excites  me.  14  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Kate Osage, speaking of personalities, is one of your better known  portraits, and she   s kind of a legend around the Cheyenne-Arapaho  community. How did you come across her?  Like I said, I didn   t go to Colony powwows until more recent years, and  she happened to be  there not too long before she died . I took many  pictures of her. I wish I could just keep painting her. She was such an  interesting woman.  Did she get to see her portrait at all?  I think she died before she got to see it,  but not from me .  But she knew you were an artist.  Well, she didn   t talk a whole lot. (Laughter)  I was told she did not  speak English.  Yes, she knew I was an artist, but we didn   t  get to  have   a  great conversation. She was very happy to pose for me,  however .  Have you done much judging of art shows?  Yes, I   ve  judged  a lot of minor shows, and I had the honor of being  one of the judges at Red Earth a few years ago. That was fun. It   s always  interesting to see the varying opinions. I really can   t decide whether it   s  better to  have  an individual judge where  the winners  reflect one  personal view point, or whether it   s better to have several. Sometimes if  you have judging by committee, you finally sort of just give up and,     You take this one. I   ll  pick the next  one.     Do you remember how the Indian art landscape changed from the    90s  to the 2000s? Does anything stand out?  It   s just changing in that the older artist aren   t practicing as much. A lot  of them are in bad health. We lost a lot of artists during the last five  years. I think we just have to wait to see what this new crop  will  do.  In 1990 the Indian Arts and Crafts Act was passed, requiring people to  provide proof of citizenship or have a letter from the tribe. Do you  remember how that impacted different galleries and individuals?  I know some friends of mine could not prove they were actually  enrolled. That did change a lot of the artwork that some of them did.  They couldn   t enter those shows anymore. It didn   t really impact me   much . I   ve been enrolled since 1974. It didn   t make that much  difference in my artwork.  15  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  How long have you been collecting works by other artists? I mean, some  artists really do get the collecting bug, too, or trading bug.  I have been collecting ever since I could afford to buy anything, I think.  (Laughter)  In college?  Well, I couldn   t afford anything in college, so I didn   t have it then. I  think one of our first paintings was Fred Beaver     That you and Ken bought?     when we lived in Muskogee. Yes. I think it was thirty dollars, and so  that was a lot of money at the time when we were first starting out.  You   ve got some really beautiful paintings by a number of Indian artists  here.  Well, thank you.  If you and Ken were both interested in something, did anybody   s desires  trump the other, or did you usually agree?  I   d say we usually had about the same taste. His father collected some  Indian pieces, so he was just always attuned to it.  I   m thinking back to what you said about the fact that his  father  was  always interested in both Indian art and Indian culture.  It was more his father. His father just loved all kinds of Indian lore and  memorabilia.  So that was kind of another incentive or permission for you to start  exploring. I   d like to talk a bit about your artistic practices, like water  media are your preferred media?   For  my first attempt at painting, I got a set of oils in Muskogee, but  they just didn   t seem to suit my temperament. I   m slow, but  in  oils,  you have to observe a lot of rules  such as  painting thick over thin,  etcetera, etcetera. So, I thought I   d try acrylics, and they seemed to suit  me better. Lately, I have found some new acrylics that have been on the  market for just a few years now. You can spray water on them, re-dissolve  them and keep working wet on wet. There   s all kinds of  different mediums that help you get different effects, and I really see  16  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  hope for that, for me, anyway.  That sounds really interesting. Did you work with alkyds at all? Am I  remembering that right? And gouache?  Yes. In fact, before I discovered these new acrylics, for years I had been  working in alkyds because they  behave  a lot like acrylics. They usually  dry by the next day. They   re actually pretty dry within an hour, where  they   re just sort of sticky.  They  would be my next favorite medium  after these acrylics. It   s sort of a toss-up between those two, I guess.  Have you ever tried any three-dimensional work at all?  I   ve always had visions of grandeur of trying everything, but I   ve found  that I actually need to concentrate more on my painting because  I   could just start dabbling all the time. I tried a pottery class at the  Oklahoma City Art Center just to do something different, because a  friend of mine wanted me to go with him. I found that   I love the  pottery, but throwing on a wheel or even hand building just doesn   t work  for me as well as  painting and drawing .  When was this? Was this earlier in the   70s?  No, this was just in the last few years. I was trying something different.  It didn   t turn out to be what I was best at.  Some of my favorites, these are pieces that were done a while ago, but  they have that black background. It   s kind of a vein of traditional art,  almost. Doc Tate really developed that, the figures against the black  background. Of course, when you   re working more realistically or  impressionistically, the black is working differently. I wonder if you can  talk about what attracted you to the black.  I   ve always liked black backgrounds. They make the design of a  painting stand out so much more. They show off the colors  and  emphasize the abstract . It   s just a personal feeling. It   s just the drama.  A lot of your works during the    80s, a trademark would be, you   d have  this more realistically executed figure, and then you   d have kind of a  penciled-in outline of another different person next to them. Can you  talk about what interested you about that juxtaposition?  Well, like you say, juxtaposition. It emphasizes one figure over all the  rest. Maybe it gives a more emotional feel, I think, to have a pencil line  around  the main subject  and very muted features on the other figures.  17  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  How important is story to your work, having a story line going?  I think it varies with each different piece. I like to emphasize emotion  more than a particular story. I love some of the great illustrative painters  that, for example, show out at the  National  Cowboy  Museum . They  do fabulous work, but if I had to make a decision, I would pick the  feeling of the painting over the story line, although their art works on  both levels .  How did you come up with your signature? Sometimes that   s a bit of a  process.  I   ve always wanted to  use  my own name. I  want  to be Brenda  Kennedy. I decided I owed it to my husband to be Brenda Kennedy  Grummer after we got married, but he always encouraged me to use my  maiden name. So, in fact, in the last few years, I   ve been using Brenda  Kennedy. That   s probably what I will be using from now on. I   m not  doing anything disrespectful to him, because he was all for it.  What is your creative process, typically, from the time you come up with  an idea?  Sometimes I   ll be lying in bed at night, and I   ll think of something that  I   ve seen, something I want to portray. Then I   ll get up and sketch it out,  and find reference materials that would go along with  it . Sometimes  I   m guilty of not drawing everything out like we are supposed to be  doing and getting it all completely planned. Sometimes I change the  painting midstream, even. I work all over  the canvas . I have one we  were talking about earlier, a mother and child picture. I got that  done ,  and I didn   t like the mother. I   ve blocked her out now, and I   m starting  again with a different pose.  When you say you get up and sketch a piece, are you following through  at night when you see that image in your head, or is it the next morning?   Usually  it would be the next morning. I have to mull it over for a  while. Sometimes when you go to sleep your solutions are presented to  you.  I   m really an early morning person anyway.   When you look back on your career, what do you think was kind of a  fork-in-the-road moment for you?  I really think if there is such a thing as that one fork in the road, maybe it  was winning that grand award at the last American Indian artist show at  Philbrook. That short of cinched it for me that I was on the path,  anyway.  18  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Right, that you   d chosen the right kind of art to explore. What   s your  creative routine nowadays? I know you   re just, the last year or so,  getting back into shows, but when you can have that schedule, what do  you     I like to start out early in the morning. I   m really a morning person. I   ve  never been one  who best works  into the late hours of the night. I might  get up at three or four o   clock and start something  though . I feel like I  have more energy and more creativity in those hours,  but  sometimes  when  I   m  getting ready for a show,  I  just have to work all of it.  I know you   ve done a lot of figurative work, but I   m remembering seeing  paintings with horses. Have you explored any animal imagery at all?  Yes, I have done some wildlife. In fact, I   ll probably be doing more  because I grew up in the country, and I like landscape and  wildlife .   I   ve done more of  the Indian things because  I   ve been  caught up in  one type of show. There   s not enough hours in the day to do everything.  I   m very interested in doing more landscape.  Okay, yes. I know, with my husband, there   s always pressure from  others.    Put somebody in that landscape.    So have you got some spots  in mind for your landscapes?  Well, sometimes I  enjoy  landscapes that you don   t ordinarily see  painted, like in January-February. It   s a  more subtle  kind of a season.  You notice the drier  muted  fields. You can sometimes get a more  emotional feeling out of that than anything else. I like  the  barren   landscape  around Oklahoma. I still have the old family farm out at  Geary, and I  love  to go out there. Other than that, I love New Mexico. I  think all of us artists love Santa Fe  and  the Southwestern landscape.  When you go back to the farm, then, do you ever paint over there, or do  you just go for the day?  I usually just go for the day or the weekend. I haven   t been working out  at the farm very much lately. I actually don   t stay out there much  because of security reasons. Out there, I   m isolated and in this day and  time, you can   t be too cautious.  When you look back on your career, what   s been one of the highlights  for you?  Well, I still say that grand award at Philbrook was one of them. I   ve won  awards at different places in different states, but I still think that  19  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  probably changed me more than anything.  What   s been one of the more difficult times for you?  I guess I   ve had a number of family members die  in recent years . It  makes me very emotional. That   s always hard. You can   t get back very  quickly. It takes a while.  Have you had a chance to do any teaching of art?  I have taught some workshops,  but  again, I   m not somebody  who   wants to teach as much as I  probably  should.  I just prefer to paint.   Those talks are kind of scary.  Well, yes, they   re kind of scary,  but they also take a lot of time for  preparation when I would rather be painting .  Do you remember your first public talk?  I made some  talks  at Muskogee when I was with the Art Guild. I  taught a workshop there  and also at Northeastern State University . I  guess my first major talk other than that was at the Oklahoma Art  Center, at Imogene Mugg   s gallery. She asked me to give a presentation  one Sunday afternoon.  Is there anything that we   ve forgotten to talk about that you   d like to  cover?  I think we   ve pretty much covered it. I   m sure I   ll think of something  later on. This has been a lot of fun.  We are going to take a look at your paintings here. This is a photograph  that you would take for scrap, except it   s also just a beautiful piece of  artwork in its own right. Where was this taken?  This was also at our Potawatomi powwow many years ago. This man is  deceased now. When I take a photograph that stands on its own, I like to  just leave it as a photograph rather than try to  make  it  into  a painting.  Oh, you don   t even use it for that. That   s a really neat angle.  Thank you. I just call that The Man on the Front Row.  And that personality shows through. Here we   re looking at, like, an  earlier piece when you were more into your realistic style, a young  20  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  woman who was the daughter of one of the artists?  An artist who always comes to Red Earth named Tchin.  We can see the realism here. Now we   re going to take a look at this style  that you   re really enjoying right now.  This was a recent painting done in a style that I   m using more now  an   impressionistic style. It   s done with water solvable acrylic. Well, all  acrylic is water solvable, but this is the one  that  you can work on and  on and on with, sort of like an oil paint. This won an award at Red Earth  this year. I believe  it  is the type of thing that I will be concentrating on  in the future. It suits my temperament.  Two war dancers contesting. You can see just how much it does  resemble oil. It   s really just amazing when you get a close look at the  texture.  Yes, it looks a lot like a pastel, actually, from the style I work in.  Does it have a lot of under painting?  Yes. Many, many layers. I like a layered look. You can see what   s  underneath, and just build it up until you get a very interesting surface  texture.  This is one in process. Go ahead a tell us a little about it.  That   s right. This is a mother and child that I saw at Santa Fe Indian  Market one year. That   s probably ten, fifteen years ago. I had the mother  drawn out, but I just didn   t like the expression. There was something  that just didn   t work for me, so I   ve painted white over where she was,  and I am going to develop a different figure for that particular spot. This  is layered in acrylic. I put a coat of acrylic on, then I blot it with  something like a newspaper or whatever, to make a texture, then go over  it with another color and so on. I like a lot of layering.  That   s going to be beautiful when it   s done.  Thank you.  You have a couple of pieces at the Citizen Potawatomi Tribal Museum.  Yes, one of them  is  a large painting of a dollar bill with an Indian on it.  I call it Trade It To An Indian. I put it in a really gaudy, ornate frame,  bright psychedelic-type colors and little humorous sayings on it. They  21  Little Thunder  Kennedy  Little Thunder  Kennedy  had mentioned they wanted to put it in the club or the casino, so I   m not  sure where it   s hanging right now.  They also own a  powwow scene.  How does it feel? That   s been a long road, from getting enrolled to  having a piece in your tribal museum. How does that feel?  It   s always exciting. It   s a great honor when anybody wants to own a  piece of your work.  Thank you so much for your time today, Brenda. I really appreciate  talking to you.  Thank you, Julie  -------  -------
