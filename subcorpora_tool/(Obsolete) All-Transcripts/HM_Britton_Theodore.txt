Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Theodore Roosevelt Britton, Jr., T-H-E-O-D-O-E-R-E, R-O-O-S-E-V-E-L-T, B-R-I-T-T-O-N, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: It only struck me is, because it was--my father was born in South Carolina in North Augusta.  And Theodore Roosevelt was a Republican.  And so it just seemed a little bit odd in those days as I think back to it because the South was very much Democratic, if I recall at that time.  But he was popular.  This is the only president that ever received both the Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism in battle as well as the Noble Peace Prize for bringing peace to the world (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think also, I mean the black population in the South would have been Republican basically, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And very proud because a goodly number of blacks, the 9th and 10th Calvary, fought with Theodore Roosevelt in Cuba, and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --yeah, Havana, yeah.  So--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he gets--his name was very good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's where my father [Theodore Roosevelt Britton] was named, and I got his name.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: October 17, 1925 in Aiken County, North Augusta, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Aiken County.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --South Carolina, okay.
Speaker 2: Yep--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --by a midwife.  I was born in a house, a little house.
Speaker 1: Okay, sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Technically, I'm retired, but I've had a number of jobs.  I was, my major school, study was banking and finance.  And from there I went into social work, working with New York City Mission Society.  From there, it was into banking for which I'd been trained, and at Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association for about nine years.  And this was followed by going into the American Baptist Tone Mission Society, which is very much in the Western hemisphere here.  From the West--from that it was into housing and urban development, 1971.  And from there, 1974, and to diplomacy as Ambassador, and 1978, head of a life insurance company, United Mutual Life Insurance Company, 1981, back to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, handling diplomatic ties with other countries.  The United States is involved in a number of cultural-type engagements to cement friendship with other countries as opposed to strictly speaking, the State Department, which is concerned with diplomacy, but we had relationships with a number of countries, and I was the one in charge of those relationships.  For example, China, Soviet Union, Mexico, Canada, Japan, plus a number of multi-lateral organizations like the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris and the Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva.  But once I retired from HUD in 1989, of course, then it was into consulting, housing management.  I am currently the--since 2005, the Honorary Council General for the Republic of Albania which is in Eastern Europe, Southeastern Europe, I guess I should say.
Speaker 1: And you are also one of the Montfort Pointe Marines, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I went in early in January of 1944, came out after World War II in May of 1946, re-enlisted in 1948 and was discharged the last time in 1951.  I was one of the recipients of the Congressional Gold Medal recently.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, before we go into--oh, I'm sorry.  What is today's date?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Today's date, April the 9th, 19--2013.
Speaker 1: And, sir, where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at my residence, 310 Somer Lane Place in Avondale Estates, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33910
Speaker 1: Now, and before we got into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask as kind of a warm up, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I would say.  It's probably chili.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Color?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I wish I could say there was one, but at my age, I'll take any time of the year (laughter).  But I think the spring and the fall are always very special to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Not necessarily a favorite.  I've done over a hundred and something--160 countries or so.  So I'm generally concerned with where I can learn something.  If it teaches me something, then that's a place I wanna be.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite phrase or saying.  The one that remains with me is one I learned when I was working in camping for a lady in New York State who had grown up with Mary McLeod Bethune.  Her favorite phrase was "Equal opportunity means equal responsibility".  And I tell that to a lot of youngsters 'cause the opportunities will come, but make sure that you're responsible and ready to--both to be prepared for them as well as to be able to recognize them and take advantage of them.
Story_ID: 33911
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Bessie Bell Britton, B-E-S-S-I-E, B-E-L-L.  Her maiden name was Cook.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cook, C-O-O-K.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is her date of birth and--
Speaker 2: Her date of birth, gosh, I'm uncertain of that.  I know it was in April, but it's probably 1904.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was your mother born?
Speaker 2: Aiken County, North Carolina--South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what are the stories from that side?
Speaker 2: Okay, as both--it's both ways.  My father--my grandfather, my maternal grandfather, his name was John Cook.  And his, his father, as I understand, was full-blooded Indian.  His mother was African American.  He was born in the 1800s.  I remember being present at his death, as he breathed his last breath.  And this must have been about 1930, about 1934 or so.  I was in about, about eight years old or something.
Speaker 1: Now, do you know what Indian group he was from?
Speaker 2: This would have been basically Chero--a branch of the Cherokee group.  I think I've heard one of my aunts refer to it as the Keystone Indians.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, on my grandmother's side, her last name was Rivers.  That was her family, but her father was reputed to be one of the members of the Hammond family, H-A-M-M-O-N-D.  He was white, of course.  And my grandmother was blonde and blue eyed and very, of course.
Speaker 1: Hammond, huh?
Speaker 2: Yes, we grew up early in what's, in a church called Hammond Grove.  The Hammond family had given over land to the freed Negroes to set up their own church.  This came after Emancipation, and my grandmother must have been--let's see, in 1971, which was about the time she was still alive, she was born in the 1800s, but I'm not certain of which year.
Speaker 1: Okay, there's a character in history named, I don't know.  I can't think of what he--
Speaker 2: Cain Rivers, Cain Rivers was one of the political figures during the Emancipation period.  He was a judge.
Speaker 1: Cain Rivers?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, this is an African American or a white--
Speaker 2: African American, yes.
Speaker 1: Cain Rivers.
Speaker 2: C-A-I-N.
Story_ID: 33912
Speaker 1: And there's a Jupiter Hammond.  I think he's from though the 1700s, I think, but I'm--I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, there was a large number of Hammond's.  As a matter of fact, on Route 130 which is the first entrance into South Carolina going East, one comes up on what's called the Martintown, the Martintown Road.  It's Route 130, and as one goes approximately a mile, one comes to the Hammond Revolutionary War cemetery, and members of the Hammond family are buried there.  Plus,--
Speaker 1: Yes, he would have been, as I recall, he was a Revolutionary War figure--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Jupiter Hammond, have you ever heard of him?
Speaker 2: No, in fact, I'm gonna remember it from now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But throughout that area you'll find a large number of Hammond's.  And one of my good friends here in Atlanta is a girl by the name of Edith Hammond whose family is out of Columbia [South Carolina].  She's related to Charles Bolden too because that's--he's part of the Hammond family up there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But they were very large land holders in this area [South Carolina].  I always trace much of the derivation of the Britton name coming out of Georgetown [South Carolina].  When you go to Georgetown, there's a large number of Britton's, spelled in different ways.
Speaker 1: And Aiken is near Augusta, right?
Speaker 2: Somewhat East of Augusta--well, it's on the, it's in Carolina, North--South Carolina.  It would be sort of North, Northeast of Augusta.  Augusta is on the South side of the Savannah River.  North Augusta is on the North side.  North Augusta was a little hamlet, very small place, until the decision to do the hydrogen bomb plant in Bonnville (ph.), South Carolina.  At that point, then it was, it really began to grow in terms of population.  By the way, they honored me recently with a resolution down there, and they're talking now about putting up a plaque that I was born there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, in Aiken County.
Speaker 2: In North Augusta.
Speaker 1: North Augusta, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, but the head of the Aiken County Museum will be coming this way, I think next week to do an interview.
Speaker 1: Okay, were you born in Aiken County or North Augusta?  Which--
Speaker 2: Well, North Augusta is a city in Aiken County.
Speaker 1: In Aiken County, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was born there.
Speaker 1: Okay, I got you.  So North Augusta is South Carolina.
Speaker 2: North Augusta is in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Augusta is in Georgia, and South Augusta is also in Georgia.  The Savannah River connects them.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, now, what are the stories from your mother's side?  Are--any stories about some of the people that you mentioned?
Speaker 2: I guess, I don't know a great deal of stories about her except that she had a real large family.
Speaker 1: I mean, well, what did they do for a living?  And did they go to school or did, you know, what did they do?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a story in itself.  The, they had a farm, of course, very large farm, which I think was eventually taken over to build I-20, Interstate 20.  It comes through that farm area.  She and my grandfather, of course, did a lot of farming.  They had a goodly number of fruit trees on the place and what have you.  They didn't have any animals other than a horse to the best of my knowledge.
Speaker 1: They just owned one horse?
Speaker 2: One horse, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember that, going to town on Sunday morning.  That was--on Saturday morning, that was Augusta, Georgia.  I remember that I used to see horses and wagons lined up for what seems like, almost seemed like miles in terms of my young age (laughter) at the time.  But that's what they did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they had fruit trees and then had a farm?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Story_ID: 33913
Speaker 1: And, now, you said the educational quest was a story in itself.  So what happened?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have to touch a little bit that, during the, during that period, up to that period, a man named Julius Rosenwald out of Chicago, your hometown, was head of, had been head of Sears and Roebucks, embarked on a plan of his own to build as many schools as he could in the South for both black and white.  Basically, they were largely one-room schoolhouses.  He did about 5,000 of them, I'm told.  I attended one in North Augusta.  It's still standing, by the way.  It's a four, four-row schoolhouse, first to fourth grade.  When we, when you came out of the fourth, out of the fourth grade, you had to scuffle to find a place that had upper levels, high school.  As it was, there was one within several miles of us.  My sister and I used to walk to that one.  However, I go back to my grandparents, and my parents.  Quite often in the South, you hear stories of some of the older people who said that they went to the fifth grade.  More often than not, they went to a Rosenwald school.  And once they finished that fourth row, that was it.  I was in Plains, Georgia about a week ago and attended, went to the place where Jimmy Carter [President Jimmy Carter] went to school, President Carter.  And it fascinated me to suddenly notice for the first time that the desks in the first row were much smaller than those in the fourth row, obviously, because the ones in the fourth row was probably--were probably around ten years old.  And those in the first row were probably around five and six years old.  But it never dawned on me before that it had something to do with the size of the desk as well.  In addition, the teacher whom I had in my class--teaching me, was a lady named Lena Key, K-E-Y.  I doubt that Mrs. Key was, had more than a grade school education, but as it happens, there was a lady out of Philadelphia, a Quaker, whose brothers died leaving their money to her.  And she set up a fund to train black women teachers.  In fact, she set up a foundation, and this was probably the only one in the country in which a black person was on that board, along with whites.  His name was Booker T. Washington.  But she paid the salaries or subsidized the salaries of many of the women teachers in the South, were African American women teachers.
Speaker 1: Was that the Gene's?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, the Gene's.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Gene's Fund, right.
Speaker 2: I see you--it was--
Speaker 1: The Gene's supervisors, they would have trained teachers come to poor areas, I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and--
Speaker 1: --I mean rural areas and train the teachers.
Speaker 2: And there's always a stipulation that it was basically women because men would then be in charge, but they would also impinge on the white community.  So it was only women who were the teachers as far as I know, the Gene's teachers.  But I went to that school for four years, and once, of course, once I finished that, then I went to another school.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, I didn't wanna get you in school yet.  I just wanted to--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: We wanna try to--now, what, did your mother have a chance to go to school and finish?
Speaker 2: Yes, she went to about fourth grade.  My father was about third grade.
Speaker 1: So that was her fourth grade, as far as she could go?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that little background gives a little explanation of why most, many of the people of that age group more often than not said they went to the fifth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did your mother have any special talents or anything that she was able to use in earning a living?
Speaker 2: Basically, it was--when she was--it was a later thing.  When we went to New York, of course, she ultimately end up in the book bindery business, and seemed to thrive in that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33914
Speaker 1: All right, well, let me go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name--it's the same as yours, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Theodore Roosevelt Britton.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, senior, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was October 7th, I think 1901.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1901.  Now, was he born in the same place?
Speaker 2: Same place, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was, I believe he might have been born in Edgefield County [South Carolina], Edgefield, E-D-G-E-F-I-E-L-D.  The, they come very close, you know, at the upper edge of Aiken County [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's because I remember the church relationship always distinguished between Aiken and Edgefield.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So what can you tell us about your father's side?  How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather was born in 1884, my maternal grandfather.  My maternal grandmother--paternal, I'm saying, paternal grandmother was born in 1879.  I checked that up one day from the census tracts.  And they grew up in the area of, that area called Edgefield [South Carolina].  Edgefield is both a town and the name of the county.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I think it's a--
Speaker 2: It produced the very famous Senator, Senator Strom Thurmond.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I could tell you a little bit more about my father's situation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Until he migrated to New York in 1935, his work had largely been in farming.  Okay, my father, I only realized much later had been the beneficiary of some largest in the sense that when other men had rather regular horses, my father, for some reason, had an Arab Stallion.  Okay, when other men were using their wagons, my father was driving a new Ford.  This came to a head many years later when I was talking with one of my uncles who grew up with my father, and he explained that during the winter my father's horse was put in the barn, and was fed oats, whereas his had to remain out in the pasture.  And I was concerned just, this maltreatment of his horse as opposed to my father's horse.  And he then eventually began to say that, Old Man Town, whose name was George Town, who was white, would put my father's horse in his barn and feed him these things.  It took some probing, but he finally admitted that everybody knew that Mr. Town was my father's grandfather, okay.  Then over the years, something came back to me.  Suddenly, all of that was cut off, and I think it had something to do with my father suddenly rebelling against this special treatment.  I don't know whether it had something to do with the fact that it became known that this man was his grandfather.  And at that time, why racial things being what they were, one didn't go around boasting that someone who was white was his grandfather or something like that.  But suffice to say that he no longer got all of that special benefit, and (laughter) I always think about it because I have seen so many stories in the South where white grandparents were quite fond of their African American siblings, or sub siblings and so forth and took care of them in many different ways.  Well, my father was much loved by all the population.  And so he, apparently, he took exception or something like that.  But he grew up doing farming before going to the, going to New York in about 1935.  His father had already immigrated--migrated to Philadelphia, and his younger brother migrated to New York.  At that time, they were building the New York City subway, the Independent line, so my father ultimately went to join his brother.  And in 1936, sent for us.
Speaker 1: Now, did your father work on the subway line?
Speaker 2: Briefly, yes.  That's a story in itself.  But he was in farming down along Beach Island in South Carolina, before going up to New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33915
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: If it--I don't, I don't know the story.  But, you know, church was central, and I mentioned Hammond Grove Baptist Church.  I'm told that because some people found it difficult to get down to Hammond Grove at times, they had another church, and some of the, some of the members of Hammond Grove broke off from Hammond Grove to found another church which they called Bethlehem Baptist Church.  That's in, it's on the South edge of Edgefield County.  And that's where my father grew up.  But I have to assume that because the church has always had a relationship--sometimes they had the same pastors, the same pastor, rather.  This would have meant that they, probably they came together in that way.
Speaker 1: Now, are they Baptist churches?
Speaker 2: These are both Baptist, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But because of the children, the ladies were pretty known as good-looking.  It would not have been difficult (laughter) to, for the word to get out among the fellows.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So your parents more than likely met in church, you think?
Speaker 2: I would suspect so, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, now, so did they get married--well, about when did they get married?
Speaker 2: It must have been about 1923.  My first sister came along in 1924.  That's--her name is Virginia.  And I came along in 1925, and my younger sister in 1927, all in North Augusta {South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you think about your parents personalities and their dispositions and sense of humor, their hobbies, how they walk, talk, what they look like, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I would have to say my father.  Of course, he was lighter in complexion.  My mother was more towards--she would have looked more Indian like.  And my father seemed to have what I frequently describe as sort of a non-threatening personality.  I remember when he died, some of my relatives saying, well, that was the end of the line for them because they had nothing to live for.  He was gone.  Well, many of our relatives are already gone.  I'm still around, but I find these days that my own personality seems to fit into that.  I have some friends who are very, very protective of me.  And some would threaten violence to anybody who ever insults me or harms me in any way.  I guess in that sense I may be blessed to follow him a little bit, and in any case, wherever I worked, I have been basically accepted and treated, maybe more than I--much better than I deserved.
Story_ID: 33916
Speaker 1: All right, now, okay, so, now, you've got like a sister and two brothers, right?  An older sister and two younger--
Speaker 2: No, no, I had two sisters, one younger and one older.
Speaker 1: Okay, just two sisters.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so when you were growing up, your household consisted of your mother, your father, you and your two sisters.  And was there anybody else in the household with you?
Speaker 2: That was it.  Oh, well, in the South that was it.  We were joined later on by a cousin in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, so all right, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes, the three of us children slept together.  In those days, have you ever heard of a shotgun type house?  Yes, well, yeah, it was a front room, the middle room and the kitchen.  I do remember one time my father came in, and he was checking on us and he had a lamp in his hand, and I seem to remember that he came pretty close or something and something happened that the lamp, chimney fell off and kind of, you know, burned my arm a little bit, not, nothing serious or anything.  But I always remember that, and I, I think that he may have been looking at me out of a sense of pride.  But then something I recall, I mentioned that he had an automobile at an early age.  It must have been about 1932, a Ford.  And he taught me to drive it.  So that on this particular day, he had me to drive his car up to the end of the road to turn around and come back down to the house.  We lived on the, let's say on an East, West type of road.  The streets were not paved.  I went up to the end of the street, turned around and returned.  And I always thought about the fact that he was very proud of me, I'm sure.  But it could have been tragic with a seven-year old behind the wheel of a car with manual steering, not, not automatic as we have today, but to go up and make that turn and come down.  And I always remember the one time that I made him angry, of course, and he used a board or a plank, you might call it, and popped me once.  That was the only time that my father or my mother ever struck me, and I can't remember what it was that I was doing that caused him to do that, but that was the only time that I remember any of them striking me for any reason.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we always ask this question.  Now, did you grow up in the--you grew up in two places, right?  In South Carolina, and then--
Speaker 2: New York City.
Speaker 1: I guess you were about 10 when the family moved?
Speaker 2: Ten years old, yes, yes.
Story_ID: 33917
Speaker 1: So, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: One thing I always remember is there were lots and lots of peaches in the South.  And I remember one day I ate too many of them (laughter).  I ended up having a difficult time.  I, they always teased me for many years afterwards saying that I said that peaches were coming out of me done and raw because I really ate too many.  In the, down in Beach Island [South Carolina], where my father worked, it basically was farming, but he could also keep any animals he could kill.  And so at times, we had maybe an occasional raccoon or a possum or, of course, and rabbits, needless to say, but also turtles.  We had turtle soup and turtles coming out of that thing.  Those were some of the things that remain with me as I think back to it.
Speaker 1: Okay, any other sights and sounds and smells?  What about New York City?
Speaker 2: Well, I should say that one of my first things from my father was a hog, and this hog--no, I'm sorry, the first one was a goat.  The goat began to grow, and outgrew me so that when I would come from school, I was (unclear) maybe seven or eight years old, the neighbors would get after me because my goat had been around their flowers, eating up their flowers.  So ultimately, we gave up the, we gave up the goat.  Then my father bought a hog for me, but this hog began to grow, and we didn't have any real cover over him.  We had a tin roof, and I think the hog must have had something like heat prostration or something.  So with that, then my father got me six chickens.  And they were going along fine.  We ate the eggs, but then there came a day when they wanted to eat the chickens, and I had some problems with that (laughter).  But that, those are the things that I remember.  We also had a dog, and I remember losing that dog, going up to Edgefield County [South Carolina] where my relatives lived up there.  That dog was hit by a car or something, and dogs in those days loved to run up alongside cars and bark at the cars.
Speaker 1: Right, that's true.  What was your dog's name?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33918
Speaker 1: All right, well, let's see.  Well, what about New York City?  What are your memories of New York City?  You were ten [years old] when you moved there.
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, New York City was something, was a real trip.  First of all, by the time I reached New York City, although I was 10 years old, I was already in the seventh grade.  Whether I was smart or whether they liked me or whatever you--I had been promoted on, you know, quite regularly.  Anyway, I, my mother enrolled me at a school in Harlem, P.S. 157.  And they determined that children from the South weren't as smart as children from the North.  So they put me back to fourth grade, three years, three years.  Well, in those days, you didn't challenge authority, especially, if you came from the South.  And that'll be something I tough on, later on about Marine Corp life.  My parents accepted it, and what, as it was, almost three months later, my father lost his job because the recession came in 1936.  Work was stopped on the subway, and people were fired.  So he lost his job, and it became necessary to find a new place to live.  We had a cousin who owned a little store down in 62nd Street in Manhattan on the lower, on the West side of Manhattan, about mid-Manhattan.  She found a job there in the next building for a janitor.  And my father took the janitor's job, and we moved down there.  This was an entirely different thing.  Now, for the first time in my life I was in an integrated type of setting.  There were whites around in the block and near the block and so forth.  Plus, the schools were integrated.  And, again, for some reason, the teachers loved me.  I did make some, make up some--a year or two in terms of school age.  And throughout my school career, the teachers took a special interest in me.  One of my cousins who is still alive tells me that when they were, when we were in class together, at the end of the Christmas or some of the holidays, everybody in the class knew that they were going to get something.  The teacher would always bring them gifts.  But they always knew that I was going to get something special.  Now, I never thought of it.  It must have gone straight over my head, but they were always assured that I was gonna get something special.  The teachers loved me.  Yeah, I went to school in 59th Street, which is right across from what's now John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school--
Speaker 2: P.S. 141.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had numbers.  And from there, after the seventh grade, I went down to the P.S. 69, which is on 54th Street and 6th Avenue.  It was about that time, by the way, that economics suddenly began to teach me something.  My parents were on home relief.  That's what they called it in those days.  Welfare was still a new term in the future.  And there wasn't much--by the way, Jim, James Dumpson became the first commissioner in the New York City government.  He became the secretary of--no, the Commissioner of Welfare.  And anyway, as I said, I--we were on home relief, but it didn't give me enough to take care of my needs.  For example, when I was leaving P.S. 141, all of the boys were dressed up in different things.  But I didn't have any special things.  So I began to shine shoes for a living.  And now, if you ever know anything about Manhattan, on the West side of Manhattan is where all of the major ships from Europe would dock.  There were the Piers.  The Kinnard Line which was British, the German line, the French line, the Italian line and others, Sweden line.  So I began shining shoes, and within a week or so, I was giving money to the family to help them along.  And to that date--it must have been about 1938, I've never had to ever ask my family for anything, nor anybody else.  I've always taken care of myself.

Speaker 1: Now, in terms of your grade level in school, did they ever adjust that grade level when you moved to the other school?
Speaker 2: I made up, I made up, I think one year or so, yeah, but, no, I was never put back up.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you didn't -- so were you in your right grade, I mean in terms of your age when you were in grade school?
Speaker 2: I was ahead of my grade for my, ahead of my years for my grade.  I was ten years old but already in the seventh grade.  Normally, I would have been in the fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I always have a laugh about that because I'm--it reminds you of the story of Red Foxx who said that he went down to apply for a part in one of those African pictures.  And they turned him down saying he was too light.  He returned two weeks later, and he said, I'm 10 pounds heavier.  I'll show them (laughter).  So, I always say, what did they know about intelligence up there?  Sure, there must have been a lot of children in the South who weren't as smart as those in the South [North], and there was a lot of children in the South who were much smarter than many of those in the North.  But I had the good fortune of moving into a section which was largely populated by West Indians, who seemed to have a greater background in terms of education than many of the others, especially those coming from the South, and so my friends all became West Indians.  And years later, when I went to the West Indies, many people began to assume that I had some kind of a West Indian background.  They even talked about my speech and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you--were you drawn to any particular subject in school, when you were--
Speaker 2: Yes, when I finished the school, P.S. 69, one of my teachers who was very close, advised me to take a General course.  Many of the people, students who were going, who were expected to go to college took an academic course.  Those who were not going to college took a commercial or technical course.  But a general course mean that you could go any way.  She advised me to take a general course.  This is the same person who advised me to buy some AT&T stock when it was less than $10.00 a share.  She also advised me to do some other things financial wise, and when I went--naturally, I didn't follow her advice.
Story_ID: 33920
Speaker 1: When I went to the next school, the High School of Commerce, almost from Day One, my official teacher said, Britton, I want you to be a gentleman and a scholar.  He didn't ask me what I wanted to me.  He simply told me what he wanted me to be.  Now, this was a man who had studied under Woodrow Wilson.  He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Princeton University.  And he was also President of the Manhattan Chess Club.  And I had never heard of chess before.
Speaker 2: Now, who's this fellow again?  What--
Speaker 1: His name was L. Walter Stevens.
Speaker 2: And you met him, he was in--
Speaker 1: In the High School of Commerce.
Speaker 2: High School of Commerce.
Speaker 1: He became my official teacher, yes.  Now, keep in mind also when I mentioned going into P.S. 141, my official teacher's name was Rose Immediato.  Immediato, that's not a name you find very much in the South.
Speaker 2: Now, is that an African American?
Speaker 1: No
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Italian.
Speaker 2: Italian.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, okay, so, this was something new, you know.  You know, then I had a chance to study, Mrs. Immediato, but also since she loved me so much, I guess she got a chance to study me.  The next school was P.S. 69, and my official teacher was named Rose Simonson.  And obviously, she was of Jewish background.  But, again, I can't--yeah, I went to--obviously, there's new knowledge being fed into me at that time but with a sense of curiosity, I wanted to know a little bit more than merely their names or, you know, that kind of background.  I began to really raise questions.  But in the High School of Commerce, it really set me on a new path because Mr. Stevens looked after me and inspired me throughout the time I was in school.  My parents didn't have much education.  So--nor much sophistication, so they did not have the kind of background that would have pushed me towards all of these subjects.  Mr. Stevens did, but fortunately, I lived close to what is now Lincoln Center.  In fact, my school was demolished to make up Lincoln Center.  Plus, I was close to the American Museum of Natural History and across the park from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  So I, I was really--and plus, Columbus Circle.  I was in a position to really gain a great deal of new knowledge.
Story_ID: 33921
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I always remember that one day I was fighting with a boy over a comic book.  And Mr. Stevens came up and without touching us he said, Britton, you'll never be a gentleman and a scholar if you're gonna spend your life fighting over a comic book.  It was some 30 or 35 years before I looked at a comic book after that.  My wife would ask me, well, have you seen the "funnies", have you seen this cartoon.  And my answer would always be, no.  Why?  Because Mr. Stevens had inspired me that that was not going to get me far in life.
Speaker 1: So Mr. Stevens, you say he had been the, he had worked for--
Speaker 2: No, he studied under Woodrow Wilson.
Speaker 1: Studied under Woodrow Wilson?
Speaker 2: Yes, Woodrow Wilson was both a professor and the president of Princeton.  And by the way, his family spent some time in Augusta, Georgia too.  His house is down there in Augusta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: So Stevens was, he was white, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And he, I guess he went to Columbia College?
Speaker 2: No, Princeton.
Speaker 1: Princeton, Princeton, okay, Princeton, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So he studied history with Woodrow Wilson?
Speaker 2: Well, he studied under Woodrow Wilson.  I don't know what his major was.  But he was Phi Beta Kappa, so apparently, he was in the Arts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I found some very unique people teaching at the High School of Commerce, and I remember so many of their names, including the principal who as the War became imminent, I quickly recognized that he was a Colonel in the military.
Speaker 1: Who?  Stevens?
Speaker 2: No, my--the principal of my school.
Speaker 1: Oh, the principal, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum.  Robert J--no, his name was, last name was McNamara, Edward J. McNamara, the principal at the time.
Story_ID: 33922
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you ever sell newspapers or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Didn't do that, okay.
Speaker 2: No.  Basically, during the time that I was at High School of Commerce, I worked in the cafeteria before breakfast and--before classes in the morning.  And I had a job delivering, working a dental technician immediately after school.  And after finishing with the dental technician, then I worked for a cleaning company.  I delivered clothing, and sometimes I worked, I went to a florist to work there.  I had several jobs after school.  That's why I said I always had lots of money, and never had to ask anybody for anything.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But this also had some benefits.  For example, I mentioned that I was near the American Museum of Natural History.  I began to--big words always fascinated me.  I'd go back to South Carolina where the insurance man would come in monthly, and he'd give me a nickel to spell a big word.  So when I was seven or eight years old, I could spell words like Baluchitherium and talk about them, okay.  When I went to New York at the Met--American Museum, going in the historic section, of all things, I came up on a painting of a Baluchitherium.  And by that time, I had studied a lot more about the Baluchitherium so that one night delivering clothes, I went to the Arts Students League and the man who answered the door, I was delivering the clothes to, turned out to be the one who had painted this Baluchitherium.  And so we got into a discussion of the Baluchitherium in terms of what inspired him to do this painting.  So, as I think back to it, here I am about 12 or 13 years old, and I'm discussing with this distinguished artist who happened to be white, his paintings and what inspired him to do it.  And where did he get his background from and so forth.  It's, it's one of those things that come back to me.
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna ask you this.  Did you--when you lived in, when the family lived in Harlem or even afterwards, did you go to the Harlem "Y" at all?
Speaker 2: Not at that time.  Only after I came out of the military in 1946.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know there was a famous man from Aiken, South Carolina who was in charge of the Harlem "Y" for a while, I think in the early '30's [1930s], and that's Dr. Channing Tobias--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --who also had a career in diplomacy with Ralph Bunche.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew, well, Dr. Bunche was a member of my church, by the way, in New York, later on, after the War.  Dr. Tobias, was--I had run into him.  But the one that was most (unclear) to read was during the 1940s, who was Rudy Thomas, and Rudy--Rudolph Thomas was a brother of Alberta Thomas Klein from, they're originally from Orlando, Florida.  And she grew up with Mary McCloud Bethune.  She knew--they were very, they were good friends.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Rudolph Thomas was associated with the "Y"?
Speaker 2: He was Executive Director of the "Y".
Speaker 1: Okay, Executive Director.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, actually, Mrs. Thomas' brother-in-law was a ranking police officer in New York at the time, Manual--Emanuel Klein.  He was an acting captain.  Captain Battle had been the first, Samuel J. Battle had been the first black policeman in the City of New York.  But as I said, I got to know Rudy much later, after starting to work for Mrs. Klein--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was the one I mentioned about the "equal opportunity" means "equal responsibility".  She inspired a lot of young people in Harlem at the time.  But I only spent several months in Harlem before moving to the (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I thought I'd ask because of Tobias, and that international, you know, diplomacy connection in him being from Aiken.  I was wondering if you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you know about him at the time--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --him being the--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was quite a reader.  I used to spend a great deal of time reading and listening to the radio.  Even now, I'm more addicted to the radio than I am to television.  I listen to the radio quite a bit, and I listen to a great deal of spoken words as well as to read a lot.  I carry a "Kindle Fire" and I keep it powered up all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33923
Speaker 1: Now, in high school, what course did you take?  You said there was a college prep course, like a business course and a general course?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they didn't, they didn't--courses were not considered college prep, but they were just general courses.  You could take most anything now.  I think the one course that fascinated me most of all, and I was, I always think it was the most valuable course I ever took in school, was typing, strange as that may seem, because with typing, you can do so many things.  But because of that early exposure out of South Carolina, I was very much interested in history and travel began to be a part of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that even in high school, I began to teach myself French because I knew I'd be going to France at some point.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what did you imagine yourself doing in France?
Speaker 2: I don't think, I don't think that I had any particular feeling at that time, other than getting to France and knowing what it was all about.  I guess I must have been hearing a lot about folks who have gone over there and spoke about how they were accepted so freely without any restrictions or anything, and not that I felt any restrictions in U.S.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there would have been men in Harlem who had been part of the Army in World War I that, you know, served in the French Army and--
Speaker 2: In Noble Cecil, oh, gosh, so many musicians.  Plus, there was other men that ultimately, I began to work for who had served in World War I, as officers at that time too, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And it was just so--well, this jumps a little bit ahead, but during that time, I was reading a great deal, and meeting a good deal.  For example, Father Divine had a mission on block from me.  Then there were a goodly number of musicians around who were just beginning to sprout, but whose names had not come to the fore, people like Thelonious Monk and other people and music and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Father Divine's mission, you're talking about in, on the West side or in--
Speaker 2: West side, 63rd Street, and 63rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue.  And I might say that I was a little bit naive about churches at that time when we moved in this area.  The local church was, the local church had a name that wasn't significant at all in terms of what I knew in the South.  I'm trying to think of the name of it.  But it actually was an Anglican church, which is something that's totally new to me.  I didn't know anything about Anglicans.  I only--in fact, I only knew about Baptist.  But this, it was all because of the West Indian background.
Story_ID: 33924
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, now how were your grades in high school?
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: How were your grades in high school?
Speaker 2: My grades were about average.  Sometimes I would have a little spurt, but basically, they were about average.  I will say this, that because I was in the commercial end of it--this is called the High School of Commerce by the way, I also seemed to gravitate towards things that would teach me a little bit about the cultural things.  Joining the glee club suddenly introduced me to music that I hadn't heard before.  Then my teachers began to expose me to things that I was totally with, art.  My art teacher tended to tell me a lot more.  And even my, the teachers who had us for physical exercise, was good enough to teach me Spencerian script, which was something totally new to me.  But almost always, my teachers tended to want to teach me something special.  Maybe it's because I had a special interest or I was attentive or what have you or maybe they just like me.  But I was, I was constantly being given something extra, other than merely what I was being taught in class.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so in high school, you're working, you're going to school, you've got--did you, had you chosen a, like a vocation that you--had you targeted one year?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, no.  I can't remember that I'd really settled down on anything.  I will say this, too, working at the cleaners were young ladies who were very much involved in the labor movement.  And the War [World War II] was beginning to build up, and so the labor movement was very much interested, and, of course, the labor movement at that time, seemed to work us to get into the War effort.  I think that there was, there was--many of them were Communists background.  And to the extent that the Germans had invaded Russia at the time, there was a desire to get us very much involved.  So there were a number of rallies, and they insisted on my going to the rallies with them.  Now, the ladies who operated, who were the cleaners were white, of course.  And the idea of being out in this very large group was something new.  They were all white, basically white.  And this was something that I had not been exposed to.  However, it served--put me on a path where I was perfectly comfortable and not intimidated by being around a group of white nor afraid or anything like that.  And it began to really--
Story_ID: 33925
Speaker 1: We were talking about high school, but we got seguewayed in a little discussion in between. We were talking about the AME Zion Church.  You said you used to go there, and--
Speaker 2: Yes, this was during, (unclear) during my high school years because of this group that was very much related to the Communist cause, I was constantly being invited to many things supporting Russia and so forth.  Communism was still very much, well, in the black community because they were much more willing to be seen with black folks.  It was sort of something like a real compliment.  So it was easy to identify with them.  I remember being in Madison Square Garden where we were singing the, a new song by Guthrie about the Roland--the, I forget the first name.  But it was a ship by James, the last name of the ship was James, was James, Roland James or something like that.  But they said, I remember the song went something like "Tell me what were their names"--oh, the Reuben James, the Reuben James, yeah.  It was quite a spirited type of thing, and I found myself singing along with it and going on.  But I learned at that point that there was a lot of good feeling, and easy relationships.  But--
Speaker 1: You're talking about a Woody Guthrie song and--
Speaker 2: Woody Guthrie, song, yeah, "Oh, tell me what were their names on the good Reuben James".  But this was one of the jobs that I held.  The gentleman who had the, what do you call it, the dental technician, wanted to send me to school and wanted to train me at his expense to become a partner with him.  But I had decided that I wanted to do something else.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you decide that you wanted to do at the--now, this is--now, you graduated from high school in '41' [1941]?  Was it '41' [1941] or '42' [1942].
Speaker 2: No, 1943, I was in my last term, and I--no, my next to last term.  So I was called onto active duty in January of '44' [1944].  So I didn't finish the last term.  I received my diploma in absentia which is, which meant that I got a diploma, but not enough to qualify me for college.  And in January, 1944, of course, I went into the military and--
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what was it that you decided to do though (unclear), that you didn't wanna be a dental technician, I mean dentist?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I, as I think back to it, I think I wanted to be in business, but I wasn't quite certain of exactly what kind of business.  Having been shining shoes and having my own schedule, but having made good--well, even in the, in high school, besides these jobs that I was working on and on Saturdays I took on an extra job in the floral industry, I also still had my shoeshine box in case I wanted to fall back on that.  But one thing about it, going back to that, is going down alongside the piers from say British to French to Swedish to Italian to German, gave me a greater exposure to the world and to diversity of people.  So it became something that was budding in my mind to want to do something to be involved with people on a broad basis.  And that led into something, later on when I went into the military of being overseas.
Speaker 1: So did you ever think about joining the Merchant Marine?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or--okay.
Speaker 2: I had a cousin who was in the Merchant Marine.  He first introduced me to some of the travels.  I would say this, in high school, there was a fellow who (unclear) was (unclear) of Liberia, and he formed the Liberia Society, and some of us began to follow that.  But it began to have some problems because he didn't want people like Adam Clayton Powell to be a member of it or something like that.  Not that Adam was a candidate, but he said, they ought to look like Negroes and what have you (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you had to look black enough to join?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, I don't know.  I got in, but suffice to say that maybe I was one of the early ones.  But that was beginning to surface at that time that this fellow would not, would not welcome people who looked like Adam Clayton Powell or Walter White.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the group you were in?
Speaker 2: It was the Liberia Society.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33926
Speaker 1: All right, so you were drafted in 1943, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was called to active duty and I was offered the Army or the Navy, and I refused either.  I told them I didn't want either one.  For some reason, I had been introduced to the Marine Corps, and felt that it was a pioneering organization.  Originally, I wanted to go in the Air Force, but for some reason I had changed my mind about the Air Force, and with the Marine Corps being a new organization, sort of a pioneering organization, I wanted to go in that.  I think I had sort of a pioneering spirit, and I often cite to people that they fail to recognize what was in my parents that they would give up everything in the South where they were safe and secure and come to this big city where they were totally insecure.  And it's only because they had enough optimism and pioneering spirit to wanna make that change.  And I must have inherited some of that.  So I think this may have had some little thing on my wanting to go in the Marine Corps, although I had been reading a little bit about it.  When I turned it down, they thought at first that I, you know, was being some kind of slickster or something, but I asked the Marine Corps person there if he could find a spot--'cause they were already filled at that point.  But he said he would look around, and I always remember his name, Sergeant Motere, M-O-T-E-R-E.  He came back and said, "you're in".  At that point, I became a Marine, and by the end of January, I was reporting for duty in Montford Point Camp.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so you--here the War is about two years old as far as the United States is concerned--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You're entering the Marine Corps.  Now, you realized that the Army was segregated, right, any branch, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, 'cause you were going into the Marines, and this is the first group of formally organized black Marines, right, in--
Speaker 2: Yes, the first--there were eight in the original set up of the Marines is 19--in 1774, but they had been excluded from that point on up to 1942 when President Roosevelt signed the Executive Order creating the, or rather calling for integration of the military.  And Mrs. Roosevelt--Mrs. Bethune had a lot to do with that by the way.  She and Mrs. Roosevelt were very close friends.
Speaker 1: I know they advocated for the Tuskegee Airmen, and--
Speaker 2: Originally, they were trying to get women, and Mrs. Roosevelt--Mrs. Bethune became the first African American executive in the federal government, based on my research.  That was in the National Youth Administration.  By the way, her protege who is now 98 years old, is a good friend.  His name is James E. Huger, Sr.  He lives in Daytona Beach [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay, how do you spell his name--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He was the second black Sergeant Major in the Marine Corps.
Speaker 1: James E--
Speaker 2: James E. Huger, Sr., H-U-G-E-R.  When you go to Daytona Beach, you'll see his name and Mary McCloud Bethune's name throughout the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He became the first black, city commissioner and the first black county commissioner, and he held a leading role in the city government.
Speaker 1: All right, so--
Speaker 2: He was the second black, Sergeant Major in the Marine Corps, by the way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33927
Speaker 1: So, well, tell us about Montford Point.  Now, how did you get there--it's near Camp Lejeune, right, and--
Speaker 2: Yes, you know, it--there was only one other person going down with me from New York.  His name was Hansel, H-A-N-S-E-L, A. Shaw, S-H-A-W.  And by the way, for some strange reason, I sometimes have a very strong memory for names and so forth.  And some people I'm kind of technical, but on the other hand, I hate for people to slough over things (laughter).  You gotta know what (laughter)--oh, anyway, I arrived.  And I think it must have been in the late part of the morning.  We must have gone down on the train that normally would have terminated either in Florida or Augusta, and I guess it must have, we must have gone somewhere from some part of Virginia or North Carolina and went over there.  But to me it was not unusual--for some reason, nothing surprises me in life, nothing, having grown up in the South, of course, you expected certain things that normally fit in.  Black folks were with black folks and so forth.  Going into Montford Point, by this time, most of the staff, the enlisted staff--in fact, practically all of them, by this time were all African Americans.  The officers were all white, but I didn't think anything particularly of it.  I just accepted what was going on.
Speaker 1: So just describe your induction.
Speaker 2: In New York, of course, we were just sworn in, and when we reported back, and we were, I guess, given our tickets.  And we got on the train to start--usually, the train left at 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon or something.  And we just proceeded and changed at Washington [D.C.], and, you know, from an integrated train to a segregated train.  You know, black folks were in the coach immediately behind the front coach.  And we got in at, early in the morning.  The next thing, we were sent to places to stay and then to come back up and get clothes and then report in for a haircut.  It was always funny that they always said, "How do you want it?"  And some of the fellows would stipulate how they wanted their hair cut, and with that, they'd cut everything off.  I remember that they, I think the name of the barber was Parker Wilson, and he--they always had a big joke out of it.  And with that we began training and so forth.
Speaker 1: How were you treated?  I mean were you surprised at your treatment at all?  I mean did they, you know--
Speaker 2: Again, I say that I've always received treatment to the best and no matter who it was.  And as I say, I--it must be some God-given thing that I didn't deserve, but nevertheless, I was blessed with it.  Even in the training, we had a drill instructor to happen to have been rather small, and he, he was good.  He treated us well.  I did have another gentleman who was a, sort of a, I guess he was in charge of a group of platoons.  He wanted to show me some specific tactics, and I discovered what his game was, so I (laughter), I got away from him but fast.  I think he needed company or something.  But in the course of it, even going out on the field, when we were punished, I always took the view that even though someone was punishing us, he had to be there with us.  And whether it was for him to go to the bathroom or whether it was for him to go to the, to go in for lunch or something, it was gonna end at a certain point.  So no, no punishment was ever too severe or so severe that, you know.  I saw other fellows pass out, but I also saw them pass out when we were getting physicals, and they'd get shots.  Some would get an inoculation and pass out.  These were big fellas, and I wasn't necessarily--
Story_ID: 33928
Speaker 1: They had never had a shot?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know, but the point is for some, the idea of getting an inoculation was not something they were accustomed to.  So they would just drop.  But it never bothered me at all.  I always said that, I took the view early that if nine--if a thousand men went into battle, and 999 were gonna get killed and couldn't come back, I would also feel, very quickly I'd feel very sorry for these other 999 because I knew who was coming back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I, I never regarded the training as difficult or anything like that or harsh.
Speaker 1: So, well, describe--how many of you were in your unit--is that what you would call it, a unit, that--
Speaker 2: A platoon.
Speaker 1: Platoon.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In your platoon--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And see, we had, I think we must have had about maybe 40 in a platoon 'cause it might have been about three or four platoons to a company.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how many made it?
Speaker 2: I think all of them made it in my platoon, yeah.  I don't remember anyone dropping out, no.  They were all there.
Speaker 1: What kind of, you know, boot camp did you have?  What did you have to do?
Speaker 2: Well, we did a lot of drilling.  We learned to drill well, and some of the things that we did were basically to build up our systems, and finally, to go onto the rifle range.  I still remember my rifle number by the way.  And I--
Speaker 1: What was it?
Speaker 2: 2076998.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, and my serial number was 925686 (laughter), but, you know, all of these things, 2076998, a Marine, it was Grand semi-automatic rifle, M-1.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And I think about the fact that even on the rifle range where we were firing next to each other, with nothing to protect our ears and I see so many of my friends or colleagues of the day who have lost their hearing.  We didn't have anything to protect us against it.
Speaker 1: Was that pretty much standard with, you know--
Speaker 2: That was standard, yeah, whether you were on your belly or standing on your feet, someone's standing right next to you firing away.
Speaker 1: So how long did boot camp last in--what was the toughest part of boot camp?
Speaker 2: I didn't consider any of it as tough.
Speaker 1: The whole thing was tough?
Speaker 2: I never regarded it as tough.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  And you're becoming a Marine, and you don't regard any of the training as tough and--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: No, in fact, I've cited to a lot of folks that--a lot of folks came from the South, fellows who came from the South who were very indifferential, you know, they were kind of subdued.  They had grown up where white supremacy was the order of the day.  And so they tended to be very, very low key.  And I point out that it created something that the Marine Corps maybe didn't expect.  And that is that, when you were taught, you were taught to stand erect with your shoulders back and your chest out.  When you looked, when someone spoke to you, you looked that person directly in the face.  When that person asked you--gave you a question or something, you were supposed to speak so that you would be heard a mile away.  Now, keep in mind that in the South, you did not do this.  If a white person spoke to you, you kind of lowered your head or something or you--and in speaking, you didn't speak, you know, so that you could be heard, I mean like that.  The other thing is that, even so, you didn't look a person directly in the eye, a white person, directly in the eye.  In fact, I don't think you even looked black folks directly in the eye unless you were ready for trouble because even with our relatives, older relatives, you didn't take liberties in terms of how you dealt with your older folks.  Yeah, you were taught to be a little bit more subdued.  But in the Marine Corps, it was entirely different.  And I always say that those men who went back to the South were an entirely different breed than those who came out of the South because suddenly, they, they--we often say, well, they acted like men.  They went back to the South as men, period.
Story_ID: 33929
Speaker 1: In fact, it got many, some of them in trouble because they acted as if they wouldn't take any stuff off anyone.  One of our sort of icons in the military, Edgar Huff, was a sergeant.  He went home in Alabama and he was arrested for impersonating a Marine.  And the colonel in charge of the camp who was in charge--who had, was from South Carolina--from Virginia, he had attended the Citadel in South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, personally drove down to Alabama and got him out of jail.  And I have stories of my friend, Ed Fiser (ph.) who is up in the home in Massachusetts now recuperating from the amputation, who was sitting waiting for a bus to take him to Charlotte [North Carolina] so that he could get a train going to New Orleans [Louisiana].  And in the course of it--to Raleigh [North Carolina], I'm sorry.  In the course of it, this big Marine came in who had been fighting in Guadalcanal and said, "When did they put you guys in the Marine Corps?"  And he said, "Well, there's a lot of 'em over there."  He said, we have a huge camp over there.  And he said, I didn't know they had black Marines, and they got on talking.  And he said, well, by the way, why aren't you getting on the bus?  And he said, well, they take only whites first, and afterwards, they take us.  And each time the bus gets filled up, they pull out, and so that's why I've been missing two buses so far.  He said, "You're ready to go?".  And he said, "Yeah".  So this white Marine called the station manager over and said, listen, you see that man.  He said, when the next bus goes out of here, I wanna see his ass on one of them seats or your brains on this floor, you hear?  He's a Marine.  And when the next bus pulled out, there was Fiser sitting on his seat, headed out.  And this began something that I've begun to kind of retrace my steps and see how white Marines began to befriend the black Marines.  For example, the buses, bus drivers at some times would become very arbitrary and would refuse to take the guys back to the camp.  Now, this could have been serious trouble for them, except that when white Marines found out about it, they would throw the white drivers off the bus, take over the bus and drive the black guys back to camp.  Yeah, and this happened so consistently.  One night, one of the fellows had been mistreated in Jacksonville [North Carolina], the little town there.  It was very racist, and so the guys had decided that they were gonna go into the town and tear the town apart.  We had tanks at that time, plus cannons and machine guns and everything else.  And the colonel came down in his nightshirt, and he said, boys, he said, please don't do it.  It won't help.  And the word got around that if they did, they would get the colonel in trouble.  And the last thing the guys wanted to do was to lose this colonel.  They loved him so much.  So on that basis, they broke it up and went back.  I've heard a lot of stories about some of the guys being mistreated and rough.  I always said the Marine Corps was very democratic.  It treated everybody like dogs.
Speaker 2: Or maggots really (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah (laughter).  So I never, for some reason, I never--the extremes on either one never made me feel bad or demoralized, and the extremes on the other side never made me feel too exhilarated.  And over the years, I've begun to conclude that people are people, and there's no such thing as the perfect one or that someone's extremely bad or extremely good because one of the people who did so much for me was a man named Senator Strom Thurmond, who asked me to help him to become adjusted to the Twenty-First Century.  He had a young wife, of course, a young daughter.
Speaker 2: Now, that's a story that comes up later, right, but--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes--
Speaker 2: About the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and I've had so many other people as I said, who treated me so royalty.  I'm not sure I ever deserved it, but nevertheless, that's the treatment I got.
Story_ID: 33930
Speaker 1: Now, who was your drill instructor at Montford Point?
Speaker 2: I can see him, but I can't remember his name off hand.  He was a little fellow.
Speaker 1: So you must not have had Hashmark Johnson, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no.  Hashmark, by this time was already up in the hierarchy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was Recruit Depot Sergeant Major by that time.  And that meant six stripes.  I was no stripes.  I did run into one of my fellows who I knew from high school who had come into the Marine Corps before.  And he had one stripe, and one day I was driving--walked, running along, and I suddenly saw him.  And I called out to him.  And I regretted that because he proceeded to have me stand up, and he told me in no uncertain terms that, how to address an officer, that I had to be more respectful.  But we had a white tag on our caps which meant that we were boots.  He had a black tag on his which meant that he was a drill instructor.  And with that, he told me to turn around and get going.  I swore I'd never speak to him again.  By the time I graduated from boot camp, I was walking down the street with my hands in my pockets (laughter), and who should come up to me but him.  I said, "Man, don't speak to me" (laughter).  But I eventually--in fact, I've seen his son here in Atlanta [Georgia].  He died, unfortunately, some years afterwards.  But he used to work on the Triborough Bridge as a toll collector.  And quite often I'd see him.  We'd always wave to each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I never, I never saw anything that was really demeaning, difficult or mean or hateful or anything like that.  Even my--well, it's a different story.  Even when I went overseas, my officers who were college graduates went out of their way to help educate me.
Story_ID: 33931
Speaker 1: Okay, so after boot camp, was there anything significant about graduation from boot camp, that--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: --you remember?
Speaker 2: --except that I remember the fellow from Dallas, Texas, his name was Frank Madison, was chosen as the outstanding member of the platoon.  And he was given the one stripe, and that's all I--from there, I went into what's called School's Company, School's Company, where they train you for clerical stuff--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --among others.
Speaker 1: So is that the job you had basically in (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I became a clerk in my unit, which was good because the rest of the fellows then were relegated to handling supplies after we went overseas.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, were you shipped, you know, fairly quickly?
Speaker 2: July 3rd, 1944--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on the U.S. Navy Ship, "Sea Perch".
Speaker 1: And where did you go?
Speaker 2: To Guadalcanal.  It took us thirty-three days.  We made one stop in Espirito Santo near Hebrides, thirty-three days.
Speaker 1: Now, explain to us where Guadalcanal is?
Speaker 2: The British Solomon Islands, approximately about a thousand, 500 miles [1,500] Northeast of Australia and just South, Southeast of New Guinea.
Speaker 1: Okay, Southeast--
Speaker 2: That was the first big battle of the War in which the Marine Corps established itself.  Alexander Vandergrift was the General in charge.  And he was the one who began to take a different view of black marines.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you heard about them in Saipan where, by the way, I have an article--I should have gotten you a copy of that article, which shows two white Marines holding a sign saying, "Thank you, Montford Point Marines".  In the early battles, we were supposed to be handling supplies, but since supplies had to come in after the ammunition ships, (unclear).  The fellows were used to bring wounded Marines back from the front and sometimes bodies from the front until one Marine officer, seeing that his group was about to be overrun, told the white--the black Marines to drop their supplies and get their weapons and get up on the front, which they did and helped to turn the battle.  And from that point on, for some strange reason, they learned that black Marines could fight 'cause I always said they should a come around the ghetto on a Saturday night (laughter).
Story_ID: 33932
Speaker 1: So you're on your way.  Now, what were the conditions on the ship going over there?
Speaker 2: Again, one of those things.  The first day I was there I met one of the crew who told me that I should not drink any of the liquids, but only drink solid foods.  And I said, why?  And he said, well, because as we get on the high seas, the ship begins rolling.  And if you've got a lot of liquids in your stomach, pretty soon it's gonna be, it's gonna be difficult for you because you'll end up throwing up and what have you.  He said, but if you got solid foods, it won't roll or anything like that.  So it wasn't too long, by the time we got out on the high seas, where a lot of the fellows were leaning over the sides of the ship.  But I was in good shape, and he always bought me things like bread and sausage and what have you.  And I, luckily, I had taken one of the bunks on the high level too.  There were four tiers of bunks, and I'd gotten on, on the top.  So I was not subject to any of the things where the fellows were having difficulties.  But, again, this happened throughout the ship.  We were on it thirty-three days, as I say.  We did have one special ceremony.  That's when they turn you from a pollywog into a shell back.  When you cross the equator, they do a ceremony.  They smash eggs over your head and so forth, and salt water and everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when you finished, you're officially a shellback.
Speaker 1: That's a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: People fly these days over the equator so they don't go through the ceremony.  But in those days, that's what it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard about those kind of ceremonies and sailors all over the world, when you cross the equator, they do something to you to commemorate it.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Ah--
Speaker 2: But that was something new to me, too, to come into the British Solomon Islands.  This is the first time that I'd been out of the country.  And it was very significant to me.
Speaker 1: So what was, well, how did you find, like the Solomon Islands?  I mean did you like 'em or did you--or was it too tense or what?
Speaker 2: Anything that gives me new education, you've got me.  I love it.  I would go out in the jungles looking around, on one--only one occasion that I saw something happen that I almost got me in the situation that I would, might have regretted.  We were out, and we had heard that there were still some Japanese in the jungles.  And at one point, we went out in a truck and one of the people jumped out of the bush and started running.  And I could have killed him with my rifle, but I didn't for which I'm glad because, now, I can still say that I never killed anyone, although I've been in two wars.  But in this place, I learned a lot about the island.  Even going out into the jungles, I found little, what you call spiders, about this size with woolly--
Speaker 1: Tarantulas?
Speaker 2: No, woolly spiders.
Speaker 1: Those are--
Speaker 2: Tarantulas are smaller if I recall.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But these were very large, almost like the sort of, size of a small rodent.  And even then I learned a lot about it.  As a matter of fact, 2008 I was at a conference in North Korea--I mean South Korea, and fellows were walking down the hallway.  And I stopped 'em, and I said, you're not Polynesian, you're Melanesian.  And I said, are you from the Solomon Islands?  And they said, yes.  And I said, are you from Domoco, Teneroo (ph.), Henderson.  And one said, I'm the mayor of Domoco (laughter).  But needless to say, the fellows wondered, well, how'd you know all about this?  And I'd tell them that I'd been on, in the Solomon Islands, Guadalcanal.  And then I talked about a fellow whom I spent some time with out there, and they said he died two years ago.  He was the most distinguished statesman in all of the Solomon Islands.  I need to say my prestige relationship that these guys grew up, they just couldn't imagine an American, an African American knowing that much about the islands or having grown up with one of the elder statesmen at a time when he was just a youngster.
Story_ID: 33933
Speaker 1: But I would say this, in Guadalcanal, because we were in charge of supplies and the Marine, the division had been receiving many special supplies, I had first crack at all of the books.  I made sure I got it.  And I was rooming with medical corpsman who were some of the more educated men in the organization.  Certainly, their knowledge was much more esoteric than typical knowledge, you know, that we had.  I learned a great deal from them, but by reading these books--we had what then was called the United States Armed Forces Institute.  They were educating and almost like, these days, we call it online education.  But in those days, they simply sent out books and so forth.  I got a book on every subject I could find, whether it was geology, psychology, you name it?  English, history, and I read everything I could find.  As a matter of fact, the--my officers knew that I would always have a book in my jacket.  We had these so-called Eisenhower jackets where it was all the way up to your neck.  I always had a book in it because if they took too long doing whatever they're gonna do upfront, I would take out my book and start reading (laughter), even though I was holding my rifle at the same time.  But, and they were helpful in sharing their knowledge no matter where they came from.  And they appreciated the fact, I guess, that I called on them for their knowledge because it must have been flattering to them.  And whatever I learned, I applied to wherever I was.
Speaker 2: Were you ever in any desperate danger in Guadalcanal?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And how long was your--
Speaker 1: Eight months.
Speaker 2: Eight months.
Speaker 1: Then we took off going to--well, I should say--I'll back up slightly.  A ship blew up off the coast of Benicia, Benicia Island, and it was an ammunition ship, and debris was being hurled all about.  And they, I remember that we were, we had to get out of our bunks and get under the tent houses fast in order to avoid some of the debris flying overhead.  The ship completely blew up.  I ran into a fellow many years--no, not, I didn't run into him.  But one of my friends from those, from that island ran into some, he encountered someone who had lost his limbs in that explosion.  He ended up in the sea for a number of hours and what have you.  And he learned what had happened.  Now, later, in handling and receiving many foreign dignitaries, I would often take them to the Arlington National Cemetery, and there is a mass grave with all of the remains that were recovered from that explosion on Benicia and it's buried in this one grave.  So I learned some things that had happened over there at the time.
Story_ID: 33934
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so the rest of your tour, you came back to the United States.  Now, you said you--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  From there, I went to Hawaii.  In April of 1945, while at sea, we learned of the death of President Roosevelt--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --April of '45' [1945], but it was until May of 1946 that I remained in Hawaii.  In fact, I always remember the name of the camp, Paukukalo in Maui and some of the things.  Now, by the way, the Third Marine Division had been staging there.  And, again, they had sensitized the Hawaiians to be prejudice against us.  Never mind the fact that most of the Hawaiians were much darker in complexion than we were.  But they had been sensitized that they were supposed to walk across, walk off the street when we came along.  But we became involved with them, both in terms of music, church, athletics and became great friends with the Hawaiians.  I've visited Maui several times since finally leaving.  One incident happened that was significant.  We had what today would be called a Tsunami.  In those days, we called it a Tidal Wave.  But it was an earthquake out in the Pacific, and it caused the water to recede, then to come back with full force at 50 feet height.  And we were able to get up to a higher level of ground.  But it took tents, and sheds and so forth and just smashed them all up against each other, tanks and all that kind of business.  I enjoyed that.  I explored Hawaii, the Island of Maui as much as I could going all to the different places, including to the bottom of Mount Haleakala, and that's 10,000 feet.  I couldn't try that these days because I'm sure I'd be able to get out.  It's not easy getting out.  Your feet sink into the sand as you're coming up.  But I was young then, so.  Then we had other fellows coming in from other parts of the Pacific, and I got to know some of them.  For the first time, I was introduced to some of the Chinese--stories about China which led later on to my, when I first started going to China in the 1980s, I went there with a sort of a background from some of the knowledge that I'd gotten from some of my friends who were returning from China in the Pacific.
Speaker 1: Okay, what kind of stories were you hearing about China?
Speaker 2: Well, the fact that there was a great deal of mistreatment of females, girls, female babies were thrown in the river and--well, some of the words.  I began to get a little sense of feelings for and what the place looked like.  There's some pictures.  The fellows had been in what's called Qingdoa which is in the North, and it's, this was a snowy region.  I've gone from the North of China to the South of China since that time, so, but I had a chance to see what some parts of it looked like by the, pretty good pictures and what they had to tell about it.  Doa means big, of course, and Qing, it has a certain connotation to that.
Story_ID: 33935
Speaker 1: Okay, so from, when did you come back to the states, I mean--you were in Hawaii.  Then after Hawaii--
Speaker 2: Yes, I returned on, in May of 1946, and I--by the way, one of my good friends out there returned with me as a sergeant.  He later was called back into the Marine Corps the same as I, and he was in the fighting in Korea.  At the same time, and some time after, he decided he no longer wanted to be in the infantry.  So he applied and was accepted in flight school and became a pilot.  He was flying the C-130s and ultimately came out as a captain, which is--I still talk with him by the way.  This is one of those things that always says that, look how the Corps has grown.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But I learned a great deal out there in Hawaii, and I experienced a great deal.  I learned that I didn't need to smoke or drink in order to really enjoy life.  I, the first time I went out with him, we were invited to dinner by a family, Hawaiian family, and typically, once they serve the drinks, you're expected to drink the toast.  And they'd refill your glass, and you drink another toast, and they refill your glass.  Well, I could recognize that that was gonna be a problem.  I stopped.  But my friend continued.  As it was, I had to bring him back into camp and sneak him under the wire because we couldn't make all the way up the way up to the gate.  And the next morning, I got word that they were giving him the last rites of the church.  He didn't die, but I tease him about that now.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came back to the United States in '46' [1946] in--what month was it?
Speaker 2: May of '46' [1946].
Speaker 1: Okay, May of '46' [1946].
Speaker 2: My first flight out of Chicago, the, what do you call it?  The trains were on strike.  And when we got to Chicago, all of the trains struck.  I had to come in from Los Angeles by train.  So I made my first flight into LaGuardia [Airport] from Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you feel different coming back to New York after having been a Marine?
Speaker 2: I don't remember feeling any particularly different.  Once I got back, of course, I, I got so involved.  For example, I started going to the YMCA and this began to absorb my mind, with the Society for the Study of Negro History.  I was learning so much that was new, but in addition, there were friends who were in college at the time.  And they were beginning to influence me to do some things.  And there was another group called, let's see, what was it called?  I forget it, but basically, Palisades Amusement Park was still segregated.  They would not allow blacks to come in Palisades Amusement Park, especially to the pool.  And so--oh, and this group was called "Modern Trend Progressive Youth Group".  And they would go on each Sunday afternoon to picket Palisades Park.  In addition, at--some of them were going to City College.  So I enrolled at City College, and I met some people whose, some names became quite a, household names.  During the day, they had what was called the "Douglas Society", Frederick Douglas, and at night, they had a Meroe Society, M-E-R-O-E.  I saw the name pop up the other day in an article about, from Europe, where some of the African students who had formed a Meroe Society.  Meroe was an ancient African American--African kingdom.
Speaker 1: In Sudan, in--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --yeah, in Northern Sudan.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's right because they've suddenly discovered that there were so many artifacts and antiquities--in fact, they discovered a huge number of pyramids predating the current pyra--I mean the ones that we know so well.
Speaker 1: Right, at a place, I think it's called Napata, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 33936
Speaker 1: Well, Meroe was a capitalist kingdom, and so we had this kingdom, and that fed into the things we were doing in the Society for the Study of Negro History.
Speaker 2: Now, who was the founder for the Society for the Study of Negro History in New York that you were involved in?
Speaker 1: I think it was James--James J. Allen.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, Carter Woodson had started the association, but James J. Allen was the one who was doing it, and he was a teacher in New York, an administrator in the school system.  But it was, and it was meeting over at the YMCA.  Some of the people, I'm trying to think of some of the names.  They went on to become rather prominent, especially in the labor movement.  In fact, one became head of African Studies at Harvard [University] prior to Henry Louis "Skip" Gates [Jr.] and his group coming up there.
Speaker 2: Oh, you're talking about--
Speaker 1: His daughter is--
Speaker 2: --Yeoward Gwinner.
Speaker 1: Yeoward Gwinner.
Speaker 2: Yeoward, yeah, Yeoward, right.
Speaker 1: Yeoward was studying with us up there, Yeoward Gwinner.
Speaker 2: Right, Lonnie Gwinner is daughter.
Speaker 1: That's right, yes.  And there were some other names that were prominent.  James Baker was one of the guys in the society with me who went on to become a psychiatrist and headed a number of the VA hospitals.  It was--and then I began to notice the differences in the names and the differences began to intrigue.  But then we had people like President--the former president of Haiti.  He was the last, I think, of the mulatto type-people.
Speaker 2: Oh, Duvalier?
Speaker 1: No, good heavens, no (laughter), no.
Speaker 2: Not Stineo Vincent or--
Speaker 1: Oh, I can't think of his name, but he was a good friend with Dr. H. Binga Desmond who was one of the power figures up there at the time.
Speaker 2: Was John Henry Clark involved in it at all?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and some others.  Some were still coming up at the time.  I think John might have been in the school system and ultimately, went over to City College.
Speaker 2: Right, he did, he did.  And what about Charles Seford, Sifford, yeah.
Speaker 1: I remember his name, and I'm trying to remember, but later on.  Of course, I got to know a lot more people, especially, I was fortunate to end up at Carver Federal Savings.  And anybody who was anybody came to Carver on their tours up there. Spanky Austin who was a, our artist.  I think he was also from South Carolina.  We engaged him as one of our artists and, yeah, to support him.
Story_ID: 33937
Speaker 1: Okay, so in those early days--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was James Egert Allen, E-G-E-R-T, James Agert Allen.
Speaker 1: E-G-E-R-T?
Speaker 2: E-G-E-R-T, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He used to bring Carter Woodson over to our meetings.
Speaker 1: James Egert Allen, all right.  Okay, so this is a, yeah, this is almost, this is a post-War version of the Harlem History Club in some ways, I guess, you know?
Speaker 2: Yes, I can't remember, but I would not be at all surprised if we had Langston Hughes and people like that because it was quite popular.  I became president of it at one point.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember Jay Rodgers?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, yes, Jay Rodgers and what's his name?  His brother was the, his brother was a minister.  He had a big, big plot down there in Virginia.  In fact, when you go East out of Virginia, you see his land down in that area.  I think he eventually bought the site of Jamestown, I believe.  I can't think of his name offhand.  It'll come back to me.  But this man had a, had a--he had a book shop in Harlem.  And he had been one of the early black film producers.
Speaker 1: Oh, you're talking about Louis Micheaux?
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah--
Speaker 1: Louis Micheaux, yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, that's right, yes.
Speaker 1: And his--
Speaker 2: His brother was Prophet Micheaux.
Speaker 1: --Lightfoot Henry--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Elder Lightfoot Henry Micheaux.
Speaker 1: That's right (laughter).
Speaker 2: And I often wondered, my friends up in North Carolina, H. M. Micheaux is related to them.  H. M. Micheaux, Jr. is still alive, his father.
Speaker 1: And so they're related to Oscar Micheaux, the filmmaker too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: Oscar, they, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: That was Oscar I was trying to think of.
Speaker 1: Right, I know they--I've heard stories about him showing his films in certain bars in Harlem.  He would bring his equipment and set it up and then show it, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: William Graves, the filmmaker--
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew Bill Graves, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now, Bill Graves is from Barbados, (unclear) 'cause I met him down there and some other guys, Irving Burgie, who wrote the anthem for Barbados is also from Barbados.  I hired him up at Camp Minisink, got him introduced to Harry Fink--Harry Belafonte, and his income floored from $5,000 a year to about $50,000 (laughter).  But, you know, a goodly number of the top people came out to see what was going on and to hear some of the stories.
Speaker 1: So this is the Society for the Study of Negro History--
Speaker 2: Negro History, yeah, we called it SS and H.
Story_ID: 33938
Speaker 1: That's in Harlem, and so at the same time, now, had you started going to--
Speaker 2: City College.
Speaker 1: --City College on the--
Speaker 2: Yes, I went there, but I didn't complete anything.  I dropped out.  I found that I needed to get back to, to get some Regent's credit.  So I went to what's called Greater Harlem--no, it was through the Harlem Evening High School.  And that got my Regents' credits.  At the same time that I had become active with what's called the Greater Harlem Christian Youth Council, which was based out of Abyssinia Church [sic, Abyssinian Baptist Church].  And that led to becoming a Scout Master up there and getting to know Adam Powell.
Speaker 1: Greater Harlem--
Speaker 2: Christian Youth Council.
Speaker 1: Christian Youth Council, okay.
Speaker 2: We were doing some surveys, doing some cooperative studies, studies of cooperative--of sales in Harlem and so forth.  A lady whose name was Florence Rice became head of the consumer movement up in Harlem, Florence E. Rice.
Speaker 1: So that's--
Speaker 2: This was before the consumer movement became widely popular.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they would complain, you know, handle complaints about certain goods or stores or--
Speaker 2: Yes, keep in mind that this was barely more than 10 years when Adam Clayton Powell was picketing Woolworth and other five and 10 cents stores in Harlem, trying to get black women hired as clerks.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Now, there was, I'd forgotten.  There was a riot in New York in 1943--
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-three [1943], yes.
Speaker 1: --about those issues.
Speaker 2: Yes, as a matter of fact, I was laughing over at--the other day, I think.  One of the Chinese man had in his store "Me Colored too".
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, (unclear).  But, yeah, it was still a lot of things being changed, and all of the stores were owned by non-residents of Harlem.  The only thing that was prominent, of course, was the Apollo Theater.  And even then, that was owned by, I'm trying to think if it was Lewis Bloomstein--no, Bloomstein owned the department store, and another fellow, Frank something, he owned the Harlem Theater--Apollo Theater.  I became friendly to them when we set up the first integrated Rotary Club in Harlem.  And 'cause the, and they joined it, being from--it was actually on the West side in the International House.
Story_ID: 33939
Speaker 1: Now, how was that set up, the first integrated Rotary Club (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, at first there was only the Rotary Club of New York.  And it had about 5,000 members.  So obviously, there was very little interchange, and it didn't really mean very much.  And one had to go downtown to a huge place for the meetings and what have you.  And finally, they allowed us to have one called the Upper Manhattan Rotary Club.  It met over at the International House, right next to Riverside Church, my church, by the way.  And that's when I got to meet many of the leading figures out of Harlem, Frank Bloomstein and some others who were well known up there.  The Harlem--the one who owned Frank's Restaurant and even the banker.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, what was the--now, you were going into, moving into finance at some points, right?  In--
Speaker 2: In 1952, I finished high--finished NYU [New York University] with a degree in banking and finance.
Speaker 1: Now, why did you decide to go into banking and finance?  Was it these meetings at the Rotary Club and the Harlem--
Speaker 2: Well, it led into it because of this.  When I was in Guadalcanal, I watched the formation of the United Nations, and I began to read about Ralph Bunche at that time, who was head of, who was executive secretary of the Anglo Caribbean Commission.  And that began to get me an interest in going into what would be called at that point, the diplomatic and counselor service of the U.S. government, the State Department.  I dearly wanted to get into that after seeing what they were doing at the United Nations.  As a matter of face, when I graduated, I used to--when I was discharged, I would go out to Lake Success [New York] to watch them meeting.  We were in tents at that time.  And later Ralph Bunche began to show up at my church at times.  And finally, I became rather prominent up at Riverside Church, and needless to say the Robert--the Rockefeller family was still very prominent in the life of the church.  And there was John D. Rockefeller who amassed a land--junior, that is, who amassed a land and gave it to the United Nations to set up the United Nations, Center, on the East side of Manhattan.  Nelson's children, no, his son, Steven, was teaching at the church at the time.  So my children went, were taught by him.  But I was, I began to get a strong feeling, but when I returned to the States from military, the State Department began recruiting, but a stipulation was that you had to be an officer in World War II.  And by federal regulations, I could not become an officer, but this is before you, before we realized that you could protest and so forth.  And some other things happened that I wanted to become a member of the State Department, but something always came up that knocked me out of the picture.  And finally, when they began to attack the State Department and it became sort of defenseless (unclear)--
Story_ID: 33940
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so tell us about your involvement with the bank.  Now, what's the name of the bank and what year is this?
Speaker 2: Carver Federal Savings--
Speaker 1: Carver Federal--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and Loan Association.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had--
Speaker 1: And what year is this?
Speaker 2: Well, it was founded in 1947.  I joined in 1955.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is after NYU [New York University], after you went to NYU?
Speaker 2: I joined in 1955.  I graduated from NYU in 1952.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Before we get into Carver, just in terms of NYU, were there any significant professors or teachers there or any incidents that really opened your eyes about banking and--
Speaker 2: Yes, I mentioned, some of the books that I had mentioned.  I had talked about my exposure to books.  One was a book called 'Give Yourself Background' by F. Frasier Bond, 'Give Yourself Background'.  That, I still have a copy of that book, by the way.  It was first published in 1939 and next in 1942.  But I--
Speaker 1: Now, what's the gist of this?
Speaker 2: I've considered it such a valuable book.  There was another one too, of course, called 'Getting the Most Out of Life' published by 'Readers Digest'.  I still have both of those books, by the way.  Anyway, I was so impressed by it that once I enrolled at NYU, I was at a banquet after my second year, and someone pointed out that there was Professor Bond on the dais, and I got up out of my seat and walked right on up to the dais--this is a big, huge ballroom, by the way, went right on up, introduced myself, thanked him for his book, shook his hand (laughter), and went back to my seat.  Now, as I think back, it took some temerity to go barging right on up to the dais when all these high dignitaries are sitting up there, you know.  There was the dignitaries on one level and the others on the lower level, but to me, it didn't matter because one of the things that I remembered so much from some of these books was, you won't be snubbed, "take the bold approach".  As I say, 'Give Yourself Background'.  When I went to NYU, although I was majoring in banking and finance, I had decided I wanted to get into some kind diplomacy.  I really wanted to study Russian, but the school didn't offer Russian as a course.  It did offer international banking and foreign exchange, not as a degree program, but as one of the courses.  I studied, and I studied every law course they gave and took things like Ethics, Psychology and, of course, I joined the Glee Club which took me some other places like Cornell [University] where I roomed with Paul Robeson, and my music teacher and the High School of Commerce had already introduced us to a great deal about Paul Robeson.
Speaker 1: About what year is this when you, when this takes place?
Speaker 2: Well, this is about 1948.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is much earlier than--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I'm, yeah, I'm--by 1948, I'm at NYU.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I was really impressed by that book, and it's one of the books that I've always remained--now, J.P. McEvoy wrote a number of essays and the other thing for 'Readers Digest'.  And that, his essay has really influenced me so that--
Speaker 1: J.P. McEvoy?
Speaker 2: J.P. McEvoy.  He worked for 'Readers Digest' at the time.  As I say, I was quite a reader and I followed him.
Story_ID: 33941
Speaker 1: Well, I need to now run back, a little bit further back to Paul Robeson.  What was your impression of Paul Robeson, 1948?  I think he was, wasn't he under some pressure--
Speaker 2: Yes, I think the last--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --by the U.S. government.  I know they--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --think the last time I saw him might have been in 1948 when he sang at Lewisohn Stadium, and he was, he then, of course, reiterated his stubbornness.  He was not about to be, he was not about to give up or bow before the U.S. government.  But I knew of his background in history because this teacher had introduced me to Paul Robeson's life when I was in high school before going into the military.  And then having worked over at his brother's house--I think I--his brother's church.  I think I saw him once or twice before I, before he really began to fade.  And in 1947 I roomed with his son up at Cornell [University], Paul Robeson, Jr.
Speaker 1: At a conference or something you were--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a conference, but we--and we were, you know, staying with different students, in students dorms or whatever, and I remember he was, he and another fellow, Jack Mycoff (ph.), from Pennsylvania, I think, shared a place, and so--a house.  And so I had a room over there.  That was my first year with NYU [New York University].  I was beginning to be exposed to a lot of things, including--I think it was about that time, I was beginning to get involved to some extent with Republican politics and Democratic politics.  But because the Republican place was pretty much empty--and I learned why after I met the leader of the group (laughter) up there.  He had little or no interest.  It was just a sort of going through the motions for him.  But by that time, at Riverside, Nelson Rockefeller, of course, and the family were members.  And I got to know him and knew of what they were doing there.  In fact, even later on I was able to entertain Jay Rockefeller down in Barbados.
Speaker 1: So this is, you're in the tall grass here.  These are people that were a lot--I mean Nelson Rockefeller was one of the richest men in America in those days.
Story_ID: 33942
Speaker 1: Yes, well, I, interestingly, I began to run into a large number of rich people.  I just showed my wife an invitation a while ago, not a--no, it's an announcement of a, old friend's wedding.  It's about like this, and it's in gold and it's in Spenserian script.  And I, there's a picture of himself and his wife.  The postage on it was $1.39 to send it out (laughter), but I, and I remember when his father died, his father left $100 million to his four children.  But in addition, he already, he was already quite wealthy because he gave me a book called 'Our Crowd' which is a story of the coalescence of the famous, all of the famous investment houses that you see now are part of "crowd" that he refers to, Lehman Brothers, Lowell Brothers, all kinds of names in high finance and how they spread out from the states into Europe, even during the Civil War.  They had to sell bonds over there in Europe.  The federal government was literally broke by the end of the second year of the war, and it was about, well, be written off by the Europeans countries--ophs, I'm getting a little carried away.  But this fellow's name was John Loeb, and he and I served as directors of the Council of American Ambassadors for a number of years.  But I was asking my wife, Vernell [Britton], if she had any idea what the cost of one of these invitations would be.  I would have to assume that they would run somewhere between $15.00 and $25.00 a piece, and I guess he must have sent out about, maybe about a thousand or 2,000 (laughter).  I think, I think financially so, when I see that, I just automatically, my mind goes up into the stratosphere in terms of dollars.  But John Loeb, Jr. was already wealthy.  He owned wine places, plus stocks and all that kind of business.  And he always took a special interest in me.  Again, I go back to it.  He has a townhouse on East 61st Street, plus a big estate up in Westchester County, well, North of New York City.  But, and he always looked out for me.
Story_ID: 33943
Speaker 1: He wanted me to join the Sons of the Revolution, and he wanted to pay my fees and all that kind of business.
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: This is John A. Loeb, Jr.--John L. Loeb, Jr.
Speaker 2: Right.  He wanted you to join the Sons of the Revolution?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Are they similar to the Daughters of the American Revolution?
Speaker 1: They predate them.
Speaker 2: Okay, so do you have to be a direct descendant of a--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  And--
Speaker 2: --Revolutionary War--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --he asked me to please look in my background and see if I could come up with any relatives that might qualify me for it.  And would you believe that I settled on the Hammond family because I got to know some other people when I was doing some work down in Augusta, consulting things, and it turned out the one who was at Merrill Lynch handling my portfolio was also a part of that Hammond family.  And he quickly said, well, you know, we're relatives (laughter).  But I got to thinking about it, and I said, but it also qualify me as the Sons of the Confederacy, (laughter) and I wasn't interested in it. But I was grateful to John because he would have done anything for me.  He became, he was Ambassador to Denmark at one point, by the way.  And we used to talk about the WASP--he was Jewish, of course.  In fact, that's an interesting story.  Some people in this country sometimes say it with disparagement that Jews have got all the money and all that business.  Well, Christians abdicated totally.  It was against the law in some places and certainly against a religion to charge people interest.  But as we went from a barter economy to an amount-based economy, the people who had the experience were the ones who were the leaders.  For example, these fellows, when they could not sell bonds in the United States, went to France and to other parts of Europe to sell paper, paper, based on promises.  Can you imagine that--it doesn't sound like much now.  But keep in mind that heretofore, where you talked about goods, suddenly, you were selling someone "paper" with a promise which sounds crazy.  But they became experts at it, and that's how many of them, many of the larger financial houses were predominantly started by people of Jewish background.  And this gentleman came out of that family.
Speaker 2: John Loeb, Jr.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 33944
Speaker 1: So you're meeting all these movers and shakers here.  And I wanted to ask you what you thought of Paul Robeson?  He's just the opposite, I guess, in some ways.  He's a Socialist at this point, right?  Or maybe even a--
Speaker 2: Well, Paul Robeson was an Internationalist.  One of his great songs, great albums had songs of labor from different countries like Chile from China, "The Vulgar Boatman" from Soviet Union, German songs and whatever.  And Paul himself was, had the highest marks at Columbia [University] than anybody else for a long time.  In addition, he had graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Rutgers [University].  He also in Columbia, became a distinguished graduate with his law degree, and because of--well, by this time, he became prominent in music.  So although the legal profession would not have received him, at the same time, he was able to use his musical background to knock down all kind of doors.  And I'm sure that having participated in so many things that he resented being treated differently, you know, in this country as opposed to say, Russia or in Europe and all parts of Europe.  His son [Paul Robeson, Jr.], I think Paul, himself, studied Russian, but certainly, Pauli--that's what we used to call him, Pauli, he studied, he was a master of Russian and other languages over there.  And, in fact, he married a lady, a Jewish lady, and they lived at 129th Street.  I used to visit them.  I haven't seen him in recent years.  He lives in Brooklyn now.  He became an engineer, but he never achieved the prominence of his father, of course.  And his mother was the daughter of one of the leaders in the South Carolina.  I think her father was one of the, was a lieutenant governor or something like that over there.
Speaker 1: Eslanda, I mean--
Speaker 2: Eslanda Goud Robinson--Robeson.  Yeah, she had quite a historical background.
Speaker 1: There's a new book about her, just came out.
Speaker 2: Yes, just came out.  I heard about it, yes.
Speaker 1: And one of the other people (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And Paul, Jr. has written a couple of books.  Sadly, I can say I haven't gotten a hold of them, but he has written a number of books.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 33945
Speaker 1: But all of these were coming out, and I always say, much of it I attributed to my exposure to Professor Bond's book 'Give Yourself Background'.  I would touch on something quickly, and then we have to go back, I'm sure.  But just being introduced to say, Queen Elizabeth, at a time when she was just supposed to just shake hands and keep going.
Speaker 2: So you were introduced to Queen Elizabeth too?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Now, how did that happen?  I mean is that during this period or are we jumping ahead?
Speaker 1: No, that's when I was Ambassador.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, we're not gonna go over there right now--
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: --but we'll go there in a minute.
Speaker 1: But during that same period, I met Richard Nixon.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is during the late '40's [1940s] or early '50's [1950s]?
Speaker 1: Early '50's [1950s], yeah.  And he came up to Harlem to receive a Human Relations award, but typically, he had to visit Harlem, what do you call it, Carver Federal Savings.  And I met him over there.
Speaker 2: Well, let's you get you at Carver Federal Savings.  Now, you came to Carver--
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 1: And I was there until 1964.  And by the way, some of the men who founded that bank were very distinguished men too.
Speaker 2: Okay, so who founded Carter--I mean Carver Federal Savings?
Speaker 1: Hope Stevens, was one of them.  He's an attorney.
Speaker 2: Now, are these African American people?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Hope Stevens.
Speaker 1: Yes, and William Hudgins.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Bill Hudgins was from Alabama.  He was a leading real estate person at the time.  Dr. Daley, A. George Daley, a graduate of the British medical schools.  He had been a, in partnership with the gentleman who became governor-general, the first governor general of Barbados, Winston Scott.
Speaker 2: Winston Scott.
Speaker 1: Hope Stevens helped to write the constitution for the West Indies Federation.  Walter Miller was a leading real estate person.  In fact, most of them were in real estate.  One person was in insurance.  Mabel Bodwee (ph.) was in insurance, and another one.
Speaker 2: Now, the bank--I don't wanna cut you off, but the bank was founded in you say, 1947?
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-seven [1947], yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, and you started your involved in '55' [1955].
Speaker 1: Yes.  It was then about $1 million at the time.
Speaker 2: Now, what did you, what position did you have when you started with the bank?
Speaker 1: Teller.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: By the way, when I graduated from NYU, there were three of us, black folks, in the field of banking and finance.  One gave it up and went into the Post Office.  Another one retired as Executive Vice President of Bowery Savings Bank, which was the largest savings bank in the country at the time.  He was out of New York, Ted Jackson.  But as I say, at this time I'm speaking of, I met Richard Nixon up there, who had come up there for a program.
Story_ID: 33946
Speaker 1: Now, just kind of give us, before you, just to set this up, now, what was the--nowadays, in 2013, you know, with a black President who's a Democrat, there are probably, I'd say over ninety percent of black people consider themselves Democrats and the Republican Party is different from what it was in 1952 (laughter), you know, in a lot of ways.  So what was the Republican Party like, and what was the, how were black people deployed, I guess, in terms of their party affiliation in 19--in the early '50's [1950s].  The President was Eisenhower.  We had just--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --come off of a long Democratic administration of--
Speaker 2: Well, keep in mind that Eisenhower was the first one to appoint a special assistant in the White House itself.  So that established--
Speaker 1: For Civil Rights, you mean?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His background was simply a Special Assistant to the President.
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: His name will come back to me, I'm sure, but he was from New York, and he ultimately ended up in banking.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because he was there, he was able to do quite a bit of influential things, and at that time black folks were still attuned to the Republican Party, especially in the South.  Now, Roosevelt [President Franklin Roosevelt] had really changed the body politic, 'cause people who say they're Democrats, do not always have Democratic philosophies, if I could assume that there is one.  And people who are Republicans did not always have Republican philosophies.  At that time Republicans were high on social values, and Democrats were not necessarily because so much of the Democratic was in the Southern part.  That was the strength of the group.  When, what's his name, when Strom Thurman ran on the Segregationist ticket in 1948, (laughter) it wasn't really because he was that committed to segregation as it was, it was becoming a popular cause to take up.
Speaker 1: It was demagoguery, I can assume somewhere.
Speaker 2: Well, politics, you might say.  His, by the way, I think everybody knew, in the South, South Carolina area, knew that he had a black daughter at the time.  They also knew what he had been doing for the University--for South Carolina State.  Why?  Because his daughter was a student there.  She was born in the same county I was, about the same time.  But, and, of course, he had been refused a nomination earlier because he was too liberal.  But he ran on a write-in ticket and was elected to state-wide office, which is unusual.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think that I've ever heard of such a thing.
Speaker 2: Well, I have his daughter's book, but also he gave me a copy of his own book called, what was it called?  This is something (unclear) later, when I was going into the politics, when I went into the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  But I go back to it that--you were asking about Paul Robeson.  Until about 1956, I think it was, there was still the Black and Tan Republicans.  As a matter of fact, they had control of the votes out of Mississippi and some other states.  But about that time, things began to change, and I think some of the Southerners who were becoming disenchanted with the Democratic Party over the Civil Rights thing began to see the opportunities for taking over the Republican Party.  And many of them began to give up their Democratic affiliation in order to become Republicans.  And oust, the so-called black and tan Republicans until, well, as I say, so any of the black folks were Republicans because of the tradition of Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt.
Story_ID: 33947
Speaker 1: Okay, so when Nixon came to Harlem, I mean he wasn't, I mean how was he received?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was well received.  This is 1955.  Let's say, they had come into office at 1952.  Eisenhower, himself, you know, had gone from the Presidency of Columbia University to the White House.  And keep in mind that Columbia University was beginning to make itself identified with Harlem.  It is now considered a Harlem university because they have really expanded into Harlem as such.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're really close, I mean, it's really close.  It's right there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, and Eisenhower had been there.  Plus, he had worshiped with the, worshiped at Riverside Church, and I would say because of his general demeanor, he was sort of accepted.  I mean he may have had some ideas that might not have necessarily tuned in with the body politic in Harlem, but, of course, he did a few things that really re-established himself.  For example, the business in Arkansas, sending in the troops, and sending in the troops in some other places tended to kind of keep his stature and Nixon was going on--secondly, Nixon came out of California, and he was a Quaker.  So for some, they didn't see him quite as the deep Southern-type Baptist, you know, especially a Quaker.  In fact, I don't think, I'm not even sure that there was any, there were any Quaker churches in Harlem at the time.  But he was kind of still sort of, you might say neutral.
Speaker 1: So how did you feel about the--now, this is the time you start becoming involved in Republican politics?
Speaker 2: About the late '40's [1940s].  I was more attuned towards Thomas Dewey.  Dewey had been the crusading prosecutor.  He had put a lot of crooks in jail and Republicans were known for their fiscal probity and being a person in banking.  And these were the kind of people whom I looked up to.  As a matter of fact, I was a member, while I was at Riverside this time from 1946 on, I was a member of the Men's Class which had been founded by John D. Rockefeller, Sr.--John D. Rockefeller, Jr.  And the men whom I, who were all in this class, basically, were people in the professions.  I joined it, by the way, to advance my own professional background, and not because I was some died in the wool Baptist or anything like that, but as one of the fellows said later, I'm an opportunist (laughter).  And I, that's why I wanted to be with them.  When I elected a deacon, which was in 1964, '66' [1966] or something--no, it was 1963, I think it was, I was, my opponent in the election had just retired as the solicitor general of the United States and a long-time member, F--his name was Andrews, I think it was.  He, as I said, he had been the Solicitor General of the United States, a person of some importance.  But I defeated him, and I would think it's due largely to my affiliation with the Men's Class.  But I had been doing a lot of other things as well in the church.  So I was well known.
Story_ID: 33948
Speaker 1: Okay, so at the bank, at Carver Bank, you started as a teller and how long did you serve as a teller before you moved up?
Speaker 2: Maybe about a month or so.  Then I became assistant mortgage officer and the mortgage officer.  But I became also known as pretty much the church officer because I began to pretty much on my own, voluntary thing to go to the churches, encourage them to put their money over there.  Many of the churches wanted to get loans.  They could not get loans, housing loans and other kind of loans in other places.  And I began to show them the advantages of putting their money together and being able to get a stronger seat at the table because they were holders of--they were in charge of monies in the bank and not just people who walk, come up to the window or something.  And I went from church to church doing that.  And it began to get me very popular.  By the way, I became sort of like the secretary to the administrative and investment committee.  Our principal investments were mortgages, and since I was the mortgage officer, I met with them and what have you.  And it got me quite popular with them 'cause I was bringing in much of the money.  This had created some problems with the president because he had a godson whom he was grooming to be his successor.  And my prominence was beginning to create problems for him.  I might also say it was something else at that time.  I found that in 1955, right after I joined, that the bank was offering free education, but no one was taking it.  But I then enrolled in it.  At the end of the first year, I completed their two-year diploma.  At the end of the second year, I completed the five-year diploma and by the end of the third year, I'd completed a 10-year diploma.
Speaker 1: And where were the--
Speaker 2: At Carver Federal Savings.  It's called the American Savings and Loan Institute.  I put it down on the form that he gave me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But in, as I say, in three years, I had completed 10 years of work.  And I was still the Executive Secretary to the Administrative and Investment Committee, but I worked out a deal with the persons in charge of the institute that I would study and learn as much as I could.  And if I appeared late, that hopefully, they would not penalize me for being late because I was doing the very things that they were teaching.  And they said, well, as long as you show up before I end the class, I'm gonna mark you present.  And I won't mark you present, based on what time you arrived, but the fact that you were there, period.  And so, sometimes I would get awfully tied up.  And I had to scuffle very fast to get downtown to Wall Street from 125th Street.
Story_ID: 33949
Speaker 1: All right, so, okay, so I was asking you off camera about Percy Sutton, and his relationship to Carver Bank, and so what--
Speaker 2: Percy was a, an accountholder.  And he did a lot of business with the bank as a lawyer for people who were buying or selling houses.  And my cousin was his secretary.  In fact, she became his sort of Executive Secretary throughout his time in politics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sylvia Griffith was her name.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanna write that down.  Okay, now, all right.  So we're in the middle '50's [1950s] here.  So what else happened in the '50's [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think one of the things was the, my relationship with the church, Riverside Church, which was beginning to really bud and by the '60's [1960s], it was really becoming very prominent.  But to the extent that so many people of importance were over there at Riverside, and my name beginning to surface in so many things, meant that I was getting a lot of attention.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I don't know where this fits in this outline, but now, you knew Horace Dawson fairly well--
Speaker 2: Horace really helped me a lot.
Speaker 1: Now, did he, did you meet him before you got involved in diplomacy and that sort of thing or did he help you get involved in it or--
Speaker 2: Horace, Horace was a major influence in that because he came past the bank, came past the HUD [Housing and Urban Development] one day with a fellow named Joseph Battle.  Joe was--
Speaker 1: Now, are you working for HUD at this point?
Speaker 2: I was working at HUD.  Yeah, that was in 1971.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, let's, okay, that's too far ahead.  We don't wanna go there yet.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the '60's [1960s] is where you're still coming through.
Speaker 1: We're still in the '50's [1950s] here.  We're trying to stay on the '50's [1950s].  You're at the bank, and so just give us some highlights of some of the things you did at Carver Bank.
Speaker 2: As I say, basically, mine was raising, was increasing deposits and also to administer the mortgages and to make sure the people were paying and what have you.  I remember one day, we must have had about 2,000 mortgages at the time.  And I could--I remember coming in this meeting, and I told them that none of our people were delinquent.  There were no late charges, and everybody was up to date.  These days, you could hardly say that for any kind of lending institution.
Story_ID: 33950
Speaker 1: But all of our people were right on time, and it's almost 2,000 mortgages.  Yeah, that must have been the highlight of all, but as I say, I had so many things.  I was also the appraiser for the bank along with another gentleman who was working, had worked for the FHA [Federal Housing Administration].  One day the president came into the bank, to the meeting.  As I say, we were not on the best of terms because (laughter) he saw me as something, as a sort of a threat.  Anyway--
Speaker 2: What was the president's name?
Speaker 1: Joseph E. Davis.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Joe said, Mr. Davis said that, I just want to give you folks an idea of how two professionals operate.  He said, Mr. Britton went out and made his appraisal and turned it in to me.  He said, and three days later, Lou Nielsen did his appraisal and turned it into me--now, Lou was white, by the way.  And he was about twice my age.  He said, they have the same measurements, and they have the same cost factors.  There was a difference of about $25.00 between their final appraisals.  And he said, it just goes to show how competent these men are.  He said, there's no wide disparity between their two figures or even their measurements or anything like that.  So when I saw Lou Nielsen later, I said, Lou, I understand that we were together on everything except a difference of about $25.00.  And he said, oh, yeah.  And I said, Lou, where'd you go wrong (laughter)?  He said, you young whippersnapper.  He said, your problem is you don't know enough about the business.  And I said, well, Lou, I think your problem is you know too much about the business (laughter).  But we shook hands on it (laughter), said any time you can get that close, $25.00, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But my job was to do appraisals, and I would have to go out in the afternoon after leaving, go out to inspect the buildings, make up all of my papers and what have you, take pictures and get it back to them by Thursday when we met.  But also the same day as my classes, and as soon as I could get out of there, I would dash down to Wall Street to my classes.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, now, all right.  So you were at, what's the highest position you reached at Carver?
Speaker 1: Mortgage loan officer--
Speaker 2: Mortgage loan officer.
Speaker 1: --and head of the mortgage loan department.  And I eventually left in 1964.
Story_ID: 33951
Speaker 1: Okay, is this when you went to HUD?
Speaker 2: No, I went to American Baptist Tone Mission Society.  The American Baptist Convention.
Speaker 1: So you went to the American Baptist Convention?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, the American Baptist Convention is probably a large organization, I would guess?
Speaker 2: It was at that point one of the significant ones.  It was not as large as the Southern Baptist Convention.  And I think it was larger than the National Baptist Convention.  You know, it's something, there was something like thirty-nine different Baptist groups at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, I wondered if it was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Missionary Baptist, Swedish Baptist, German Baptist, National Baptist USA, National Baptist of America and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how did this position--now, what position did you take at American Baptist Convention, and--
Speaker 2: Manager of Real Estate and Insurance.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was a, sort of a confluence of events.  My, the president of my bank was quite a task master.  When it was time for the March on Washington, he did not want any of us to take any time off.  When Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy] was assassinated, and they were holding the funeral, we had to come in to work.  Well, my daughter was born on about the same day as Kennedy's daughter, and--was it his daughter or son?  Maybe it was his son--no, no, no, it was his daughter, Caroline.  They were born about the same day in the same hospital on the same floor.  So coming--going up on the elevator, he and I were on the elevator, and you know, kind of nodded to each other, and so forth.  But I had sort of a feeling of closeness to him over and above the election, you know.  And so when I was called--I had to come in to work on the day of his funeral, I just couldn't take it.  And I realized that banking was not for me.  Originally, I thought it was 9:00 to 3:00 (laughter), but anyway, I then came to the point, we had a few words, and I said, well, I'll resign today.  I left.  But because of my connections over at Riverside Church, one of the men who was on the board of Deacons with me and who always spoke with me was a man who had been one of the developers of the Pan AM building in New York.  He was one of the top-flight consultants in the field of real estate and was also on the board of the American Baptist Convention.  And he wanted me to come on, he wanted me to come on the board of the American Baptist Convention.  And I said, now, I want you to be aware of something.  I'm leaving the bank, so since I'm leaving, I wouldn't want you to present me as being a banker when I'm really not.  So he said, well, where are you gonna work?  And I said, well, I don't know.  I haven't worked out anything yet.  So he said, well, our man in charge of our real estate is retiring, so if you don't mind, I'd like to consider you as being in the Treasurer's office to take over his position.  He was located right there in what's called the Interchurch Center, the very large building right next to my church.  Needless to say, I ended up taking it, and we then set up some housing corporations and the corporation became very successful.  They're the largest in the country, and I got a lot of public exposure out of being manager of this socially-oriented housing.  In fact, one of my friends who was a Harvard [University] and a partner at one of the largest law firms in New York City was always amazed.  He said--we were trying to get something going with the mayor of Malden, Massachusetts.  And he absolutely refused us.  He wouldn't even talk to us.  He wanted to have the thing all by himself.  And we asked you to go up to talk with him, and when you came back, he was eating out of your hand.  We got everything we wanted, and we never could understand what in the world did you do, he said, but somehow, all of the obstacles that we had in front of us just evaporated.  And so I guess that was sort of the first recommendation of me in diplomacy or something.  But I got to know this gentleman quite well and became good, friendly with him before he died.
Story_ID: 33952
Speaker 1: But we became the largest operator of nonprofit housing in the country.  I began to go to Europe to study the English system, which had started in the 1850s, and then another meeting down in Spain, what was called the International Housing and Planning Commission, planning organization.  And this then led into my, into my being recognized by HUD.
Speaker 2: Okay, and, so what year did you join the American Baptist Convention and--
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 2: Okay, 1964, and so what year were you recognized by HUD?
Speaker 1: It must have been about 1969, after the Nixon administration came in. George Romney wanted to set up some new programs in HUD, and he also wanted to get new structures and new types of structures.  So he had a group of us to come in to evaluate some of them.  And for some reason, I was chosen as the spokesperson for the group, and I had to present this--this is by the assistant secretary, to present it to George Romney, the Secretary of Housing.  And I made my presentation, and the assistant secretary then began to invite me to join the staff down there.  But I said, no, I didn't want any part of government.  And he continued for about two years, it was almost two years, and as it happened, by this time, there was a re-organization within the organization.  And a person was being put in my, in charge of my total unit that I had some misgivings about.  I, I don't know what it was, but I didn't think that we could work together too well.  It turned out later on, he was convicted as a pedophile and went to prison.  He was a minister, by the way.  But the fellow, Harry Finger, the assistant secretary at HUD had been after me to come down.  And so we went down, I went down for another conference.  It was called "The Tipping Point Conference", how do you get people to work together in communities without it becoming all black or something like that.  And he began to praise the gentleman who was in charge, who had developed Columbia, Maryland.  His name will come back to me.  I don't know when.  But this gentleman was worth about $7 billion.  And he was praising this man to high heavens, and when he asked him to speak, he said, "Hold it".  He said, I would love to take the credit, but the man who deserves all the credit for making me look good is sitting over there.  That's Ted Britton.  And he said, if you wanna know how to make these communities work, you wanna hear Ted Britton, not me.  Well, when he pointed that $7 billion finger (laughter) at me, it meant something.  And Larry then asked me to come down as his deputy.  That's when I joined a few months later.
Story_ID: 33953
Speaker 1: And as I say, at one point, Joseph--Professor Battle of Duke University came to invite me to come down to speak at Duke University.  And he had Horace Dawson with him.  And, in the course of it, he asked me if I could come, and I told him, no, I'd be in Europe at the time.  And so Horace asked how long would I be over there.  And so I said, probably a few days or so, but I'm open.  Anyway, he asked if I could do some speaking for the U.S. Information Agency.  And I agreed.  Well, as it happened, someone had preceded me and left a very bad rapport.  But when I arrived over there, I assured them immediately that I was there to make them look good.  I was gonna be there for a few days, but they were there for years.  So, and so I told them to use me in any way they saw fit to make their programs look good, whether it meant midnight or early in the morning or what have you.  This is something they hadn't heard before.  But then each post makes a report to headquarters and the State Department.  And by the way, those same reports go over to the White House because they, you know, they use 'em for different things.  And so my, my speaking and programs began to be recognized.  It went from Europe to other parts of Africa, then out as far as Bangladesh.  And at one point then, I think it was Stan Scott who was in the White House.  He had succeeded Bob Brown as special assistant to Nixon, asked if I'd be interested in one of the ambassadorial posts.  And I said, yes.  Now, by the way, Simeon Booker had been publicizing everything I did in government.
Speaker 2: In "JET" [Magazine]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was constantly in "JET".  And so I said, yes, and Stan then turned me over to one of the fellows in personnel who I continued to work with, and it got right down to the crux of it, that I then had to get political support.  Well, I was nobody's politician.  And I certainly wasn't wealthy.  As a matter of fact, I laugh because Horace told me later on that they thought that--he and his colleagues thought that I had about as much chance as a snowball in hell of becoming an ambassador.  So I have to do a speech on, later on, and I'm gonna tell the folks that I'm one of the few snowballs that came through hell without melting (laughter).  But I told him that I would call on Senator [Strom] Thurman.  And when I called Senator Thurman, he sent a note to President [Richard] Nixon that same afternoon.  And at that time, you know, President Nixon was thriving only because of the support of Henry Kissinger and Strom Thurman.  So Nixon said immediately, yes, he gets it.  He resigned, but then my friends had broken--had taken Gerry Ford around to introduce him to the Executive Branch.  And when he found that I was there, man, well, that made a difference.
Speaker 2: Now, I don't wanna speed through this too fast, but Nixon, you come into the, to HUD in--
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-one [1971].
Speaker 2: And the ambassadorship is--
Speaker 1: January of '71' [1971].
Speaker 2: --it's in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: This goes up to 1974 when I was nominated.
Speaker 2: Okay, nominated for ambassador in '74' [1974].  That's just as he resigns--he's resigning, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he resigned in '73' [1973], I think, '73' [1973]?  '74' [1974], I guess, '73' [1973], '73' [1973].
Story_ID: 33954
Speaker 1: And I didn't wanna skip over '68' [1968], and, you know, '68' [1968] was significant because of the assassination of Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and--
Speaker 2: Yes, that was an interesting thing too because Nelson Rockefeller was the speaker that evening, okay.  And his son and I had been in the Young Republican Club in New York, Rodman Rockefeller, his oldest son.  I knew that Rodman was expecting.  Okay, this is when Nelson was still married to Mrs. Clark, his first wife.  She was a very reserved person, unlike the later one, Happy.
Speaker 1: Happy Rockefeller, right.
Speaker 2: She was a very reserved person, and so she did not give, she did not get carried away with all of this politicking and shaking hands.  She didn't, she was sort of more or less, sort of an aristocrat.  When I came up, I already knew, had met the governor before.  And so when I came up, I--and he was about to start talking.  I said, "Hold it, has the baby arrived yet?"  And he said, just this afternoon.  And he turned to his wife, and he said, he knows about Rodman, he knows about the baby.  When, so she took me over and asked me to stand with her while the people were coming through the line.  So it looked funny that here, of all people, I'm standing up there with Mrs. Rockefeller, and talking with her while the Governor is shaking hands and he would introduce her periodically and so forth.  And she'd break away, but as soon as she broke away, she would then start talking with me again.  So it was kind of funny, but she was so happy that I knew Rodman.  This was their first grandchild, I think it was, the only grandchild.  And so she was so happy over it.
Speaker 1: Okay, we have to pause here, I think-- (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  No, (off-camera discussion).
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so go ahead.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this was special that she should suddenly, you know--of course, a lot of people looked up and said, well, (unclear) what's he doing up there?  But eventually, when they settled down, I went back to my seat.  And I knew the people who were managing the kitchen quite well.  And so at one point in the program, the fellow in charge of the kitchen--they can come and see everything.  He came around there, he asked me if I could, you know, he signaled me to come out.  So I went in the kitchen, and the radio was on.  And they were announcing that Dr. King had been shot.  And then they suddenly broke and announced that he was dead.  So I was, I guess I was the first one to know it out of that group.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But I had known him because he had spoken so much at Riverside [Church].  I was on the Board of Ushers and the Board of Deacons.  In fact, because I was so well known, I might have been the most prominent black person in the total congregation.  I was also chairman of one of the five religious commissions of the church.
Story_ID: 33955
Speaker 1: Now, what did you--what was your reaction to Dr. King's speech on the Vietnam War?  He had just made that speech, I think, earlier in '68' [1968] before he was assassinated, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That winter.
Speaker 2: This same lawyer that I spoke of, had me and my wife up for a reception up at his house up in Scarsdale.  I guess you've heard about Scarsdale [New York].  Anyway, they were talking about the fall of Western man, if the Viet Cong won.  And I contested that.  I said, I can't imagine that Western man is so weak that the fall of this particular place will make a difference.  And I had studied about the DNBN-4 because I was going to France.  Let's see, yeah, I'd already--I had already--let me see, had I already gone?  Yeah, I had already made a trip to Europe.  In fact, this might have been the second trip.  But I argued with them, and they--oh, these guys, they couldn't, they couldn't possibly understand how in the world I could say that it was no threat to us.  One became federal judge a month later, but these men were very wealthy, very wealthy.  In fact, the one who was hosting it, when he found that I was a Montfort Point Marine, he sat down and wrote a check for $5,000 as a contribution to building the monument, yeah, just like that without even telling me.  And, of course, he's, we keep in close touch, although he's quite ill now.  But I was not bothered by the, by the specter of the Viet Cong winning.  As a matter of fact, I was a little bit more sympathetic to them because we were the interlopers.  We were in Vietnam.  It was not that they were over here in America trying to (unclear).  So I was not bothered by the thought that Martin [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was stepping off ground.  At the time, we were trying to, we had a pulpit committee, seeking a new minister.  I wanted him to become the minister of Riverside Church.  And I talked with him, oh, a number of times on a Sunday morning.  And his answer was that he, he just could not, he just could not in good conscious begin talking about it, taking a new pulpit at a time when he was promoting the Poor People's campaign.  He said it would not have been fair to be doing, promoting his own.
Speaker 1: I think, Andrew Young, I heard him on television last week say that that was Dr. King's dream job--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --to become the pastor of Riverside.
Speaker 2: Well, if you pull up the, pull up the King Center, and enter my name, you'll find a letter that I'd written to Dr. King, that I never knew was public.  It's a rather lengthy letter, and lucky I did not take any liberties of speech or language or anything like that.  But it was a very serious and sensitive letter.  And I talked about how we had talked and how I was very much interested in his coming up there and what have you.  And I was really surprised.  I was just on the King Center one day, and this letter popped up.  I said, I never would have believed (unclear).  But anyway, he--
Speaker 1: So the letter just responds to the conversation and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was sort of--
Speaker 1: Were you encouraging him to take the--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --yeah, sort of a reiteration of our conversation, what we had been discussing and so forth.  And--
Speaker 1: Were you encouraging him to take the position or--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --or reconsider?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yes, yes, yes, because I knew him, and I had, in fact, I was with him the Sunday before--well, both Sundays before he was assassinated, I was in, oh, gosh, I didn't think of bringing that picture of the two of us, taken out in California, the Sunday before he was assassinated.  He was in New York the next Sunday night to speak at Wyatt T. Walker's church, and it was actually--it was to install Wyatt T. Walker as pastor over there.  And that was the last time I saw him.  I guess it was the third of, second or third of--no, it might have been the, no, it was three days before he was assassinated.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that'd be the first of April [1968], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 33956
Speaker 1: But I was very much in sync with Martin's [Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.] feelings and so forth, and I had seen him so many times at Riverside Church.  He did enjoy it, and they had more tape--and I was about to say they had more tape on him than anybody else, no, but that was Malcolm X.  And Malcolm, another thing, he lived two blocks from me, and I became their banker.  He was--that's another (laughter) story too.
Speaker 2: Well, that's, it's significant enough to tell, so I mean--
Speaker 1: Malcolm also, his Temple No. 7 in Harlem operated a restaurant.  And I used to eat there every day.  But I got to know--in fact, he introduced me to Elijah Muhammad.  But all of the top functionaries, including Louis XX, who became Louis Farrakhan, and Joseph XX, who was the Fruit of Islam, Henry who was--
Speaker 2: Joseph Gravatt, right.
Speaker 1: Henry, who was the editor of the publication "Muhammad Speaks" and John Ali who was the national secretary.  I knew all of those people.  And--
Speaker 2: John Ali was in finance or something himself.  He was the accountant for the organization, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was the national, yeah.
Speaker 2: The national (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And Joseph XX became a professor in the New York higher education system.  But I knew all of them, and I, I was not, I was not hostile to any of them.  In fact, I was there when James Forman came into the Riverside Church, and I saw what happened after his arrival there, the improvements and the politics and all kinds of things, you know.
Speaker 2: Now, you're talking about James Forman's call for reparations in--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --in 1969 or so, I guess.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969], yes, and how the country responded in so many different areas.  People never associated with him, but I know it because I was there, and I--my job was to kind of keep him, to work out accommodation between himself and the pastor.  The pastor and I had attended high school together.  So, and in--and also at NYU [New York University].  But the pastor elected not to receive him and to cancel the service, which was good.  The upshot was that it attracted more attention than if he had let him come in and talk.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, and the politics, black folks became vice chairs of assemblies, senates, of councils, city councils, commission.  I think it was sort of a token at the time, but they didn't think of the fact that once the leader, the chair left, for one reason or another, then obviously, the vice chair was the logical successor.  But it was in schools, colleges, men became vice deans and deans and what have you, vice presidents.  In business, they started urban markets and special markets and minority markets and those kind of things.  But all over the country, it began to change.  Even Nixon [President Richard M. Nixon] started black capitalism at that point, which within--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --had to fall out because some of the other minorities began to complain.  So he changed it to Minority Business Enterprise.
Story_ID: 33957
Speaker 1: You're talking about the importance of James Forman's entry into Riverside with his manifesto for reparations, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how important that is in retrospect.
Speaker 2: Yes, you know, some people think of it as some bombastic type of thing.  James Forman came in dressed in a long white tunic.  He had a staff, and that was it, sandals.  And he just followed the minister in, fir the choir, then the ministers, and he followed them.  And he stopped in the chancel.  And as soon as the ministers came into their seats, then the pastor, the senior minister, stood up at the lectern and announced that service was cancelled for the day.  And with that, the choir marched out, the pastors, the clergy marched out, leaving James Forman standing there in the chancel all by himself before a stunned congregation.  And they came forward to listen and hear what he had to say, and he made a very simple statement, maybe about five minutes and took a few questions.  And with that, he thanked them and left.  It wasn't, it was nothing explosive or anything about it.  Within months, we had formed at the church what was called a Riverside Fund for Social Justice with a quarter of a million dollars, for things in the community.  Now, some would say, well, James Forman had nothing to do with it (laughter).  Ha, yeah, right.  But then shortly after, we hired an urban affairs minister.  And many of the churches also hired ministers of urban affairs, ministers for outreach, all kind of, what do you call it, euphemisms.  But then that effect was the same, meaning in business, in politics and banking, you name it.  All kind of euphemisms were given.  Even on the boards, they began to have a black person on the board.  In fact, at that time, it was only black and white, I mean Spaniards didn't count, Hispanics didn't count, women didn't count, you know.  It was just, that was the way things were at the time.  But so much happened out of that, I've often asked some of my colleagues, church colleagues how would they -- would they recognize a new prophet if he showed up?  What would he be wearing and all that business?  I would say that people like John the Baptist would have been slaughtered if they tried to get in.
Story_ID: 33958
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, so and you had mentioned at the end of the last session, I mean section, Nix--Richard Nixon's black capitalism initiative.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And I, I raised Arthur Fletcher's name too as the founder--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of Affirmative Action.  All these things were happening around the same time, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Arthur became Assistant Secretary of Labor.  In fact, he then began to set some standards and goals which became the law of the land.  By the way, his son is in housing himself.  The last time I saw him, he was executive director of housing out in, I think Indiana, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay, Black Capitalism, did you have any influence over the direction of Black Capitalism?
Speaker 2: Peripherally.  My work was in research and technology, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology.  It doesn't sound like much now, but it was significant in those days because basically, we were always talking about equal opportunity and some of those things, which is, you know, I'm not knocking them and so forth, but research and technology.  That, you think of a person as sort of a bramen (unclear) in the scientific field.  In addition, most of the guys who staffed that operation came out of the space program.  So a significant number of them were PhDs and things like hydrology and all kind of esoteric types of studies and so forth.  Not only that, with the techniques that they developed in the space field.  Remember, it was just two years after the landing on the moon.  And at that time, they thought that they, the space program might be folding after that.  So many of them had come to HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] to develop new technologies, new programs and so -- and I was in charge of them.  But then I got sidetracked into international research --
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --while at the same time doing -- my expertise was in the field of finance and housing and housing management.  My boss's field was astronautics and aeronautics.  So that's why he felt that I would help him to the greatest extent by being able to balance out his lack of knowledge of housing.
Story_ID: 33959
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is it--I, now, it's about time to talk about Horace Dawson, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Is it about time for him?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: All right, well, tell us about Horace Dawson?  He was one of the first United States, if not -- was he the first United States Ambassador, black ambassador?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no.  The first one was Edward R. Dudley.  Edward, Ed retired as a Supreme Court Justice in New York City.  In fact, he was one of the principal presiding justices.  Ed was appointed in the waning days of the Truman administration in 1948.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or was it 1948?
Speaker 1: And what was he Ambassador of, what country was he Ambassador of?
Speaker 2: Liberia [Africa].
Speaker 1: Of Liberia, okay.
Speaker 2: As 1948 waned, everyone assumed that Truman would lose the election.  So they offered it to Charles Houston who was in charge of legal affairs at NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  He turned it down, and I think the next one was Thurgood Marshall, who turned it down.  And Ed Dudley was the low man on the totem pole.  He took it, but rather than flying over to Liberia, he decided to go by ship, and it took him approximately six weeks or more to get from New York to Liberia, but he went over to England and to France and down to Spain and finally down.  And --
Speaker 1: So, let me just say something.  Let me correct myself, and just for the sake of history here.  And I don't know who was the absolute first, but I know--and we can even go back further to--and I, my mind is slow.  That's why we're doing this.  But we can go back further to Henry Highland Garnett as Ambassador to Liberia in the 1860s and to Frederick Douglas as Ambassador to Haiti.  Was he the first, Douglas?
Speaker 2: Make a note of this.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't until 1893 that the U.S. Congress allowed an American to have the title of Ambassador.
Speaker 1: Oh, so these are pre--
Speaker 2: Eighteen ninety three [1893].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and even then, there were not many after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Previous to that, all Ambassadors were royal ambassadors, and we were not royalty.  But over the 1800s, more and more countries became independent, especially in South America, and it became, each one of these appointed an ambassador, but that ambassador took precedence over any American emissary.  At that time, we had Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary and so forth.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: But not ambassador.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I accept that because I think, yeah, the title was like a, actually minister to Haiti and minister to Liberia--
Speaker 2: That's right, yes.
Speaker 1: --for Douglas and Garnett.
Speaker 2: Yes, and Ed Dudley then finally landed in Liberia and Truman was re-elected.  Okay, and he remained there.  But the former president of Liberia who had been deposed, his name was C.T.O. King, was sent as the ambassador, as the minister to the United States.
Story_ID: 33960
Speaker 1: And in 1950, he complained to the then assistant secretary of state that--I'm trying to remember whether it was Soapy Williams or what.  But he complained to him that he had been head of state and had appointed ambassadors around the world.  And here, now, he was in the demeaning position of serving as minister to the most important country in the world.  And so, he said, well, okay, no, problem.  From this day on, you'll be ambassador.  Well, everything is reciprocal in terms of dealing with nations.  If the minister from Liberia was allowed to become ambassador, then it meant that the reciprocal appointee from the U.S. would also have to be.  And so Ed Dudley got a call from the United States that from that point on, he was to be ambassador.  And he became the very first one to become ambassador.  Clifford Wharton who was a senior diplomat--his son became president of Michigan State [University] and also later, a deputy secretary of state.  He was already minister -- let's, see, he became minister to Romania later on, but it was not the same as Ambassador.  In fact, there were many men who were appointed after Ed Dudley who were not, not only African American, but whites who received the title of minister because we had not raised the level of representation up to that of ambassador.  And by the way, just for a little education, there are ambassadors and there are Ambassadors Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary.  And I put it on my resume that I was plenipotentiary and extraordinary.  The difference is that one can be appointed Ambassador for a special purpose but does not have the ability to sign agreements nor does that person represent the President of the United States, the head of state.  Extraordinary means at the highest level of representation and plenipotentiary is the ability to sign documents, binding the United States.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were an ambassador plenipotentiary?
Speaker 1: Yes, naturally, yeah--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --'cause I represented, I was accredited to Queen Elizabeth who was the head of state of Barbados.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, all right, now, right, so tell us about Horace -- now, Horace Dawson who had been Ambassador, I know to Liberia [Africa] and to, I think (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, no, no, Horace became Ambassador to Botswana [Africa].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was some, let's see, I think this might have been, oh, maybe in the, at the end of the Ford Administration [President Gerald Ford], yeah, 'cause he was Ambassador when I went down to lecture in Botswana in 19--n South Africa in 1982.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we had kept in touch throughout that time because Horace was still over at U.S. Information Agency.
Story_ID: 33961
Speaker 1: Okay, so well, tell us the story about how you got involved with--
Speaker 2: Oh, I was invited to do the speeches.  And, of course, once I went down to the, first, Ethiopia [Africa], then Kenya [Africa], it was successful.
Speaker 1: This was in 1974 or so?
Speaker 2: No, 1972.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I was then invited each time.  They wanted to know what time did I have to give to them and so forth.  So I would do this, and they would arrange speeches for me.  For example, the embassy in London, Sweden, Denmark, and finally out into Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey, not to mention all the way down to South Africa and places down there, and Mexico as well.  But each time I went, there was a favorable report in talking about how well I had done, even in Budapest [Hungary] and what have you.  And that's how it started developing.  I mentioned Senator Thurmond.  At the time, he found that I was doing a lot for South Afri--for South Carolina.  We had established--there was about a 150,000 home without indoor plumbing.  And we worked out a scheme to have an add-on bathroom that was financed by the Department of Agriculture and administered by the Tennessee Valley Authority and some other things being done for South Carolina.  And he wanted to know why.  He asked me to come over to his office, and so I went.  And I told him because there was so much to be done and folks like yourself who had held such high positions had done, had left so much undone.  And (unclear), by this, before that he took me to introduce me to his wife who was just twenty years old, and he was in his sixties.  And his little daughter who was just about two months old, and as I say, he began to tell me all about this.  So he gave me a lot of trinkets.  He said that he had been almost in the last century, and his philosophy was based on that.  But he had to change because his wife and children, child would be in the next century, and he couldn't deliver that to them.  So he gave me even a copy of his book.  It's called 'The Faith We Have Not Kept'.  And I did a, I did a, about a two or three-page critique on it.  And he was so, seemingly gratified that I took the time to cite out -- and then I'm not attacking him, but how I differed with him and how things he may have overlooked.  And he said, you know, you remind me that sometimes we assume that a person doesn't have shoes because he's just lazy and don't buy them, when you find that there are places that will not even sell him a pair of shoes or anything like that.  And he said that he really needed some education.  And he asked me to help him.  We kept in touch from--I should have brought a copy of that picture, a picture of him smiling away, "To my good friend, Ted Britton" and so forth.  But a long letter from him, thanking me for reading his book and commenting on it.  And so, and when it got later on that I needed some political help, although my senators were Senator Buckley and Senator Javits, they were a little bit less than forthcoming.  As someone pointed out to me, well, they didn't do anything to hurt you.  And I said, that's true.  But when I wrote--called Senator Thurmond, he immediately fired off a letter that made it sound as if I was the greatest thing invented since ice cream.  And President Nixon responded immediately.  So as I say, the rest became sort of history.
Story_ID: 33962
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's how you got in, you became Ambassador to--
Speaker 2: Barbados and Grenada.  Now, originally, I was being groomed for Upper Volta and a gentleman who was--I was just looking at his picture last night, was one of the senior leaders of the State Department, had just been nominated to Greece.  And he was all set to go to Greece, but he was called in at the last moment for a session with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and he made a statement about Turkey that infuriated the Greeks.  And they withdrew, what's called the Agramon (ph.).  Before a person's name is sent up or a person is nominated, they discreetly use back channels to find out if the host government would have problems with receiving this person.  And they said, no, no, they welcome him.  But when he made that statement, they withdrew it.  But in the State Department, you must be appointed to a senior post within a certain length of time or you are dropped or you resign or you retire.  They wanted to keep him in because he was such a senior-level person.  So they then sent him to Upper Volta to give him a post.  And with that, then when I came up, they asked me, well, we wanna send you to Barbados.  We hope it's all right 'cause I understand, in fact, you've been hearing a lot of it lately that people who are wealthy who are friends of the President, who, long-time functionaries and what have you and done everything for the President, big contributors.  Those are the ones who get posts like Barbados.  I said, you know, that's people like me (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what was it like?  Now, had you been to Barbados before?
Speaker 2: Never, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I knew so many Barbadians in camping, Camp Minisink, I mentioned earlier, there were many people from the West Indies.  And the people who lived on my block, when I moved on 62nd Street in 1936, were basically from the West Indies, from Barbados, not Jamaica.  They were all from Barbados basically, and so I was right at home.  But in addition, many of the people I worked with in banking were people from Barbados, and when they heard that I was going down, of course, there was a great big roar of applause.  And when I arrived, so many people were in touch with me saying that we heard you were coming.  Our friend, so and so, told us you were coming, and that was it.  Even Dr. Daley who was on my board and was one of my great success--supporters at the bank, had been a partner with the Governor General in a medical practice.  And so, right after I presented my credentials, and we were very serious and sincere, you know, pompous and what have you, he said, all right, come on over here.  Let's drink some rum and talk about, tell me what the hell George is doing these days? (Laughter) Just like that, George Daley.  Well, you know, all of the serious--all of the seriousness, of course, just kind of evaporated.  So we got to be good friends.  And he was the one who introduced Queen Elizabeth to me.  I was the low man on the totem pole among the ambassadors.  I was the newest arrival.  But when she came up and he introduced her, she immediately commented on my name, and I said, well, ma'am, you know, the Mother Country is ubiquitous as you well know (laughter).  And she laughed.
Speaker 1: Britton --(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But then I said, and ma'am, I haven't seen you since 1939.  I always remembered.  And she said, where?  And I said at the World's Fair.  You and your sister were having a wonderful time.  You were so happy and smiling and laughing and their parents were seriously, they were prim and proper.  And she said, yes, she said, my father was very sick at the time.  And she said, and it was the last vacation that we really had together.  And she said, my sister and I, we all talked about it, as the best vacation we had ever had because all of the responsibilities began to--she said we had to go to the country.  The war [World War II] broke out.  We had our duties, and we were separated, and she said, my father became more and more ill.  She said, but I'm sure you know all about this.  And I said, "Yes, ma'am, and my feelings really went out to you too."  And she said, you're so kind to remember all this.  And she touched my hand again, and the Governor General looked over and winked.  But by this time, the line of people who were waiting to shake hands or something, be introduced, were bent down, wondering what in the world was going on, why was she taking so much time with this American?  But that was it.
Story_ID: 33963
Speaker 1: But I go back to something else, that book I mentioned, 'Give Yourself Background'.  It always said something about trying to know what's going on in the world.  You can never tell.  I mentioned President [Richard] Nixon before.  He was apologizing in a meeting with a group of us in 1972, that he had not done anything to distinguish himself at being human and concerned.  And I corrected him.  I said, "Mr. President, don't you remember?"  You came to Harlem to receive a Human Relations Award in 1955, said, that's where I first met you.  I said, but you never publicized the fact that when you were at Duke University, you would go out each morning to help the gentleman who was handicapped, who couldn't walk very well, and you would help him to classes at law school.  And you did that throughout your time in law school.  I said, this shows a lot of compassion that a lot of people would not have put up with at all.  I said, but you have a lot to talk about that you haven't (laughter) talked.  He said, where in the world did you learn all of this (laughter).  And I said, well, I have to tell you (laughter).  I spent half a day in the company of Jack Anderson, and he told me an awful lot about you, a lot of the good things.  And I said, sometimes the people who are closest to you may not necessarily say the good things, but they're defending against some of the other things that--and he said, I really am grateful to you.  Well, after that, Mel Layard who had been the Secretary of Defense--
Speaker 2: Melvin Layard, yeah.
Speaker 1: --began to call me on a regular basis.  They asked me if everything was all right, if I needed anything from over at the White House.  And only once did he call, and I said, well, I seem to be having some trouble with the Secretary of Housing.  He wants me to give up my title while I'm still waiting for this appointment as Ambassador.  And he said, don't worry, we'll take care of that.  And I got word later from one of my friends who was in the meeting with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who said that every time he tries to touch me, he gets a word from the White House to lay off (laughter).  You know, people are standing around the wall taking notes when the president's in a meeting.  And all of these things have things for people to follow up.  Mel Layard was appointed as my contact to look out for me and make sure everything was all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just, I was curious about, now, Jack Anderson was one of the--
Speaker 1: He was on the squat list.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was on, yeah, Nixon's enemy's list--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --because of his writing about the Watergate scandal, and he wrote about it a lot from 'Parade Magazine' and other-
Story_ID: 33964
Speaker 1: Well, I spent about, oh, maybe about three hours with Jack Anderson on a plane and typically, I grilled him on every subject under the sun.  I knew a lot about him too.  Of course, he told me even more.  He had been the youngest correspondent in World War II, and whereas, he had the right to go in and talk to any General he wanted to, suddenly, they decided that every correspondent had to be in uniform.  People like Drew Pearson, his boss, his senior partner, became in the upper levels of the hierarchy as an officer.  Jack Anderson was made a low-ranking NCO [non-commissioned officer].  So suddenly, he could not, he could not go into these places.  He had to go and, you know, appeal to someone like that.  And he said, I know what it is (laughter) to be suddenly relegated to that.  And he talked to me a lot about things, how when--I think it was Drew Pearson, when he died that--no, when he was still alive, he made sure that Jack Anderson got to be a part of the column 'cause I was curious.  I said, I'm always curious about something.  You went out of, you've gone out of your way to make that Britt Humes' name is always included as part of your column, and I said, it's no coincidence because it takes additional space from other subjects.  But you do it.  And he said, well, I got it from Drew [Pearson].  He would give me lots and lots of breaks and he said, so it was that when he died, his wife called me, his widow called me and immediately asked if I wanted to take over the column, and that we should work out some kind of arrangement.  And he said, so I've always been grateful to him.  And then he talked about his children.  I think he had eight children.  He was involved in the Mormon Church.  I just learned an awful lot about him, but, and, of course, I also learned about a lot of people, about other people.  Nixon wasn't the only one.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you do like to learn about it.  Once again, as you said in the beginning, you like to learn about what's going on, and--
Speaker 1: Well, I spent a couple of hours one day with Danny Kay, and I was curious as to how did he become the UNICEF [United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund] Ambassador.  And he told me about meeting Strong who was the head of UNICEF.  And when I told him, of course, I was an usher at Strong's funeral, that also built it up.  He said that he was coming from England and the pilot announced they had a problem with the plane.  And he didn't want the people to get excited, so he asked Jack--Danny Kay if he would talk to the people.  And Danny went back and started talking with the people and sort of entertaining them.  And everybody settled down, and then the pilot announced that everything was okay.  When he returned, the man who was sitting next to him was Strong, the head of UNICEF.  And he said, we need a person like you.  He said, you've done well as an entertainer.  You've made a lot of friends across the world, but you have a chance to even make even more by being the Ambassador for UNICEF.  And that's how he became the Ambassador for UNICEF.  He spent a lot of time talking about some of the experiences he had.
Story_ID: 33965
Speaker 1: So what were some of the highlights of your career as chief admission ambassador to Barbados and Grenada.
Speaker 2: Well, I think the basic thing was being there because for the first time, although I'd taken my family to two different countries, Canada and to Mexico, that was driving.  But suddenly, we were able to get down to another country offshore, and we were the first family.  Unfortunately, my oldest son never came down.  And he died, lost his life in the military before he could make his first trip.  But as I said, besides that, then, several incidents.  I was able to help the Barbadians to get a ship that they needed.  Being an island place, you want to have that.  So I was able to help them get it, but also one of the things we set up was a, let's see, it was called, well, a hurricane warning system.  That was in there, and then something else happened that was kind of unusual.  The Cubans were flying over, to Barbados on route to Brazil and to Angola.  And the State Department was doing everything possible to get them to stop it.  We were sending in the formal letter, but getting nowhere, and one day the Prime Minister and I were having lunch, just the two of us.  It was his birthday.  So, you know, we were that kind of friends.  And I pointed out to him that all I would, I would be the first one to object if I thought if anything would be done to hurt Barbados.  I said, I have no control over everything, and so if any of those planes blew up or bodies were over the tarmac or something like that, tourist would fly to the four winds.  And I said, in a sense I have to sympathize with you because if I were running government, you always need money.  You've been selling them gasoline, clothes, food, whiskey, cigarettes and everything.  And that's fine, but as I said, it's a matter of putting in one thing against the other, and you don't want anything bad to happen if you can possibly avoid it.  And he said, I hadn't thought about it like that.  So with that night, he went on the air and denounced the Cubans for using Barbados for hostile purposes and demanded that they stop it or else he'd have to break off relations with them.  That was number one.  The other thing, of course, in 1976, the Bicentennial was coming up.  And Barbados had decided to get in the airline business.  They had bought an airline from a gentleman in England, Blake Leaky or something.  Anyway, they said they paid $250,000 for it.  Well, that would get you a motor for some of these big planes.  At any rate, the State, the CAB, which was still functioning at the time, Civil Aeronautics Board, in the U.S., refused to accept it.  So with that, Barbados then put the American Airlines on a three-months' permit.  Now, I was reasoning it out, and I said, wait a minute.  No airline can operate on a three-months' permit 'cause they've got to deploy food, aircraft, staff, all kinds of things.  They've gotta make decisions and sorry, no, I don't think that any attorney would allow them to enter into such a contract on such a short notice.  It wasn't sufficient for them to, you know, to do their business.  At any rate, I made this case in the papers.  I didn't do it on a discreet note to the Minister of Foreign Affairs or something, which might have been the more appropriate way.  And I guess I was just thinking, without thinking that I'm a diplomat.  Well, when it came out, it said that Barbados really ought to reconsider it.  It wasn't a harsh attack on them, but it said that it might be something that may need rethinking.  Well, with that, then the Prime Minister went on the air and denounced me and said that I was becoming the "ugly American" and what have you, and that if I didn't like it, I could always just leave.  Anyway, I didn't realize it, but he had put, they had put all the other airlines equally on three months' notice in order to be reciprocal, you know, treat everybody the same way.  And so I learned it later on when I was thinking about making a trip up to the States and everyone of the airlines said, anytime you need to get out of here, you've got a seat.  Somebody else might be thrown off the plane, but you've got a seat.  I didn't realize that I had said something that everybody could relate to.  So that was the second thing.
Story_ID: 33966
Speaker 1: Now, those things I could never raise a big flag and say look what I did because it was just, it just wasn't proper.  But within a matter of months, the Prime Minister was holding another session which I was there as the guest of honor, and he said, I had done more to help Barbados than any other envoy ever sent down there to the Caribbean.  So it--and he and I had been up here in the States arranging for the sale of this boat to come down there to--what is it?  To Barbados.  And it was captained by, I think by Hugh Mulzac, who was the first black captain in the U.S. Maritime Service.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He was from Barbados.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Those are the ones that I think as more of a highlight, although I will say that after the government lost, Errol Barrow lost, some would say that he delivered it to the opposition by attacking me.  But in the, he--when they had sworn in the new senate and the new house, I was scheduled to leave the next morning coming back to the States for consultation.  And that same afternoon, a Cuban plane took off out of Barbados and blew up as it got offshore, killing all of the Cubans onboard, plus the entire Guyana soccer team.  This was 1976.  And so I went to New York, went to New York and to Washington.  And two days later, I was sitting at a banquet, I was sitting next to Carl Rowan.  And Carl said, well, you'll be happy to know that the President of Cuba denounced you before a million people last night, the cowardly American Ambassador who fled Barbados after blowing up the Cuban planes (laughter).  As a result, I have not been too anxious to get down to Cuba.  I had nothing whatsoever to do with it, nor did I know anything about it.  But--
Speaker 2: Do you have any idea of what happened?  How the plane just blew up?
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm told, I--most of the stuff that I read indicated it was sabotaged.
Speaker 2: Do you think it was the United States that sabotaged it or--
Speaker 1: I have no, I have no way of knowing it.  I can only say this, that the thing that I was worried about in terms of Errol Barrow, and people landing there on the tarmac might have been the same thing that happened with that group too, because, you know, once there's a pronouncement of something, many people feel that they're supposed to take it up.  Sometimes people who are not even in the employ of the people who make the pronouncement.  Let it be known that the American government is something, and many people in foreign countries will think that that's what they're supposed to do, I guess.  The opposite also works.  But it, basically, it was a great experience, and when I was, I think the greatest outpouring I got was when my son lost his life, my oldest son lost his life in Michigan.  And the, what do you call it, the government sent flowers.  The Governor General sent condolences, the Prime Minister and people sent condolences.  The church leaders sent condolences, the education--because I had been active in all of those fields.  So it was quite a--
Speaker 2: So that happened while you were there, you were in--
Speaker 1: Yeah, September, 1976.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, yeah, September, that's just before--so you were Ambassador till the early part of '77' [1977] or--
Speaker 1: Early part of '77' [1977].  I think it was May of '77' [1977].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Okay, and then the new administration which would have been the--
Speaker 1: You know, every presidential appointee submits his or her resignation effective on January 20th, the day of the inauguration.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so the Carter [President Jimmy Carter] administration took over in early '77' [1979], and then, so who took your--
Speaker 1: January 20, 1977.
Story_ID: 33967
Speaker 1: Yeah, who took your place in Barbados?
Speaker 2: I think it was, I'm trying to remember whether it was Frank Martinez or whether it was Sally Shelton.  She was the wife of one of the leaders, one of the directors of the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency].  She was a good friend of Andy's too, as I recall.  I'm trying to remember.  This is the head of the CIA that was found floating down, who drowned in the river.  It was in 1977 or '78' [1978].  I can't remember who it was.  I don't think it was Richard Helms.  It was, oh, gosh.  I can see his face so good.  I knew him quite well.  But he was the one, I think he succeeded Richard Helms, yes.  I can't think of his--
Speaker 1: So what did you do in the, you know, once you stepped down as Ambassador--as the--
Speaker 2: Two things, I joined a little research firm in New York, briefly.  It's called "Logical Technical Services.  And a few months later, I left to become president of the United Mutual Life Insurance Company.
Speaker 1: President of the United--now, what is United Mutual Life?
Speaker 2: United Mutual Life Insurance Company.
Speaker 1: And were they based in New York?
Speaker 2: [No audible response -nodding, yes].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is this again, an African American business?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't stay with them too long.  I then went in for independent consulting and did that until, about the beginning of the Reagan administration.  One of the things that bothered me, I think it might have been 1980--1979, I had a call from a gentleman asking if I would join him for breakfast.  He wanted to get to know me.  And so I put it down on my calendar and went down to meet him.  And somehow, when I got back, I realized that someone had copied it and circulated it around to indicate that I was taking time off from my work instead, to meet with this old, out-of-office governor, at a time when I should be doing business up there with the thing.  I was back by, maybe by 9:15 or so.  But I was a little bit bothered that they should take that.  The gentleman's name was Ronald Reagan, by the way.  He had asked me to come down and have breakfast with him, and the first thing he--just the two of us.  And he said, I just want to congrat--thank you for your service to the country, both your military service and your diplomatic service and to say that if I decide to seek the Republican nomination that I can count on your support.  I haven't decided yet.  But he said, I just wanted to get to meet you in the meantime.  I, I just felt that people were questioning my judgment.  And so I let it be known that I didn't want to stay.  I was unhappy.  One gentleman absolutely refused to accept my resignation.  He, and he was the father-in-law to one of my long-time friends, David Dinkins.  He became, this gentleman became head of the Democratic Party in New York City.  Yeah, Danny.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Daniel, it'll come back to me.  Joyce, David's wife is his daughter.  Yeah, I forget Danny's last name.  But I, as I say, that was one of the things that bothered me, but I left to United Mutual after that.
Story_ID: 33968
Speaker 1: But as it was, I was on the board of Freedom National Bank.  Sam Pierce who represented the law firm downtown, was also the general counsel to the bank.  And since Sam and I had been in Young Republican politics years earlier, and he--in fact, I knew him before he ran--before he was appointed judge by a Governor [Nelson] Rockefeller, he and I would quite often sit in the back to chat because most of the other guys were Democrats.  And so--not that we were unfriendly, but just that we had a lot to talk about, you know, being from those days in the 1950s.  And so when Sam went down, I sent him a little note at one point saying that I would be free in a couple of weeks.  I had, working on something, but in about three weeks, I would be free and if he needed me, why, he could call on me.  Well, next thing I got word all around that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development had been calling me, trying to find me.  And I finally got in touch with him, and he then asked me if I would come down to head his international part down there.  And that's what I did for the next eight years or so until I decided, well, until I decided to go up to, come up to Newark [New Jersey].  I wanted to get away from Washington and to begin to get, settling back down into things outside of Washington.  When I came up to Newark, that put me close enough to New York City that I could keep my links and also get my old apartment back.
Speaker 2: Now, this is--now, where are we now in terms of time?  This is--
Speaker 1: In the 1980s.
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighties [1980s]?
Speaker 1: Um-hum, yeah.  (simultaneous)
Story_ID: 33969
Speaker 1: I know there was an incident that's here in our outline where you took some photos in London, I guess, and they were used in a trial.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  Now, there was something.  It was in 1985--
Speaker 1: It says '88' [1988].
Speaker 2: --'85' [1985] or '87' [1987], it may be.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What happened is I had been on a mission to the Soviet Union.  We had a meeting of the ministers over there, and I was in charge 'cause I was the American chairman of this U.S. Soviet agreement.  And I stopped off in London.  It was right after the, right after the big storm over there because about 200 of the old trees were knocked down.  And I was on, coming down Baker Street, to that famous street, Sherlock Holmes--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's another story.  Anyway, I was turning the corner, and I had my little camera with me, and just at that point, I saw these car coming in.  And they were blocking another car.  And so I began taking pictures.  It was a story in the making as I saw it.  So, I began taking pictures, and they stopped and had this gentleman to step out of the car and his wife.  She was pregnant, about eight months or so.  And they proceeded to question him.  I took pictures of it.  And then they, suddenly, they grabbed him and forced his head down on the hood of the car and then put handcuffs on him, and took him away.  And I still had my photos so I asked the young lady there, I said, what happened?  And she said, well, we were accused of robbing a bank.  And she said, and isn't that stupid.  She said, here it is, I've got this big vat of hot soup in the car.  I'm eight months' pregnant, and it just, it's just stupid.  Why would they do such a thing?  And I was very sympathetic.  And I said, well, listen, I've taken pictures of everything.  So if you need any of them, you know, call me.  This is my card, and I gave it to her.  And about, oh, several months later, they called to tell me that he was being charged on a number of things, offenses and that he--they understood that I--this is the Law Society in London, like Legal Aid Society, that they heard that I had taken some photos.  And I sent them the photos, and they said, well, these will be very helpful, but we'll need you here in London to testify.  And so I said, no problem, so--.
Story_ID: 33970
Speaker 1: I made arrangements, they sent me a ticket, and I made arrangements to go to London.  And I thought that the thing would be over on a Tuesday which it was scheduled for, and I could then leave on the Friday morning.  But I'd have some time, you know, to spend.  Well, as it was, they postponed it until Thursday, and when I came in the--I found that the gentleman had been charged with robbing a bank.  He had been charged with--but that was dropped.  He had been charged with resisting arrest, possession of an offensive weapon and assaulting seven policemen.  Well, my photos showed him standing there, talking with the people with his hands out.  So it wasn't exactly one resisting arrest.  Then they said possession of offensive weapon, and he didn't show any weapon, nor did he ever take anything out.  So that was dropped, and they said, and for assaulting seven policemen.  Well, the jury decided that he was not guilty of assaulting six of them, but guilty of assaulting one, but they couldn't identify which one it was.  So the judge threw that out.  But it, when he called me, he said, I understand that you have some photos?  And I said, yes, sir, and I showed him.  And he said, "May I make some copies of them."  I said, well, these are your copies.  And he said, but you've recounted this so vividly and yet it happened a number of months ago, and you're very a busy person.  How can you recall all of that?  And I said, well, I took notes.  And he said, well, where are they?  And I pulled out my notebook, and he said, "May we copy it?"  And I said, I've already made copies for you.  So, he (laughter), well, that was it because I, you know, I hadn't changed anything, and all this stuff was in chronological sequence.  I've been doing that since about 1971.  He had everything right there in sequence as exactly what happened, where it happened, and so forth, and my talking with the young lady and what have you.  So he, the gentleman was completely exonerated.  Simeon Booker ran those photos in the "JET", "JET Magazine".
Speaker 2: Okay, that was 1988, I guess when the trial finally took place.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 33971
Speaker 1: And then you--in '88' [1988], you also testified before the Development Policy in the Caribbean Committee, I guess, on--before the House in July concerning the--I don't know if this is the one where, okay.  The Invasion of--well, I don't know if this is about the Invasion of Grenada or what?  Was this about the--
Speaker 2: It might have been.  I had some misgivings about that.  I'll explain it quickly.  Grenada was both a volcanic and a coral island.  I don't know if you know the difference.  The capital city is St. George's.  Ocean-going vessels were able to come right on up to the buildings in the harbor at St. George.  Okay, now, that, you can immediately sense is the volcanic side.  You can't do it on, you can't do that on the coral side because the coral reef goes out into the ocean.  When the United States invaded Grenada, and I had some problems with it because I saw that medical school being founded and I visited.  When they dropped men into the sea, they did not distinguish between the coral side and the volcanic side.  And men were laden down with 40 pound weights on their back, had no place to land.  They went straight down.  I've never seen a report on the, on that invasion or what happened.  I know that, I think we lost something like 40 men.  But--
Speaker 1: And it's unnecessary--
Speaker 2: --not because they were shot by the Cubans or by the Grenadians but rather that, I think it was poor planning on the part--it was no planning.  I think it was a thing to quickly take attention away from the 243 men who had been killed in Lebanon.
Speaker 1: Now, that's the--those are the days of Iran Contra too, I think that--
Speaker 2: It was part of it, yeah.
Speaker 1: --to distract them from--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I have no way of proving this, but obviously, I knew the difference between coral and volcanic.  Barbados is coral, but--and that side of it, you have a large amount of volcanic thing.  You're in one of the, two of the greatest earthquakes or eruptions in the Western Hemisphere occurred in Martinique, Mount Pelee, and also down in St. Vincent.  That's a sort of a volcanic thing, but that's, was my thoughts about it.
Story_ID: 33972
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what did you do in the--now, you worked for HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] again in the '90's [1990s] for the Bush administration?
Speaker 2: In the 19--from 1981 till 1992.  It was George H.W. Bush and when Jack Kemp took over as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development--
Speaker 1: Oh, this is '91' [1991] to '92' [1992]?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Ninety-one [1991], '92' [1992].
Speaker 2: Well, '89' [1989] actually.  It's (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay, '89' [1989] to '92' [1992]?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I was in, at HUD from '81' [1981] to 1992.  Remember, now, I mentioned that I was, that when Sam Pierce became Secretary of Housing and Urban Development--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I contacted him and went down to handle his international things.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh, '81' [1981] to--all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and when Jack Kemp came aboard, I reminded him that I was watching him being interviewed on "The Today Show" in which he indicated that the one job that he'd love to have would be the secretary ship of Housing and Urban Development.  And he was kind of impressed that I knew about all of this.  And I was happy that he was there.  Now, at the end of Sam's term as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development--and he was the longest serving one, by the way, he was investigated because of some problems effecting his staff.  They, there were a lot of things that were not quite, according to Hoyle, some--they, of course, some of them went to jail because they were accused of selling off, what do they call it, selling off of, not vouchers, but selling off some of the things that they should not have been doing.  In addition, there was some problems with the administration, and what's her name, she's on national public radio.  It'll come back to me (unclear), but she found letters from me warning Sam Pierce of some of the problems and saying that he really needed to take steps to correct some of them, could create problems for him.
Story_ID: 33973
Speaker 1: One of the things that didn't surface, and it was something that I think he must have worried about, was at one point, he wanted to sell bonds to the Japanese Ministry of Finance.  But instead of coming through me, where I could have helped him, he had one of his close people to take it over to the State Department to, you know, do it without necessarily anybody else knowing about it.  200 agencies of the Federal government got copies of his letter.  I got two copies, and this goes back to something else.  Before I took up post in Barbados, I met with every branch of government that I could find, including the Defense Department.  And we had four different military installations on my post.  So I had the Defense Department working with them.  They appointed the senior member, military member in the Caribbean there on my post to become defense liaison to the Ambassador.  So my name got into the system of the Defense Department.  And any time anything came up, my name surfaced.  It went right on up, especially, having dealt before with the Secretary of Defense.  So I'm, he, as I say, he sent this letter over, and 200 agencies of the federal government became privy to something that he wanted to keep private.  But even later, when he was, had been asked to go over to Kenya for the anniversary of the Kenyan independence, he had never told me about it.  And I had to come one day and tell him, look, I don't wanna, I don't wanna seem like I'm intruding on whatever you're doing, but I've been getting a letter on everything that you're planning to do, going over to Kenya and who's going with you and everything like that.  I said, because I'm part of this system, especially, in the DOD [Department of Defense] system, and you're using a DOD plane to get there.  So I said, I don't wanna sound like I'm a smarty, but I just want you to know that I am alert, yeah, and aware of it.  And any way I can help you, I will, or protect you, I will.  So--
Speaker 2: So, unnecessary problem, I guess, if he didn't, understood--
Speaker 1: Well, he was a secretive kind of person, and he was very trusting.  Sam once told me that he had a, he had made a touchdown in one of his games--he went to Cornell [University] as you heard.  And when he shook hands with one of the alumni, there was a hundred dollar bill in his hand, and so he was always very attuned to the people who had money or what he saw as having money.  But, in this case, he was putting secretive things in the hands of people who didn't know anything about the process.  And I knew the process.  You know, I had top-secret clearance, but not--I don't think anybody else with the possible exception of himself, would have had that kind of clearance.  Once you, once you're an ambassador, you're always an ambassador.  And I could have done back to being a janitor or something.  But when I stepped into the State Department, I'm ambassador.  It's just as now, when I go up with the things from the Montfort Point Marines, with all due respect to them, although they know I'm coming, I always notify the people at the highest authority because they respected--my equivalent rank is four stars.  With the Montfort Point Marines, I'm just one of the fellows.  But once the commandant knows that, I'm in a different position.  It's part of permanent protocol.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And now, being 1974 to 19--to 2013, I'm one of the older ones.
Story_ID: 33974
Speaker 1: Okay, 1991 at Howard University.  So it's a gathers, is this a gathering of the Association of--
Speaker 2: It was a meeting of the Association of Black American Ambassadors.  And we were holding a seminar on blacks, black Americans and American foreign policy.  Condoleezza Rice was one of the people in that group, and I pointed her out because she was with the National Security Council at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you, the topic of your presentation was "The Impact of Foreign Policy on African Americans"?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I pointed out that sometimes it seems as if so many other people were in charge of the foreign policy, but we have a vested interests in some--the way it's going and so forth.  At that time, I don't think that we had had, let's see John, John Reinhardt had been the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs in 1976.  But I don't, and I don't remember too many people after that being in the hierarchy of the State Department.  Even Cliff, Cliff Wharton who came and stayed only a very short time.  And he was out.  But this is, this is on the tail end of the George H.W. Bush administration.  And by the way, I knew him when he was Chairman of the Republican Party and later on when he became head of the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency].  So I've been--the fact that I had then been in charge of the China program for eight years, and I had established a reputation.  I had studied Chinese so, obviously, my name had gone to him, you know.  I have pictures of him.  I guess it's in the other place.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a time when there's a great deal of activity in terms of trade with Chinese and the United States, it kind of warms up in the early--in the '90's [1990s].  It started in seventy, in 1978 when Jimmy Carter signed the Science and Technology Agreement.  Usually, there are things that are not, not diplomatic per se, but they're cultural.  When I came in, of course, we did have the agreement to exchange information and technology on housing and planning.  And I was the American chairman.  So I would make trips with the delegations, part--both the governmental people and private people.  And they would do the same thing over here, although their people were all government.  And so we worked it that way.  And I made, must have gone about five or six times.  It was on my first trip with Sam Pierce, the Secretary with me, that I told him that my ultimate aim was to become career and to be able to retire ultimately.  And that's what he, we talked about that on the road, on the train from, I think Shanghai to Guangzhou [China].
Story_ID: 33975
Speaker 1: Okay, now, well, tell us about the associate, the Association of Black American--
Speaker 2: Black American Ambassadors?
Speaker 1: --Ambassadors, yeah.  Who--
Speaker 2: Started by Franklin Williams out of New York, President of the Phelps Stokes Fund.
Speaker 1: Okay, Franklin Williams.  He was president of the Phelps Stokes Fund.
Speaker 2: Franklin H. Williams.  There was a building in, on 58th Street and, between 9th and 10th Avenue, no, between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenue.  It's the same avenues, but they get numbers from 59th Street on down.  So it would be 9th and 10th, but he, there's a building, the Franklin H. Williams Caribbean Cultural Center.  Frank was, had been Ambassador to Ghana, and had been, I think a deputy counsel or something like that with the NAACP out in California, a Lincoln [University] graduate by the way.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so and what year did it start?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  It might have been somewhere around the early '80's [1980s], yes, 'cause I took a group of black Ambassadors to Japan during about 1986 or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Frank had worked out the financing for it.
Speaker 1: So organization takes, does fact-finding tours or kind of councils (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I've been out of touch with them for some time now.  I, I've not--I know that they have had a number of banquets.  In fact, Condoleezza Rice was the honored guest in one of the banquets.  But I have little idea what they're doing these--I would, I became a director of the Council of American Ambassadors in 19--about 1982 when it was founded.  And I, most of my attention had been devoted to them, although I was Secretary General of the Association of Black American Ambassadors at one point.
Story_ID: 33976
Speaker 1: Okay, so from, so did, so what were your activities during the Clinton [President Bill Clinton] years from '92' [1992] to [2000].
Speaker 2: I left government in 1992, but during that time I was, let's see, what was I doing?  I'm trying to remember whether I got involved with the National Housing Ministries, and I can't remember exactly when.  It might have been about that time because that's the organization that I formally headed before going into government in 1971.  They were having some problems with the government.  They were managing, and they were having problems with the Boston office.  And they called me to ask if I could help out.  I had gone to Newark in 1989, 1988, thereabouts to help clean up some of the abuses in the housing field up there.  I think about '70' [1970] when the Housing Authority and executive directors went to jail.  There were some real abuses up there in New Jersey, and so HUD [United States Department of Housing and Urban Development] knew of my background there.  And with these folks having problems, I guess they decided that--and they knew that I had a good relationship with the Boston office, decided to call on me.  And so I went up.  I was surprised to find that they had been three directives by the government HUD office to give up the management.  I didn't know that.  But I worked out a plan with the HUD office.  And they said, well, if you're gonna stay with it, we will relent.  And so I spent the next six years or so, helping to straighten things out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you--now, at any point, I mean did you, I mean have--did you retire from public life at any point?  I mean, I know you're basically retired now, but--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm still the, what do you call it, the Counsel General for Albania, and I seem to be the most active one because when we had a meeting of honorary counsel generals in Albania, I think in 2010 or something like that, 2011--although there were men about four, 200 and something, I was asked to be the spokesperson for all of them, from (unclear) worldwide.  Of course, it may well be that my standing as Ambassador may have had something to do with it, but I also knew all of the ministers, plus the prime--the foreign ministers, going back to 2005.  And I knew the Prime Minister.  In fact, the mayor of the principal city, Tirana, had been foreign minister, and he and I were good friends.  So I was given a lot of things.  Everywhere we went I was the spokesperson for these 200 men from around the world and women too.
Story_ID: 33977
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on your career in the diplomatic service and, well, as your career in business as well, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: It's hard to say because I've done so many things, and in each one I've achieved some kind of special attention.  For example, we didn't mention the Montford Point people.  But I was the first one to get--I didn't mention it before, but I was the first one to get Marine security guards into Barbados.  The British, in the British tradition, Barbados did not believe in armed men going around.  Even the police didn't--were not armed, similarly to the Bobbies in London.  But because of things becoming a little bit hairy, I was able to convince the government to allow us to have Marine security guards.  So I became the first speaker at the, honored guest, at the Marine security, Marine, annual Marine Birthday Ball in Barbados.  In fact, my wife [Vernell Elizabeth Stewart Britton] and I were the honored guests at the last, at the past Marine Birthday Ball in Barbados.  But in 2010, General Conway, the commandant then, became very active in terms of supporting the Montford Point Marines.  And while I went up there as one of the fellows, once they realized my protocol standing, I was immediately elevated.  I got to know the commandant quite well, and others, and because of the attention by the commandant, it began to sensitize my colleagues in the association itself.  I not an officer, nor have I ever been an officer of it.  So I don't deserve any of this special accolades, but when they see the commandant and all the other people being differential, well, it makes something, a difference to them.  So in every case, I have been, lately in the Montford Point Marines, I've become part of the public figure.  As a matter of fact--when did I talk with, oh, I've been a life member of the Second Marine Division Association.  And recently, because I was in Mont--up at Camp, up at Jacksonville [North Carolina] last year for a, what was it?  For their annual meeting.  I sent a note to the executive director of the Second Marine Division that I'd be there, and that he needed to know that one of his life members will be receiving the, what do you call it, the Congressional Gold Medal, which then became an article in the magazine.  And when they had the change of commanding generals at the Second Marine Division, I was the honored guest.  And now, I will be an honored up there shortly, later this month.  But it's been a lot of things throughout the country that I've been invited to, be the honored guest because of, well, the Gold Medal, but also because of the protocol thing.
Story_ID: 33978
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean you certainly seem like you were, you have the temperament for diplomacy, (laughter) I mean from the stories you've told.  I mean do you think it's something that you learned along the way or some family trait or--
Speaker 2: When I go back to it, I think that I've been blessed with sort of a non-threatening type personality, plus I've also been the beneficiary of some good education, maybe from a substantial school when one says I went to NYU [New York University], that was my school.  It's special.  And basically, some of the things that I've picked up, including that famous book "Give Yourself Background", which says be prepared and don't hesitate to speak up but also to be able to speak properly and to not offend people and so forth.  So it's all fitted in, and I guess I'm blessed with sort of the genes that may have fitted into it.  So many of the people would have been great contributors to this country if they had had some of the benefits and advantages that I had.  Some, I was talking with someone yesterday about the, we were talking about education.  And this person was talking about, well, education didn't mean anything until after the Civil Rights thing.  And I said, no, the great impetus to education could have been after World War II because thousands and thousands of our people, men especially, had the benefit of the GI Bill.  We could have gone to any schools we wanted to practically.  And so many of them passed it up.  I used to pass Lester Grainger, who lived up on the same street where I was working.  And I was often tempted to grab him and say, listen, I've run into so many fellows who talk about they have easy jobs and what have you.  If problems, economic problems come along, those are the first jobs to go.  But I didn't see anybody in the leadership of black America encouraging men to take advantage of the GI Bill, to get a good, solid education.  And it was just such a loss, such a loss.  People who took courses and refresh air-type things that, you know, were good for entertainment but not necessarily useful in terms of contributing to the overall national economy and what have you.  Those things were lost, and there were men who really were very talented in some areas and would have made a great contribution.  But they were not encouraged to use their benefits and talents.  Remember, when we came, every veteran was entitled to 52 weeks at $20.00 a week.  That was the 52/20 Club we called it.  But in addition, everyone basically was entitled to education.  Some could go beyond a doctoral degree, but we just, we just passed it.  Now, true, after the "Brown versus Board of Education", that's another subject.  Just as a side point, everyone of the men who sat on the Supreme Court ruling--and they were all white, had all been born in the 1800s, which sounds, something strange to think that people born there, what do you know?  What do they care about Civil Rights and all that?  But it was unanimous.  All, the youngest one had been born in 1891.  So it was special.  But as I say, we, some of them talked about the 1860s.  No education was in a real flux at that time, worldwide, not only here, but Europe.  The Baader-Meinhof, (unclear) the red, the red, whatever is in France and what have you, and it took a long time for us to come out.  We still aren't out of the turmoil of the '70's [1970s] when me used to go, come into class wearing suits and ties and shirts.  Now, you come with a polo shirt and sneakers or sandals or something.  It's different.  I'm not saying that I'm against it, but it's a different kind of a thing.  And now, of course, the disruptions have been great because in some cases, some schools that were very stable were destroyed or discontinued.  And some that were not so stable were, you know, pushed forward.  But it's just one of those things.  We got a long way to go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33979
Speaker 1: In that regard, is--what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Without any sense of criticism as I am a strong believer in education.  By the way, I'm still chairman of a university over in Albania.  They're the ones that gave me the honorary doctorate.  I'm a strong believer in education.  I'm also a strong believer in health.  I read everything I can on health.  Today is the science edition of the "New York Times".  That's the place that I go to first when I start reading the "New York Times".  In addition, I'm a strong proponent of knowing a little bit about the economics thing, how people can use their resources more effectively and conserve their resources.  I'm not saying that they need to be cheap or stingy or something, but rather to know how to effectively use them and to be alert to the miss--potential misuse of things.  So, well, just basic, some of things that I think about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I read an awful.  In fact, some things that don't concern me at all, I tend to want to know about.
Speaker 1: Okay, if you could go back and change something, would you do it in your life to this point?
Speaker 2: Let me tell you a little story.  I was at HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] in 1972, and as you know, with having been in appraising, I'm very sensitive to directions and all of that.  And at this particular point, I was to go out to California to be part of a meeting out there, and I was gonna take an afternoon flight and change at Chicago and continue out.  When I pulled out of the driveway, for some reason, instead of turning, all I had to go is fifty feet and make a right turn.  And I would have been over at the airport in maybe ten minutes.  I have no idea what led me to do it, but I passed that, and made a left turn.  I, now, keep in mind, I was in my forties then so I couldn't have been the dumbest guy in the world.  But I made a left turn, and when you make a left turn on that road, you can't get off it for about a mile or so.  So I said, oh, heck, I'm gonna miss that plane.  So I just continued on over to Baltimore to take a nonstop plane from Baltimore to California.  I didn't read the newspapers or anything, but when I called my office the next morning, they were shocked that I was in California.  Why?  Because the plane that I missed crashed, killing everybody on board.  So I never regret anything that I've done because it might have had some fatal consequences (laughter).  I can't explain yet what led me to make the mistake of not making a proper turn and to make the wrong turn going into the opposite direction.  Of course, it's possible that The HistoryMakers were looking forward to my talking with you guys--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 2: --and if I had made the proper turn, I wouldn't be here, so.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  Okay.
Speaker 2: The Lord was looking out for you folks (laughter).
Story_ID: 33980
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us something about your family.  You have children, right, and--
Speaker 2: Yes, I had five children.  I think I mentioned that the older one died in the military in 1976.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And my former wife [Ruth B. A. Baker] died in an automobile accident that took her life and some others.  So one child, my youngest son lives in New York where I grew up and lived.  And his, my oldest daughter also lives in New York.  My youngest daughter lives in Florida, in Orlando.  And my other son lives in Texas, in Mexia, Texas.  That's what they're doing down there now.  I guess I'm in closest touch with my youngest daughter.  She has a daughter who is, has the autism spectrum, autism spectrum disorder, ASD, they call it these days.  The wife of the Prime Minister in Albania set up a regional center for autism research.  I know her quite well, and so the last time when she was dedicating this center, she saw me in the audience and had someone to have me come up on the, there and sit on the platform next to her, the day she was dedicating it.  The second top person, black person in the Marine Corps is Lieutenant General Walter Gaskin, who is deputy military chairman of NATO.  He has a son who is autistic.  He's going to be in Albania next month to meet with the defense ministers.  So I put him in touch with the wife of the Prime Minister, and he's going to visit with her while he's there.  But in addition, I met a young lady through another organization, "People to People" [International], which we didn't talk about.  And she is a specialist in speech and auditoria disorders and so forth, including having a great knowledge of autism.  So she has been giving me some information that I've been sharing with the two of them, plus my daughter.
Story_ID: 33981
Speaker 1: So it's, it's a combination of things.  My protege whom I began advising in 2001 is now the Albanian Ambassador to Turkey, and we're in constant touch all the time.  By the way, as I say, I do know the Prime Minister.  My organization "People to People" [International], which I was a director for ten years, elected to give him the highest award, called "The Eisenhower Medallion".  And he found that he could not make it because of some political problems at the time.  So I suggested to him that he do a video.  He then asked if I would write the speech for him.  So he did a video to be presented at the time, using that speech.  But then he sent his wife over to receive the medal for him.  And so I had to write a speech for her.  But while she was here, she and the members of her party, including the deputy foreign minister, wanted to see some parts of the West.  So I had to arrange a trip out there for Grand Canyon and Sedona and Phoenix and so forth, plus some other receptions along the way.  So it's never a dull moment.
Speaker 2: Now, how did you get involved with Albania, I mean, or when did you get involved with Albania?  Was it during the George H.W. Bush administration?
Speaker 1: Mentally, it goes back maybe during World War II.  I followed the partisans fighting the Germans and World War II.  And I kept up with it.  I knew about the king and it was always fascinating to me, that his name, King Zaug (ph.) was such that it attracted my attention.  So, and I kept up with that.  I knew a lot about what was going on over there.  When I joined this "People to People" organization, one of the groups, one of the people involved in it was this young fellow in Albania who was very active.  He had lost his father to the dictatorship in 19--when he was four years old.  His father wanted to immigrant, so he was promptly imprisoned and later on, lost his life.  So my friend and I got to know each other when I found he was from Albania.  But we met in France in 2000.  That he began to tell me some of his hopes and aspirations.  So I began to advise him, in fact, sending him a book, Tip O'Neill's, "All Politics Is Local".  And ultimately, I ended up going to Albania in 2005.  And we cemented.  He asked me to visit with his minis--with his party leader, and also I was put on a panel with another gentleman who had been an ambassador as well.  He spoke no English.  I spoke no Albanian, but when we came out, we were good friends, arm-in-arm talking.  We were using French, okay.  We met with the party leader and so forth, and three months later, the party was in an election.  It was successful.  The party leader became the Prime Minister, and this gentleman became the foreign minister and my protege became an assistant to him.  And I've continued to work with him and so forth, and so recently, then, he was--I sent the Prime Minister a special note, talking about him, and how he had grown and so forth and that I thought he would make an excellent candidate for representing Albania in some country.  And three months, three or four months later, he became minister, I mean Ambassador to Turkey.
Speaker 2: What's your protege's name?
Speaker 1: Genc Mucja, M-U-C-A-J.  He's not the Ambassador to Turkey, Esabajon (ph.), Georgia, Iran and Pakistan.
Story_ID: 33982
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there anything I haven't--now, "People to People" something that you mentioned several times.  Now, how is--
Speaker 2: Founded by President Eisenhower in 1955 to promote interchange between people over and above government.  He started out with some very high-powered people, Walt Disney, General, a couple of the top Generals from World War II, and the gentleman who owned Hallmark Cards, and all that kind of business.  So, it's now celebrating, let's see, 1955, yeah, it's close to about 55, maybe 58, it's getting close to 68 years now.  Yeah, 58, yeah, it's just, quite up there.  But it's currently headed by his granddaughter, Mary Eisenhower, who's the brother of--the sister of David Eisenhower, for whom Camp David is named.  And she is, she's stepping down this year.  She's not well.  She's had serious illnesses.  But the "People to People" has thrived.  It's in, I would say maybe about 70 different countries now.
Speaker 1: And where is that headquartered here in the States?
Speaker 2: Kansas City.
Speaker 1: Kansas, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, "People to People International".  I've been on the board, I was on the board until 2000, I think 2010 or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there anything else that we haven't discussed or we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I get amused.  My present wife [Vernell Elizabeth Stewart Britton] is not particularly accustomed to some of the perks that go with being an Ambassador.  I'm laughing because a couple of years ago, we were coming in from Egypt.  And as the plane pulled into JFK--and by the way, I have friends throughout government.  So they know me.  The pilot announced, will the Ambassador of Britain please come to the front of the plane.  Well, by that time, people had begun crowding the aisles.  So my wife immediately said, we may as well sit down.  We can't be inconveniencing these people trying to get upfront.  I told the steward, the hostess, and next thing, a word came back from the pilot, "Folks, please clear the aisle.  The Ambassador and his party has to leave the plane first."  She was saying, we can't be--(laughter), and I said, well, you wait right here and you come out when they clear the aisles.  In the meantime, I'll be sitting up there, and the president--in the Crown Club waiting for you.  (Laughter) She skulked down, you know, and followed me.  I'm accustomed to all of this.  As I say, here comes, I've dealt with presidents, prime ministers, Queen, kings.  So, you know, they're all people, and so I always remember that old business about "don't be intimidated", "Take the bold approach", "have background" and so forth.  And invariably I know something about these folks, so, I can talk with them as if it's something that's, you know, that we're sharing almost like, it's special.  So I, I'm never intimidated by any of the things and secondly, I try not to offend people.  But at the same time, there are certain perks that go with holding this particular title, and for someone who comes out of a place like South Carolina, a small community, the U.S. doesn't have a great number of things that you can wear, you know, that is great.  But this is one of the few.  I would also say that although I wanted to stay in the military in 1951, when they found that I'd opposed the Marine Corps setting up an all-Colored organization in Harlem in 1948, my interview just fizzled out.  And so I lost my opportunity to get a commission.  But friends have since told me of what happened in Korea and believe me, it was no fun.  Talk about bodies being shipped up, stacked up on trucks going back down, talking about fellows taking their shoes off at night and leaving their toes in their shoes, talk about fellows who froze because they didn't have enough to wear and what have you.  No, I, I think about these things and I recognize that I could have done something differently, but everything that I've done differently has been positive.  Some of the other things might not have been so positive.  I might not be sitting here talking with you now.
Story_ID: 33983
Speaker 1: Okay, now, our last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I guess basically, it would be somewhat--and it sounds rather simple.  It might be somewhat like a good American, one would could be identified with the country, who could speak for the country, who would defend the country, who could recognize our shortcomings, but at the same time, relate them to the world in which people are still developing.  I don't wanna sound demeaning or anything, but I recognize that the world is not at its full potential yet.  It's got many, many hundreds of years to go.  And so when I see a person doing something that may be in a sense considered unethical, amoral or something like that, or harsh or prejudice or something, I always see these people as victims of their genes and sometimes of their environment and what have you.  And no one is ever a bad person.  My family sometimes teases me that I never say anything bad about any person because I'm not that religious, but we were all created pretty much in the same image.  True, some are lighter, some are darker, some are brown, some are yellow, but the fact is, we're still human beings.  We're all the same thing, and so I, I'm very much ready to defend anyone.  I said before that I had visited over a hundred and sixty-something countries.  When anything happens on the face of the globe, I instantly react because I have friends in so many of these places.  So I'm always concerned about them.  When you speak of things happening in Japan, I have friends in Japan.  When you're talking about Indonesia, Africa and what have you--it's automatic.  I mentioned going to South Africa in 1982.  It was still very much prejudice and so forth, Apartheid, but I had people come up to me afterwards to hug me and thank me for being there, for talking about things.  Even up in Israel, when I ran into South Africans who said that they heard me on the radio or saw me on television.  It makes you feel real good.  So I'd love to be remembered as someone who sort of made some kind of positive contribution in the world.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you, sir.

Speaker 1: Tell us about these pictures. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  So, can you name you and your wife for us?
Speaker 1: Okay, that's my wife and I strolling down the Ginza in Japan.  And that one's at the Presidential Ball in 1981.  In fact, it was featured in "U.S. News and World Report".
Speaker 2: Okay, can you give your full names?
Speaker 1: Oh, my wife is Vernell, Vernell Elizabeth Stewart Britton, of course, myself, Ambassador, Britton, Ted Britton.  Yeah, that was another one.  I think that was at the, Vernell and I at the Great Wall in China. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  In Beijing.
Speaker 2: In Beijing.  And that's another one, let's see, where were we?  Vernell and I-- (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Up in Baltimore, Maryland, and that one was up in, one of our places, the final one, Vernell and I up in Winterthur in Delaware, the Botanic Garden up there.
Speaker 2: And that's Theodore R. Britton, Sr. and Theodore R. Britton, Jr.  I think I might have been about 40 years old at the time.  I was up at, I was at, working at Carver Federal Savings, I think.  And my father was, he was, we were living in New York at the time.
Speaker 1: That is my oldest sister, Virginia and myself.  I think I might have been about two years old.  I have no idea why my mother dressed me up like that or how she even had the money to find the garments to dress me up like that, but I looked as if I'm some kind of a little aristocrat, except for the location.
Speaker 2: Nice Afro too.
Speaker 1: That was in my hay day whereas folks told me I could never become Ambassador or even to get into the State Department.  There I am at the pinnacle of it, down in Barbados.  And that's the Ambassador's flag in the back.
Speaker 2: That's 1976?
Speaker 1: About 1976, yes. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 2: Now, recently, I spoke at the Home Depot's Veterans Day up here in Atlanta.  And that shows, at the center there, under the Home Depot logo, the logo of the Montford Point Marine Association.  Then down there, it's the logo of a U.S. Embassy, and further over there the logo of the U.S. Marine Corp.  And there're a number of pins there too.
Speaker 1: And this dates from what year?
Speaker 2: Oh, last year.  In fact, yes, about, maybe about November.
Speaker 1: Of 2012?
Speaker 2: Twenty twelve, [2012] yes, yes.
Speaker 1: You remember that I told you this particular teacher always said that he wanted me to be a gentleman and a scholar.  I always think that when the President sent his letter to Queen Elizabeth saying that he is a gentleman and a citizen of the State of New York, that was part of it.  When I received the doctorate in Albania, Doctor of Laws, it made me think that maybe I'd final made the circle, gentleman and scholar.  That's General Amos, Jim Amos on the side over there.  He's wearing a cap of the Montford Point Marine Association where I presented it to him, making him an honorary member, National Honorary Member.
Speaker 2: He's a Marine Commandant.
Speaker 1: He's a commandant of the Marine Corps.  He's been a wonderful person.  I think that as far as the Montfort Point Marines are concerned, he could be elected president tomorrow or something.
Speaker 2: This lower one is, goes back to 1944 when I had just gotten out of boot camp, and the other one then too.  But the big cap is also about 1944, I guess it is.  And the other one, the smaller one is about 1950 and the one over in the corner there is 1950.  And Camp Lejeune.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, this was painted by one of the most distinguished curators in all of France, Dr. Bernard Penn.  Bernard was not Dr. when I first met him.  As a matter of fact, he was still in his teens, and he had just escaped from Algeria.  His father was killed as they were trying to escape during the rebellion.  His mother and sister came with him.  He was separated from his mother and sister.  And it was some years before he found them again, but I met him in his teens, and we've been friends every since.  This goes back to 1969.
