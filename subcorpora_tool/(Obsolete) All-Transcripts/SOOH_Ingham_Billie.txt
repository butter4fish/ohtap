 Finchum  Ingham  Today is August 8, 2009. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library and we   re conducting an oral  history project featuring the 1930s as part of our    Spotlighting  Oklahoma    project. Today we   re here in the Stillwater Public Library to  talk with Billie Ingham about her experiences and memories from the  1930s. Thank you for joining me today. Let   s start by having you tell a  little bit about your childhood, where you born.  I was born on a farm three miles north of Glencoe, Oklahoma.  In what year?  1931. August of 1931.  So you   ve had a birthday recently or have one coming up.  I will have.  Did you have siblings?  Yes.  Talk a little bit about those.  I had a sister five years older than me. Her name was June. And then I  had a half-sister and brother. The brother was Melvin Matlock. He was  18 years older than me and had a sister, Geraldine Matlock. She was 14  years older than me.  So you were the baby of the family.  I was the baby.  5  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  And born really close to Depression times.  Yes.  Do you have some fond memories from early school? Like first, second  grade?  Oh yes. I went to a little country school in Noble County, southeast  Noble County, named Whitehall. It was just a one-room school and we  had first to the eighth grade. I walked a mile and a half to school every  day and then back home that night. We took our lunches. We had a little  cage out in the entryway and it wasn   t heated, I imagine that   s why we  had it out there, and we   d all put our lunches in that. Either a paper  sack   usually I had a little syrup bucket that my mother put mine in.  Very seldom had a bought lunchbox because people just couldn   t afford  them back then.  And what would your lunch be, typically?  Oh, we   d have a sandwich. My mother always made sure that we had   something . We butchered, so I had usually ham or something similar to  that. And we   d have, if she had sweets baked, we   d have usually a  cookie or a piece of cake. And sometimes we   d have fruit, not always,  but sometimes.  In those days what kind of fruit would they be able to get? Apples?  I guess so. I can   t remember the fruit but I know we had it once in  awhile. Not always.  Did she raise a garden?  Yes, a big garden.  And can?  She canned, yes, she canned a lot.  And did you have to help?  Oh, yes. I knew how to snap beans very young.  That takes a skill to pop them and make sure you get all the strings off,  doesn   t it?  Yes, but we did.  6  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  And did she have a cellar where she kept it?  Yes, we had a basement under the house and we kept that stuff all down  there.  How big of a house did you have at that time?  We didn   t have a very big one. We had a four-room house.  The parents had one room and the kids had to share the other?  Yes. And a big kitchen we ate in and a living room, that was it.  And how was it heated?  We heated it with wood.  That your dad had to chop or did you     Yes, my dad had to chop. He had a buzz saw that when he got enough  logs cut up, we   d bring them up to the house, up close to the house. And  then this man that owned the buzz saw, he would come and cut it up for  us.  And then stack it for the winter. Is that how you   d cook, too?  Yes, yes.  So in the wintertime was your room cold?  Sometimes it got cold before morning. Daddy would put logs in it   woodstove  before we went to bed. It would stay warm most of the  night, but we got up to a cold house.  Do you remember when you actually got electricity?  We never did. I was married before we did.  And that would   ve been?  I married in 1948.  So quite a bit later.  Yes. They didn   t get electricity out there until I think about    50.  7  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  What about your water sources?  We grabbed a bucket and ran to the well. (Laughter) We had a pump  well and we carried water into the house at night so Mama would have  water to cook breakfast.  And then bath time?  That was in a tub. (Laughter)  Once a week or once a day or   ?  No, I think about once a week.  Did everybody have to share the same water?  Yes, I think so. I can   t remember that part real well.  Was it a galvanized tub?  Yes.  We   ve heard some people say a particular number, whatever size they  were. I   ll have to learn a little bit about that, too.  I don   t remember that.  Did any other relatives live with you during that time period?  We had a cousin, a man cousin that had been hurt when he was young  and he lived with us. My dad would take anybody in. He lived with us.  What did your dad do for a living?  He was a farmer.  What did he raise?  He raised mostly cotton, but we also had a little wheat and oats that he  harvested. And hay, we had a hay patch.  And did you have to pick some cotton yourself?  You bet. (Laughter) I never was good at it.  How long do you think you had to do that? How young would you have  8  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  started?  Probably ten.  And all day long?  Oh yes. Usually on Saturdays because we were in school when cotton  was picked.  So your mom had to help and then when you came in from school you  had to.  Yes.  Did you have cotton mattresses?  No, we had mattresses and also featherbeds. We had one featherbed.  You had to get up and beat them every once in awhile to level them out a  little more?  Yes. The feather mattress, when we were kids I remember we   d sink  down in it and that made us warm.  Did your mother quilt?  Yes, she did.  Did she teach you?  No, cause I was working outside.  So chores weren   t necessarily divided by gender? The women didn   t  spend time in the kitchen and     No, by the time I came along, my older sister and my brother were  already out. Well, my sister married when I was about a year old. And so  my sister that was just older than me, we had a lot to do because we had  to do chores.  Gather the eggs and     Gather the eggs and feed the chickens and water them. And we   d milk  cows by hand, that was our job. Then we had to separate the milk from  the cream and we just had to do it by hand with a machine. And then we  had little calves that we would take milk to, and also pigs. So we were  9  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  busy.  How many acres did your dad farm?  200.  I   d say you were really busy then.  Yeah.  Did he have hired help?  No.  Did he plow with a tractor or with a horse?  In the    30s we had horses. He always had a nice team of horses. I  remember we had four and it took two to pull the plows and cultivators  and stuff, so he would work two of them one day and two of them the  next day.  Well, that was nice. Good horses then.  Yeah, they sure were.  And he had a big barn?  Yes, we had a large barn. It had a hay loft in it and that   s where he put  his hay. And my sister and I had to get up there and push hay through a  scuttle hole down for the cattle.  Did he farm his entire life?  Yes.  So during the Depression, do you remember if they had any particular  major issues with financing anything?  Oh, I   m sure we did. But he stayed with the farming.  Did he have to do any outside work or he just was all farming and that  was it?  Well, during the hot dry drought years, the government come in and told  farmers if they would take their team of horses and their tools and go  into western Payne County and build terraces on farms  it would  keep  10  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  them from washing away. They did that and built ponds. They did that to  give the farmers a little money because it was rough during when the  drought was on.  Do you know some of the farms he actually got to do some of that on  here in Payne County?  No, I don   t. I don   t know. I just heard him say it was western Payne  County.  So that was WPA?  Yes.  And did your mother work outside the home any at all?  No.  She did her job on the farm.  Yes, sure did.  So if you went to school in a one-room schoolhouse up through the  eighth grade, about how many children would be     Well, there was just two in my class. (Laughs) But I think about 15, 16.  And one teacher?  One teacher, she taught them all.  So how early did you have to get up in order to get there on time if you  had to walk that far?  About six o   clock because we had to be at school, I think, by eight or  8:30. So we   d leave the house by seven o   clock.  You walked a mile and a half, even in the snow?  Oh yes, and the mud. (Laughter)  No school buses then?  No school buses for that, no.  Then after the eighth grade what?  11  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  I went to Glencoe High School. And they had buses and they come and  got us.  By that time. Were they heated? Did the buses have heaters?  Oh my, when I first started, no. No, we just learned to dress warm.  And then when you got home from school you had to do chores.  Yes.  Did you participate in FFA or 4-H?  No.  What   d you do for fun?  My sister was five years older than me so she didn   t like to play with  me. I had a dog and we played and I know I climbed trees. We had some  persimmon trees across the road from us and I lived in the persimmon  trees (laughter) because I did love persimmons and playing with my dog.  I   d play till dark.  How close was the closest neighbor, say your age, a playmate?  Well, we had one. We had a family about half a mile north of us.  So you got to see them occasionally?  Yes. Well, I went to school with them. And yes, I played with them.  So 200 acres, did you venture out very far from home with that many  acres to     Oh yeah. I knew every acre on that farm. I played.  Did it have a creek?  Yeah, we had a little shallow creek down through there and my mother  had a hard time getting me out of it. I know she at one time had made  me a little white pinafore to wear over my dresses. It was made out of  flour sacks, but she   d iron it up and starch it and it looked real pretty and  she got me ready. I went to the creek and I fell in. Then I came back  and   you know how it is, it was red. She learned not to dress me until  last because I did love to go to the creek.  12  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  And so she sewed a lot of your clothes?  Oh she did it all. Yeah, all of my clothes.  Using flour sacks or feed sacks?  Yes, I wore a lot of feed sack dresses. I even wore those when I was  going with my husband. (Laughter)  Did she have a pedal sewing machine?  Yes.  And did she teach you to sew?  No, because I was outside working. I learned to sew after I got married.  How did you meet your husband?  Well, that was a long story. I had gone to a barn dance. You know, used  to, the farmers, if they had a big barn and had a hay loft, when they fed  all the hay, usually in May or June, then in the summer months different  farmers would have a barn dance. And I had went to a barn dance nine  miles north of Stillwater with these neighbors I told you I played with  and that   s where I met him.  And that would   ve been in the early    40s?  That was 19 and 47.  So dated a year.  I was young when I married.  And had he been in the war? Or did he have to go to the war?  No, he was disabled enough that he didn   t have to go.  So barn dances, did they have live music?  Oh yes. This one had polka music. They all had brass instruments. And  dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  (Laughs) No banjos, huh?  No, not at that one. A lot of them I did go to they had fiddles and guitars  13  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  and stuff like that.  And would your dad have one in his barn when he finished?  No, we never did have one. I don   t know why, I don   t remember.  Did he go to them?  Oh, yes, some of them.  Did they have travelling ministers back in those days, too?  I don   t think so. We had different salesman come by and stuff. Like the  Tulsa Tribune paper, there was a family that came every year and took  our subscription for it. And then we had the 3K man come, he sold  medicines and flavorings, you know.  It was the 3K?  Yeah, he was out of Perry, Oklahoma.  I hadn   t heard that.  Yeah, that was one and the Watkins woman, she came too.  Like a traveling medicine man?  Well, they sold medicine. Mama bought some once. I know the 3K man  had a liniment that he sold that we thought was the best that there was.  Did she have some home remedies?  Oh, yes. I don   t remember going to the doctor very much. I know one  time I was bit by a snake and she stuck my foot down in the kerosene  can and it     It worked?  It worked, yeah.  What kind of snake, do you remember?  No, we didn   t know. Because I was barefooted, of course, and I   d went  with my sister up to hoe some cotton, chop some weeds out. I was on the  outside row and there were weeds and something bit me right on the  heel. It had two holes in it so my sister said it was a snake. I was a half a  14  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  mile from the house, and instead of her going with me, she sent me  alone, which wasn   t really a good thing. By the time I got to the house,  my foot was swollen and my mother, like I said, stuck it down in that  kerosene and then she put me to bed and turned a chair up where I could  put my foot up, you know. My dad was gone from the farm at that time.  When they harvested, they all gathered together and did it so he wasn   t  there. None of us could drive, so she just had to do the best she could.  She would   ve took me to the doctor but there wasn   t any way to do it,  until he got home anyway.  Was there a telephone where she could call and ask for instructions or  anything? Call a doctor?  No, we had a phone, but I don   t know how come.  Well, she may   ve just known that that would work then.  Yeah.  So he helped neighbors pull together and do one field and move to the  next?  Yes, that   s the way they did. My dad had a thrashing machine. It didn   t  have a motor on it. The neighbors that I knew, they had an old steam  engine and that   s what they used. They   d pull my dad   s thrashing  machine with that old steam engine and they   d go from farm to farm,  harvesting the grain that was made that year.  That must   ve been interesting to see that whole crowd coming.  Yeah, we had to cook for them, too. There were probably 12 to 15 men.  And I know my mother would fix a big feast for them. She and I would  go to the field, take a tub, probably the tub we bathed in, I don   t  remember, and we   d go gather corn and bring it back to the house and  shuck it and clean it and cook corn on the cob. And then we had potatoes  out of the garden, she   d fix that. She   d make several pies and we   d have  them. She always raised cabbage, so we always had slaw. It was a feast.  But we had to be sure and serve them.  How many days would they be there?  Usually they could harvest each person   s in one to two days.  Okay. So you only had to cook a couple of times then.  Yeah.  15  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  And then where would they sleep?  Oh, they went home at night. I think they must   ve had a car or  something   no, they took their teams home. I really don   t know, I can   t  remember.  Well, let   s see. So most of your clothes were homemade. You didn   t have  the hand-me-downs then if you   re     Oh yes, I did. I wore a lot of hand-me-downs because I was younger.  (Laughs)  And shoes? How many pairs might you     Mother and Dad would buy me a new pair when school started and I  wore those all winter, all till late in the Spring and then my mother  always had a Sears-Roebuck catalog and she   d order us a little pair of  sandals that probably cost 80 cents. And when we went to church or  anywhere we wore those sandals. Otherwise, we were barefooted.  Did you get bee stings very often?  No, I don   t remember bee stings, but I remember wasps and mud  daubers and stuff like that.  And if you got stung by one of those, how did she treat those?  Well, on the red ants somebody had   I don   t know whether you   ve ever  heard of bluing? We put that in the rinse water and it made the clothes  look whiter. I don   t know whether they were, but it made them look  whiter. She had heard that that was good for an ant sting and she   d daub  a little of that on it. And that liniment, that 3K liniment, always was used  for everything. So we made it.  Did she make biscuits?  Yes, every morning for breakfast.  From scratch.  Yeah.  And loaves of bread?  Yes, she made homemade bread. Some of my fondest memories was  walking home from school in the fall and smelling that homemade bread  16  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  she was just getting out of the oven. We always had butter because we  had cream. And she   d be making plum jelly. We   d get home and I  always wanted the heel, she   d let us slice enough off for that, my sister  and I. And then we   d slather that butter on and then that plum jelly. It  was really good. After we   d walked a mile and half, why we were  hungry.  Sure. And what would you drink, milk?  Yes, milk and water.  So she must   ve had a plum tree if she made plum jelly.  We had plum bushes in summer I remember and then we   d all go, my  sister and my mother and I, would go pick plums and she   d can them  and then when she needed jelly, she   d just drain the juice off and run the  pulp through a sieve and make homemade jelly or preserves, whatever  you wanted to call it.  So you learned some of those things, too. Do you do any of that today?  Yes, I did. I did that a lot when my children were small.  Do you do any now?  If I had them I would. (Laughter)  Probably tastes better too, doesn   t it, than this bought stuff?  Oh yes, yes. We   d pick blackberries also in the summer and my mother  would can them and she   d make blackberry jelly with stuff like that. If  she had a chance to get any peaches, why we   d do that. We usually had  one peach tree I remember and she   d can those. I remember when we   d  come home from school and she didn   t have anything else fixed, why  we   d open up a jar of peaches and she   d hand-whip some cream. We put  that on our peaches. My sister and I thought we were in hog heaven.  (Laughs) It sounds good to me, too.  It was good.  And it was hot in those days too, wasn   t it?  Very much. And then we didn   t have electricity.  No fans.  17  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  No fans, no.  Head out to the shade tree.  Yeah.  I   m assuming there was a shade tree.  Yeah, we had trees around the house. Also, my dad in summertime, he  just moved a bed outside and  we  slept  there  at night.  On the porch or just in the yard?  No, just out in the yard. That   s the way people did, cause it was hot, you  know.  Did the children get to do that too?  No, we usually slept in the house because we were scared.  Do you remember going to see your first movie at a movie theatre or a  drive-in?  I was probably 15 years old before I   well, once in a while, but we  didn   t get to go much. We   d go to Pawnee. They had two movie houses  up there. I think you could go for about a nickel and that   s about all we  ever got at one time. (Laughs) But I don   t remember going very much  until I got in high school.  In the    30s the Wizard of Oz came out and Gone With the Wind, so I was  just curious if you had seen     Yes, I remember seeing Gone With the Wind the first time. It was really  a good movie. I still love the movie, I   ve watched it many, many times.  Did you do a lot of reading during the summer?  Oh yes, we read if we had time. (Laughs)  Was there a library near by?  No, Glencoe didn   t have a library.  Was there a bookmobile or anything?  I don   t remember any. If we had a book, it usually was ours that had  18  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  been given to us. When I was small, I had a book, the Grimm   s  Fairytales. I would read them over and over and over, but I always liked  them.  Were your parents born in Oklahoma or how did they come here?  My mother was born in Arkansas in the Ozarks but my dad was born in  southwest Oklahoma around  Geary (Greenfield) .  So his family was in Oklahoma then, did you go visit very often during  those years?  No, we didn   t have money to buy gas to go.  And they didn   t come to you either?  No.  Did you write letters?  Yeah, we wrote lots of letters. I loved to write letters.  What was Christmas like?  Well, it wasn   t very much. (Laughs) I know that my sister and I would  always go cut a cedar tree for our tree and we saved our decorations  from year to year, mostly homemade. We   d make those little homemade  chains made out of paper and trim the tree. I know I got very few gifts. I  think three dolls is all I ever had in my whole life. That crippled cousin  that lived with us, he bought me a little rubber doll when I was about  five, I called him Jimmy. I still had him when I got married, but he had  gone through a lot of hot summers and he wasn   t as cute as he was when  I got him. And then another doll that I had, we   d draw names at school  at Christmastime and a girl got me a doll one time. And I can remember  for my birthday when I was about four or five, Mama got me a little  Kewpie doll. It was small enough that she could put it in a matchbox and  she lined it with cotton and the cloth and that   s what I got for my  birthday, that little doll. Those were the three dolls I had.  Well, the small one you could take it anywhere you wanted to.  Yes, I sure could.  Stick it in your pocket and go. Did your parents finish high school  themselves?  19  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  No, neither one of them got to. My dad was a family of 13 children. My  mother, there were nine children in her family.  How did he come to own 200 acres?  He didn   t own it, we were sharecroppers.  Sharecroppers, okay.  Yeah. In 1927 this farm come for rent and he leased it and he lived on it  21 years.  Leased it every year?  Mm-hmm.  And after the 21 years what?  He sold out and moved into Glencoe by then.  And he retired or did he do something in Glencoe?  Well, now he ran the cotton gin at Glencoe for a long time.  It   s not there anymore either, I don   t guess.  No, no it   s not.  On Saturdays did you go into town?  Yes, we usually went to town Saturday afternoon and saw everybody, all  the neighbors and stuff like that.  Any special treats like getting to go to the store and pick out candy or  ice cream or something?  Oh yes, I   d get a nickel. They   d give me a nickel and I could get a pretty  nice little sack of candy for a nickel.  Did carnivals come through?  No, not up there. At Pawnee and Stillwater, they had carnivals.  Did you get to come to them?  Well, Stillwater, not much, Stillwater was about 20 miles from us.  20  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Pawnee was about nine and that   s where we went a lot.  Would you go by car or on the horse?  We went by car.  And do you remember when he got his first tractor?  Yes, he got his first tractor in 1942. It was an old Farmall tractor that had  lug wheels on it. It didn   t have rubber tires. It had spiked wheels on it.  We thought we were uptown when he got that. And he really was.  Did you get to drive it?  I knew how to drive it, yes. I drove it some. Not much. But he let me  drive it.  So his main cash crop would   ve been cotton in the    30s.  Yes. Cotton was everybody   s cash crop around there.  And as far as you know he was able to make ends meet there in the    30s?  Yes. I know at Glencoe we had two grocery stores and that man, he was  real good. And my dad never would do it, but I had uncles that did, you  could charge your groceries all winter and then when you had your crop  come in, why everybody come in and paid it off. But now my dad,  instead of doing that, he would in the fall, when he harvested his cotton,  he would go and buy probably six to eight sacks of flour, 50 pound sacks  of flour that came in cloth bags. And he   d buy sugar and beans, things  that would keep. We had a room that we called the summer kitchen.  We   d move out there in the summer with the kitchen so we   d have more  room in the main part. But in the winter it was cold out there and he   d  stack them up and you had to get them off the floor or mice would get  them. So he would stack them up out there where it was cool. We  always had plenty of flour. And he butchered and we had lard and then  we had sugar he   d buy and the fruit that we   d can, why she could make  pies. So we made it. And cooked beans, we always had beans it seemed  like. And then all of the canned stuff that she canned out of the garden,  green beans and corn. And we had potatoes that we raised. So we lived  well.  So you really didn   t feel like you were in the Depression?  Oh no, I   m sure it worried my dad and mother but I was too little to  worry about that.  21  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  It took a lot of planning on his part.  Oh yes, but my dad didn   t like to owe anybody anything. And I know  that poor old grocery man, he worried about all those accounts that he  had on the different farmers. But he was good about letting them do it  because he knew they   d pay.  Do you carry over any of those habits from your dad today?  Oh, yes. I don   t like debts either. My husband and I, neither one like  debts. We owned our farms, we bought them. But just as soon as we  could pay them off, we did.  Let   s back up a minute. You got married in    48 and then what? Let   s just  do a little bit of a timeline.  We lived on his uncle   s farm. We were sharecroppers for eight years and  then we bought our first farm. I still live there where we bought it 53  years ago.  How many acres did you have?  Well, we started out with 80 and then there was an 80 coming up for sale  next to us and we bought that and then there was an 80 a mile east of us  and we bought that and then there was 150 coming up for sale and we  bought that. And I know my mother said,    Oh, you   ll never see the back  of your neck you   re in debt so deep.    But we got out real soon.  That   s a lot of acreage. So what was your primary crop?  Cattle. Most of it was pasture land.  So not cotton.  No, but I used to cry when I   d be picking cotton. I   d say,    I   m never  going to marry a farmer. And I   m sure never going to marry a cotton  farmer.    So when I started going with my husband I found out that he  was living on the farm too, I asked him did he ever mess with cotton. He  said,    I picked cotton one time and I swore up and down I   d never raise  cotton.    So I knew that was the man I wanted to marry. (Laughter) But  he was a farmer.  But no cotton.  No cotton.  22  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  And so you   ve farmed all of your life. How many children do you have?  I had three children. I lost one of my sons last year, but I had three  children.  And did any of them go into farming?  No. (Laughter) No, they didn   t.  But farming   s been a good life.  Oh, I would love to have seen them farmers. But my husband wanted to  make sure they got an education and they didn   t have to if they didn   t  want to.  Do you still raise cattle?  I have cattle. My husband   s dead but I still have cattle.  And still have all the land, too?  Yes, I still own all the land. My daddy used to say   he never got to own  any land and he wanted to, you know, and he   d say,    Don   t sell your  land because they   re not making any more.    He didn   t want us to sell it.  So I   ve still got it. My children, I   m sure, will sell it.  Well, maybe not all of it. They may keep the original 80.  They might. (Laughter) My house was built in 1906. It   s an old two-story  white farm house. We   ve remodeled it.  Older than the state, then.  Yes. I think people think I   m silly to stay out there on the farm, but I  love it out there.  I   m assuming you   ve updated it with electricity and indoor plumbing  and all that.  Oh yes, it has electricity and he remodeled it, my husband did, through  the years.  It   s home.  It   s home. And I don   t owe anything on it. (Laughs)  23  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  When you were in your childhood, you had an outhouse?  Yes. I had an outhouse after I got married for 12 years. And then we put  a bathroom in.  That would be early    60s then.  Yes. My son went to college down at Oklahoma City and he was having  to share a bathroom with four boys. And those boys were just griping  themselves to death about having to share a bathroom. He said,    Listen  boys, I can remember when we got our first bathroom so this isn   t bad at  all.    (Laughs)  Did they get to spend any time with your father on the farm, your kids?  No, my father was already     Out of the farming business?  Yeah. I was the last child and my mother was nearly 40 years old when I  was born. So they were old before my children got big. They   d go stay  with them at Glencoe though, that was a big treat.  How long was he in the cotton gin business?  Probably five years he ran that cotton gin. He started when we were still  out on the farm and then when they moved to Glencoe, well, he ran it.  How did he learn how to farm?  He was raised on the farm also. His dad, they had children, 13, so I don   t  think his father ever owned a farm either. But he worked for his uncles,  which lived down by Geary, Oklahoma, which was  south  of Watonga.  He helped his uncle on the farm for years until he got married. My  mother had been married and her husband died in the flu season there in  1918. She had come to Oklahoma so she could get work helping in  harvest time and picking cotton. And she met my dad, but she didn   t  think it was fair for him to take on the responsibility of two children. She  had two children. So she moved back to Arkansas, which was along the  Buffalo River and my dad followed her down there. They got married  and they lived there, I think, three years. They had 40 acres they had  bought but it was up on the ridge above the Buffalo River and it was  rocky and terrible land. But I know they said they raised tomatoes and  sold them to a cannery there. And the way they raised tomatoes, they  stuck them in the ground just a little bit because there wasn   t enough soil  and they put rocks around them to hold them up. They could raise, she  24  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  said, just bushels of tomatoes. There must   ve been something in those  rocks that was a mineral or something that was good.  Anyway, they farmed three years there and my half-brother, he was by  that time about 12 years old and him and my dad would take the old  horse and try to plow that rocky slope. My dad got tired of falling down  the hill with the horses and the plow, so he said to my half-brother,     Charlie, if you don   t take me back to Oklahoma, I   m going to run  away.    And he said,    I   m going to run away with you.    (Laughter) And  so they sold out after three years and moved back to Glencoe.  For your mother to have been travelling to Oklahoma with two kids as a  single woman, that must   ve been tough.  Yes, it was. It was. But her mother was still down in Arkansas, she  wanted to go back there and when my dad and mom moved back to  Oklahoma, they had her two oldest children and my sister was born  down there. When she was four months old, that   s when they moved  back to Oklahoma. They had an old Model T and they just loaded  everything that they could mostly and the rest of it they just had to sell it  or go off and leave it. They come to Oklahoma and picked cotton the  first winter. Then my dad had a chance to rent one farm, he did, 80  acres. And then this 200 acres come up that next year and they moved  onto that place and they lived there 21 years.  He must   ve liked farming a little bit.  He loved it but it was a lot different here than it was down there on those  rocky slopes. If they   d have kept that 40 acres though, it   d have been  worth a lot of money now because the Buffalo River, the government  has made a park all out of it now. So right where they were at, why they  could   ve probably sold it for good money now.  Well, they managed to survive and pass good genes and traits on to the  rest of you.  Yes, I was the only one of their children that stayed with farming. The  other ones, they farmed some when they first married but they wanted  out of it.  Too tired of those early mornings.  I guess, I don   t know. Well, they were tired of not having anything. My  husband had to work in town after a few years, but we made it.  To supplement the farming?  25  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Yes, yes. We couldn   t have made it if he didn   t. He got a job up at OSU  and we lived on that and all the cattle we sold. We paid our farms off.  We didn   t want to be in debt.  That   s a trait carried over from your dad, too. Is there anything you  want to cover that I haven   t asked about?  Well, going back to the lunches that we took to school. I know my sister  that was five years older than me, one time we got up one morning and  we didn   t have any bread to make our sandwiches with. So Mama had to  take those awful old biscuits and make us a ham biscuit to take to  school. My sister was ashamed. She didn   t want anybody to see us  eating a biscuit. Now it would be fashionable. But that day, we had to go  out, she and I   she made me because she was five years older than me.  (Laughs) She made me and her go out behind the coal house at school  and eat by ourselves because she didn   t want anybody to see us eating  our biscuit.  Probably other kids had biscuits, too.  Oh yes, I   m sure they did. And then one time Mama had an empty cereal  box and she put my sister   s  lunch  in a cereal box. Well, just as we were  getting ready to go to school, some calves got out. So she was getting  the calves back in and she hollered at me and told me to get her lunch.  So I grabbed a cereal box and when we got to school it had cereal in it  instead of her lunch. (Laughs) She said I had to share mine with her and  I didn   t want to. (Laughs) But you know I did, because she made me.  That was memories I never did forget.  Did you go to church?  Yes, we went into Glencoe to church.  Followed by a big Sunday meal?  Oh, yes. Mama would come home and fix a big Sunday meal. And we  usually had relatives in to eat with us on Sunday because my dad would  always butcher and we always had meat. Others didn   t and so they   d  come to our place to eat on Sunday.  And then what did they do after they ate their meal?  They   d sit around and talk and us kids would play outside.  Did they have a radio?  26  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  We got our first radio in    41. My dad got it and the reason he got it was  to listen to when Joe Lewis was boxing, that   s when he got it. And then  he also had a nephew that went to the war. I can remember my daddy  sitting by the radio and listening because there was a lot of static, you  know, it was the old battery radio. He   d listen at it and I   d see big tears  rolling down his cheek and he   d say,    Toughie   s       (We called the  cousin Toughie, it was his nephew.) And he   d say,    Toughie   s in a big  battle over there right now.    He just worried about him being killed. He  was wounded, but he come back home alive.  Radio was a popular thing back in those days.  Yes, they were. My husband and I had a radio after we got married.  When we   d been married about three months we decided we wanted a  radio. We had electricity so we bought a radio and we listened to   there  was a program on called One Man   s Family and it come on at 6:30 in the  evening. We   d get done with the chores and get in there and listen to  One Man   s Family. (Laughter)  And then go to bed early?  Oh, yeah. Well, we played Dominoes and Monopoly and stuff like that  to not have to go to bed so early, you know. And then yeah, I guess  about 8:30 we   d be in bed.  And then up by what the next day?  Probably six, 5:30 or six.  Those were good times too, even though they were tough?  Yes they were. We knew what hard times was and we were really  thankful when we had a little bit.  I wanted to ask about dime stores. Did Pawnee     Yes, Pawnee had a five and ten cent store. It was called Ernie   s. I think  they   re still there.  Really?  I used to love to go in there. I know I   d have maybe ten or fifteen cents  and I loved to go in there and buy my mother a little something, like a  little pretty cut dish or something like that. I   d do that and my sister  would do the same. I have a bowl that my sister bought there in 1938  and gave my mother. She kept it for several years after my mother died.  27  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  And a few years ago she brought it and she said,    I thought you would  enjoy it, too.    So I   ve got it now. My daughter will probably get it.     38, so it   s 70 years old. No chips?  I think it has one little chip on it. It   s kind of a blue-ish glass bowl. And I  can remember what my mother put in it. She always made her banana  pudding. She was famous for her banana pudding and she   d put it in that  bowl.  That   s a special memory.  Yes. My sister and I were talking a while back. I said,    Do you  remember what Mama always put in this?    And she said,    I sure do, it  was banana pudding.    (Laughter)  Sounds good.  Yes, she could make the best banana pudding I ever ate. And she didn   t  make it from a box either, she made it from scratch.  Can you do the same?  Yes, yes. I very seldom use a pudding, because I don   t really care for the  bought one. (Laughter)  So she shared some of her recipes with you?  Oh, I   ve got some of hers. When I first married I started collecting  recipes out of the papers and magazines and I have box after box of  them that will probably be destroyed, but I still use some of those. I have  recipes that I   ve used 50-some years.  You may have to share some of those.  Yes, I have some good ones. I know a pound cake. My kids always said  I made the best pound cake around. And that recipe is very, very old.  You   ll have to share it. Well, tell us a little bit more about cotton  picking.  I was the last child in the family, so before I started to school, my  mother would take me to the field with her and she would let me ride on  her cotton sack. And I think now, how in the world did she do it, the  cotton she   d pick and me, too. It added up to quite a bit. And she always  knew that I   d get hungry before we went back to the house, so if she  28  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  didn   t have anything to make me a sandwich with, she would take  homemade bread and slice it and just cover it with butter. She   d sprinkle  sugar on it and make me a sandwich so I   d have something to eat before  we went to the house.  And how much cotton would she pick?  I don   t remember. I   m sure she was a good cotton picker because that   s  all she   d ever done. But she didn   t get a lot. I know after I got bigger I  had to pick cotton and I was lucky if I got 30 pounds a day. (Laughs)  That wasn   t anything   How much would one bag hold?  Well, I imagine they could get 200 pounds in it.  So you didn   t get one quite full each day?  No, no, no, I never got any. I can remember when my sister was married  and she was pregnant with her first child her and her husband picked  cotton, well she couldn   t pull a sack because she was pregnant but she   d  pull alongside him and put in his bag. And I thought that was something.  They farmed also and during World War II, I know we were over there  at their house helping them chop cotton and it was a real hot day and an  airplane come over real low and we thought we were being bombed and  we all went to the ground and laid flat. (Laughter) But it was just an  airplane flying over.  So what   s the difference between picking cotton and chopping cotton?  Oh my, chopping cotton you started in usually just as soon as school was  out really, about the latter part of May, why we had to go out and thin it  out. You get it too thick, it wouldn   t make and we had to thin it out and  then get the weeds and the grass out of it. That was hard work too, but  that wasn   t as hard as picking the cotton.  So once your sack was full, what did you do with it?  Well, we had to pull it until we got to the end. And then my dad would  usually be there to weigh it and he   d weigh each person   s amount of  cotton and write it down because the workers that weren   t our family got  paid.  By how much they picked?  Yes.  29  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  So about how long would a row be?  Oh my gosh, that one row in that one field, it was half a mile long. And  we   d go down it and then back with it.  So for him to be weighing it, you   d go up and back down?  Yes.  So you   d get two rows for him to weigh.  Yes.  When he weighed it, was it on a truck or what were his scales?  It was just an old cotton scale. It was just a very simple scale, but it was  very seldom wrong. It had what you call a pea weight, it   d hang on  there. He   d get the scales leveled out and then he   d hang the cotton on  there and he   d just keep moving this pea until it was level. And that  would tell you how many pounds you had of cotton.  Do you happen to remember how much they might   ve got paid per  pound? The helpers?  Two and three cents.  A pound?  Yeah.  More incentive to hurry up and make it up and down the aisle.  Yeah. This cousin of mine that could pick so much, why she   d always  have a pretty good check at the end of the week.  And did you actually get a check yourself?  No, no. (Laughs)  You were free labor, huh?  Yeah, the only time I ever got paid to pick cotton was when I was  picking for neighbors. I remember the winter before I started going with  my husband, I had picked cotton and I had bought a new coat   first  bought coat I   d ever owned, and I bought some clothes. And I didn   t  even know I was going to be going with him, but I was really glad that I  30  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  did it because I had a few bought things that I never had had before.  Let   s talk a little bit about the wedding. Did you elope?  Well, sort of. My dad and mother knew we were going to get married  and we were getting married up at Pawnee. We had went up on  Wednesday to take a blood test   then you had to have a blood test and  you had to wait three days on the results of it. We went back up on  Saturday to get the results of it and the doctor had never sent it off. So  my husband   s old car, we knew it wasn   t going to make it very far. So  my cousin had a better car and he took us back to Stillwater and there  was an old doctor down on Washington Street, I was trying to think  what his name was, but anyway he was open on Saturdays. So he took  us up to the hospital and run the blood tests for us and gave it to us, so  by the time we got back to Pawnee, it was five o   clock in the evening.  At that time the courthouse stayed open on Saturday, the county clerk,  where we got our license. But it was closed by the time we got back up  there.  Well, this cousin was going with a girl that her mother worked in the  clerk   s office so she called this county clerk and said,    Would you come  down and open up and get these kids a license?    And she says,    Well,  my daughter   s getting married at six o   clock.    But she says,    I tell you,  if they want to wait, after the wedding   s over, I   ll come back and open  up and get their license.    And so by that time it was late. So it was 10:30  at night when I got married and we were married by a blind judge in  Pawnee and I never did forget that. That   s when we were married.  10:30 at night.  10:30 at night.  Were your parents there with you?  My dad said,    No, I   m not going to be there tonight,    because my dad  went to bed early. He said,    Just go ahead and get married, it   s okay.     So we did. He didn   t want me to get married that young, but he finally  gave in. He knew that I was wanting to get married.  You finished high school?  Yeah, that   s all I did.  Do you have wedding pictures?  Yeah, we took our wedding picture about three months after we got  31  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  married. Dad bought me a new dress and I never did forget it. It was  kind of a chiffon dress, it was thin and it was very pretty. It was a grey  background and it had little fuchsia flowers all through it. And I was so  proud of that when I got married.  You wore that to get married?  Yes.  Well, I bet it   s pretty. Do you still have it?  No, I don   t know what happened to it. Like I said I never moved but two  times in my whole life. I never lived in but three houses in my whole  life. So when I married, I didn   t own much. We could haul it in the car  and I did take the dress then. And when I had my first baby the first  year, well I wanted to be sure that I could still wear my dress. I was  hoping I could and I could for awhile, then I got too big to wear it.  Special memories, too. So Pawnee was where you did most of your  business.  Yeah, that   s where my husband and I courted and then that   s where we  were married.  It   s a square, isn   t it?  Pawnee? Yeah, it   s on the square, yes. Hasn   t grown any, I don   t think. I  think it   s just like it was up there.  Do you remember when he actually sold out on the farm and went to  town, what that was like for him?  I   m sure it was hard for him, but he was working at the gin.  Already?  Yes. There was a little hill there by the cotton gin. And one winter     well, when I was a junior in high school there was a whole bunch of us  girls got together, there was a big snow on, and we went down there and  slid down that hill. We had lots of fun. It was junior and senior girls.  (Laughs)  Did you wear blue jeans?  Yes, we were beginning to. I know I was in high school when I got my  first pair of blue jeans.  32  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  I think if you   re sledding it would be cold if you had to do it in a skirt.  Oh, yeah. (Laughs) Yes. Yes, when I was a little girl and walking to  school I had to wear those old cotton socks, long socks, and supporters  to hold them up. And I hated them, I just hated them. But you know, we  had to have something on our legs walking to school.  In dresses then, too?  Yes, oh yes. I can remember when we walked to school, my sister was  five years older than me and she was tall. She had the longest legs I   ve  ever seen and she could walk fast. And she   d say to me in the winter  when we were going to school, there was big old deep ruts frozen you  know, and she would say to me,    If you don   t keep up with me, there   s  boogers over there in the ditches and they   ll get you.    I would run and  fall in those ruts and cry. (Laughter) But she just kept walking. She  wanted me to keep up with her and I was little and I couldn   t.  Did she finish that school and go on to high school, too?  Yes, she went to high school then I went five years by myself out there  at the little school.  Is it still there, the school?  No, no they tore most of those little schools down. Although we do  have, where I live now is in the Elm Grove Community and as a farm  women club, we kept our little building all up. So it   s still there.  Did your husband participate in some of the conservation efforts that  they had, county agents and stuff?  Yes, he did. He did, after we bought our farm.  Terracing, probably didn   t have to do much of that, it   d already been  done.  It   d been done, but built new ponds and stuff. He went through the  conservation thing. And then the conservation thing helped me have a  guy come in and cut cedar trees because the cedar trees are getting so  bad in Payne County.  They   re everywhere, aren   t they?  Everywhere, yes.  33  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Do you remember going through any tornadoes?  Oh, yes. Not too many when I was a kid. My dad, he always made us go  to the basement. It was in part of the house and so we could go into the  basement. He   d make us go down there. We didn   t have any electricity  so just an oil lamp or something and I hated to go to that cellar because  there were always spiders crawling on the wall. (Laughs) But my  husband and I went through several tornadoes and had damage. I had  damage this spring. It blew down ten of my big trees right in the yard.  And then the ice storm we had a couple of years ago did some damage.  Oh yeah, I didn   t have too much. Lucky we didn   t have too much ice out  there. But boy this tornado that went through in February of this year, it  really did, it just blew big trees down right into my yard.  And where were you during this?  There was a college boy helping me and we were in the barn when it  came up working calves. We didn   t know it was so bad until we come  out. He looked up to the southwest, this kid did, and he said,    That   ll be  here in three minutes.    So we took for the house and we just barely got  on the porch when the trees started falling. This boy had just said this  morning,    I never saw a tornado.    But he did see. (Laughs) He saw that.  I bet he won   t utter those words again.  He will remember those trees falling.  When  your dad  had his team of horses and switched to a tractor, did  he keep the horses?  Yes, we kept two of them. He still had them when he sold out.  Just because he couldn   t part with them?  I think so, because he didn   t use them. But my dad always took care of  his horses.  Did he ride any of them?  Oh, we had one that we could ride, but he was so fat you couldn   t put a  saddle on him, so we had to ride him bareback. And one time I rode him  and I fell off of him and broke my collar bone. I can remember that real  well.  34  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  If you were doing hay, was it in bales or just loose hay?  It was in bales.  Square bales, not round bales.  Yes. And I told about the thrashing crew and us fixing the meals for  them. That was quite a deal. But we always had to have a water boy and  I did that one year. I rode the horse and carried jugs. I   d go to the well  and fill them up and they were old clay pot kind of pottery jugs and I   d  go from wagon to wagon letting the men get a drink.  Walking?  No, on the horse. And then I   d go back and fill them up again and take  them back out in the field to them. Now we had straw piles or hay piles.  The thrashing machine would separate the grain from the straw and it  made a load of these hay piles. Daddy used that for hay in the winter,  he   d let the cattle in there until they cleaned that up. Boy, they would  too. I   ve helped stack hay in the barn. I couldn   t ever go but three bales  up, that was as far as I could lift, but I could do that and take a hay hook  and pull it back so somebody else could stack it.  And you mentioned earlier that you had corn. Did you do popcorn?  No, we never did raise popcorn. My mother would buy that. That was  corn for the hogs that we had. It was still in the fresh stage in the field,  my mother would gather it and can it.  And then did they grind it for cornmeal?  No, we didn   t.  Got that in town from someone else?  Yes. That was another staple that my dad bought in the fall that we   d  have so we could have cornbread once in awhile. My mother wasn   t  very crazy about cornbread because she was raised in Arkansas and they  couldn   t raise grain down there, the land was so rocky. And so they  could raise a little corn and she was tired of corn. (Laughter) So she  made light bread always. We had bread, you know, to eat.  It   d be biscuits or flour probably.  Yeah.  35  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Did they have grapevines?  We didn   t. We could go out and pick wild grapes that grew in the trees,  we called them possum grapes. They weren   t good to eat. They were  small, about like your little finger and we   d gather them and my mother  would boil the juice off of them and make jelly out of it. I heard about  some people in the early days taking those old possum grapes and  getting the juice and sweetening it and then drop dumplings into it and  cook them. They said they were good. I never did do it.  Well sugar helps, doesn   t it? (Laughter)  Yes, it sure did. And you didn   t have to worry about your weight then  because you were working so hard.  Worked it off.  My sister and I, we didn   t have a pond on the farm that we lived on, so  we had water for the cattle in a big stock tank. She and I, every evening,  had to fill that old stock tank up and it took a lot of cranking an old hand  pump.  Actually hand pumping it?  Yeah. That was our job. We had to make sure the cattle had fresh water.  And if you didn   t?  Well we didn   t. We did.  You knew better, huh?  Yes. Well, we knew the cattle wouldn   t have any water to drink. We felt  sorry for them so we pumped it. And my sister always made sure that I  pumped as many strokes as she did.  Even though you were smaller.  I was small, yes. And I also said that we separated our milk. We had a  machine that had a handle on it and you had to crank it so that we could  separate the cream from the milk. I can remember cranking that when  my hand wouldn   t hardly go up and over, it was too short. But that was  things that we had to do.  And what about doing laundry?  36  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Well Mother got her first washing machine in 1941 and like I said, they  didn   t have electricity so she got an old gasoline powered washing  machine. We were uptown when she got that.  So before that did she have to do it in a tub?  Yes, on an old scrub board and heat her water out in the yard in a big old  black kettle. I know when she got her first washing machine, Daddy got  a check from soil conservation. He had done something and they were  helping the farmers and he got a  98 check. We set down and we had a  family conference as for what we were going to spend that money for:  either a windmill or my mother a washing machine. And we all wanted  to get her a washing machine. The windmill would   ve sure helped my  sister and I though, not have to pump water.  Did he get that another time?  No, we never did get a windmill. There was a windmill on our place  when we bought it but we had a tornado and it messed it up. (Laughs) So  we never did use it.  Pumping water would give you arm muscles.  Oh yeah, and like I said, we didn   t have to worry about our weight. My  sister and I were just as slim as a rail when we were girls.  And ate what you wanted.  Ate what we wanted, yeah. We were hungry and we ate at night because  like I said, we   d walked a mile and a half from school and then did all  those chores. I know we   d milk eight cows and each one of us milked  two. And we did that by hand.  A family affair.  A family affair, yeah.  All four of you there at one time?  Yes. Well, sometime my dad got real busy and we   d have to milk his  cows.  You had cats in the barn?  Oh yes, we always had cats. They loved the milk. Then we   d take the  milk back to the house and separate it and then we   d take the separated  37  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  milk and feed the baby calves, the calves of the cows that we milked.  We   d feed them, and the baby pigs, young pigs love milk too. So we had  a use for everything.  Nothing went to waste, I guess.  No. And the cream, my mother and dad sold. You could sell it at  Glencoe at the grocery store. There was somebody that come by and  picked it up at the grocery store and brought it to Stillwater to the  creamery. That   s where they made their butter and stuff. My mother  always churned her own butter. And she did it by hand. She just had a  half gallon jar that she   d shake. I tried that, but it never turned to butter  for me. (Laughter)  You have to get it going pretty fast I would think or it wouldn   t get hard.  Yeah, she   d sit and do that. We always had plenty of butter to eat when I  was a kid.  Sounds like she was a great lady.  Yes, she was. She worked awfully hard.  You both did.  She lived till she was 78.  To have kind of a hard beginning, that   s     Yes, she did lots of hard work in her life. I did a lot of hard work, too.  Like I said, I was the only child that stayed with the farming.  And those of us who haven   t farmed appreciate you hanging in there.  Yes, people still marvel at me still having cattle at my age. It   s just hard  to give them up.  Those are little sweet faces too, aren   t they?  There   s nothing like going out in the pasture and finding a new baby  calf. And I think that   s why I stay with it.  How many do you have?  I   ve got close to 40.  38  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  Finchum  Ingham  That   s enough to keep you busy.  Very busy.  Well you can just dwindle them down if you want.  Yes, yes. I did, I got rid of some this summer. Should get rid of all of  them but I haven   t quite made my mind up yet.  Do you have a herd dog?  No, I   ve got a dog but he   s not a herd dog. (Laughter) He   s a house dog.  He   s a big old black lab, weights 77 pounds but he still is my puppy.  Keeps you company.  Yeah, he sleeps on the floor. I put him a quilt down on the floor there at  the foot of my bed and that   s where he sleeps. And then if he wants to go  out early in the morning, he   ll come (snorts) and I   ll know he needs to  go. But he   s lots of company to me.  Most farmers have a dog or two like that.  Yes. Oh, I   ve always had a dog, when I was a kid at home we always  had dogs. I always was good with them. And my oldest sister, my oldest  half-sister, she   s still got a dog, too. My other sister, she doesn   t care too  much about them. But my older sister and I, we   re both dog women.  (Laughter)  Okay, if you don   t have anything else, let   s wrap it up. Thank you for  coming.  Thank you.  -------  -------
