Story_ID: 300268
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Arthur Clark] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is--or was Winifred, W-I-N-I-F-R-E-D, Elizabeth, Crews, C-R-E-W-S, Clark.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth was September 30, 1923, in Trenton, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  First of all how far back can you trace that side of the family?
Speaker 2: That side of the family is very difficult to trace because both of my parents--both of my mother's parents died when she was young.  Her mother died--both her parents basically died from tuberculosis, and both were gone by twelve.  But when her mother died she went to live with an aunt so the family was split up and there were five sisters and brothers and they were all split up.  And she went to live with an aunt who we then later began to call Granny.  So she was--it was sort of a Cinderella's story.  The Granny--the aunt who sort of treated her like the, you know, like the, the servant girl.  And so, we don't really know that much.  What we do know about my mother's side of the family is that the women were strikingly beautiful which went for my mother as well and that they were sort of known for that.  And the other sad part of it is that as we were able to trace back a couple of generations.  My mother's side of the family seems to have had weaknesses in terms of heart ailments.  So her entire family--my mother's entire family--of five sisters and brothers, parents and aunts and uncles everybody was really gone by the time they were sixty, early sixties of heart ailments.  And that was no less true of Grace [Crews], who was my grandmother who died in her thirties of a heart ailment.  But I also understand that both she and grandfather had touches of tuberculosis along the way, but she actually died from a heart ailment.  And that's actually--my mother died from it at forty-eight.
Speaker 1: Uh.
Speaker 2: And I do know that the Crews name came, we're not quite sure how, but it actually is from Spaniards.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is their tradition in your family of having come from of your mother's side of having come from somewhere other than New Jersey?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Do they have a southern root (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Or Caribbean?
Speaker 2: I know very little about my mother's side of the family I think because they were all split up. I mean there were tons of them, you know, of the--of my generation the older generations sort of died out.  But of us, you know, the children and the cousins of this generation they're--I mean we take up a whole county.  But we really don't have much information.  And actually, one of my relatives has attempted now through birth and death records to try to re-create some things.  When we get to my father's side of the family, that's a different story (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 2: My mother's side of the family we don't know.
Speaker 1: Now your mother's side it seemed like there be some kind of island connected with a name like Crews or Cuba or a Spanish?
Speaker 2: No there were was never (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or Dominican?
Speaker 2: There was never an island connection that we are aware of what we believe is that it was a slave owner.  And that it was not an island connection although when you look at my mother's people, they all looked very as if they were some kind of Hispanic roots in them.  They were all, you know, very olive complexion dark curly wavy hair that was, you know, sort of the look on my mother's side of the family.  So it, it would suggest that but we just have no information at all sort of a sad thing 'cause we have so much on my dad's side but my mother's side very little.  And I think that's because they were all split up as youngsters and there was no oral histories which on my father side was a tremendous amount of oral history.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's no other place other than New Jersey?
Speaker 2: That I'm aware of.
Speaker 1: There was slavery in New Jersey (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Of course we all know that, that it was before 1830 that there was slavery in New Jersey, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  But we don't know where they came from, the thought is that it might have been in Virginia, which is also where my father's family came from, but there's just been a hint of that and there's just nothing really to back that up.
Story_ID: 300269
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Winifred Crews Clark] talk about growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was real hard, you know, she was the--like I said it was sort of Cinderella.  You know, not allowed--she did very--excelled in school but was not allowed to participate in any activities, was forced to come home was not allowed to even go to school in the morning until her chores were all done.  And then she had to walk, you know, meaning it wasn't three miles to school, but it was just about three miles to school she had to walk.  And not allowed to leave until, till every chore was done and school was not considered a priority.  So she grew up with an aunt who wasn't very pleasant with her got very close to first cousins really wasn't as close as she would have liked to have been with her own siblings because like I said they were all split up with different relatives.  And I think really was very happy to have left home (laughter).  Even when she got of age, and she married my father [Arthur Clark] when she was seventeen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she didn't--did she have a chance to finish high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did finish high school she got her diploma but with a lot of, you know, as I remember now a lot of hurdles and the fact that she had to really want it.  With, with her aunt that she lived with, it was, she was told that it wasn't a priority, she was told she wasn't a priority.  She was told, you know, all kinds of negatives about herself that would definitely not have caused her to have--would not have been a means of high expectations on any part of any family members for her ever.  And so, for her to have even stayed in excelled grade wise and to have even stayed in school was a major accomplishment.  Like I said even getting to school nobody was, you know, was encouraging her to school no one was helping her to get there.  And as a matter of fact, the opposite was true.  Even when she did get involved with an activity she was told no you can't do that how dare you even think that you can, you know, be on the dance--on the committee to plan a senior dance.  You know, you're not good enough and, you know, you're not allowed to go.  So she was forced many times to just stay home and not participate in anything that was going on.  There was a carnival down the street she wasn't allowed to go.
Speaker 1: She was a good student?
Speaker 2: She was a good student, yes.
Speaker 1: All right, did she want to go to college or something you know?
Speaker 2: No I don't think she had expectations past high school not that I ever heard.  I mean she had high expectations for all of us.  And, you know, I guess I never really thought about 'til we're talking about it now is that a lot of those high expectations may have even come from how much of a struggle she had to get her education.  And how much she must have wanted it in order to go through all of that.  But I think in, in her time I just don't think college was a thought, I don't think college was a big thing.  But for all four of us, it was a, it was a--wasn't a mandate, but it definitely was--if you wanna go we'll get you there somehow.
Story_ID: 300270
Speaker 1: Now can you tell us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Arthur, A-R-T-H-U-R, Horace, H-O-R-A-C-E, Clark.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is June 13, 1918, Pennington, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Less than a mile from the house I lived in my whole life.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about your father's side of the family in terms of their ancestors how far back?
Speaker 2: Well we go back to Madagascar, which I always understood was a little bit different, but we haven't been able to--through oral history mostly.  We know that we had a relative who was known by one name Delilah [ph.] who came over from Madagascar.
Speaker 1: Uh, now, now this is interesting because I've heard, I heard a few other people, you know, which Madagascar as a place of origin passed down through the family.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Most of them are and Arkansas and Texas.  Texas and Arkansas (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's interesting.
Speaker 1: But, you know, so there's a, there's definitely, you know, something that there is a chapter in our history we really don't know that much about 'cause most of, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of black people in the United States are descendants from West Africa.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Generally from the coast of Nigeria, Ghana.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, Liberia around there and not from, you know, a place like Madagascar you hardly think that they would be, but they are, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there a story in your family as to how they, they came here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No there wasn't really a story as to how they get your but, I--the running thing is that if you go to Madagascar today, you'll see a lot of people who look like us (laughter) look like my family looks.  So, but we were able to trace it, and again it was an oral history my father wrote it down because his mother [Pinkie Coles Clark] told him.  And she wrote it down because it was passed down to my father side of the family as well as her side of the family.  And so and Delilah--gee I wish we could've given this 'cause I have it written down, and I didn't bring the writing with me.  But and I haven't memorized it all, but Delilah goes all the way back and she's about four generations back four or five.
Speaker 1: All right, so she would be a great, great, great (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Great-grandmother I think, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay her name would be Delilah?
Speaker 2: Delilah.
Speaker 1: Is there a last name for her?
Speaker 2: No, no last name.
Speaker 1: Okay. And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they, and they listed her as a Madagascar Indian, and I don't know what that means but it wasn't just from Madagascar but a Madagascar Indian.
Speaker 1: A lot of East Indians settled in East Africa--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, back when the British empire was going on, you know, East Indians were brought over to Tanzania and Kenya and other places Madagascar was certainly a place.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that makes sense, makes sense I mean, all of this has been written down recently you need to, you know, if anybody is watching that's something to follow up on if you're in school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So are there any traditions from Madagascar that are passed down through the family that you're aware of?
Speaker 2: You know, it's funny my daughter recently had to do some background thing for school and so, you know, one of those, you know, bring a dish from where your family from.  And I decided that we would do a little research on the Internet and look at all the things that came from Madagascar.  And it's funny they're not--I wouldn't say that it's a tradition that came from Madagascar, but there definitely some dishes--in Madagascar they're very--they live very much off the land heavily.  You know, probably the grains the rices but other than that heavily in the greens and the living off the land kind of thing.  And my family is a huge, you know, anything that you can grow that you can cook in a pan (laughter).  You know, not so much raw vegetables but anything.  You know, we used to have something that grew wild called creasies, and we would cut them.  And you stir-fry 'em that's not--there not really like they're kind of green, but they grow real close to the ground, and you stir-fry them in a pan and (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do they grow in New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they grow 'em all over New Jersey, yeah.  And well, you know, again I, I don't know when my dad just found them or--but they're called cresies, and they grow low to the ground.  And when they get a yellow flowered there bitter.  So you don't want to eat em then, but they cut them low to the ground and my father, and this is my father's side of the family.  He is definitely a--he was always involved with landscaping and involved with the land and is much more comfortable outside than inside.  But definitely, whatever you can find you can grow those are the best things to eat. And that's very much a tradition with Madagascar people so.
Speaker 1: Are cresies the same thing as dandelions?
Speaker 2: No they're not dandelions they have a different taste but same kind of when--they grow wild, so if you look in a field like in New Jersey, we had a lot of land.  And when you looked in the field, you could see these patches growing close, close to the ground.  And you cut 'em at the roots then and just saute 'em in a pan.  But like I said once they got the yellow tops, but they weren't dandelion tops but they did get a yellow kind of flower, and then they were bitter you didn't want them then.
Story_ID: 300271
Speaker 1: Any other stories about that side of the family?  Now they--that's a long time ago for them to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well we, we bring up that's--and that is my father's [Arthur Clark] side of the family.  And so they settled in Virginia on my father side of the family.  My grandmother [Pinkie Coles Clark], my grandmother's my maternal--this is my father's maternal side of the family.  And they came to Virginia and at some point, they became freemen very early on.  My grandmother and her mother and her family were all free.  And I'm not sure exactly when that happened, but it was one generation back from my father's paternal side.  So the story is that in Gretna, Virginia, which is where my great--where my grandfather [Henry Clark] was born and raised.  And he was born in 1864 same year my grandmother was born 1864 which is the--around the time of Reconstruction.  They were both born free, but my grandfather's family had been slaves, and my grandmother's family had been free.  And they lived about ten miles from each other in a small town.  And I went down to look around and find the slave family for the Clarks I don't know I'm sure you're familiar that when you go look in the birth records for slaves, there is no entry for father's names.   There barely entry 'cause they were considered chattel so you would see the date of birth, you would see baby boy, and you would see the mother's name.  And a lot of times there would be a slave name like Dolly.  And then you'd see the slave and then there would be a listing for the slave owner, so it's never a listing for the father.  So it's sort of hard to find relatives that way.  And then what we would do is try and double check death records because those are--you can find those a little easier.  And also, we checked marriage records whenever we could find them.  And what we found was that there were seem to be two large slave owners name Clark, one was the father one was the son.  And so what we did was we looked at--we did find my great-great-grandmother's name.  And we looked at all the children that were born of them, so we were able to find some relatives (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was her name your great-great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: My great-great-grandmother's name was--as I talk I'll remember it.
Speaker 1: That's okay, we'll just keep going.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have this in writing so I wish I brought it--
Story_ID: 300272
Speaker 1: And one of the interesting things we found in that process was that on my grandfather's side that he had always told my father [Arthur Clark] that he was the seventh son of a seventh son.  And but we didn't know all these seventh sons, so we were--we had a list of who his brothers were, and we found out somewhere half-brothers.  And we found a brother in the birth records that we've never heard of before.  So my father--when we went through these records it was my father's and two of his sisters.  And so it was sort of interesting for them to find this uncle who they had never even heard talk about so but on my father's side of the family everybody settled in Virginia--on my grandmother's side of the family.  On my grandfather's side of the family, everyone settled in this Virginia area.
Speaker 2: Now what, what's the, the folklore the tradition about being a seventh son of a seventh son?
Speaker 1: I don't know, I don't know I, I really don't know the folklore associated with that, but he used to just say that, you know, and there may be I have to go look that up there must be some folklore about that but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, some kind of folklore. I think being born the veil, the seventh son.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there probably is something, but he would tell my father that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They have blues songs written about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he was the seventh son of a seventh son and my grandfather's name was Henry Ballard [Henry Clark], and he was quite a character he was.  And my grandmother's name was Pinkie Coles [Pinkie Coles Clark] and the Coles family again were free. And the Clarks who lived ten miles up the road had been slaves.  And actually my grandfather and my grandmother--there are conflicting stories, but as I understand it they did not actually meet and get married until they both left Virginia and came north to New Jersey.  And then they met, and they happened to be from towns only you know ten minutes from each other and settled in the area where my family still lives in New Jersey.  But what else we know about them is that my grandmother raised, you know, my grandmother raised, you know, other children when she was a young girl.  Like she helped raise some other people, so we went to that area we had a hard time finding Coles, who were relatives.  But we found a guy who actually was a taxi driver who was in his nineties who told us that my grandmother had helped raise him.  And we also found another woman named Cleo [ph.], who now is 102 who was a Coles and who was raised as the Cole in any event in the same area.  So we were able to find, you know, the family church we were able to find a lot of information.  But the next step for us is to go to Richmond [Virginia] because again if you are hearing as I'm talking there are pieces we have, but we don't have sort of, cogent story because it's very hard to piece together.  But in any event, my grandfather came north, and my grandmother came north and they got married, and they had twelve children, and my father was the youngest of the twelve children.
Story_ID: 300273
Speaker 1: Now did your father [Arthur Clark] talk about growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And what it was like?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father had a great family and still does have a great family he's--like I said he's the youngest of twelve, and right now there are he and two sisters left.  But growing up, they actually grew up primarily in the house across the street from where my father lives today.  And it was about on five acres they had pigs, and they had chickens, and they had big gardens and they lived heavily off the land.  And it was a wonderful family I mean, that's most of what I've always heard my grandfather [Henry Clark] wasn't a hard-working kind of guy.  He was a hard drinking, you know, happy-go-lucky kind of guy who my grandmother [Pinkie Coles Clark] sort of had to make him always go work. But they were able to raise twelve children, heavily like I said, on the work of the land.  So my grandfather, my grandmother were both born in 1864 and stayed--and were married when they were young teenagers and stayed married to both of them died in their late eighties in that time.  And my grandfather was known for tomato wine he could make tomato wine (laughter) that didn't quite taste like wine.  My fathers inherited that that recipe, and if you ever tasted tomato wine, it more taste like some very hard liquor to (laughter) you then wine so.  But he always kept a beautiful garden and kept his family fed, again working off the land.  And my grandmother could always take a pig and the story is that she used everything but the oink which I know it's been a story other people have told.  Including we had neighbors who were from Eastern Europe who would come and takes the blood and make the blood pudding off it 'cause my grandmother didn't use that part.  But they loved it, and they would take the blood and do the blood pudding, but she made everything else.  From bacon, to hogs head cheese, to ham and so the family always ate very well.  And so the cornerstone of our family has always been food and sitting around the kitchen.  And I remember back as long as I was a kid--since I was a kid, and I remember my father telling stories that the kitchen was always the focal point of our family whether it was just for eating.  Or for sitting around the table and if you start in the living room you always wind up migrating into the kitchen (laughter) for whatever, you know, what every family event there was.  And we always had lots of family event our family is very large and very close and so on my father's side.  And my mother [Winifred Crews Clark] loved being a part of that because she didn't have that much family left.  And the family she had was so spread out, and I think she always tried to make efforts to stay in touch and, and become close with particularly her first cousin because she grew up probably more with them than she did with her own sibling.  But to be part of my father's family who was a large and very tightknit, picnics every weekend.  You know, people were always--I don't ever remember not have a lot of people around.  And I grew up loving that and still love that so, you know, the tradition that's been passed on to me is I always have an open-door policy at my house.  You know, kids, stray kids, you know, you need a meal after church, everybody come over to our house and eat and we'll find food (laughter), you know, to feed everybody, but that's a tradition that our family's always had I think.
Story_ID: 300274
Speaker 1: Now did your father [Arthur Clark] have a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: My father finished high school, he never went to college.  He was a sports person, he played every sport, excelled in every sport.  The place where we grew up was predominantly white, so there were very few African Americans.  And it was also a very biased town in the sense that they had not been exposed to a lot of black people, but their media exposure whatever they understood about black people was very negative.  But we were the exception.  The Clarks are the exception somehow because we were the only ones they knew.  And everything they knew about black people was always negative, so we had to be an exception.  So my father always, you know, he ran track, he played football.  He played baseball, he played every sport and, and excelled in all of it but never--I don't ever remember even my father thinking about telling me that he even had aspirations to go to college.  I just don't think it was something he thought about, you know, being the youngest of twelve kids.  You know, growing up, you know, in the '20s [1920s].  You know time--he went into the [U.S. military] service after, you know right after my--they were married (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's when they, you know, that he went to World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 2: Yeah he was a sergeant and for the first time came to the South.  And for the first time from his standpoint experienced active racism.  You know, in New Jersey there were, you know, even during the time I was growing up, there were unspoken rules.  You know, I don't remember, you know, there were never any signs up that said no blacks here or what you had to do, but you sort of knew there was a culture of the place.
Story_ID: 300275
Speaker 1: Your father [Arthur Clark] went to the war [World War II, WWII] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he was married when he went?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was married, and so he didn't go overseas because he had my oldest brother.  And I believe doing that period my second oldest (laughter) brother was on the way 'cause they're only two years apart.  But yeah, that might--well 1942 my oldest brother was born, so it's really just my oldest brother was around.  But like I said when it came to the South, you know, in New Jersey--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --they had a system of sort of quiet separation.  We knew which restaurants not--we weren't welcome in no one had ever said anything but you knew you weren't welcome there.  You know, we knew where we could go swimming, and we knew where we couldn't go swimming.  And my dad told me it wasn't around when I was there but that they had to sit in the balcony at the movie theater.  And so there just wasn't--there was sort of a quiet separation wasn't that activism that happened in the South, and there weren't any signs that said, you know, no blacks allowed, but there're grocery stores where we knew that we weren't as welcome in that grocery store.  And so when--and I remember as the kid walking in certain places and knowing I'm not supposed to be here.  And, and if I made the mistake of walking in once, I'm not doing it a second time and not because anybody told me you just knew where you weren't supposed to be (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what was the major ethnic group in that part of New Jersey?
Speaker 2: White Protestant, Catholic. Probably the largest church in the area was Catholic.  Probably more Catholics and Presbyterians and Episcopalians.  You were Jewish you; you were very different.  Probably not as different--a matter of fact interestingly being Jewish you probably were treated--because black people sort of knew their place so to speak.  I mean, in the small town [Pennington, New Jersey] very small town that I grew up in there was a black section.  And all the black people lived in that section, and it was one strip of very small town, so it's really, you know, a, a block on both sides that were all the black families.  And then another little strip on another part of town and then we lived way out of town.  So it was our house and my uncle's house across the street, and I guess we sort of (laughter) made another little, little settlement there, but we weren't sort of scattered.  So I think if you were Jewish I remember even in the '60s [1960s], when I was going--'60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] when I was in elementary school and high school [Hopewell Valley Central High School, Pennington, New Jersey] that Jewish people were, you know, lots of ethnic jokes.  Lots of, of not invited a lot of places because they were Jewish.  Probably--and they didn't know their place, you know, (laughter) whereas we knew ours.  So it was probably harder on the Jews in the area than it was even for the black people.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your parents' [Winifred Crews Clark and Arthur Clark] personalities and who do you think you take after?
Speaker 2: It's interesting, I've recently done a little study in the personality giftings, you know, I think a lot of companies do DISC [Dominance Influence, Steadiness and Compliance].  And my father is a dominant personality he--calm, he's very calm. To him, he does things because he wants to--as long as I've known him.  I'm not sure what he was like as a, as a kid but, you know, he was always an aggressive--aggressive meaning of getting things--a doer he was always a doer and but not an overpowering personality.  He really, until my mother died in '71 [1971], wasn't much of a talker but a calm personality.  I remember growing up always thinking that there's nothing my father could ever say that was wrong.  If my father said it was (laughter), you know, like God himself saying it.  Very even-tempered I don't think once he ever disciplined me.  I'm the youngest so I can't be for my siblings, but he ever disciplined me with spankings or anything like that.  And I asked him about that once, and I asked him why that was and he said because I did all my spankings before you could walk or talk.  He said that was something he learned from his mother that you really teach children right and wrong before they can walk and talk.  And then after that, the rest of it is why did you do something wrong you knew it was--there was no more question of knowing right from wrong it's a question of choices.  So my father is always been holding us accountable for our choices and holding us responsible.  And never letting us get away with I didn't know, or I didn't understand.  But his accountability was practical accountability well guess you just can't do that.  Oh guess you can't go there, you know, I don't remember him going okay just this once I'll bail you out.  You know, we got ourselves in a mess, you know, we had to--oh well you're responsible for the mess you got yourself into. My mother was a little more chatty like me.  So I get that part from her and very family oriented.  Life was totally surrounded; you know, she raised six of us.  I had a twin brother who died three days after we were born he would've been the seventh.  And if it were up to her she probably would've had a couple more kids.  And I think it was up to my father he probably would've had a couple more.  But I think at the point in their lives, and financially they decided that six of us was probably enough, but she was totally family oriented.  I remember many times just her doing what I consider the impossible, you know, a dress I needed for a school play.  And all the cool, rich kids had gone out and bought costumes.  And I'd come in the next day as she would've made this beautiful costume or outfit I needed that, you know, was better than anybody else had but she had made it by hand.  So, and she worked part time when I got older she took some jobs part-time as a domestic and seemed to enjoy that actually and seems to enjoy that actually.  She actually seemed to enjoy getting out--not so much being a domestic but getting out of the house when she had never done that before.  But nothing ever took the place of us kids and what we were doing and what our needs were and my father's needs, you know, what he needed.  So wherever she was dinner was always on the table.  And so I take after my mom in the probably a little bit overbearing sometimes and my chattiness but I take after my father in a sense of very pragmatic and I'm very calm.  You know, I always look at things and weigh whether things are worth it (laughter).  Is it worth it for me to have an argument with you?  No, it's not worth it for me to have it, so I take after my dad like that.
Story_ID: 300277
Speaker 1: And my mother [Winifred Crews Clark] and my [paternal] grandmother [Pinkie Coles Clark], and some of my aunts were strongly women of faith, and I definitely take after them in that.  And that's probably a legacy for my father's mother, my father's sisters and my own mother who--my father [Arthur Clark] made sure we get to church, but he didn't come much my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What, what was the name of your church?
Speaker 1: First Baptist Church of Pennington [Pennington, New Jersey] in that town there were two black churches.  One was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, and one was the Baptist church, and we went to the A.M.E. church for Sunday school because the Baptist church didn't have a Sunday school.  And then my parents actually attended the First Baptist Church, so we went 9:30 [A.M.] Sunday school in the A.M.E. church.  And then 11 o'clock we went church--First Baptist Church where my mother played the piano.  And my grandmother was the church mother 'cause--and when she was living.  And then my father's sister was the church mother when she was living.  So it's a church that our family's grown up in and our family's still a part of it.  It almost faced distinction there for a little bit I remember at one point the church had only, you know, one or two or five members.  And now it's over the past couple years they've got a new pastor, and it's gone through a resurgence.  So that's good to hear that's the--and I've been there to visit whenever I go home, but that's where my family gets its spiritual legacy from it's really from the women in our family.
Speaker 2: Now how many siblings do you have?
Speaker 1: I have, I have six siblings, one of them was the twin brother who died like I said when we were very--when we were babies, and I'm the youngest.
Story_ID: 300278
Speaker 1: Now, can you turn on the way back machine and take us back to your first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Gee, okay I'm trying to do the whole way back machine thing.  Okay, first childhood memory is probably--I had a high chair that was very high-tech.  It converted into like a, a rolling desk almost it would go from high chair, and you could turn it over and it had wheels.  And it had a little tray where you could eat lunch, and it had little counters on it.  That's gotta be way back right?  If I was in something like that and I remember tooling around having it folded down like a little car and tooling around the kitchen.  And I remember in the kitchen (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so it converted into a walker like?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sort of like a walker it had a seat.
Speaker 1: And you could--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you could compel it at your waist?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you could put it down and it was--I mean I'm saying that was high-tech 1954, '55 [1955] that's pretty high-tech.  And it had I remember it, it was wooden it had a white, like tray.  Like a little desk area that most of the time I would love eating on it, and it had a counter on it, and I remember 'cause I remember my perspective of being so low sitting in our kitchen.  And then we had one of those old washing machines in the kitchen the one with the ringers.  And I remember my mom [Winifred Crews Clark] would have that hooked up to the sink, and she'd be washing clothes.  And I loved watching those clothes--there's something about feeding those clothes.  And watching her feed those clothes through the wringer and them coming out in the washtub on the other side.  So that's probably my earliest, you know, where I could actually place myself somewhere.
Story_ID: 300279
Speaker 1: Can you describe your neighborhood for us and tell us like what were some of the, you know, sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: It was a rural neighborhood, and we had--what I consider our own little neighborhood was six houses.  And there were fields in between each of the house fields behind each house fields in between each of the homes.  So it was some sort of in the middle of nowhere, and it was called Dublin [Road], the road was called Dublin.  And we understand that these six houses were built because there was a private in this, in this small town [Pennington, New Jersey].  And there were Irish women who worked at the private school.  And then there were Irish men who came through when they were building the railroad they hooked up got married.  And all settled in this little area, and they called it Dublin.  So these six houses were considered the original houses and out of those six houses was the house that my [paternal] grandparents [Pinkie Coles Clark and Henry Clark] lived in that then later my aunt and uncle took over.  And then the house across--directly across the street facing it that we lived in my parents [Winifred Crews Clark and Arthur Clark] moved into.  I would say they moved in somewhere around 1948 'cause it was a couple of days after one of my sisters was born.  And then there were two other--four other houses right down the street.  So that was my world that and the fields and the woods behind and our houses where I spent most of my days (laughter) as I was growing up.  So the sights and sounds were again being outdoors all the times that's what I remember.  It's one of those things, you know, it's hard for my kids to understand.  And it's our generation gap they spend so much time inside, but you give me--I don't care if it's a snowy day a rainy day we found something.  If it was raining, we were out in the rain if it was snowing we were out in the snow.  You know, but we spent a lot of time in trees lots of treehouses lots of climbing trees.  Lots of growing things and eating them outside so, you know, they didn't have to feed us (laughter).  We'd find our own (laughter) fruits and berries around the neighborhood.  So that was probably the, the biggest thing is, you know, that was my world.  And our neighbors were pretty consistent throughout my life.  There were, you know, maybe two families who moved in while I was growing up.  The rest of the families were there from start to finish.  And we just grew we grew up with them but our cousins lived across the street, and they had five kids.  So between us and them, that was our world and the relatives who came to visit.
Speaker 1: You had a lot of kids to play with?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well there--I had me, and I have a sister who's six years older.  I have a sister who's four years older and then my sister who's ten years older a brother who's eleven and my oldest brother is thirteen years older than I am.  But really it was the sister next to me and I and three cousins.  There were five across the street they had two very old, old like my oldest brother and then the other three were around my age.  So the five of us played together and then the families that came in and out. They're probably another half dozen kids between the families who lived in those six houses.  And we really didn't play with kids unless they were relatives who went outside of those boundaries of those six houses.
Story_ID: 300280
Speaker 1: How would you describe your personality as a little girl?  I mean, what would people say about you and what would you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Precocious.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was probably precocious, inquisitive, chatty and I think smart.  I think that, that was sometimes they didn't know that--I remember the one story is that when I was probably about three people would come over, and I'd be reading books when I was three.  But what they didn't know was I had the books read to me so much that I actually had memorized probably a half dozen children books.  So (laughter) people would come over--I guess that--I guess I was probably a little manipulative too, I'd open, I would open these books and start reading, and when in fact I had just (laughter) memorized all the words.
Story_ID: 300281
Speaker 1: What was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: Well I went to two. I went to Pennington Grammar School [Pennington, New Jersey] which was sort of the traditional elementary school.  And while I was there they built a new elementary school for the people who lived in the township which is where we lived which was called Bear Tavern Elementary School [Titusville, New Jersey].  And so I did--
Speaker 1: Bear Tavern?
Speaker 2: Bear Tavern, B-E-A-R, Tavern, T-A-V-E-R-N.
Speaker 1: That's an unusual name for an elementary school.
Speaker 2: Well because it was on Bear Tavern Road which had some history.  It was in Titusville, New Jersey which is where Washington [President George Washington] crossed the Delaware [River].  And it's where certain battles and between New Hope [Pennsylvania] and Trenton [New Jersey] took place.  And so there actually was a tavern on the corner called the Bear Tavern and they name the street after it and then the school.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah this sounds right for a grade school, Bear Tavern (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: A grade school.
Speaker 2: I said Civil War, I meant Revolutionary War, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Revolutionary War, right.
Story_ID: 300282
Speaker 1: Did you like school?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting question.  I think I was neutral about school at least in my early years. Wasn't a social place for me because again I was a bit of an outcast weren't a lot of black kids we were things minority.  I had to learn to overcome a couple of things, you know, as I was growing up.  You know, I had to figure out--I mean, a good example is I remember being in sixth grade and all the girls being invited to a sleepover except me.  And me going well gee, I'm not a person nobody likes me. You know, I mean that's what a sixth-grader does.  And then it took my older brothers and sisters and my parents [Winifred Crews Clark and Arthur Clark] to explain to me that there might've been some other reasons.  And in fact, there were, that--and the teacher actually and that my understanding was I wasn't invited because I was black.  And the parents didn't want a black child at their house, but I didn't understand that and so that's the first time I remember a family member help me resolve that issue.  I remember the pain it caused me I remember crying.  And just not understanding why every girl had been--and they gave out the invitations in the classroom--every girl but me.  So but during my earlier years those kind of things happen but I, again, I think I just instinctively knew I wasn't included in certain things.  So school was never a social place for me and then also what happened was the handful of other black children there were--they were at the track system at the time.  And I was in the accelerated track, and I was the only black child in the whole school system that was in the accelerated track.  So I was always--so the black kids always said well you think you so smart.  And then white kids would go well, you know, we don't wanna be--have anything to do with you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You still black as far as they're concerned.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you still yeah you just black (laughter).  And it wasn't--and interestingly sometimes it wasn't so much the kids.  But it's--so it wasn't that when I was in school I didn't have--the kids didn't treat me fairly.  It was just when it came time for birthday parties or sleepovers or let's go to Johnny's house after school to play (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The supervised socialization.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the super--yeah, it was more of the parents.  So in the classroom academically until I got to high school [Hopewell Valley Central High School, Pennington, New Jersey] I don't--and junior high [Timberlane Junior High School, Hopewell, New Jersey], a couple incidents in junior high I never had a problem with a teacher.  Matter of fact the teachers as I look at it now I think my teachers probably in elementary school were happy that I was doing well and so I think they encouraged me to do well, I never had a teacher who discouraged--and so I think I was lucky that way, because I never had a teacher who discouraged me until I got to junior high and high school.
Story_ID: 300283
Speaker 1: Now what activities were you engaged in, in grade school and junior high school [Timberlane Junior High School, Hopewell, New Jersey]?  Did you, did you play an instrument or anything, or were you--did you dance or do anything like that?
Speaker 2: Well I played piano briefly (laughter), and that was an outside it wasn't through the school I took private piano lessons.  It was sort of a thing all my sisters did everybody--a certain point started taking piano lessons.  And, and it was a good thing for me to do because it teaches you certain kinds of structures and it teaches you, you know, I sing now.  So and I've always enjoyed singing so I can't say I still play the piano, but I can sound out a few notes here and there.  Always very active athletically in elementary school we didn't have any kind of organized sports, but I was the queen of kickball (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, queen of kickball?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and anything where there was singing.  You know, I was in Girl Scouts all the way through--I started off as a Girl Scout.  I started off as a Brownie and stayed in Girl Scout probably longer than most girls did.  I stayed in Girl Scouts until I was in high school [Hopewell Valley Central High School, Pennington, New Jersey].  And then did--even became sort of an advocate, Girl Scout advocate my last years in high school.  So I always stayed 'cause I love camping sold a lot of Girl Scout cookies (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you the only, only black girl in your troop?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or were there others?
Speaker 2: No, no as a matter of fact all the way through, you know, it was a very integrated troop.
Speaker 1: It was all black?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, it was integrated.
Speaker 2: No, it was an integrated troop.  Troop leaders were always all white and the troops--I wouldn't even be the only one there were two, three of us.  In a troop of maybe ten so when I think about it was probably the most integrated (laughter) thing I did at that time was probably the Girl Scouts.  Never any issue with the Girl Scouts.  Camp I loved going to camp, and I never felt any kind of discrimination in the Girl Scouts.  The crafts the community's service may be, that's why I stayed in there so long because it really was just the beneficial area in my life.  I loved being a Girl Scout, and my girls have been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you sell the cookies and everything?
Speaker 2: Sold the cookies sold the calendars had the, had the sash with the patches coming up and going down and coming up the back (laughter).  So yeah and interestingly I think that's probably I mean, I have a history of having done probably until recent years a lot of community service.  And I think I got that through Girl Scouts. Always felt like if I didn't--wasn't doing something for the community there was something missing in my life. And I got that from Girl Scouts you always should be doing something.
Speaker 1: Does Girl Scouts have a team component, do they have a team component where you go like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Boy Scouts you become an explorer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they have Brownies, kindergarten, first, you become a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Girl Scout?
Speaker 2: --junior 'til you're like junior high, and then you become a cadet in junior high, and then a senior in senior high.
Story_ID: 300284
Speaker 1: What else did you do when you were little--coming up?
Speaker 2: Well in elementary school that was probably--anything that had to do with singing.  I mean, you know I always loved to sing.  And probably would've done a little acting if I had if I have been had like a stage mom type I would've done that.  And I actually wind up doing a commercial when I was ten (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you now tell us about that experience?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It was actually one of those very interesting coincidences in that a neighbor of ours in one of these six houses, they moved in from New York [New York] that was the first influx into our neighborhood of like the New Yorkers who moved down and used to commute to New York.  And he worked for an advertising firm or something, and they were looking for kids to do commercials.  So he sort of gathered up all of the neighborhood kids and we went to this place in Princeton [New Jersey].  And there were hundreds of kids running around all day with their parents, and they were interviewing the kids for commercials.  Nobody knew what the commercials were for so when it finally came down for my interview, and I was ten at the time.  They asked me to eat those cookies that were the wafers that have the look like ice cream cones on the top, and they have like the cream in the middle.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: There the wafer cookies (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I hate them.  And (laughter) they said, "Would you eat these and tell us what you think," and I said, "Do I have to," and they said, "Why?"  And I said, "'Cause I don't like them," and they said, "Well what kind of cookie do you like?"  And I said, "My favorite cookies are Nabisco Fig Newtons."  And they said, "Well why do you like them," and I told them. Turned out they were doing the commercial for Nabisco Fig Newtons I had no idea.  So of course, I was like I'm sure I was there number one draft choice for that (laughter) commercial because they didn't have to prompt me on anything.  So--
Speaker 1: Was that the Darn Tootin' commercial Darn Tootin' commercial?
Speaker 2: No, it was it really was a commercial where they the commercial was kids sitting around eating. And I was eating this, you know, panned up and I'm eating a Fig Newton and they said, "Why do you like Fig Newtons," and I said, "I like Fig Newtons 'cause their gooey," and it paid for my college education.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.
Speaker 2: 'Cause in those days commercial didn't run, you know, thirteen weeks and then they have a new one.  In those days commercial ran for two and a half or three years which is what happened with this one.  It ran--it used to run on 'Dr. Kildare' I remember most the weeks you'd see my--and so I had a brother in service at the time who was engaged.  And so his intended family saw his sister for the first time in the commercial when they were watching 'Dr. Kildare.'
Speaker 1: That's a wonderful story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did that increase your popularity in school and so forth (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: I mean, now that you were on the Fig Newton commercial?
Speaker 2: No, you know, it just didn't--no it didn't faze anybody I don't think.  There were two or three of us who were--who I was growing up with at the time who were in that same group.  And they had done an Oreo commercial and a Fig Newton commercial and there were maybe three of us.  But I mean, it was mentioned like all we saw you on TV the other night, but no didn't have anything to do with popularity or singling you out or anything nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like I said the biggest thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like people kind of took it for granted almost.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sort of not that everybody did it or anything it just wasn't no big whoop about it.  And I didn't think too much about it, you know, I did think at ten kids unless you're in a big, you know, series that they watch, and you just go to commercial I don't think kids really thought that much about it.
Speaker 1: You ever think about how rare it is for anyone to be on a commercial in, and (laughter)--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I guess nobody really thought about it.  And it was a national commercial, and I don't think that any kids--plus in those days remember we were outside more than we were watching TV.  So yeah, if you were watching 'Dr. Kildare' but if it was on the rest of the time, nobody even noticed.
Story_ID: 300285
Speaker 1: Now at church, did you have like responsibilities at church [First Baptist Church of Pennington, Pennington, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: No, not really, I mean, you know, I was there always (laughter) at everything, my parents [Winifred Crews Clark and Arthur Clark] made sure of that.  And we did a youth lead service, you know, I always participated at Easter I always--but no I never had any responsibilities not, not growing up.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers in grade school?
Speaker 2: Yeah I mean, I had a couple favorite teachers it's funny 'cause my third-grade teacher was considered the meanest.  She was the one that all the kids thought was the meanest teacher, and she had gone to high school with my father.  And wasn't that she, she wasn't any nicer to me because of that, but I remember her name was Mrs. Ritman [ph.], and she was a very hard-nosed teacher, and I think it's because of that she was my favorite.  Teachers--and I've always been like that as I think about it now that teachers who were soft on me and didn't a challenge me just aren't memorable to me.  But the teachers who challenged me and were like no that's, you know, do it again, do it again, do it again 'til you get it right.  Those are the teachers I remember I don't know how I felt about her at the time but now I think back and I--she's one of my favorite teachers.  And, and because my dad had had a reunion they were trying to put together a reunion, you know, they all in their late eighties now.  And a couple years ago she had contacted my father and then as they were talking about the reunion, she said "Oh, by the way, what's Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Clark Jenkins] doing?"  And I emailed her, and we had a little dialogue and it was so neat.  Third-grade teacher who was just happy to hear she was so happy to hear about my successes.  But I was just--it was so nice to talk to her even by email because I think it was--I think third grade was one of those pivotal points with me.  You know, I mean that was the point which you either get challenged and you move up, or you go, "School doesn't matter to me."  And I think because she was on me constantly I took one road instead of another.
Story_ID: 300286
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-seven [1967] and '68 [1968], you were at middle school, now what was the name of your middle school?
Speaker 2: Gee, Hopewell--gee what was the name of my junior high school?  Hopewell Township Junior High.
Speaker 1: Hopewell Township?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sorry I take that back that was the old one.  Timberlane, I'm sorry I couldn't I guess I was having a blackout there, Timberlane Junior High [Timberlane Junior High School, Hopewell, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Timberlane?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Got named after the street that they built the junior high school on that was a new junior high school when I went into it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Timberlane Junior High School, now this is the first time in your life you got kind of--hindered, you know, by the system here, right?
Speaker 2: Well it's interesting because it was also the first I got to be black a little.  You know, I mean, I sort of was feeling my oats a little because, you know, so--I hadn't had much socializing.  Like I said before because, you know, I wasn't in any in any classes with any of the black kids and so there wasn't except for relatives there was no socializing there.  And then with the white kids, I was in classes with them, but there was no socializing with them.  So when I got to junior high, that's the first time we changed class and also we had things like gym.  So it was the first time I got to be with all the other black kids.  And felt this little kindred thing here but felt a little tug because still except for lunch and gym none of them were in my classes.  So I really developed the social life--to sets of friends.  I sort of developed, you know, my, my sort of kids I was in class with and then the kids I wasn't.  And at that point and time, my parents [Winifred Crews Clark and Arthur Clark] had gotten involved in an organization called the Association of Equal Opportunity [Hopewell Valley Association of Equal Opportunity].  In this town [Pennington, New Jersey] that was very conservative, you know, when Goldwater [Senator Barry Goldwater] ran for president, 60 percent of the population voted for Goldwater.  So it's a very traditional, you know, nobody sort of stirs up the waters kind of town.
Speaker 1: Now that is a conservative town because the country as a whole defeated Goldwater in a landslide.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: LBJ [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] won in a landslide.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So this was a conservative town.
Speaker 2: This was a conservative town, very rural very--but educated rural not uneducated rural.  And there were a number--a couple of Jewish families who was part of this organization.  So what happened was I had developed some friendships because my parents developed some friendships through this organization.  And they were in leadership roles and so we sort of had this whole new family dynamic of my parents actually developing friendships with people who were white or Jewish who lived in the, in the township.  My dad always was a likable guy, and he had spent his whole life there.  So he had always I mean, even 'til now he's got people he's known his whole life.  The whole town knows my dad, but I don't remember there sort of being this okay you come to my house for dinner I go to your house for dinner we do things together socially.  And so there were families for the first time that we started doing that with. And so their kids, I got to be friends with, so that developed a whole group of friends of mine who's our parents were friends.  And then I still had all the black kids who socially I probably had more in common with and also some of them were even relatives.  So this sort of double group of friends I had but it was a developing social life.
Story_ID: 300287
Speaker 1: But teachers began to find me a little bit of an oddity.  And I really was very outspoken, and I wasn't disrespectful but at the same time I tended to stand up for myself a little bit and sometimes stand up for others.  And so I had teachers who I was a little bit of an oddity to them.  And so they didn't quite know what to do with me because I didn't fit in places that they had, had before because there weren't that many kids coming along.  It wasn't like there were these fast track which I was in the accelerated track that there were a bunch of black kids were in that.  Even, you know, even once I moved in I was still the only one once it was even a consolidated system because now it was a township consolidated junior high school [Timberlane Junior High School, Hopewell, New Jersey].  So instead of being Bear Tavern Elementary [Bear Tavern Elementary School, Titusville, New Jersey] there probably, you know, ten elementary schools that fed into this junior high.  And still I was the only black child who was in the accelerated program.  So I was a little bit of an oddity some teachers championed me my favorite teacher then was a French teacher.  I had never had a language before, and she was very supportive with me.  But then I had an algebra teacher who, every chance he got, you know, jumped all over me.  And I had a geography teacher who jumped all over me, but he jumped all over me because he thought I was lazy.  I didn't realize that at the time I really couldn't stand him at the time, but I realize later that to him I was an oddity but he, he almost was angry at me because he thought I was intellectually lazy.  And I was, he was right about that I didn't do my homework.  But I could still get straight A's but even if I didn't--as long as they didn't grade homework.  And if I just had to talk about something I just had a lot of knowledge in my head.  And so, you know, I didn't necessary do the work, but I'd still get the grades and that sort of bugged him.  And so every chance he had he was all over me.

Speaker 1: You indicated earlier that first--that middle school [Timberlane Junior High School, Hopwell, New Jersey] was the first time you really had been challenged along racial lines, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well yeah, well also I think during that period of time I think I was developing a little bit of anger.  You know I was developing a little bit of animosity because I think it became clear to me I had older brothers and sisters.  One of my sisters was at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] at the time.  Yeah she was, she was in Boston [Massachusetts] at the time in college and had been arrested because they thought she was [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis.  You know, I mean I had--we had these debates within our family because my oldest brother's second wife was white.  And meanwhile, I had a sister at BU, who was like, you know, black power.  And then I had other family members who across the spectrum and there were lots of internal debates within our family and some very heated things.  And then I started looking back in my life and beginning to understand those things like not being invited to a sleepover and instead of being hurt by them I think I've developed some anger towards them.  Same thing with teachers, you know, when teachers started to challenge me I think I went that spectrum for not understanding that anything was racially driven to believing that everything was racially driven.  And I think elementary school was my period of going--oh they just did that 'cause I was black.  You know, or that happened and, you know, not--because I wasn't mature enough to be able to sort through some of the differences.  So that was the period of time in which I started--and I started also just noticing in, in life just the inequities in our, in our town [Pennington, New Jersey].  I remember hearing the stories where a neighbor of ours, because we lived like I told you there was these six families other than that there was a new development up the street from us which were really nice houses, all new development.  And one of the families that the mother actually had been my troop leader at one point they had been trying to sell their house.  And then threatened to sell the house to somebody black unless I think there were some homeowner's responsibilities, and they said well we'll just sell to somebody black unless you lift these certain restrictions.  And so when I heard that, you know, those kind of comments changed things for me.  And when I started understanding that--like even the neighborhood at the end of the street, there was nobody black there nobody black would be welcome there.  And that the Clarks, people saw us as different, and I would hear comments because people thought we were different.  I would hear comments about black people in general like I wasn't black, you know, and I was like and I would go what are you talking about and they'd say, "Oh not you.  But, you know, those other ones out there," because this was, you know, we were in the middle of, you know, '67 [1967], '68 [1968].  Was the following year it was also when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was, you know, when Dr. King was shot and I was just angry (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember where, where you were when Dr. King was shot and how you found out?
Speaker 2: I remember I was home.  I mean, you know, I remember I wasn't in school, and I remember I was home.  And so a lot of my steam blew off in a very protective environment.  My sister was on a class trip she was in Washington, D.C. on a senior, on her senior trip.  And that just went apparently it just--there were only four or five black kids, but it just was a crazy situation for them to watch.  And so I had heard all of those stories and so I'd watched everything.  So Dr. King's assassination was a very--I heard about it in a very protective environment.  If I'd been in school, I probably would have done something. Some sort of a demonstration of anger I probably would have, but because I was home I didn't.  And then by the time I went to school the next day I was still angry, but it was a little bit more controlled.  And so my day the next day I do remember I didn't want to talk to anybody who was white.  I was now in this solidarity thing it was like all the black kids we were all trying to find each other that day and sitting together at lunch.  And that's sort of began that's sort of more isolation thing for me because the reaction of the white kids was also very, "Okay what you gonna do to me," you know.  So it wasn't just my own anger, but it was also watching the reaction the kids around me.  Like all of sudden, I'd grown up with them ever since I was kindergarten because of all the violence that had spilled over across the nation during this period all of a sudden I was a threat.  And the interesting thing is that on some level I might've been one (laughter) the night before if my--if I hadn't had a chance to sort of tone down my anger.  So but it was probably the first time I realized it was a lot of stuff bubbling up in me.  And that the world around me was not an equal place.
Story_ID: 300289
Speaker 1: Now where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to high school at Hopewell Valley Central High School [Pennington, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Hopewell Valley Central High School.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now doing this period of time how, you know, you were talking about the historicity of the area in terms of, you know, being a place where [President] George Washington, you know, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah. Yeah
Speaker 1: --the Bear Tavern being a place that Washington passed through was there in the late '60s [1960s], some school districts tried to for the first time teach black history (unclear) that kind of thing was there any attempt being.
Speaker 2: No, as a matter of fact it was my own attempt (laughter).  When I got to high school, I was sort of the; I was sort of the mouthpiece for the black students.  And there were only like twenty of us out of--again a consolidated school district there were twenty of us out of about probably mid 200s so maybe 250 there were and most of them I was related to, but that was the whole school.  And we started something called the--well I started something called the Black Culture Club, and we had to have a couple of teachers.  So a couple of teachers were our advisors and the, and the organization was actually multicultural it was black and white kids.  So it was all the kids who sort of as we used to call it hung black.  And it was all the kids whose like our parents were in this equal opportunities association [Hopewell Valley Association of Equal Opportunity]--equal opportunity people who sort of cared about that.  And sort of the hippie kids who sort of were like yeah black power, you know (laughter).  So we were all in this organization, and I put together a play called 'Beautiful Blackness.'  And the reason I put together that play was because again there--just so many opportunities for me to do things that I wanted to do in school.  Things like singing and acting I wanted to try my hand at. And I tried out for the school play one year.  And I had tried out a couple of times and always gotten these sort of bit parts.  But I did sing very well, and so I tried out--they were gonna do--what's the name of it with Mammy Yokum?
Speaker 1: 'Li'l Abner' (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Li'l Abner.'  Yes, they were gonna do 'Li'l Abner' one year, and I trained out for Mammy Yokum.  And I remember seeing that besides just any kind of racial thing, you know, the guy who was in charge of it had his favorites.  So the favorites during tryouts were actually standing there, you know, while you were trying out.  Like watching you like being with him why you're trying you're like oh yeah like she didn't get the part.  So I tried out, and I didn't get the role and at that point, I really didn't want a secondary role.  I didn't want to be like, you know, dancer number two.  You know, I wanted to have a major role.  So I didn't participate, but I did not know why I hadn't gotten the role.  I just thought I was good thought I sang the song great that I had to try out with, but didn't make it.  So it was obviously his, his conscience bothering him because he announced to the group when I didn't come for practice.  He said I see that there's somebody's missing, and he said "I see that Michele's [HistoryMaker Michele Clark Jenkins] missing.  And, you know, I just, you know, this town just isn't ready for an interracial couple on stage."  Which meant Mammy Yokum being black and Pappy Yokum (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And Pappy Yokum--
Speaker 2: Yeah and then--
Speaker 1: A big romance right?
Speaker 2: So I never understood that I--see I had no idea until obviously his conscience got the best of it and he announced it to the group.  And I found out that's why I didn't get the role then, of course, I would like okay.  And so I put together a play on my own called 'Beautiful Blackness.'  And we did everything we did the sets, we did--I designed the programs and basically, what we did was music, dance--African dance, poetry, performances that kind of thing.  And I directed it. I like wrote, (laughter) produced it directed the thing and acted in it with about twenty other kids.  And it was a huge success, and we wound up doing it actually two years in a row.  But that so angered this guy who was in charge of the drama department because he couldn't--because of the racial issues he couldn't stand up and say--he tried to squash the whole thing but then it was like well this is at the culture--the Black Culture Club putting this on.  And, you know, yes you're in charge of the drama for the school, but the Black Culture Club wants to put on a program.  And I certainly didn't ask him to be our advisor.  So there're a number of incidents like that that happened throughout my high school.  Including one that was major my senior year oh to--backup just for second I--out of that situation I actually joined Forensic Drama.  And came in and did 'A Black Mother's Prayer,' which I had done with culture club.  And would never have undertaken that but for being angry because of why I wasn't (laughter) in the mainstream play, and wound up coming number three in the state for that performance.  So again sometimes, you know, it was sort of my anger and my I'll show them that sort of, you know, catapulted me to doing that--
Story_ID: 300290
Speaker 1: But my senior year in high school [Hopewell Valley Central High School, Pennington, New Jersey] was like a major event, or actually I'm sorry, my junior year in high school.  I was going for--it was Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] the anniversary I believe of his death my junior year in high school.  And the school was showing 'Montgomery to Memphis' ['King: A Filmed Record...Montgomery to Memphis'] there were twelve upper-class junior and senior black women at the time.  And that day I had an excuse to get out because I had an interview at Princeton University [Princeton, New Jersey].  So I was supposed to leave early my mom [Winifred Crews Clark] was working at Skillman [Skillman Institute, Montgomery Township, New Jersey], which was a mental and geriatric facility.  And she couldn't take me, so I had to leave at a certain time and walk into town get on a bus go into Trenton [New Jersey] switch buses and then go to Princeton and be there in time for my interview.  So I had brought a note that morning said that I was to get out early.  So we all went in to watch 'Montgomery to Memphis' now in those days we were all supposed to be sitting with our classes.  Well, this day all the black kids sat together that was, that was like a major statement.  And, you know, everybody was all nervous.  Why are the black kids all sitting together?  So when it was over the assistant principal called all of the upper-class twelve upper-class black women into his office.  And he started screaming and hollering at us and told us that we were all liars that we had all forged excuses to get out of school.  And just totally went off on us.  And, and was going--and he said, "I've called all of your parents, and all of you will be suspended from school."  So, me being the mouthpiece I was, went in and said you have no right to talk to us this way.  I said, "I did not forge a note from home.  I have a note from home."  "No you don't.  You're lying."  And he just--and a couple of kids had forged notes but what you--what he did was wholesale bring in twelve women because we were all black because two people had forged notes or whatever from their house.  And brought everybody in and just chastised us yelling and screaming telling us we were all suspended.  So meanwhile they called their parents, and my mother came up to the school.  My mother very family-oriented not confrontational, you know, at all, and the vice principal was a neighbor of ours.  He lived in this new development right up the street from us, so my parents knew him pretty well.  So he said (laughter) he said "Yes Winifred, well Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Clark Jenkins] came in here, and she forged a note."  And my mother looked at him and said "Mr. Archerry [ph.] she did no such thing" and so he went on to tell her about what all the kids had done.  And she said, "I don't want to hear about what all the kids have done tell me what my child did."  And it turned out I hadn't done anything so my father [Arthur Clark] at the time because of his involvement with equal opportunities organization [Hopewell Valley Association of Equal Opportunity] sat on the board of education for the town.  And so there's a complaint made, and so Mr. Archerry was very close to being fired.  They suspended him for a while and told him that never again was he to bring wholesale, you know, all of these racially--he basically anybody if you were black and you were a female he called you in the office and accused you of lying and forging a note.  So and my mother was really upset because she said listen, you know, she has an interview at Princeton, and she's now missed it.  And so the only way she's gonna get there is if I'm late for work, and I take her.
Story_ID: 300291
Speaker 1: So it was a big, you know, it was a big brouhaha [at Hopewell Valley Central High School, Pennington, New Jersey]. But there were--I probably had six or seven incidents like that that were major.  I mean one where, you know, one of the white kids in school wanted to turn the black kids against another white kid.  So they wrote a note supposedly from this white kid and gave it to the black kid and said look at what she wrote.  And so that everybody went after this white girl was going to beat her up, but it was forged so I kicked the--I told--asked the vice principal to leave his office, and I said let me handle this.  And I brought all the kids in and who were involved and then 'cause I--something was fishy about it, and we rooted out the fact that it was forged.  So I mean, you know, we had all of these sort of, you know, this was a middle--this was like a real middle-class upper-middle-class rural community in the middle of New Jersey.  And there was just stuff going, you know.  Hotbed of just racial stuff going on constantly and there was always simmering, you know, just under the surface.  You know, you couldn't you wouldn't dare go to--I mean I didn't go to any sock hops or go to any of the dances.  You know, you just couldn't do that because there was nobody to dance with and the white guys definitely couldn't dance with the black girls and, you know, you couldn't vice versa.  If anything like that ever did happen, you know, would be the major talk of the town.  So, you know, mid-'60s [1960s], late '60s [1960s], you know, Middle America was just a hotbed of just everything just simmering on the edge.  And I always felt like, like I said when Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination happened and even times past that it was always, "Okay, what are you going to do next?"  You know, like okay yeah, you're okay with us until something happens it's like okay which side are you on, that was always sort of the tone in the neighborhood.
Story_ID: 300292
Speaker 1: Now when did you graduate from Hopewell [Hopewell Valley Central High School, Pennington, New Jersey] (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I graduated in 1972.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you did get your interview with Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] right, eventually?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter) I did get my interview, but again, I applied to BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], University.  Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and Princeton, and they needed an English teacher's recommendation.  Penn couldn't even consider my application unless I had a teacher's recommendation.  And I had, and one English teacher and I had given him, oh months before, you know, my application that he had to fill out and also the recommendation and an envelope stamped envelope.  So the same day I got my Princeton acceptance I also got a letter from the University of Penn saying I can't, we can't even consider your application because we never got the recommendation from your English teacher.  So I went in, and I said, "I gave this to you like three or four months ago."  And they said they don't have it.  He said, "Well I didn't like the way you put it on my desk."  So I looked at him, and I said, "Well it doesn't matter anyway I got into Princeton."  And he said, "Are you going?"  And I said, "Well I don't know." "Well do you think you can handle it?"  I mean it was just as total, you know, and what happened was the University of Penn--he never did send in the recommendation and University of Penn accepted me anyway.  So, but I really went through high school really with this I'll show them because it really was a, you know, you're set up to fail.  I mean I had teachers who told me when I--my guidance counselor told me when I applied to those three schools--those were the only three schools I applied to and I got into all three--said you need to apply to the state school and I said I don't want to go to the state school well you're not going to get into any of those three schools.  You know, and they, and I already knew that they told my oldest brother that somebody had to be a ditch digger and told him that he was not even college material.  So, you know, and my family had already prepared me for the fact that I was not going to get college support from my high school and I didn't.  My high school did not support me going to college.
Speaker 1: These are the college counselor's stories from high school from which we had accrued (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I don't know there's gotta be a hundred stories like this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't think there's one story a black person at a white high school where the counselor helped 'em.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My counselor told me I couldn't (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Anybody listening to this, this interview may want to check out the rest of them this is somebody's Ph.D. dissertation, you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's like they all go to school and do the same thing to discourage black people from going to school.
Speaker 2: And the amazing thing was I mean, this what I didn't understand I mean I was out of a class of 217 I was in the top ten, you know, I had an A- average.  I was an exchange student my junior year in high school over my junior year in high school.  I was in every activity; I was president of the girls athletic league.  I was, you know, the cheerleader, I mean all these things that I was now involved and I got in forensic debate.  I did all the other things and still my guidance counselors were discouraging me from going to college.  And they, their whole attitude even if I was going then well you need to go to state school. Princeton? That's out of your league.  Boston University that's out of your league. University of Penn that's out of your league and never get in.  My family is the one who said don't listen to them (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is a--and always is this is a book for somebody to write.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There's a guidance counselor's story why you guidance counselors all (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean without fail.
Speaker 2: And we had a black guidance counselor, Mr. Renwick [ph.], I remember him we had a black guy (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did he ever give any advice?
Speaker 2: No matter of fact Mr. Renwick ran the other way he had no interest in--mean his whole thing was I don't even want to have any black student as my guidance, you know.  He never tried to mentor us never tried to do anything for us, and he never gave me any advice.  Matter of fact I think I went to him at one point when my guidance counselor who was a nice lady.  And I really got the impression like--she thought she was doing the best for me.  And I went to him for some help, and he discouraged me as much or more than she did said well that's what you need to do.  You need to just apply for, and I'm going look at my transcript.  And they just totally discounted me (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's just amazing how--
Speaker 2: So when I got into those schools they were like--then when I got in you know what I was told oh she got in 'cause she was black.  And when I came back after my first year at Princeton I was in an exchange student for AFS [American Field Service] and AFS had a dinner, and they'd asked me to come and speak at the dinner into my freshman year at Princeton.  And when I came back, I ran into that same English teacher.  And I said hi and he said, "You still at Princeton?  You still there," and I was like, "I went last year. Where else would I be?"  'Cause his whole thing was you got in because she was black, but you can't there.
Speaker 1: And that's American Field Service you're talking, AFS?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did that my junior year.
Speaker 1: And this is truly remarkable every story we hear--pretty much every story I've heard if there is an exception I can't remember.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well all of my sisters and brothers went through the same thing.  So the good thing is that probably--except for my older brother who got a football scholarship, and they really, they like practically called up the college, said, "Take him," the rest of us had been through, you know, similar experiences.
Story_ID: 300293
Speaker 1: Your senior year in high school, you get, you get accepted to Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] you said it was one person though at Hopewell [Hopewell Valley Central High School, Pennington, New Jersey] (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was one person who really--and that was the principal, you know, the problem we had was with the vice principal, but Mr. Willever [Richard H. Willever] I'll never forget him.
Speaker 1: His name is what?
Speaker 2: Mr. Willever
Speaker 1: Willever.
Speaker 2: And he was very liberal I mean, you know, in the '60s [1960s] you had people who were very liberal.  And he was very supportive.  I mean, he was that guy who always made me feel like I could do anything, not that, not that--and that I was special in the sense that, you know, if you wanna take this world by its tail, you know, you could do that.  And he never--he always seemed like he was stepping out of my way so that I can do that.  And because he was the principal he didn't have a lot of hands-on.  But the few times when we would interact he would always encourage me not try and say well you need to change, and you need to be different.  He was always, and he didn't keep his job long (laughter).  I mean he kept mean he was in the school system for a long time don't get me wrong 'cause he was a teacher for a while then vice principal.  But once he become principal, and his philosophy was much more--wasn't that he wasn't a strict principal.  It was just that he didn't--kids who had their own identities he encouraged you to keep your own identities rather than being this big conformist.  Maybe that was the difference.  But, but also, high school was sort of traumatic for me, 'cause it's--junior year was the year my mother [Winifred Crews Clark] died.
Story_ID: 300294
Speaker 1: It was Mother's Day my junior year [at Hopewell Valley Central High School, Pennington, New Jersey], and she [Jenkins' mother, Winifred Crews Clark] had an aneurysm.  It was the night after my junior--it was the night of my junior prom.  I'd gone out to my junior prom, and I remember I came in some ungodly hour (laughter).  You know, but I was only allowed to do because it was my junior prom.  And my mom was waiting up for me as she always would.  And we had a very long talk about just an unusual talk about life and guys and, you know, all kinds of stuff.  And the next morning at 6:30 or so she woke up, and she complained that her back was hurting her and the doctor came and said she had a virus in her back.  And then he left and within an hour she was gone.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it turned out she had some sort of an aneurysm. Forty-eight years old.  So that was I mean I had lost my grandmother and my aunt before that who were very close to me.  My grandmother died in '62 [1962] so, you know, it may me about six so, you know, I didn't go to the funeral.  And I didn't, you know, and I remember missing her, but she was also old, you know.  And the same thing with my aunt she was in her eighties actually my aunt died after my mother died that aunt did.  But another aunt who had, had cancer who had been very lively and just strong personality died of cancer, so I watched that.  But again didn't go to the funeral, so this was really the first trauma in my life the first sort of non-idyllic for me a non-idyllic kind of situation in my life like that personal life.  And right after that was when I get my go-ahead to be an exchange student and so because my mom had died they adjusted my time period.  I was supposed to go away for a whole year, so I left in June and came back in--left the beginning--end of May and came back in September instead of going for a whole year.  But it was a traumatic time, you know, still is I think.  I think anybody who's lost a parent fifty years later, you know, you still miss 'em so I'm no exception (laughter) to that.  But, but it was sort of my turnaround time in my life a spiritual turnaround to 'cause I remember sitting in bed that morning and just doing a--I wasn't in a deeply spiritual child I did--went through all the motions but didn't really have a personal relationship.  And I remember doing a strong prayer that said okay don't let her suffer.  If you gonna take her take her quick and she went quick (laughter) so then I had to (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did you have a sense that she was dying before she died?
Speaker 1: No, absolutely not I mean, you know, she woke up and said, you know, I got a pain in my back.  And the only thing that was very weird is my mother was not a send us to go do things kind of mother.  Like, go get me this or can you go get me that.  I-that--just never did that, and she asked my sister to go get her some Tums or Rolaids 'cause she--and I that just was weird, and it was 6:30 in the morning.  And so she got up she was complaining about this pain in her back.  So for me part of it was--my sister was home at the time, and my father [Arthur Clark] was at home we were the only ones left at home.  And so when I got up and she had had this--the doctor came and gave her some sort of sedative and then left and I had gone downstairs.  And then something was going on between my sister and my father and then I saw my father run down the steps, and my sister ran down the steps and called the doctor again.  And then I heard the sirens go off 'cause we lived in a small town where they called the volunteer ambulance.  And the sirens went off, and then I'm just sitting in--literally sitting in the middle of the living room just watching this.  You know, I have no idea what's going on, and then I watched--then the ambulance, the doctor comes in.  And then I see my father walk into the living room walk across the room and just drop into a chair.  And put his hands into and, and clearly crying put his hands--and I'm just looking at him.  And, you know, I'm going--and, you know, I think there is of--there's a sense of what had happened but just like what the heck is going on here.  So I think I stayed in a little bit of shock for a couple of days.  You know, all my siblings came home, and it was Mother's Day, and we were planning to go to my sisters' in Maryland that day.  And we had--my dad had bought my mom a yellow dress.  And so that's the dress we put on her and all four of us girls--we had four daughters wore yellow to match her dress.  So we look at it as a celebration but me talking to God and saying, "Okay, take her."  Then I felt guilty, and I was like, "Oh no, I told him to take her quick and not to have her linger if he was going to take her.  So did I do this?"  You know, so that was the beginning of some sort of--some exploration for me, some spiritual exploration for me as well.

Speaker 1: So you went through your senior year [at Hopewell Valley Central High School, Pennington, New Jersey] without your mother [Winifred Crews Clark] and (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah and that was a little rough, my dad [Arthur Clark] when I look back at it now, was probably a little shut down my senior year.  And so I was a little wilder than I would've normally have been, 'cause my mom was gone, my dad was a little shut down.  All of my sisters and brothers were now gone.  And so I sort of took care of myself after that, and I'm not so sure I was--so I had less supervision.  Lots of hits and misses lots of things that probably should've taken me out of the running and didn't.  And I look back on it now going--(laughter), you know, all the mistakes I made.  And I just by the grace of God just stuff that probably could've should've changed my life forever.  And I skipped out, skipped off scott-free of some of it but not always good choices during that period.  But just shows you, you know, I mean up until my mother dying and then, of course, my dad being a little shut down that year after I was probably a model teenager.  Take away the supervision just for one year (laughter).  You know, a little bit of hell on wheels that last year.
Speaker 1: Yeah well, you know, you had two of kind of sort of depressions in a sense (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --then to so it's gotta be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --bad on--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I went away probably one of the things that did help is I went away right afterward.  You know, I mean my mom died in May I was on a plane to Austria three (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you were an exchange student?
Speaker 2: Yeah, three or four weeks later.
Speaker 1: American Field Service [AFS]?
Speaker 2: American Field Service three or four weeks later I was on a plane to Austria (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well were you there all year?
Speaker 2: No, I was supposed to go for the year but because my mother died I only stayed June through the end of August, so June, July, August, three months with a family and--
Speaker 1: And that was right after your mother died?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 300296
Speaker 1: That was an interesting experience, because I had spent some of my high school years [at Hopewell Valley Central High School, Pennington, New Jersey] sort of, you know, I won't say I was an anarchist in a sense of, you know.  But I was very negative on the U.S. a little at least the racist culture I felt.  I was a little down on but when you go to another country, all of a sudden you're like rah, rah U.S., you know, U.S., you know, yay team (laughter).  You know, it was very--because I ran into people who said I just don't get why you all do this, and I'd be like well we do this 'cause of this and that.  You know, so whatever it was--but also the race thing in Austria I lived in the Alps in a town that really was at the base of the Alps, a very tiny town.  We were--I was an oddity, so it wasn't a negative thing it was just different I mean I be walking down the street, and old ladies would point at me and saying a negrin [ph.], negrin, you know, cause they just had never seen anybody before.  It wasn't a negative thing or I--we went to visit the monastery and the nuns just went--touch, you know.  They were just went touching me, you know, I mean just like I had been an alien who had landed.  And so I was never offended by because it was just it was nothing negative behind it, you know.  There was no, you know, well because you're different then we'll treat you this way it was almost just the opposite.  I was almost like I was the celebrity in town but also I learned, you know, to speak I'd had taken four or five years of French.  And they sent (laughter) me to some place where they speak German with like five-day language camp before they put us on the train with changing trains probably three times.  And put us on a train with tickets to get to our (laughter) location after five-day language camp.  But I learned to speak German fluently, you know, I mean by the time I came home after three months I was dreaming in German.  And I wasn't translating I was thinking in German can't do it anymore but--'cause, you know, you don't use it you lose it.  But I understood the mechanics of learning a language, so if I ever want my kids to learn, you know, my thing is, throw 'em in the culture where they don't speak English for a couple of months and they'll get it.
Story_ID: 300297
Speaker 1: When you came back you finished your senior year [at Hopewell Valley Central High School, Pennington, New Jersey] and went on to Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey].  Was Princeton--what expectations did you have of Princeton and did it meet your expectations?
Speaker 2: Gee, I don't think I had any expectation of Princeton that's really funny.  I don't think I looked at it as hard or easy but sort of my personality is I sort of took life as it comes.  And I actually enjoy change I don't crave change, but when I'm changing, I'm excited about it.  But I also nest wherever I am, you know.  So, but--so I think once I was going I wasn't excited to leave home I--very happy at home.  I was excited to go to something new, but I don't think I had any real expectations of it.  But when I got there I had a little culture shock because, you know, there were people that culture shock the other way but for me 350 black people on campus was like wow.  I've never seen this many (laughter) black people before wow it's a lot of people.  And I gravitated towards that it was a time of my life where I really wanted that--I really wanted what I consider a black environment.  But course I never knew that Princeton out of what 3500 people on campus 350 black students including grand students was not like some big black environment but for me, you know, it was (laughter).  So, (laughter), so that was--I probably needed it in stages anyway, but I think I underestimated the academics, underestimated the impact of the social life.
Story_ID: 300298
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was it tough when you first got there [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Wasn't that, wasn't that class was tough, it's that I didn't get there that often (laughter) so that was the tough part.  I mean, I mean I had the intellect to do it but, you know, I was too busy just being in all of the social life, you know, same thing, you know, we probably criticize most of our kids from doing.  I, I lived that--where I got there, and I was just so happy to be anywhere where there was a social life that, you know, I--if I had an eight o'clock class they never saw me.  And so I was a crammer, so I didn't go to class a lot of the semester.  And then come time for exams I would--'cause they give you a syllabus.  So you're like okay well I got this, you know, okay paper do on this day.  Okay, I'll get the paper in and so I sort of skated through. I had one semester I think I was on academic probation but generally other than that one semester I did very well with very little effort.  And probably the tell-tale was my senior year I took a course that I had never ever been in class for, and we had an exam of final exam never been the class never read any materials, and I got a B+ (laughter) on the final, final exam.
Speaker 1: And what was the class can you tell me what the class was?
Speaker 2: The class was--it wasn't a gut.  I majored in anthropology, and it was an anthropology course in my major.  And I, I don't remember what the class was, but I didn't go to class once.  And I--but interestingly enough and this is my defense of all of that is that I was in a strong academic environment.  So it wasn't that I was skating on the academics I was skating on maybe going to class I was reading the books, I was having an intellectual discourse--so even though I was being very social.  I mean I had--I have more political understanding of wrestling too because it was a very intellectual group of people.  So when we sat at dinner and somebody would say and so and so this happened in the world today all hell broke loose in terms of the discussion.  And so part of it is I'm very competitive so when people would say well this is because of this and the history.  And, and I didn't know any of that I'd be in the library studying so I can have this intellectual discourse on what was going on in the world.  So I may not have been in class much my first periods and, and that wasn't the--let me--I don't want to make it sound as chronic as I'm probably making it sound.  I mean, I had a couple of bad semesters but, you know, there were semesters where if the course excited me I was there like all of the Afro-Am courses I majored in that.  I was--my major was anthropology, my minor was African American studies.  Every African American studies course, I didn't miss it.  The political science courses I took, I didn't miss one of those.
Story_ID: 300299
Speaker 1: Now who were some of the professors that you remembered at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Marguerite [Ross] Barnett was a professor there.
Speaker 1: Was she anthropology or African American studies?
Speaker 2: She was political science.
Speaker 1: Political science.
Speaker 2: Cornel West was a classmate (laughter), and Cornel was really funny because Cornel was a grad student at the time.  But the African American studies courses were all combined.  And we had a--and actually, Marguerite Barnett was in the political studies department but because African American studies wasn't a major you got a certificate in it.  Then she also taught courses in that as well.  And so it was a course on African Americans in film, and Marguerite Barnett was teaching the course.  And Cornel West was in the class with me, and the class had maybe ten students in the whole class.  And Cornel sometimes--we'd have these, you know, everybody would be talking we read the coon books, you know, that mammies and that, that, you know, study (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Donald Belton's book.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Donald Belton's book and we'd have these, you know, normal discourses, intellectual discourses.  And then Cornel would open his mouth, and he would go into this whole long thing.  And I remember a friend of mine once said, and it was so true he said, "I don't know what that brother just said, but it was deep" (laughter).  You know, it really was it was deep 'cause Cornel would say the stuff, and you could follow him part of the way.  But then he--even this group of what were considered the cream of the crop intellectuals Cornel would say stuff, and you go I don't know what he said, but it was good (laughter).  It was, and I know it was an intellectual, and I know a was smart, but I totally didn't get everything, you know, it'd be like could you repeat that.  And he have--and he'd look at you like what do you mean you didn't understand what I said because he just thought on a whole other plane from people.  You know, nicest guy and just, you know, I'm just crazy about Cornel but he couldn't--I'd have to stop him even on, you know, if we're talking about something.  And you have to go okay stop Cornel I got you up to this point but you starting to losing me a little, you know.  So it wasn't, it wasn't an interesting group, Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs [Princeton, New Jersey].  I took a course there so, you know, I got a huge--I got a lot of intellectual training at Princeton.
Story_ID: 300300
Speaker 1: I was also only the fourth class of women to go all the way through.  And so bathrooms were hard to find on campus.  So (laughter) and I remember having a couple--I remember I took a course on African colonialism but again sometimes motivated by teachers who just totally teed me off.  And one teacher was teaching this class on colonialism in Africa, and he was talking about Jomo Kenyatta and just reamed him, just made him a laughing figure, just joked about him in the class.  And just--and I had just read the book 'Facing Mount Kenya' [Jomo Kenyatta], which to me was I wasn't much of a reader in those days.  You know, I'm a voracious reader now, but I wasn't much of reader then.  When I read that book it just it, it opened me up to the whole--to just wanting to know more about Africa and about cultures in Africa.  And more than what I had seen when I was a kid with spears and, you know, John Wayne movies or whatever.  But so, to have him then to come into a course and have him just, you know, whether he was a positive or negative figure in history is to make him a joke just laid me out.  And I wound up slamming the door out of the course, and so I came in to see him later, and he said, "Oh I have to apologize.  I thought you left the course because you were angry," and one of my friends somebody who was black said, "Oh no she left 'cause she had an appointment."  And which later I had to sort of call him out on that one I said, "I did leave because I was angry," and I explained to him why.  And so he had me write a paper--he said well then write a paper on it.  So I wrote a paper on it that was honestly brilliant, and he gave me like a C minus because he didn't agree with the point of view I took.  And so I ran into kind of--that happened to me a couple of times when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was a black professor?
Speaker 1: No a white professor.  That happened to me a couple of times when--at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] where professors graded you based on viewpoints rather than on the intellectual.  I mean, I know when I wrote something that was good, and I spent the time to write it.  And I know when I wrote something that was there was fluff.  I mean, you know, I knew that and, believe me, I got enough A's on fluff stuff to just laugh about it but something I felt passionately about and wrote from a strong analytical perspective.  So for him to give me a C minus I mean, I called him out on that too, and basically his explanation was he didn't agree with my point of view.  So there was a little bit of intellectual snobbery there.
Story_ID: 300301
Speaker 1: Shockley [William Shockley] I mean, I got involved with--almost dropped out of Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] was ready to give up my Princeton education (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now this was the famous Shockley who wrote--?
Speaker 1: Who wrote the thing that said that black people were inferior and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, intellectually inferior to white people?
Speaker 1: Right, and--
Speaker 2: He was a physicist, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I believe, by training.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: And not a--
Speaker 1: And Shockley was going to debate--
Speaker 2: Dr. William Shockley?
Speaker 1: Yes Dr. William Shockley was going to debate someone can't remember who it was (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dr. Frances Cress Welsing?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: You know, he debated her on the Tony Brown show ['Tony Brown's Journal'] at one point (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no with want to debate him anyway it was somebody white is going to debate at Princeton.  And we just went through a whole--
Speaker 2: It was Ashley Montagu I think.
Speaker 1: You're right it was Ashley Montagu (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dr. Ashley Montagu.
Speaker 1: You're right boy that was good Dr. Ashley Montagu that was who he was going to debate at Princeton.  And we protested, we protested, and we were gonna do sit-ins we were gonna do like all kinds of stuff to just--I was just indignant about this.  And that they were gonna allow him to come, and, you know, just spread such garbage.  And so the powers that be said that if we protested and interfered 'cause what our plan was is to stand up and to disrupt that we would all be suspended and expelled.  I remember having a meeting, I remember being in tears.  I remember calling my father [Arthur Clark] and saying just want to let you know this is important to me and if I get expelled oh well I get expelled.  So, I mean we were already I was ready to go to the wall on this one.  Then they came back and said there was no more reason for us to go to the wall because Ashley Montagu was no longer debating Shockley.  It was now going to be Roy Innis so because Roy Innis was debating him now it was--and to me, it was like and so? (Laughter) And but what happened was we had like one thousand students ready to like lay down their college educations.  And when they announced--it was like just me, you know, (laughter), so it was--the I mean the disappointments and, you know, I was ready to like lay down my, but I was--wasn't prepared to do about myself.  And at that point, it was like we withdrew our objections because Roy Innis was there.  And so what happened was a couple of students--one student went in and turned his back on them and just stood there.  He didn't disrupt--he just stood there with his back to them.  So, I mean there was--and I did some protesting I protested outside, but I didn't go in and disrupt.
Speaker 2: So the point of the process was that William Shockley ideas were so ridiculous they had no place on there?
Speaker 1: Well that was mine that's what I thought everybody's objection was because to me it didn't matter who he was debating.  But when they discovered well now he's no longer debating Ashley Montagu, and I guess the feeling was by debating Roy Innis the black perspective was being heard.  It didn't change anything for me, but it changed everything for the 999 other students who decided not--that it wasn't worth, you know, laying down our college education so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is the equation that I've heard because I, I heard Ashley Montagu actually debated on 'Phil Donahue' ['The Phil Donahue Show'].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Ashley Montagu is more than equipped to handle William Shockley.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well actually (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't think Roy Innis could deal with them as anthropologists and see not neither one of them are anthropologists or--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --or brain--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --scientists (laughter).
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: So it's--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I mean Roy Innis was going to debate him on the, you know, I don't know what Roy Innis is on is certainly wasn't going to be on the side of physicists (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That make you wonder doesn't it?
Speaker 1: But an interesting irony is that my cousin--first cousin who grew up in the house across the street from me who became a professor at, at a Berkeley [University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California] wound up debating, debating William Shockley and he changed his name became a Muslim became Cedric X, and he debated him at Berkeley.  So that was a whole another thing then of course when he came home we had to have this big family debate.  So now we got Cedric X, my sister who's been arrested as (laughter) thinking she was [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis.  And my brother who's grown up really in another era, whose second wife is white.  And so now we're going through this whole--and then we've got these--my parents who in the middle of the road, you know, can't we all just get along (laughter) people.  Christmas was interesting in those days.
Speaker 2: It sounds like it was (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 300302
Speaker 1: You really were in a stimulating environment there at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] it sounds like.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Princeton was a very stimulating--I can tell you my experience there was very different from probably particularly most white students and males.  'Cause like I said, I was the fourth class of women to go all the way through.  But I did partake I mean ideas stop and smell the roses a little bit at Princeton, which I think a lot of black students didn't do.  So I was a member of Triangle Club, I was a cheerleader, you know, I mean I did get involved in--I think it's sort of my history.  I did that in high school [Hopewell Valley Central High School, Pennington, New Jersey] too.  I was sort of a rabble-rouser, but I also was a partaker of all the opportunities.  And my father [Arthur Clark] said actually he said this to me about ten years ago when somebody was asking him about me, and he said I never met anybody who everything they tried to do and everything they went out for they got.  And I thought about it, and I argued with him at first.  And I thought about it, and I said I really have been blessed most of my life that, you know, if I--every college I applied to I got in.  I went out to be an exchange student I got it, you know, everything I tried to do or I applied too.  But then I said, but I worked hard at stuff.  I mean, you know, I mean there was sort of that dichotomy which is, on the one hand, I probably was intellectually lazy.  But then when something stimulated me, and I really wanted to do it, I put all my energy out into wanting to do it.
