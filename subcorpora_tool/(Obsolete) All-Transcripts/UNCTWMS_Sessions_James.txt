Jessica Wilkerson: This is July 7, 2009, and I&#8217;m here with Jim Sessions for an interview.  The first question, Jim, is kind of a broad question.  What early experiences influenced your career as an activist and organizer?
Jim Sessions: I think the earliest had to do with growing up in Texas, West Texas, in a rigidly segregated society and educational system and so forth and seeing racism first hand, and the church that I went to, and to have been with the youth program that I was a member of--.  Well my dad was a minister and he would take my brother and myself to--.  He would exchange pulpits with small African American churches in whatever town we were living in at the time.  He would take us to those services and we were just always thunderstruck by the differences and how moving and energetic the black church was as opposed to the white church, [Laughs] but ne&#8217;er the twain shall meet.  So I grew up in segregated public school systems, university system, and church, and I think I was first struck certainly by racism during that time.  Later on class became more important to me, but I think my earliest ones had to do with growing up in that segregated society.
JW: And you said your dad took you to black churches.  Was he involved in anti-Jim Crow--?
JS: No, no, no.  He was political.  He was a good Democrat.  He was a Roosevelt Democrat, I mean John L. Lewis and Franklin Delano Roosevelt were our saints. [Laughs] Then later on in Texas it was harder to be a Democrat, but no, he was not an activist.  I just think he was a liberal minister who played his bureaucratic game within the church but also had this outreach sense of everybody, all God&#8217;s children kind of thing, so he wanted us to understand that too.
JW: So what were your first organizing experiences?
JS: Organizing experiences?  Well, I think that many took place in what we then called the Christian Student Movement, where the student Christian movement in this country--it was part of the world Student Christian Federation--but I as both an undergraduate and as a seminary student took part in some civil rights demonstrations in Dallas, Texas at Woolworth&#8217;s, picketing at Woolworth&#8217;s and sitting in at Woolworth&#8217;s in Dallas. And we organized a student chapter of the NAACP there to do those activities.  Then later on as a chaplain in a number of colleges and universities during the &#8217;60s was a very, very energetic, vibrant time against the war in Vietnam as well as dealing with going down--.  We would go to Montgomery, go to Selma, we&#8217;d go to Birmingham, take students on buses down, and that got us really involved in a way with the movement that was starting in the South, but on college campuses, not only the movement against the war in Vietnam.  So I think those initial organizing really had to do with mid-&#8217;60s civil rights activities and then organizing with students around the war in Vietnam.  Those were probably the earliest ones.
JW: Can you describe what it was like being a Southern activist in the Northeast?
JS: Well, it could be a really long story. [Laughs] I never experienced any real prejudice or antagonism towards me as a white Southerner in the Northeast on the college campuses that I was on.  I think I was thought of as being interesting. [Laughs] But I never had any problem with that, though on the other hand I felt different, and Fran Ansley, my partner in the &#8217;60s then, also felt different. And it really had to do with why we moved south.  We increasingly were impressed with the role that class, income, jobs, had to do with politics and were always totally dumbfounded [by] how working class people in Boston could support the war and be over against the students who were putting their bodies on the line lots, when it was their kids who were becoming cannon fodder in this war.  We just always could not fathom that, and so I think it made Fran and me both study and work with and try to visit with and learn from working-class folks in Boston.  When you do that and you&#8217;re white from the South you discover a couple of things.  One is working-class whites in Boston, in the Northeast, are generally Catholic and white, and if you are Protestant you probably are black and low income, so we were neither--.  We were not Catholic and we were not black, so we didn&#8217;t fit into either category of socialization up there. So it made us think, we should go home. [Laughs] So that&#8217;s what we did.  We kind of bailed out and left the Northeast and left jobs behind and came south without jobs, really for the reason that we felt like our organizing work and our movement work needed to take place in our own indigenous kind of population that we understood, much more comfortable stopping in a country and western bar and listening to Waylon Jennings than stopping in an Irish bar in East Boston and listening to &#8220;Danny Boy,&#8221; you know?
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: So it was that difference that we experienced as white Southerners in the Northeast really that said we should go back.  We understand African Americans in the South better than we do in the North.  We certainly are white Southerners ourselves.  Our people are white Southerners, so that difference really made a big difference to us, and deciding to move to East Tennessee followed the same kind of line that low income and working communities in southern Appalachia were by and large white, working-class folks.  Well, that was our society, you know, differently from say Birmingham or Charleston.  Roanoke, Knoxville, Chattanooga or Asheville all made more sense to us in terms of our ability to understand and then contribute to the movement.  There&#8217;s another story about what was going on down here at that time that also might be really interesting but that can come later on.
JW: Okay.  Related to that, I wondered also when you came back did you feel like an outsider again because you had been educated--.
JS: No.
JW: Okay.
JS: No, fell right in.
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: It was just--.  It really was a great sense of relief to be back home in places that we understood, knew somewhat the history of, understood the mores of, and even though different people would be very confused or misled we would understand where that was coming from, so I think we felt really at home.
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: Initially in Nashville, which is where we first moved to just as a stopping off place, before deciding to move to East Tennessee.
JW: Okay.  How did you get involved in organizing in southern Appalachia?  You&#8217;ve kind of said your personal reasons for doing that.
JS: Yeah.  Well the first little organizing activity was again trying to take seriously our own experience and background.  I&#8217;d been in campus ministry and a college chaplain for ten years or so, so that&#8217;s kind of what I knew, and Bill Troy, who we induced to come down and join Fran and me down here, [he and I] had both been members of first the Cambridge Ministry in Higher Education, which we organized in Boston, which was an ecumenical ministry at Harvard and MIT and so forth.  We said we should learn from that, so we drew a circle around Knoxville, a hundred and fifty mile radius, and identified all the working-class higher educational institutions that were really sort of popping up then called community colleges.  These community colleges bridged that kind of community and higher education that we&#8217;d always worked for and the students there were mainly coming out of first generation college--.  They were the first kids to go to college from their families, so they were working-class kids coming out of working-class families in the coal fields in eastern Kentucky and in southwest Virginia and eastern Tennessee.  So we said we know about campuses and campus ministries and students and faculties and so forth, so our focus is going to be a hundred and fifty mile radius of all the community colleges that are in that circle, and it turned out to be a bunch.
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: So we traveled to Isothermal Community College and to Walters State and to Roane State, Virginia Highlands, Big Stone Gap, etcetera, organizing some faculty and students to be members of what we then called the Southern Appalachian Ministry in Higher Education. [Laughs] So that was our first little effort down here and then we spun off from that.
JW: But it had a sort of social justice--
JS: Oh, definitely.
JW: --goal?
JS: Definitely, definitely, because what also came along with that choice was the discovery, once we got to digging, that the community college systems that were just popping up then in large part were meant to train people for jobs that they would never find in their own community. So in southwest Virginia at Virginia Highlands you were going to have to move to Johnson City or to Knoxville or to Chattanooga or to Roanoke to get a job.  It was to build up a surplus labor pool of people who were somewhat trained to take jobs in industrial and economic growth in what the Appalachian Regional Commission called industrial growth zones that they had identified in Appalachia around Knoxville, around Tri-Cities, around Chattanooga, and so on.  So we saw this so-called education that was taking place in the community colleges as really anti-community, anti-working-class education that was going [to] de-people, take the youth out of the mountains and move them into the industrial growth zones where they would take low paid jobs and not live at home anymore and abandon their culture and their community.  We took that on as a sort of a fight and we carried it to the Appalachian Regional Commission, and we carried that message that these kids should be trained and educated to serve their communities, not to serve the industrial growth plans of the national corporations, so that was sort of our--.  Then you get into race, you get into class, you get into all the issues that you--and sexism--that you run into, but that was the way we went about it initially.
JW: So how did the Appalachian Regional Commission and all of the people along with that who were working so much on the highways and the industrial growth zones, how did they respond to that sort of activity?
JS: On our part?
JW: Yeah.
JS: Oh, they hated it.
JW: [Laughs]
JS: Oh, very much hated it.  Later on when I&#8217;d become the director of the Commission on Religion in Appalachia, which came as sort of an outgrowth of that other--I mean our role in it grew out of that earlier work--we invited the director of the Appalachian Regional Commission to address the Commission on Religion in Appalachia. We had that meeting in Washington and we also had the president of the United Mine Workers come to that meeting. The head of the Appalachian Regional Commission chastised, publicly chastised me and the commissioners and all these people who he said were providing a disservice to the people of Appalachia by doing this fear mongering about what the scheme was, and just as much as said these people have to move and you are inhibiting their movement by discouraging them from moving and giving them reasons not to move.  They&#8217;re going to have to move.  So this kind of population removal was a part--.  And he just said it right out loud, [Laughs] you know.  People who live in the coal fields, people who live in Buckhannon, Virginia, they&#8217;re going to have to move, that&#8217;s all there is to it, and you are a disservice by discouraging them from moving. [Laughs] It was great.
JW: [Laughs] You knew you were succeeding at that point.
JS: [Laughs] That&#8217;s right.  That&#8217;s right.
JW: Well, I had a question--.  One of my questions, what your view of the War on Poverty [and its] benefit at the time.  That answers it a little bit, but I wonder if you want to say more about the War on Poverty.
JS: Well, I&#8217;m not an economic--.  I&#8217;m not an expert on all of this and I think people in Appalachia were really proud that President Johnson--first of all that John Kennedy, that whole story of John Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey in the West Virginia primary.  I think people were sort of proud of that popularly, and then after Kennedy was killed and Johnson came down and famously stood on the front porch of the little shack with the little barefooted kids running around and blah, blah, blah.  They were proud of that kind of initiative and taking seriously the region and its economy and its people.  I think people were very proud of that, but I think that over time people began to see it wasn&#8217;t all it was cut out to be and that some people really took a much more skeptical view and called it the War on the People [Laughs] in Appalachia instead of the War on Poverty.  And it also continued those schemes of moving people out and getting them in industrial growth zones.  That was still a part of the War on Poverty, and the War on Poverty didn&#8217;t end poverty in Appalachia, so that was too bad.  I think over time it proved not to be all it was cut out to be, though initially I think we were very pleased and proud to have been finally seen, not be invisible in the nation.  But then it turned out to be one more story about the poor pitiful Appalachians, and we fall back against that image and that caricature of the people of the region as being poor and pitiful rather than proud and powerful, so we had to fight that.  I think it was a pretty mixed score.
JW: Mm hmm.  What did you see as the key concerns in southern Appalachia in the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s?
JS: Well, when Fran and I first moved here one of the reasons we moved, in addition to the ones I said earlier, was things were happening in southern Appalachia that were very exciting and very interesting.  Institutionally here in Knoxville or in this part of East Tennessee there was this big economic nexus at the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratories and TVA and Alcoa.  That&#8217;s a huge bunch of forces to come together in this part of the region, so there was that going on structurally and economically here, but more importantly for us the Black Lung Movement was starting in the coal fields, the Miners for Democracy was starting within the United Mine Workers to throw out the corrupt regime that ran the Mine Workers at that time, the Council of [the] Southern Mountains was very strong and growing and very vibrant, and there was a growing anti-strip mine movement happening, so the Black Lung Movement, the anti-strip mine movement, the Miners for Democracy, Council of Southern Mountains, and also Highlander was here as well.  All those things just made this really a very exciting time where people were in movement, and not students from the colleges, these were the communities in movement, to save their land from strip mining, to save their jobs and their lives from the black lung, to save their union and their future jobs and the viability of those jobs from a corrupt union.  All of those were just very exciting things to work on.  In the late &#8217;60s and early &#8217;70s those were terrific things to latch onto and we certainly did.  We just kind of threw everything that we had into working with those different movements, pursuing those issues.
JW: Mm hmm.  So shall we move--?
JS: I should add one more, though, and that was tourism.
JW: Oh, yeah.
JS: Tourism and timber, especially in western Carolina, where communities were being kind of just sold out for tourism and where the forest was just being decimated by the timber companies, so those were two other aspects, all having to do with land, right?
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: Strip mining, coal mining, timbering, tourism development, TVA and the dams and the rivers and the lakes; it was all very different from Boston.
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: [Laughs]
JW: I&#8217;m just curious personally what organization or organizations addressed tourism, because it still seems such a huge, ever-growing part of this area.
JS: Yeah.  I don&#8217;t think anyone real was and did.  We contracted--.  The Southern Appalachian Ministry kind of identified these issues and we raised funds to get research and writing done on those, and we hired a wonderful woman who did a study of tourism development in western Carolina.  Then some other people did a study of the tourism industry around Gatlinburg and growing around Pigeon Forge--Pigeon Forge [back then] was not the Pigeon Forge we know today--and it was called &#8220;All That Glitters Is Not Gold&#8221;--or was it &#8220;All That&#8217;s Gold Does Not Glitter&#8221;? [Laughs] Those were two, but no real organizing took place around that so much as in the other areas, that I know of.
JW: Does it make sense to move on to your work with CORA, or is there anything in between that we should talk about?
JS: Well, no, there is in between.  The Southern Appalachian Ministry developed and we had a good board of directors and fellow allies and colleagues, and after our first round of working in the community colleges and relating to the various issues I just named we decided to break the Southern Appalachian Ministry [SAM] up into two components on two different issues, and one was energy and one was labor.  The energy component worked on TVA, TVA rates, nuclear power, dams, like the one built on the Little Tennessee River, they built the Tellico Lake, strip mining; those are all energy issues, and so Bill Troy took that component.  The other one was labor, what was happening with the United Mine Workers, what was happening with the organizing, [union people around here], what was happening with the black lung movement and miners getting their compensation, and I took the labor movement.  Out of that grew something between then and CORA, which was SAM, and Bill started the East Tennessee Energy Group that became TVEC, Tennessee Valley Energy Coalition. And my labor thing became the Southerners for Economic Justice that had really started in Durham with Bill Finger, but then he didn&#8217;t stay very long after starting it and I became the director of Southerners for Economic Justice.  That was closely, closely [Laughs] related to the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union, the Textile Workers Union, and the organizing of J.P. Stevens workers throughout the South, so in a way I got sort of sprung from southern Appalachia because that became a South-wide organizing effort that went on for a number of years. It was only when Southerners for Economic Justice had kind of concluded its work on the J.P. Stevens organizing drive that then I left SEJ and went to the Commission on Religion in Appalachia.
JW: Okay.
JS: A little piece in between.
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: Actually it was a big piece in between.
JW: [Laughs] Yeah, it sounds like a big piece.  So what were the primary goals of the Commission on Religion in Appalachia, from your perspective?
JS: I think that was always a good question [Laughs] and I&#8217;m not sure it was a question that was ever answered.  The Commission on Religion in Appalachia began as sort of the church&#8217;s piece of the federal government&#8217;s initiative of the War on Poverty in Appalachia, so I think the National Council of Churches and the national denominations all said that&#8217;s really important; the church should have a role in it.  After all they&#8217;d had settlement schools and hospitals in Appalachia for years and had been in this kind of service role with nurses and missionaries from somewhere else, so CORA began sort of as the church&#8217;s piece of the government&#8217;s War on Poverty in Appalachia.  There was always a battle about the degree to which it was a service organization or an advocacy organization and that had become sort of bitter internally when they hired me, so with allies within the churches we were able to move it from basically a service commission into being an advocacy.  We funded land use studies, land use research; worked with John Gaventa at Highlander and [26:30] on the study of what mining was doing to the region; we made common cause with the mine workers.  The Miners for Democracy had been successful, although some people were murdered along the way.  So ours was an effort to turn the Commission on Religion in Appalachia into the church&#8217;s economic justice campaign for the region, and we were successful at doing that and could talk Presbyterians and Methodists and Baptists and Episcopalians and Lutherans and Catholics and Disciples and Church of Christ and a vast array of denominations who at least on the national level could understand that.  None of them lived in Appalachia, [Laughs] right?  They could be theoretically for that and support us in that work, and that happened and we got some very good support, mainly from national denominational structures, for the Commission on Religion in Appalachia to take us into kind of a labor justice and economic justice region wide, from Pennsylvania to Alabama and all the religious configurations in between.  So that&#8217;s what we did, and I think there were people who still wanted it always to be a service organization and kept tugging us back into co-ops and kind of missionary things and we kind of fundamentally became an anti-missionary [Laughs] thing because we didn&#8217;t need missionaries coming in from Boston and New York--like ourselves--because we were a grassroots, congregation based, up from the bottom, take care of ourselves, so we did a lot of funding of grassroots organizations.  We were funding at one point between half a million and six hundred thousand dollars a year of church money, going to local grassroots advocacy organizations like the Council of Southern Mountains and like the Black Lung Movement and so forth.  I think we felt good about especially being able to literally deliver resources to strong, organizing, grassroots organizations, or not always so strong but growing grassroots organizations in the region.
JW: So that was a major shift when you became director at that point, was the shift from service to advocacy.
JS: Right.
JW: What challenges, because I imagine there were many with such a major shift, but what were some of the challenges that you faced that you didn&#8217;t really expect?
JS: Well, that&#8217;s a good--.  Well I think, and I don&#8217;t know that we didn&#8217;t expect this, but if you are middle class, mainline, religious affiliated workers, like CORA--.  CORA was made up of major national denominations, every one of which was a mainline, mainly white, denomination; whereas the churches in Appalachia are mainly not mainline, except in the county seat towns.  We were an organization of county seat churches, [Laughs] right?  But the people we cared about were not so much the people in the county seats but out in the mountains.  They didn&#8217;t belong to our churches. [Laughs] They belonged to the Four Square Gospel and the little Dove of Holy Spirit church, these small, independent, either charismatic or Pentecostal or fundamentalist churches, so they really were not our churches. So it took us a while to really understand that there was this real distinction between where we were coming from and where they were coming from, and we were the class bound people trying to advocate for folks that really understood their religiousness in a very different way, certainly different forms.  So that was something to understand, and especially when you began working on labor issues, working with the mine workers and in the coal fields, you understood that if you were there representing CORA you were there representing the Presbyterian Church or the Baptist Church or the Methodist Church and so forth, and those are the denominations of management, right?  That&#8217;s not where the coal miners belong to.  So we were there representing management religiousness as opposed to this, and so it was a contradiction that was one that I really had not anticipated. But it was a huge learning experience to try to figure that out, but it made it possible for us to go into those county seat churches of mainline denominations and argue with them and fight with them about their priorities and whether the coal company management should be running the church, [Laughs] which is often the case, and whether they should be aiding the coal miners who were trying to organize their union or get their black lung benefits.
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: Or to fight off the ravages of strip mining, or what have you.  So that was a big learning curve, I think, for us and one that&#8217;s not resolved by any stretch of the imagination but it&#8217;s an important one, I think.
JW: So did you have to focus more on building bridges with those mainline churches or did you also have to think about building the bridges with the--?
JS: Both, both, both, because we weren&#8217;t natural to either direction.
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: [Laughs] And our credibility was not great in either direction because in a sense we were in the mainline congregations fighting for people out in the county who were going to some other church that night, so that&#8217;s not where they were coming from. Then we&#8217;d be in the congregations in the coal fields, and they would know we didn&#8217;t belong. [Laughs] We were really from somewhere else.  So anyway it was an ongoing thing.  I don&#8217;t think it was ever resolved.
JW: What would you say were the major successes of the Commission on Religion in Appalachia?
JS: Well, like I said earlier I think just practically and crudely put CORA was able to deliver a lot of material resources to community organizations that were indigenous and were advocacy organizations themselves for coal field justice or for land justice, for labor justice, and they would not have ever gotten those resources otherwise from the churches, because CORA could provide sort of an umbrella of ecumenism that protected various financial officers in the denominations so you didn&#8217;t say--.  It wasn&#8217;t the Presbyterian Church that gave fifteen thousand dollars to the Council of Southern Mountains; it was CORA that did that, right?  And so the Presbyterians loved giving their money to us because we would sort of be an umbrella and protect them from reaction within their denominations.  So I think delivering money, and delivering consultants, and delivering some help, some organizing help, and workshops and trainings and so forth about organizing and on issues, and also I think being able to fund studies, like the land use study or the labor justice study or the labor economic study.  We would recruit writers and researchers and give them funds, and those would become kind of the documents that you could make your case on within the region, so I think CORA did good in doing those sorts of things.  There were elements of CORA that never overcame the kind of noblesse oblige, Lady Bountiful, missionary stance but structurally, institutionally in terms of the way the money flowed and the way the staff worked [Laughs] I think they delivered in lots of really good ways.
JW: Mm hmm.  So why do you say that they couldn&#8217;t overcome some of the mission bound--?  Are there examples you can think of, of how they failed to completely overcome that?
JS: Well some did, some didn&#8217;t, and some people were very happy finding funds to support a crafts co-op, you know, which you can make an argument about how that&#8217;s local economy development for grassroots people and that&#8217;s fine.  So we would do crafts co-ops and housing co-ops and quilt co-ops and food co-ops and a lot of cooperative kind of things that really weren&#8217;t advocacy organizations, but you could understand how this would help a local community get by that was in bad shape and it would be kind of modest, bottom up economic development that was of a scale that they could handle and we could support and had a payoff for them and for local people, but it was not really labor justice or economic justice.  A lot of religious people kind of get drawn into supporting--.
JW: The sort of safe politically stuff.
JS: Yeah, yeah.  They were safe politically, but you could make a case for why they were also important.
JW: Right.  Let&#8217;s see.  So what was--?  I realize you worked in a lot of communities but maybe you can give a general response about this.  What were some of the community responses to CORA bridging religious concerns with economic justice, which some people would say is more political?
JS: Mm hmm.
JW: Was there tension there?
JS: Oh, yeah.  Well a lot of--.  And I&#8217;m also not an expert on mountain religion at all.  I&#8217;ve read some things and I know some people, but I would say a number of independent churches in the region whose members or participants are mountaineers, low income Appalachians, their theology and the doctrines of those churches does not in any way have to do with this world.  It&#8217;s just not there, and so those are really never--.  And we weren&#8217;t going to fight about that.  We weren&#8217;t going to convert them from their fundamental beliefs, so those congregations were always sort of like, fine, that&#8217;s fine, [Laughs] you know?  Members of them who might be coal miners would come out of those congregations and work with us on an issue or something, but not as the church, not as the congregation.  They&#8217;d be individual members that would come out and do that, and within the mainline denominations in the county seat churches you would find here and there people of conscience who would step outside their class and their church and pitch in and help us.  So those did happen but I think that class divide between the mainline denominations and the countryside congregations, we didn&#8217;t solve that at all, and I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s solvable or that it should be, necessarily.  I think it was important for the mainline people of faith to understand the role and responsibility they played in those communities, and we tried to help them do that as gently as we could, but I don&#8217;t know how many conversions took place about that. And we didn&#8217;t want to be parachuting in from some relief airplane, [Laughs] you know, into communities, telling them what they should be doing, even if it was the mainline congregations.  They&#8217;ve got to figure that out for themselves, so we tried to help that but I don&#8217;t know how great we were at it.
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: Some were so much better than others, and I must say Catholic churches in Appalachia, which are not huge in number, those priests and those sisters and those small congregations always understood their own doctrine of economic justice and labor justice.  They understood that about their congregations and they were always pretty much there on the front lines with the Commission on Religion in Appalachia and so forth, so you had to hand it to them.  You could hand it also to grassroots activists who had a religious faith, and although their own pastor would not have blessed them doing these things stepped out and did them anyway, and that happened a lot.
JW: Mm hmm.  So I&#8217;m wondering how--.  You&#8217;ve talked some about the religious and class tensions that existed.  I wonder also about how much CORA addressed issues of race or gender and how you dealt with those issues with different populations.
JS: Yeah.  Well, never successfully. [Laughs] And this was some time ago.  This was, what, 1980, &#8217;80 to &#8217;92?
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: That&#8217;s when I was there, I think, those twelve years.  The women&#8217;s movement, and in some cases the civil rights movement, had come to Appalachia late, you know?  There were leadership roles that were stuck and there were small--and Appalachia being overwhelmingly white, not as white as we all think it is because there are significant communities, historic, long lived communities of African Americans in the region who worked in the mines and in textiles.  But CORA was an overwhelmingly white organization and male-led, and I think we changed it some during that time and we integrated some and we recruited some African American denominations into CORA that had not been there before, and we recruited African American leadership out of denominations.  Out of white denominations we would try to find folks, and did that some so that some of our officers eventually were African Americans and the leadership of CORA, its chairpersonship, was for at least half the time that I was there led by women. And some of the strongest staff people, certainly, were women as well.  Then when I left to go to Highlander, I was succeeded by a really strong woman, Tena Willemsma.  So I would say we were faced with that a lot and I think probably--.  And partly we were all--.  We had to take the representatives from each denomination that they decided on.  We didn&#8217;t get to select who made up the Commission.  The Methodists decided their delegation, the Disciples, the Catholics, so they sent those representatives.  We had three members and three alternates from eighteen, nineteen, twenty different denominations that made up the Commission.  We didn&#8217;t choose them, so we had to go to these denominations and say, this is what we&#8217;ve got to have.  You cannot keep giving us these three white guys every time, as nice as they are.  You&#8217;ve got to give us a more diverse representation.  You&#8217;re the only ones that can do it.  We had some at large members that we could recruit and so in the at large category we always pulled into CORA stronger participation from women and from blacks.  But, sexism and racism was never solved either, but I think we made some serious efforts at it.
JW: Mm hmm.  I&#8217;m going to go back to a more general question.  I&#8217;m interested in why, or if you have an opinion about why social justice activism seemed to flourish in southern Appalachia in the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s?  You&#8217;ve said the civil rights movement, that all came a little bit later to Appalachia, and Helen Lewis had said things were hot in Appalachia in the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s, and I wonder what your opinion is on why things seemed to come together at that time?
JS: Well I don&#8217;t--.  We kind of arrived in the midst of it, so I&#8217;m not so sure of all the origins of it, but I would say the War on Poverty in Appalachia brought a lot of people, volunteers and low paid folks, into the region who possibly, like ourselves, came with good intentions but didn&#8217;t understand boo about what they were getting into and kind of got converted by the region and by the people into being activists themselves. So there were a lot of folks who became active in the region that way.  There was also a thing called Appalachian Volunteers, AVs, and I can name two hands full of people who&#8217;ve been activists and have continued to be activists in the region for thirty years who came here as AVs, and when their internship was over, or when their volunteer time was over, stayed.  I think that&#8217;s what was so interesting.  So many War on Poverty--.  The warriors on poverty and the Appalachian volunteers came in and by and large many, many of them stayed, and so they remained kind of mixing the pot, you know, that way.  Also I think in addition the student movement growing out of the civil rights and especially anti-war stuff, and people began to leave--.  There was a sort of back to the land movement that took place.  I don&#8217;t know what that really meant, but I think a lot of young people came back to the region; had left here, gone to school and came back, so it was a youth movement within the region that was activist oriented and had all these experiences in San Francisco or Boston or Chicago or Cincinnati or somewhere else and brought those experiences back into the region, and that fed that a little bit, I think.
JW: So you think--?
JS: And there was some money, from the feds, from the churches, and so forth, that helped stimulate stuff to happen.
JW: Mm hmm.  It seems like an interesting idea, instead of thinking of movements necessarily as just happening in certain places, like the civil rights movement being stronger in the deeper South, but then following the people who were involved in that movement and where they go and how they--
JS: Right.
JW: --impact different regions.
JS: Right, right, yeah.
JW: So how salient do you think the women&#8217;s movement, or women&#8217;s rights, was in the organizations you were involved in?
JS: [Laughs] I am not the one to say.
JW: [Laughs] Well, we&#8217;ll get other opinions on it.
JS: Consider the source here because I was never--.  In the roles that I played in various organizations I was not ever very much of a bashful person, and I was wrong lots of times, and I have a tendency to defend the organization I&#8217;m working for [Laughs] when it shouldn&#8217;t be defended.  How salient?
JW: Yeah, like how much did--?  Because the women&#8217;s movement really picks up steam nationally but sometimes we think of that as only happening in big cities or the Northeast and the West Coast, but was it here, even in different--
JS: Yeah.
JW: --forms than in those places?
JS: Well, I think certainly in different forms, and I think in a way Appalachia had women&#8217;s leadership within it and being active women leaders apart from the women&#8217;s movement.  A number of the congregations would have women pastors.  Now there were other kinds of congregations in Appalachia that would never allow a woman to be in a leadership role, by doctrinal fiat, but there were congregations and denominations for whom women were the leaders of those churches, the preachers, so that was already indigenous in the region, that kind of women&#8217;s leadership.  Then a number of the organizations, especially in crafts cooperatives and food cooperatives and all the kind of service things that were grassroots oriented were often led by very, very strong women, and they did not become strong women because of the women&#8217;s movement.  They were strong women, and they were celebrated.  I think they were often over celebrated sometimes because they would be made a star by people like us and they would sort of lose their credibility with their own base sometimes, because we would say, &#8220;Oh, God, Eula is so great.  She needs to be heard by--.  Take her to New York,&#8221; and so I think we did a disservice to a lot of women&#8217;s leadership in the region by latching on too enthusiastically sometimes.  It changed their lives, sometimes for good, sometimes not so good, and sometimes did not serve the community in helping her strengthen her leadership within the community rather than taking her out of the community.  I think that was always a problem of both secular and religious work in the region.  Then just the patriarchy in the mountains has a long history and is very strong, and I don&#8217;t think we ever converted many mountain men into being feminists, you know, except to the degree that they already were just by the nature of their family and their community and so on.  And just by definition in the coal fields, coal miners were guys and it was only very late in my tenure at CORA that women coal miners got organized and got into the mines, and June Rostan and Madeline Rogero were all leaders in that women coal miner employment--Coal Employment Project, it was called.
JW: Yeah.
JS: Yeah.  But that was pretty late, I think.  Then when layoffs took place they were the first ones fired or laid off, because they were the last hired, and you know, last hired, first fired.  So that was a strong effort and successful to a degree but the coal miners were still guys, which means that the preeminent union in the region was a virtually all male union, and its leadership was all male, so it was hard to get much traction [Laughs] with that, though I think they understood it.
JW: [Pause] Let&#8217;s see.  So I&#8217;m going to skip ahead a little bit.  Since you brought up the layoffs that began occurring, was that--?  What was your reaction, and it may be a continuing reaction, to the deindustrialization and the shifting economy?  How prepared were these organizations for these massive changes that began to take place?
JS: Well, let&#8217;s see.  I think in a way they were always in a sense prepared because Appalachia has been a boom or bust--certainly the coal fields have been a boom or bust--so they&#8217;ve been in these cycles of layoffs, because sometimes the mines just all shut down because of the coal economy.  Then sometimes because of oil prices they&#8217;re all opened up and everybody&#8217;s at work and things are thriving and then something else will happen internationally and [broop], they&#8217;ll all go down again.  So there&#8217;s a sense in which there was some--.  It&#8217;s not unusual to have the bust happen, though to CORA&#8217;s credit I think early on CORA saw what was happening.  In fact we had a coalition at one time called the Great Lakes Appalachian Project.  Have you ever run into that?
JW: No.
JS: Oh, the Ecumenical Great Lakes Appalachian Project, EGLAP, [Laughs] and it was a coalition between industrial activists fighting deindustrialization in the Rust Belt and coal field people, like ourselves, and CORA was a major proponent of this because if these factories shut down in the Rust Belt they don&#8217;t need coal.
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: So there was this real interdependence between the coal fields and the factories, certainly around Pittsburgh and in southwest Pennsylvania, Charleston, West Virginia, but also in Detroit.  So we had for several years this coalition of doing studies and having workshops and having conferences on deindustrialization and helping people understand where is this coming from, why is it happening, how can we get prepared for this, really before the worst of it hit.  But we had a very clear analysis of how the growing Rust Belt was going to affect the economy in Appalachia and we had studies about that, we had workshops, we had conferences about it, and the grassroots people, the mine workers, certainly understood that, the auto workers, the steel workers, all understood that.  So we would take the entire Commission, maybe fifty people, to small towns in southwest Pennsylvania to visit these closed down steel plants that were--.  People would never forget them because they were haunting.  The wind would be blowing, there would not be a sound, and there would be these long, long rows and rows and rows of building totally empty, totally silent, and it was pretty moving and stunning and made a big impression on the religious folks about this used to be a thriving community.  There used to be children playing in these streets.  Used to you couldn&#8217;t hear yourself think because of the noise coming from the factories and the glow from the furnaces, and now, nothing.
So I think we made some very strong efforts to get people to understand that and I think we were preaching to ourselves, and everybody we could get to listen to us, from very early on that the economic makers and shakers don&#8217;t give a damn about whether you have a job or not.  They&#8217;re not interested in making steel; they&#8217;re interested in making money.  They&#8217;re not interested in mining coal; they&#8217;re interested in mining bank vaults.  They&#8217;re not interested in making cars; they&#8217;re interested in making a buck.  They&#8217;ll give this up in a minute, and they&#8217;ll give this region up in a minute.  So I think we had some pretty tough talks about all that.
JW: Mm hmm.  How successful do you think it was?
JS: [Laughs] Well, it all happened. [Laughs]
JW: But what do you think were the major roadblocks?
JS: It&#8217;s a huge economy.  We were so politically pitiful that I just don&#8217;t think we ever organized powerfully enough or were ever in the shape to do anything other than yell and warn people and so forth, but the communities themselves were in weak positions and the economy just rolled us over.
JW: So I&#8217;m wondering what you would say, because you&#8217;ve been involved in so much, starting with civil rights and the student movement, and you&#8217;ve been in so many organizations, but what do you think is a thread that runs through all of those for you?  Or is there one?  How do you see all of that as connecting?
JS: Well, I think the abstract term would be economic justice and the more concrete would be labor and labor justice, working people&#8217;s rights, would be true through all of that.  Yeah.  And I should say just to backtrack a minute, in terms of the boom and bust cycles and so forth and experiencing deindustrialization, to remember that while the guys were in the coal fields, in the mines, there were women and children in the textile and clothing mills, and they closed much earlier and ran away, you know.  So people knew from their own experience what was going on.  They didn&#8217;t need to be preached at.  They knew, and they knew before it really began to happen else--.  Before it started happening in Detroit it had already happened in Elizabethton and Johnson City and Kingsport and places like that.  I can remember going to a union meeting of the clothing and textile workers.  The secretary treasurer of the international met with us in a motel room one time and we were sort of giving him a hard time about why the union wasn&#8217;t standing up more strongly to keep these places open, and he&#8217;d say--.  I can remember it so well.  His name was Jack Shankman.  He was a great guy.  He said, &#8220;Look, look, we&#8217;re the clothing workers union.  We&#8217;re not the autoworkers.  We don&#8217;t have the power of Detroit.  The autoworkers can do what you&#8217;re saying but we&#8217;re just the clothing workers and we&#8217;re not that powerful.  The economy of our industry doesn&#8217;t give us any clout to make the changes that you&#8217;re calling for.&#8221; [Laughs] Well, what happened now to the auto industry, right?  But there was a time when there was this hierarchy of union strength in the region that isn&#8217;t anymore.
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: But, anyway, that was--.  I was going backward there.
JW: Oh, no, it&#8217;s okay.
JS: Oh, the theme.
JW: Yeah.
JS: Well I think for me the theme was economics, economic justice, labor justice, working people&#8217;s rights, yeah, labor rights.
JW: So that was already, even when you were doing civil rights and student movement stuff you already were aware that class needed to be a part of that too?
JS: No.  No, I think for me personally [it] goes back to those anti-war days in Boston and not understanding why working people didn&#8217;t get it that their interest was bound up in this war and this war was not serving them.  Why, why, [Laughs] why is this not true?  It was something I just didn&#8217;t understand, and so we would go back and read about where this was coming from and so forth, and reading political analysis from Marx to numerous other writers during that time helped us to understand that and I think put me at least on the road to trying to understand structural, institutional, systemic, economic, matters that were more important to work on than episodic issues that come and go, you know?
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: Better to work on something that does have a theme.  There should be a theme to your work, not just responding to every--.  Although my resume may look [like] I just respond to any--there was something going through it, I think, that understood that we&#8217;re not just dealing with single issue politics here or single issue organizing; we&#8217;re dealing with power, economic power, and who&#8217;s got it and who doesn&#8217;t have it, and how do you organize around that.
JW: Mm hmm.  So what--?  I&#8217;m trying to think of the best way to ask this.  What did it feel like--?  You were involved in such major activities and I would imagine it was exciting and stressful, lots of emotions involved, being pretty young to then doing this your whole life.  What did all of that mean for you?  [Laughs] I know that&#8217;s a really vague question, but personally what has it meant to be involved in all of these movements?
JS: It was always a great privilege and a great honor [Laughs] and lucky as hell to be in the right place at the right time often, through no clear strategy or thoughts of my own, and it&#8217;s just been great.  Looking back at the Pittston strike and winning that, and being able just to play a role in that that I never volunteered for but just got swept up in, was terrific, the J.P. Stevens campaign that resulted in lots of contracts for Southern textile workers, which over the long haul they all went away but for the time being--.  All these victories were ephemeral, or time bound, but they were--.  The J. P. Stevens drive was by and large a successful drive, Pittston was, and then we fought at Blue Diamond and Scotia and lots of other mining struggles.  They were tough.  Strip mining changed some, not enough, and then mountain top removal came along and ruined a whole lot of that work, so there have always been ups and downs.  Those experiences for me, being able to roll them into other institutional settings where you could push the envelope further, like with the AFL-CIO, you could go to the AFL-CIO leadership and not pull any punches, just name it.  This is the way it&#8217;s got to be.  You could do that because you had paid the price and would have some credibility so you could kind of roll one thing into another, and bringing those experiences to bear in a new setting was always lots of fun and exciting, and I just [Laughs] [felt] like I was really blessed to get to do those things.
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: But, we&#8217;re part of the long haul, you know, and we&#8217;ve lost a lot, a whole lot, and so it always is sad looking back at it that way, but by some measures if you can look at where you were standing in 1962 as opposed to where you&#8217;re standing in 2009 there are a lot of changes taking place that sometimes when you&#8217;re caught up in the year that you&#8217;re working you don&#8217;t realize how different it is today than it was then.  Or how different it is today, not that racism has at all diminished so much, but structurally having gone to school in legally segregated, I mean segregated by law, schools and gotten that kind of education and to be able to work today. Or are gay and lesbian rights today being fought for openly and successfully and victoriously as opposed to days when I was a member of organizations for whom if a staff person was thought to be gay they would have been gone like that. [Snaps fingers]
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: Within the church.  So some things have happened, I think, which I&#8217;m glad about and lucky to be along.
JW: You mentioned economic justice being a thread.  I also wonder if you think, or how you think, religion also was a thread through your own life and movement activity?
JS: Well, economic justice to me is a part of the gospel, of the tradition that I grew up in, which was kind of liberal Protestantism, so there were lots of--both in terms of race, and I never will forget the picture on my parents&#8217; wall of Jesus sitting on the side of the mountain with all these little children around at his feet and they were all colors, you know.  That doesn&#8217;t look like my Sunday school class. [Laughs] And so that sort of sticks in your craw, and that just comes from little old Bible study things and Sunday school, that you learn these things and you say, gee, but that isn&#8217;t the way it is around here. [Laughs] What&#8217;s wrong here, you know?  So I think lots of people have those kinds of religious things that tug at their hearts from early on.  Then as I studied theology there were wonderful theologians, like Reinhold Niebuhr, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and the social gospel theologians from Boston University, and so forth that I read and was inspired by and helped me think about it harder.  So I think the church has played a role in all of that, and then also before CORA but also within CORA there were national denomination leaders who were very strong about civil rights and women leaders who were very strong about women&#8217;s rights and who were very strong on peace and ending the war in Vietnam or ending the Iraq War, strong religious leaders.  Now, they weren&#8217;t always representative of their own denomination that way, but they provided real leadership so it was always inspiring.  So I think always both theologically and experientially and in terms of leadership religious communities have been really very helpful to me.  I&#8217;m not saying they continue to be very sustaining, as people pass and go away and as churches restructure and pull back from those positions and so forth, partly because of the positions they&#8217;ve taken they&#8217;re smaller and less powerful than they used to be, because they were just not conservative enough to keep a lot of their members.  In that way they&#8217;re less helpful because they&#8217;re less powerful but they&#8217;re less powerful because they helped you, you know, [Laughs] so I mean it&#8217;s sort of [tough there.]  But I would say that&#8217;s been pretty much a consistent thread, not always of a formal nature but certainly informally.
JW: Let&#8217;s see.  I was going to ask you if you are aware, since you have had such a long history here, of which organizations explicitly addressed women&#8217;s rights.  I know CEP is probably the major one but then if there are also other organizations that you can think of in southern Appalachia that less explicitly addressed women&#8217;s rights but it was still a part of the central platform.

JS: Yeah. [Pause] I&#8217;m going to forget names.  There&#8217;s a wonderful women&#8217;s organization, Appalachian Women Empowered, A-W-E, AWE, in southwest Virginia, and a wonderful woman who started that with Terry Vautrin, was one of the founders, and the other person who lasted longer and is still there, I think, used to work with the Episcopalian--APSO, it was called, Appalachian People&#8217;s Service Organization.  Meredith, Meredith--not Meredith Tax, Meredith--.  Her name is Meredith.  You&#8217;ll find it.  But Appalachian Women Empowered in some ways grew out of CORA, and I think the Council of Southern Mountains, back when.
JW: That&#8217;s great, because I actually haven&#8217;t heard of either of those yet.  I haven&#8217;t come across those.  You said Appalachian--?
JS: Women Empowered.
JW: And then the other one, Appalachian People&#8217;s--?
JS: Appalachian People&#8217;s Service Organization.
JW: Okay.
JS: APSO.  That was the Episcopal component of CORA.
JW: Okay.  Lastly, is there anything else that you would like to say or like for us to cover, or are there any questions that I didn&#8217;t ask that you thought I might?
JS: To go back, do you know the name Tena Willemsma?
JW: No.
JS: Okay.  Well under the women&#8217;s, and CORA, T-e-n-a--.
JW: Oh, yeah, June mentioned her yesterday.
JS: Okay, okay.  W-i-l-l-e-m-s-m-a.  [She] would answer that last question probably differently [Laughs]--
JW: Okay.
JS: --and at greater length.  Tena was my predecessor--my successor--
JW: At CORA.
JS: --at CORA, yeah, and is retired now but is still doing a lot of--.  And she was also my labor justice buddy as well.  She directed the Social, Economic, and Political Issues Task Force [Laughs] of CORA, SEPI, it was called.  Some people thought SEPI took over CORA.
JW: Mm hmm. [Laughs] Okay, any other--?
JS: So, what did I leave out?  Well, lots. [Pause] That&#8217;s [a lot.]  That&#8217;s [a lot.]
JW: I might come back to you for a follow-up.
JS: Yeah, yeah.  I think, you know, that a lot of the seeds that CORA helped plant, along with the help of lots of other people, are seeds that still grow throughout the region, but they&#8217;re not very dramatic and they&#8217;re not very well known.  The structural things that were CORA are basically gone now, partly because the national denominations have pulled back because of their own loss of membership and loss of funds, and so the focus that was on Appalachia when I was at CORA is not there anymore.  But I don&#8217;t think that means all was lost.  I think what was planted was planted and it still grows out there and has made some changes.  But we were up against--.  We were a poor region in a rich economy that made its living off the backs of coal miners and textile workers, and ripping up the land, and cutting down all the trees in North Carolina, and digging up all the land in the western side of the valley, and damming up all the rivers, [Laughs] I mean really screwed over royally by powerful forces that remain powerful today, and we were never ever able to defeat that power, so it was always sort of a valiant battle that had some victories but overall we&#8217;re still part of the capital economy in this country and none of us have been victorious about that.  [1:16:18]
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: Except to elect a new president who to this day is not doing so well by us, so we need to--.  I hope that we have some organized forces in the region that are calling--.  And that does happen, and I think those are some of the old communications links that date way back that when it&#8217;s leaked out of Washington that Obama&#8217;s getting ready to name a Mine Safety and Health director that would be terrible [Snaps fingers] the e-mail network just flashes anger into Washington and Obama withdraws the nomination.  Or he&#8217;s going to name somebody to the Bureau of Land Management that oversees the strip mining laws and so forth.  He&#8217;s going to name a bad person to that one. [Snaps fingers] People pop to and start right in.  But I don&#8217;t think he gets it so it&#8217;s going to be up to a lot of us to see that he gets it.
JW: Mm hmm.
JS: [Laughs]
JW: That&#8217;s all. [Laughs] That&#8217;s all we have to do. [Laughs]
JS: [Laughs] That&#8217;s all.  But we can get his attention.  He&#8217;s a different president, I think.
JW: Right.
JS: I think we can get his attention.
JW: Okay, anything else that we should cover?
JS: No, that&#8217;s too much.
