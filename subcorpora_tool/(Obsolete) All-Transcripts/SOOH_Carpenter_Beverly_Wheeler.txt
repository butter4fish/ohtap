 Finchum  Carpenter  Today is June 13, 2009. My name is Tanya Finchum and I   m here with  Beverly Wheeler Carpenter. We   re in Stillwater, Oklahoma and we   re  doing an oral history for the project that the OSU Library is conducting  featuring the 1930s. Thank you for coming today.  Thank you.  Let   s start by having you talk a little bit about your childhood, where  you were born, your parents and we   ll move forward.  Alright. I was born in Ponca City, Oklahoma at the Ponca City Hospital  on September 24, 1931. The Depression had gotten a good start then.  My parents had lost a child early in their marriage and Mother couldn   t  conceive anymore. Medical practices weren   t too good. It happened very  quickly and perhaps it couldn   t be helped. Anyway they couldn   t have  any children and they liked children very much. Through the years they  both had good jobs. Daddy came to Ponca City in 1915 to be  Superintendent of Lake Park Refinery which later became E.W.  Marland   s Marland Oil and then later Conoco. Mother was raised in  Keokuk Falls, Indian Territory after they left Queen City, Texas where  she was born. Her parents had a rooming house, or as she said it was a  hotel. There was a railroad stop at Keokuk Falls. Her father had a saloon  and a country store, and he outfitted people that were coming into Indian  Territory. He dealt in hides and furs and anything that came along.  Mother   s mother, Ida Harwell Smith was a staunch Carrie Nation type of  person. She did not believe in liquor, dancing or anything. I   ve got a  picture of her and she is just scrooched up something terrible. I don   t  have a picture of Mother   s father anymore, I did have. He was kind of a  happy-go-lucky looking guy. I don   t know how they got married  5  because they certainly weren   t alike, but they stayed married until their  dying day. That   s how everybody got to Ponca City.  Daddy had left home as a young man. He had gotten through the eighth  grade which was wonderful in those days. Like Mom, he was in the  Texas area, close to the border, and he went over in Arkansas after he  got out of the eighth grade to work for a fellow who was going to teach  him how to do telegraphy for the railroad which he learned and he did  that too. Meanwhile he got a job to make his board and room with the  undertaker in this little town. His best friend was a little black man about  his age. Their job was to go pick up the dead people, so they did, in  between painting things white. Everything wanted to be white then.  So one evening they were going out way in the country to pick up a man  and it had gotten real dark and stormy on the way back, as they went  over a wooden bridge the casket came open and the man sat up   he was  dead but he went up. Scared Daddy and this little black guy to death.  They jumped out of the wagon and ran all the way home and the buggy  followed them which terrified them even more because here was this  wagon with a dead man in it following them into town. They ran on  through to their boarding house and the buggy stopped in front of the  furniture store which was also the funeral parlor. Daddy decided that  was definitely not the work he wanted to do. So he really took up house  painting and still did telegraphy work and that   s what he did as a young  man. He was always proud of the fact that Mother had graduated from  high school and went to Ada to be a teacher, after two years of college.  He was very proud of that fact that his wife was educated. They met in  Ada when Daddy was being a telegrapher for the railroad. I don   t think  they have that railroad anymore. It was the Southern Pacific or some  old-fashioned name. I think Daddy enjoyed doing that.  When he was courting Mother they would take the little carts that you  use to see them taking up and down to check the rails. They would take  that and have a picnic. They would have to lift it off when the trains  were coming by. That   s how they did their courting. Her father objected  strenuously because they were alone. They married, I think it was in  about 1911 or so. Mother graduated from high school in 1908. There  were eight girls in her class and they called themselves    The Naughty  Eight.    (Laughter) One of her boyfriends was in the class or two ahead  of her. I think he was named Marcum. He later became a general during  the wars and in-between. My dad used to kid and say,    Look if you  would have married Marcum you would have been the general   s wife.     And she always said,    I don   t care, I   d rather be your wife.    So they  were very happy together. They got along very well.  When I came along in 1931, their marriage was very solid. There just  6  wasn   t any fussing or anything like that. They both knew what they were  going to do and that   s what they did. They didn   t have any children and  they were used to helping out people. Another thing they did when they  first came to town they opened a little grocery store on Grand Avenue in  Ponca. I know the spot where it was. A lot of fellows were overseas in  the war and they left their wives at home, of course, with their children.  People ran a tab in those days when you paid at the end of the month or  whenever you could, I guess. Daddy and Mother could just not collect  from those women that didn   t have money and had children. I don't  think they even tried. In fact, Mother said they gave more groceries  away than they sold. So that little business folded. Mother went back  home to be a housewife for a number of years.  A job opened up at the Continental to be the assistant manager of the  Continental cafeteria which was earth shattering to have a cafeteria for  your workers. Mr. Marland was very ahead of his time and was  criticized strongly back east for this, because he not only provided  housing in many cases, he had insurance, if you had a new baby and you  worked for Continental, it was paid for he was very good to his workers  and as I say that was frowned upon back east and other places because it  set a terrible precedent, you see. You might have to do that. People came  from miles around to look at this miracle. He had established a cafeteria  for his workers because the Continental building was out of town and  most people walked even though he made gas and oil. So it was easier  and you had better workers if you fed them well.  That was Mother   s job and the manager was going to have a baby. So  mother   there was no danger with mother   so she got the job and she  adored it. She worked for 43 years. She loved every minute of it. She  traveled with the Continental to shows in Chicago and big cities and  attended the restaurant association and she was highly thought of in the  business because she did run a very good operation and she learned that  at home because her sister who was slightly deaf, her older sister, was  the bookkeeper. Mother was the one that helped order food and saw to  the preparation and things like that. Her younger sister played the piano  for the people that came to eat. She was only very little. She was too  little to work. So mother had a good background in a basic economy and  knew how to be practical. She had a wonderful flare for cooking. She  could taste something and tell you what was in it. I   ve never been able to  do that. And she could also make people mind by raising one of her  gorgeous eyebrows and giving you    Mrs. Wheeler   s Look    you just  straightened up. The crankiest of women would just straighten up.  Mother had a cafeteria full of women. She generally hired little widowed  women or women whose husbands had run off somehow or another and  left them with families and every one of them that Mother hired seemed  7  to be wonderful cooks. Her pastry cook was outstanding and her meat  chef was a colored man, a black man named O.T.    Oklahoma Territory     McKinney   and his wife   s name was Arizona as she was born in the  year Arizona became a state. I simply adored O.T. He had a gravelly  voice like Rochester on the Jack Benny Show and he loved children and  he thought I looked like Shirley Temple. What   s not to love? Of course,  I really didn   t. I just happened to be a little white girl  (Laughter) I just  adored O.T. He wore the white cooking outfit and the big cooking hat.  He presided over the breakfast waffles which were famous.  O.T. had a big family. He was very proud of his family and I would  occasionally get to visit with his children and I thought it was super fun.  They just were so different and I was an only child and I loved to play.  Then there was the day that Duncan Hines came to Ponca, especially to  visit Mother and he stayed several days to see the cafeteria operation and  Mother was highly flattered with that. I remember that too and I am just  almost positive I saw him but for the life of me I can   t remember too  much about it. My parents were in the practice of helping people and as I  say they had good jobs. They could manage to do that. They especially  liked to help women with children.  When they first came to town they lived in Mrs. Hill   s Boarding House  that was down on Second or Third, rather close to the refineries, the City  Service, Continental and Marland. They lived there about a year until  they bought a house. While they were there they made good friends with  Mrs. Hill and she would tell them about people that needed help. One  day she called and said,    Anna Lee, I   ve got a young woman that   s 24  years old and her name is Ruth. Her family has thrown her out. She   s  from over in the oil patch,      by that I mean Shidler and Wizbang those  places were out in Osage County. It was solid derricks out there. I mean  solid. Like a forest. She had become pregnant and I figured it out  between Christmas and New Year   s. I imagine it was a one or two time  deal and he was a married man and her family just wouldn   t have her.  They threw her out. She had enough money to get to Ponca and to get to  Mrs. Hill   s. I think she perhaps had known Mrs. Hill some way or  another, knew she would help her out. She worked there as a house maid  and helped with the kitchen and things because she could work there and  hide from the public.  Mrs. Hill also sent her to Dr. C.D. Northcutt who was my folk   s doctor.  He and Mrs. Hill were the go-betweens for Mother and Dad to help Ruth  and pay for her doctor   s visits   even though I don   t think the doctor  charged much, if anything   and paid for the birth. Well before I was  born, Dr. Northcutt called and said,    Anna Lee and Jess, would you be  able to come up to the office at a certain time?    Daddy said,    Yes, sure.     They went not really knowing why and he said,    Well Ruth knows that  8  she cannot keep this child and keep it in good health and take care of it  because she can   t hardly take care of herself.    Remember 1931, things  were terrible. And she was ostracized, you know.  So Mother and Daddy said,    What do you mean?       She wants to adopt  her child out. And she wants to talk to you about it.    And also, in the  other room was a lady and a man and I have always understood she was  one of the health nurses for Ponca City. She was kind of a cranky  woman and so Ruth talked to both sets and the lady that was the nurse  said,    Oh, I just couldn   t possibly adopt a child if it   s not a girl. I   m not  having a boy around the house.    Her husband was extremely brow  beaten. Everyone always said that. Well Mother and Dad were  speechless when she brought that question to them. They said,    We   re  going on 46 or so and 36 or 38      whatever Mom was, and that was  considered kind of old. In fact, people said that to them. Isn   t that awful?  Dr. Northcutt said,    Ruth has decided after visiting with you that you are  the ones that she would like to have raise her child. Do you have any  objections whether it   s a girl or a boy?    and my folks said,    Oh, no. We  would be overjoyed to have a baby. Are you sure you want to let us have  your baby?    They just couldn   t get over it. And she said,    Yes, I   m  positive.    And that   s the way it stood.  So when it was time for Ruth to deliver, Dr. Northcutt   s nurse put in a  call to the Continental where Mother was in the cafeteria and out Mother  went like a flash and she took her best friend which was her assistant  manager (I used to call her Aunt Lucy Bowles) with her and a laundry  basket. I think they thought they were going to bring me home that day.  Daddy had moved over to Continental to be the superintendent, the     night sup.    His best friend got burned up in a tragic fire and Daddy  quit. He said he couldn   t stand anymore accidents or things like that and  he went to ranching and farming full time. By that time my parents lived  out on the Osage on a small dairy farm and Daddy was happy as a clam.  He had turkeys in pens and pigs and horses and we also had a ranch in  Kaw Lake now. He had lots and lots of cattle. He started with white face  and built up a huge herd of 300 or 400 every year or so, so he was very  happy.  Mom couldn   t get a hold of Daddy. He was obviously out at the ranch.  She left a message. He got there just after the fact and well it was  hysterics time I guess because by that time everybody knew that Mr. and  Mrs. Wheeler   s baby was on the way. And sure enough, there I was.  They named me Beverly Anne Wheeler. They named me their self.  Daddy loved the name Beverly and he constantly teased Mother while  they were waiting for me, if I was a girl he was going to name me Sally.  His first girlfriend over in, I think it was Mountain Home, Arkansas was  named Sally and Mother said,    No, Jess, that baby is not going to be  9  named Sally.    He was a big tease. I don   t think he really would have  done that, although I like the name Sally. Anyway that   s how I got there  and how I got to be a Wheeler. I knew from the time I knew anything  that I was an adopted child. I loved every minute of it. I told people I  was adopted which would sometimes bring the conversation to a cold  stop because you know that was kind of a hush-hush thing. But I was so  proud of that.  I did have some fears when I was older, from about nine until I was  about twelve, that somebody would come and get me and take me away  and oh I did not want to go. I was very happy where I was. Mother  would assure me that nobody was coming to take me away, that they had  papers that proved, by law, that I was theirs. That made me very, very  happy and I just quit worrying about it. Most of my life as a young  woman and as a young child I felt like I had to be a very good girl and  smile at people so they would also adopt a little girl or boy because I  knew about orphans homes and I hated for anyone to have to be there. I  had a wonderful happy childhood with so many wonderful gifts. My  parents were very loving, very understanding and all of Mother   s family  died rather young. I didn   t get to know any of them. But her sisters and  my cousins were 20 years older than me at least. They accepted me with  open arms. There was never one word of criticism. I was just made over  and looked at and petted and my hair was curly and it would be curled  and I was just kind of showed off, as you would say, and carried around  for people to see. I was a miracle child, people thought.  Everyone in Holdenville, Oklahoma and Hughes County where Aunt  Maddie (mother   s older sister) and her husband lived   they went down  there often to visit. Their parents were buried there and had lived there  in their older years. So everybody in town knew Mother and Aunt Kat  and the Stanford   s which was my Aunt Maddie   s married name and I  was taken down to the Stanford Drug Store and sat on their fountain for  people to admire or laid on the fountain. I heard this from many old  ladies in Holdenville because I was Anna Lee and Jess    little baby girl. I  just grew up loved. I knew there was a Depression as I got older because  I had little friends in Sunday school that sometimes their clothes were a  little ragged and torn. But I didn   t pay much attention to it for some  reason. We never said much about it. But the minute I outgrew  something, Mother and another very good friend of hers, Mertie Chance,  would take those clothes and Daddy   s shirts   Daddy said he could lay  down a pair of undershorts or a shirt and Anna Lee and Mertie would  have made it into little clothes for a kid and that   s the truth. You better  be careful or your favorite dress was swoosh, out the door being made  into something. Mert did the sewing machine and Mother did the hems  and sewed the lace on and they made some awful pretty little clothes for  boys and girls.  10  I knew that children needed clothes and things and needed food and I  knew that we gave away a lot of food out of Daddy   s garden. We had a  hired man and his wife that lived with us in the Osage and he milked the  cows and fed the turkeys and all that. Daddy, unfortunately, had asthma,  and I realize now, emphysema and everything he loved he shouldn   t  have been around, but he stuck with it and he died at age 64 of very bad  heart trouble. Mother lived to be 75 and she retired from Continental  when she was 62. She was going to die of boredom but it only took her  about three weeks to find out, no, she wasn   t bored at all. She was very  happy. I knew about the Depression. It was in the newspapers and I  learned to read at four. I don   t know how I did that. So people thought I  was really smart. No, I really wasn   t. I just learned to read when I was  four. As an only child living way out in the country, I think you have to  learn to read. I had story books and toys, but there wasn   t always  someone there to read them to me. I just did it. I just learned to do it  myself. I did go to kindergarten. It was right across the street from the  Continental, so Mother could leave me off and pick me up and get to me  if she had to. She knew exactly where I was.  When I went to school I went to Mrs. Bartum   s Private School, because,  again, she could leave me early if she had to and she could pick me up  late if she didn   t get off at 3:30. She could pick me up at 5:30, it was  okay. That was one of the reasons I went to St. Mary   s during the war  years. Everybody at our farm, every hired man, everybody went to war.  And my nanny and everyone that lived with us went to the Continental  to do war work. There just wasn   t anybody there. I had to do something  and I went with Daddy one summer back and forth to the farms and to  the ranch and oh that was very tiresome and it really wasn   t a good deal  because the men that were left were pretty rough and tough. Oh and  there was a lot of cussing going on and one thing or another and I had a  wonderful vocabulary of cuss words. I really did, not knowing that you  really shouldn   t say those. I soon found out about that.  I found myself enrolled in St. Mary   s for the seventh grade. Mrs. Bartum  closed her little private school and they retired. They got old enough to  retire, she and her husband, so I went to St. Mary   s and I just loved it.  Oh, there were so many children of all ages and I loved the sisters, they  were so much fun. My teacher was an Irish lady, sister Mary Vatallis.  We knew she had red hair because she had red eyelashes and red  eyebrows. She would hold up those long black skirts and dance the jig  for us and oh we just adored her. But she always danced that jig when  there wasn   t any other sisters around and we just loved her. I had her  seventh and eighth grade. Then later I had the woman that was the  principal of the school. I was sure she weighed 94 pounds and I was  scared to death of her. I can   t think of her name but it was a real long,  kind of Latin sounding name and she taught, of all things, algebra. Every  11  time I went in that classroom I burst into tears. I know that woman  thought I had a problem. The problem was that I was just terrified of her.  I flunked algebra twice. I never did get it. I never got it at senior high. I  didn   t really get it in college. I got into Stephen   s College. Maybe they  didn   t make me take algebra, I don   t know, but she just terrified me.  And she was a nice person, she just looked so stern. She wasn   t Sister  Mary Vatallis, I   ll tell you that  (Laughs)  My best friend, when we moved to town from the farm, lived up the  street and we talked about how tough things were. She was well aware  of it and I was and some of the little friends we played with knew about  the Depression. It had gotten a teeny bit better because in Ponca, many  men had the opportunity to work for the oil companies or to drill oil  wells which was a hard job in those days. You got killed and lost your  arms and legs there were job opportunities here that were not other  places. And because of the oil business, that made other jobs and that  was the first time I realized that other mothers went to work besides  mine because mother   s cafeteria was full of these ladies who I always  referred to as ladies. Some people would say,    Oh your mother   s help     and I would correct them, even as a small child. They were ladies. I  always referred to them as that. And I still feel that way.  They were lucky to have jobs and they knew that and after Mother died  and many years until the last one died, a few years ago, occasionally  they   d call me or I   d call them to see how they were doing and they  would say,    You know, we wouldn   t have a nice retirement like this    or     We wouldn   t have our house paid for    or so on and so forth or    Sent  our children to college if it hadn   t been for your mother.    They felt like  she was solely responsible. Well she was, in the hiring. She had the last  word over that. That was one of her must haves. She would have been  considered a department head but a woman was not a department head  in those days. The man that was her boss in later years was Mr. Lewis  Trapnell and he thought he knew everything about cooking and so forth  and he didn   t. He   d bring Mother these impossible recipes that were too  time consuming or were just not going to go over with the general  public. She   d come home and she   d have to lay down after having a talk  with Lewis Trapnell. Mother was 5   2       and believe me, she was full of  energy and could get things done.  Her hair turned white prematurely when she was very young. She and  Daddy hadn   t been married but a year or two. She had rheumatoid  arthritis and her wonderful strawberry blonde curls turned white. She  didn   t know that she was so ill. When she sat up the first time and saw  herself, she screamed and pointed and said,    Who is that old lady in my  room?     She was with her sister to take care of her in Holdenville and  her sister said,    Anna Lee, I   m so sorry to tell you that   s you. Your  12  hair.    Mother never dyed it, she kept it white. It was outstanding. I think  it gave her quite a presence. It was just beautiful, white like a cloud and  curly. I adored it. I do not have that hair. I always wanted that hair.  Daddy was black headed and combed straight back and he was very tan  from being in the sun, his arms, his neck and his face. He had that black,  black hair he combed straight back. One day a lady approached Mom at  the cafeteria,    Oh Mrs. Wheeler, I saw your husband downtown before I  got here. I didn   t know you were married to an Indian.    Sometimes that  was a pretty good thing to say, but from this woman, no, it wasn   t.  Mother knew exactly what she meant. She meant a slur. Mother said,     You know, that   s funny, I didn   t know it either.    That shut her up and  she never said anything again.  When I got in high school I loved to walk down to the drug store and I  stole one of Daddy   s white shirts one time because I had a pair of jeans  which was very unusual. I had those jeans to go fishing in and I wasn   t  supposed to really wear them someplace. We weren   t into that then, you  know. Well I put on this white shirt, rolled up those sleeves and my  gosh, I thought I was the   I don   t know what I thought I was. I was not  a zoot suiter, I don't know what I was. And who should come around the  corner as I almost got to the drugstore, but my dad in his pickup. He  pulled over to the curb and said,    Come here.    Daddy was never cross  with me, never. I thought, oh my gosh, didn   t I leave a note on the  kitchen table or what? I had to get in.    I don   t ever want to see you in  one of my shirts again looking like that.    Oh, he was furious. So I never  did. I never did that again. I wore my jeans occasionally to picnics and  so forth come to find out I had on one of his very, very best shirts,  wouldn   t you know? I didn   t have sense to get a bad one. But that was  about the only time he fussed at me.  Mother had a little trick. She   d make you go out and break your own  switch. Now that   s a tough one. Of course you cried all the way out the  door getting your stick and really boohooed when you got your switch  because if you got a little bitty one you just had to go back and get  another one. By that time you   d punished yourself sufficiently and you  never got switched. She had the switch in her hand. But by that time you  threw yourself on your mother   s lap and cried boo hoo hoo hoo hoo,     I   ll never do it again     whatever it was. And that   s how I learned. I  guess I was a pretty good kid. My cousin said I was. I was always  beautifully dressed as far as I can remember. Some of those clothes I  didn   t like too well, some of them were Shirley Temple originals. They  were kind of itchy. I still have this little dress, it must have been awfully  expensive in those days. It was white with little red flowers and little red  trim that was hooked together by something called insertion and I had a  real ruffly skirt. Itched like crazy  The seams weren   t finished. It was  starched and ironed for Sunday school. When you got home you were  13  just raw if you didn   t have a little slip on under it. That was Mother   s  favorite dress on me, and I loved that dress, but oh it was miserable. Just  miserable.  I learned to eat what was on my plate because of the little starving  children in China. Everybody did that and you took your pennies to  Sunday school and on your birthday, put in double the amount. If I was  five I got to put in ten pennies. Finally I graduated up to a dime. Now  that was a big deal, when I got to put my dime in. Our Sunday school  classes were separate. We had little girls and little boys, clear into high  school. So I wouldn   t know much about boys. They were a real foreign  commodity to me and didn   t seem to bother me. Every Christmas when  you made your Christmas list   and I learned to write early too. I think  Mother had something to do with that. My list would consist of,    I want  Mommy and Daddy to go to Ponca City Hospital and get me a baby.    I  figured if they got one, they could get two. And they would nicely  explain to me that they were pretty hard to come by and you couldn   t  just go get one because you wanted it. And my answer was,    Can't you  just ask Dr. Northcutt? He   s got everything up there at his office. He  could just go get one.    One time he explained it to me. I must have been  very upset about it because I went into his office all by myself and he  played like he was examining me, my throat or something and he said,     You know, sometimes you just can   t have everything you want.    He  had adopted two children   two boys who were friends of mine,  especially the younger one, Jimmy. He was a plump little boy and I just  loved Jimmy. He said,    The reason we happened to have Jimmy and      I  don   t remember the other   s name      was because they were brothers and  they came together.    Well I could understand that. And I said,    But isn   t  there some at the hospital, a baby somewhere?    and he said,    Well, I   ve  given them all away. I don   t have any this year.    And you know,  somehow I believed him. I figured he was the final word. Santa Claus  didn   t have one thing to do with that. You obviously got them out of the  hospital and I was satisfied with that and I told the folks I was and I quit  asking.  So you get a notion of how I was raised, but the thing that bothered me  the most, I   d go with Mom and Dad in the car, especially Daddy, he  would go out to White Eagle to pick up some Indian men to work for  him on the ranch because everybody hail and hardy was gone to the war.  There were some guys that would still work and ride horses and they  loved to ride horses and herd the cattle and all that. Besides they got a  darn good feeding and they   d camp out there in tents at the ranch while  they were having the round up. It was a big deal and they had campfires  and they really loved it. They loved to come work for Daddy because it  was so much fun. And when it was it over, he would give them a steer to  take home. They   d have another big powwow. In fact they had a  14  powwow and we were invited a few times. By the way, I love  powwows. Would see people walking up and down the road carrying  little bundles with children and pushing little wagons and I don   t know  what all, but they were just beat to death. Daddy would get them back in  the pickup and take them as far as he could, whichever way we were  going. I would ask a lot of questions about that. Sometimes we would  pick up pregnant women, I realize now, they sat in the front with us if  possible. They were so skinny and poorly that we could get two of them  in there with Daddy and I in those small pickups and it was just sad.  Same thing with Mother, we   d be driving around somewhere and here   d  be these, oh just pitiful  folks . They were so tired. Daddy would say,     These are good people. It   s just they have been turned out of their  farms and they can   t make it.     If you went over past Ponca, just a little ways past Pond Creek, there  you really ran into it because they had the Dust Bowl over there. We  didn   t have dust here in Ponca like that. Our fields were plowed and  planted. But over there, I   m telling you that sand would take the paint  off the front of your car and did off of Mom   s car. She had a blue car  and she had to have it repainted in the front when we got in the  sandstorm, it was just shiny metal under there. It was frightening. There  were people on those roads. It was terrible. And I asked many questions  about that. I loved John Steinbeck   s books but people got the wrong  idea, those people weren   t Okies. The Okies actually stayed here. They  were the ones that toughed it out. And as my husband said who lived in  California for a number of years,    California wouldn   t be the state it is  without the Okies. They went out and found heaven. They started  Knott   s Berry Farm and many orchards.    Things would grow there and  they had water. They didn   t have dust and they could farm and plant and  develop.  We had the people that stayed and they are to be praised because it sure  was tough and I saw some of those houses as a child. The sand had  drifted in and out of them and people were still trying to live in it and  Mother was handing out clothes and food and she and her friend Mrs.  Bowles would make trips over there as soon as they could gather up  enough stuff: canned goods, home canned goods, just whatever. It was  tragic. Usually I was supposed to stay in the car and the reason why was  because the contrast from me to those poor little children would have  embarrassed those families. That   s how Mother explained it and I could  see that. It would have hurt their feelings and there was no point in it.  Some of the kids would come up and look at me in the car window but  they knew I couldn   t get out. They said,    You don   t want to get dirty.     I   m telling you, even now it   s heartbreaking because poor little things,  they were dirty. It was all dirt. And Mother and Aunt Lucy would buy  cases of soap, mostly Lifebuoy and Palmolive and Lava. I can remember  15  how that Lava smelled. It would get grease and everything off of you.  They didn   t want to be dirty, they just couldn   t help it. And shampoo  was a big deal   Packers pine tar shampoo, something like that. It killed  chiggers, mosquitoes, and you could wash your hair in it and wash your  dog in it. You could kill fleas and everything these people were just  destitute. Women would cry over a bar of soap because they weren   t  used to being dirty. And I   ve seen them do that and it was just mind  boggling for a child. You learn to appreciate what you have. I think  that   s why I didn   t want somebody to come and get me. I sure didn   t. I  knew that it could happen. Or I thought I knew that.  I never found out who my father was   that was not available and that   s  okay. I don   t need to know. I never was particularly curious about my  mother. I had a mother, I had a father. I was so happy with them. I  remember once when I was about three and a half or so, a lady came to  our door, knocked I thought she was real pretty. She had blondish hair,  marcelled with waves. I thought she looked like Alice Faye. I used to go  to the movies with my nanny and Alice Faye was a big favorite because  she could sing and dance and look pretty and I liked Alice Faye. I  thought this lady looked like Alice Faye. She was dressed rather nicely, I  thought. It was fall and she had a little cape or jacket on with a little fur  collar. Boy, that got my attention. I thought, gee she is pretty nice. I  remember hanging onto Mom   s leg which is something I didn   t do too  much. Mother had a limp and I usually just held her hand because you  didn   t want to jerk her over I learned to hold hands and not just cling to  Mother because I was too big for her to walk around and carry me, you  know, she couldn   t do that. She was a small little woman.  This lady came in and sat down and I was playing and she and Mother  were talking and I didn   t pay one bit of attention to what they were  saying, which was not like me because usually when company came I  was big ears because it was an occasion. When they stood up to go  Mother went to the door with Ruth and I was hanging on Mommy   s leg  and she said,    Ruth, this will have to be the last time because the baby is  getting too big.    I knew who they were talking about because that was  me. Daddy called me    the baby    up till I begged him to quit  (Laughter)  And now I wish I could hear that again. But she said,    That   s fine. I just  wanted to come one more time.    She said,    I   m getting married and I   m  moving to California.    And something to the effect of    I knew I did the  right thing.     After she left, probably a few hours later I decided I didn   t know who  that lady was. I asked Mother,    Who was that lady? Is that Uncle  Orville   s new wife?    Daddy had a brother that was kind of frisky and I  loved his first wife Ruby. She stayed with us and took care of me when I  was just a new born while he was off drilling oil wells in Cuba or some  16  darn place. He went weird places. Mother said,    No, that   s not Uncle  Orville   s new wife.    And I said,    Who is it?    I had an uncle Jeff, I said,     Is it Uncle Jeff   s wife?    because I knew her. She said,    No.    I said,     Who is that mother?    She said, somehow she put it, not birth mother  because that term wasn   t in use. She said,    That   s the lady that had you.     Well I knew enough to know that women had babies, I didn   t know how,  what, why or where or anything except the Ponca City Hospital. That  soaked in pretty good and I didn   t ask any more questions. It was just  fine.  When I got in high school I asked Mother about it because people would  ask me,    Do you know your mother?    I said,    No, I know my real  mother. My real mother is Annie Lee Wheeler. That is my real mother.  And my real daddy.    Usually people weren   t rude, they didn   t go on.  You had to fill out papers in high school for records that are going to  follow you for the rest of your life and it would say the name of your  parents. I ran across one that said something about being adopted and I   d  never seen one like that before. It must have been something about going  to college because I believe I was a senior. I didn't fill it out and I asked  Mom,    Well what am I supposed to do with that?    She said,    Well just  put down that you were adopted at birth and that   s it. You don   t have to  worry about it anymore.    I said,    Good. I don   t want to have to worry  about it.     My first husband   s father just couldn   t stand it and so he just kept on and  kept on until one day my first husband and I drove over to Pawhuska  because Mother and Dad lived in Osage County where my official  adoption went through and we talked to a judge. Even though I was  pregnant with my second child, he would not release those papers to me  (laughs) and I really didn   t care. I don   t think Frank Hicks cared either     that was my first husband   s name. His father was terribly disappointed  because he thought that since I had family in Holdenville that I was the  child of a man in Ponca City named Pat Murphy who had the Buick  garage who was a big friend of his, but no, I wasn   t. I played with his  little girl. He finally couldn   t stand it and he said something to me about  it and I said,    No, I played with that little girl in Holdenville. I   m not  her. I   m me. I   m me and you   re going to have to quit worrying about it.     By that time I had two children. I said,    I have two healthy children. I  obviously don   t have any bad genes, and so I   m not going to worry  about it.    So he quit, but he was very disappointed because he thought  he   d found out something I didn   t know. That   s why you ought to tell  your children that you   re adopted. You don   t want any ugly surprises  later.  I had a friend in high school that got a very severe jolt. She found her  birth mother. She didn   t know her. She didn   t have anything in common  17  with her. She had six other children and she just didn   t fall all over Anne  and become what Anne wanted her to and Anne was so disappointed. I  said,    That   s why I never look. I mean I don   t want to know. I don   t  want to know now.    If anybody wanted me, they knew where I was  before and after the Depression, World War II or whatever. I   ve been  right here and I would have been so easy to find and I figure she did me  a big favor and she was happy with what she did and so I   m happy. I just  bless her heart for picking out wonderful people, because she could have  easily had me aborted, you know, or given me to just anybody, which  they used to do in those days, and it could have been bad. It could have  been really bad. I feel like I   m very lucky, especially to be born in the  Depression because as my husband told me coming down here, he said,     You know, that was very unusual for people to go out of their way to  adopt a child in the middle of the Depression.    He said,    Actually they  were farming them out.    He knew people that would send their children  to Missouri or anywhere to relatives to make it through. I said,    Well, I  know I   m lucky.     But another thing that used to happen, one lady that lived in Ponca and I  call her a lady, I guess she was. She had worked for Mother a little bit at  banquets at Continental. They had big, big, big banquets at night and she  hired temporary help to wait on the tables and help with the prep and  clean up and so on. Mother had about 23 women working for her in  regular times, but you couldn   t keep your staff day and night so they   d  have some temporary people. This gal obviously had worked for Mom.  But one time Mother was supposed to work at the Kay County Fair in  the democratic booth. It was awfully hot and she just didn   t feel like it.  She really didn   t. She had already retired and she was just awfully tired.  She said,    I just can   t go over there. I   ll babysit with the children if you  want to go over there and do that because you   ve never done anything  like that.    I just jumped at the chance and I thought,    That   ll be fun. Go  to the fair in the daytime and see people.    So here I am just doing my  democratic thing, whatever it was those other ladies told me to do and I  could run and get them drinks and Coke because I was the youngest one  there and I was having a good time.  Here comes this gal up there and for some reason I was standing outside  of the booth. I was probably handing out buttons or pencils or rulers or  something and she comes up to me and just steps back and just gives me  a look from my head to my toes, slow like   kind of insulting. And I  thought,    Gee, am I wrong? Have I done something wrong? To be a  democratic lady handing out stuff?    I don   t know. And she got up closer  to me, just in my face. She said,    I wonder why your mother adopted  you.    I said,    What?    and the other ladies in the booth knew Mom and  one of them came over and took me by the arm and squeezed it and I  said,    Mother didn   t adopt me.    I said,    My mother and father adopted  18  me. Mr. and Mrs. Jess V. Wheeler.    She said,    I knew that.    She said,    I  don   t see why they adopted you.    And this other lady just led me off. I  was so shocked. I just couldn   t think of anything to say. It still strikes  me as the most rude thing I ever heard. That other lady told me that  woman   s name so when I got home, I told Mom what happened she said,     I   ll tell you about her. She worked for me a little bit. But she was so  unhappy. She made the other ladies unhappy. She wasn   t particularly a  good worker. We don   t have time to fool around when we   re trying to  serve 300 people a banquet.  I think her child either passed away or she couldn   t have a child, I don   t  know which.    Mother said,    She   s just full of sour grapes because she  didn   t have enough sense to get one like we did, to go see if she could  find a baby. She   s just jealous.    And here I was a grown up woman with  two kids, but you know I think that was right because I had that woman  do that to me three times. One time on the street downtown, and I fell for  it the second time and I was mad at myself   the same thing, looked me  up and down like I was a bug or something and that time I didn   t say  anything. I just walked by and I felt bad about it because I was rude. But  she was very rude, right in the middle of a crowded street downtown in  Ponca City she starts with this. The last time she did it my husband and I  had started a gift shop which I simply adored. I had gifts and furniture  and everything you don   t need and some you do, I loved it. I was pretty  good at selling. I didn   t know I could ever do that, I was pretty good at  it. She came in my store and by that time she was quite an old lady and  the same darn thing, she did that. By that time I had forgotten her name.  I said,    Look, my mother and father have passed away. They obviously  adopted me because they had the opportunity and they wanted to adopt a  child. That   s just exactly how that went.    And she said,    Well I just  could never understand it.    And she turned on her heel and out she went.  I thought, if she ever shows up at a door where I am, I   m never going to  let her in again. I was so peeved at that woman and a few years later, she  passed away. Then I heard from another person in town that knew  vaguely that she was just always very unhappy her whole life long. She  had a little cloud over her head and obviously she liked to spread that  doom and gloom around. But that   s the only really bad experience that I  had with being adopted.  I used to wonder when I was having children and I did ask Dr.  Northcutt. He was going to attend my children   s birth, but he had heart  trouble so Dr. Glasscock had to do it, I like Dr. Glasscock too. I said,    Is  there any kind of a record of any diseases or anything I need to look out  for with my children?    Dr. Northcutt said,    None that I know of.    He  said,    As far as I know, Ruth came from a healthy family and she was a  healthy woman and you seem to always have been very, very healthy.     And I have, praise God. As I got older, I quit worrying about it because I  19  told my kids when I got to be 50,    Well okay, I made it to 50, folks. It   s  okay, we don   t have to worry about anything     (Laughter) Then when I  got to be 65, I said,    Okay, we don   t have to worry about Alzheimer   s  because I   m maybe over the hoop for that.    I told my daughter the other  day who will be 60 at Christmas, I said,    Well it looks like I   m maybe  going to make it to 80. So you all really don   t have much to worry  about.    And they never worried. It was me that worried, but you know I  think people are doing a good thing when they take some kind of  medical history because there might be something that people need to  know about. I   ve just been blessed by being healthy and thank goodness.  I was raised nicely. I had a wonderful family.  I   ve always felt like I was kind of on the outside, in a way, looking in  because I didn   t have any siblings. So I observed other people   s home  life with children. I was just fascinated with it because there was just me.  I wasn   t really lonely or lonesome. I always could read and believe me  I   ve got a book with me in the car. If I   ve got a book some place I   m just  fine. I   m just happy as a clam with a book and I learned to entertain  myself and that   s a good trick to learn because I know there   s lots of  people that can   t do that and they   re just running around at loose ends. I  was always interested in how my little friends lived in their house. And I  learned at an early age that you don   t go to somebody   s house and eat  things because their food was proportioned out for their family and I  learned that very quickly. I think I was about five when I learned that. A  lady that worked for Mother had two daughters and they were old  enough to babysit me and this was very rare   extremely rare. I don   t  remember it happening but twice. I was going to stay with them until  Mother got off work which was about 10:30 and then their mother  would come  home also . I had already eaten, but that was a pretty long  stretch in there and Mother had fixed some food from Continental. By  the way, the ladies there could buy anything that was left over for the  cost of the food. They were not allowed to take it home free and  everybody was happy to pay for it and if they felt like they couldn   t pay  for it when they first went to work, Mother paid for it. Maybe they knew  it, maybe they didn   t. Some of those women had three or four children  that were hungry and you know, they take out of their pay even then,  and you didn   t get to take home a full paycheck for a couple of months.  That was another one of those things Mom did that people didn   t know  too much about.  Mother had brought food for us. We were going to have a little inside  picnic. It seems like we had fried chicken and peach pie or something  like that, something wonderful. Well we got hungry about 9:30, we ate  everything up in sight. We got a piece of white bread for each one of us  and Oleo. I   d never seen Oleo in my life and they mixed it up with a  color packet. It came white and looked like lard. Stirred that up and I got  20  to help stir and listen, that was real fun. Spread that literally all over that  bread, kind of thick, and sprinkled it with white sugar   best thing I ever  ate. I was sleepy when we got home or was asleep, I don   t remember  ever going home. So the next few days I wanted white bread with Oleo  on it and the gal that lived with us, my nanny, she cleaned house. She  was there and she said,    Oh, my word. Why do you want to eat that? It   s  terrible.    She said,    I   ll make you some bread and butter.    I said,    No, I  would really like to have some Oleo.    She said,    Well honey, people  don   t really eat that when they have butter.    See I didn   t know that. But  oh, I thought that was such a treat  Well, of course Mother heard about  that. I asked her for some. She said,    I don   t have any. We   ve got  butter.    And I said,    Oh. I thought that was so good.    And she said,     That   s just because of that sugar on top.    I said,    Maybe.    So she made  me a piece of toast and put butter on it and sprinkled it with sugar and  cinnamon. That was real good. That was okay. I had that for breakfast a  lot after that. But you see, I just learned little things I didn   t know I  learned from just looking. I learned not to ask too many questions, like     Where is your daddy?    Don   t do that. Or    Why don   t you have another  doll?    No. Or    Why is the wheel off your wagon?    or anything like that.  You just went along with whatever is going on.  I tried to learn to play baseball. I was scared to death of that ball. I could  throw it but couldn   t catch it. I   d run out of the way every time. And tag,  all the kid games that you didn   t need anything to play. Jacks, I was  never good at marbles. I just never liked marbles. One thing, you played  it on dirt and I didn   t like to run my hands over that dirt. So I learned a  lot and didn   t know I learned it, both from the people that were really  suffering from the Depression and also another view with Mother and  Dad and Mother   s family who were fairly well off in those days. And  my uncle   s drugstore, they gave away an awful lot of medicine out the  back door. Many hundreds of dollars worth of medicine went out the  back door. People were ill and they would go see Mr. Carl. They  couldn   t even afford a doctor. He doctored them   especially the black  population in Holdenville. They would come and tell me about it after I  grew up. If it hadn   t have been for Mr. Carl, their baby would have died.  He would see to it that a doctor went out to their house. They were  benevolent people and I learned a lot of things. I learned not to make  people feel bad about something if I could possibly help it. I think that   s  a good thing too. I can   t say I ever went hungry, because as you can see  I   m quite plump. I use that word sparingly, but I consider myself as  fluffy, that's what I am. I   m fluffy. I heard that joke years ago. But I   ve  always had plenty to eat. Maybe I really didn   t like to eat it, like brussels  sprouts and my folks were fond of oysters. I   ve never been able to make  them. I don   t like them fried and I sure don   t like them raw, but I could  appreciate the fact that there were people who did not have goods and I  remember Mom handing it out.  21  Finchum  Carpenter  One big favorite was sandwiches. Sometimes down at the Continental  they would put their money together and they   d cook chicken and broil  eggs and make egg sandwiches and hard boiled eggs and oh gosh,  people would just crowd the car to get those. And I just remember  feeling so sorry about that. These little kids walking on the highway.  You know, bad. Wish I could think of my birth mother   s last name. That  doesn   t mean much to me in a way. I was happy to find out that she was  24. That made me feel a little better because I think if she   d had been a  real young 14 or 15 year old girl, I   d wonder about the terrible shock of  this and the fear and the loneliness and how awful it would have been.  At 24 it would have been bad enough, especially if your family tossed  you out, but you know people used to do that. And they still do it today.  I know. It   s sad.  It is. It   s very sad. Because most of the time you don   t do that exactly on  purpose. I mean, you don   t think you   re maybe going to get pregnant.  We did have a bunch of kids in Ponca, about six of them. They decided  to all get pregnant at the same time and have babies. They thought it  would be fun. They went to the St. Johns Baptist Church down in our  Dixie Hill area and the First Baptist Church took over those girls and  they had to teach them how to take care of babies and everything. And  that so reminded me of the things I saw in the Depression because I saw  some awfully young pregnant women. I realized as I got older and  pregnant myself, they were very young. They were so skinny and so  thin. Their little tummies   it was just very obvious. I used to wonder  about what happened to those people so often. My dad would just give  me a blanket answer,    Oh they all went to Arkansas or somewhere to be  with their folks.    He didn   t really want to tell me that he didn   t know  either. Many a time he   d pick some dollar bills out of his pocket and  give everybody a dollar and I know he didn   t have too many dollars to  give around. But he would and sometimes if he   d been in town to buy  his  special  groceries which consisted bologna, limburger cheese, and  they cut cheese in big round pieces in those days and you just got that  hunk. It had a red rind on it, rat cheese he called it. I don   t know what  kind it was, it was delicious. If he   d been down to a friend of his that had  a store and he   d get assortments of some bolognas and it was in hunks  and he   d give it all away before we got home because he   d picked up  some people for a ride. He   d give everybody a package and he didn   t  have any when we got home and he   d say,    Well I guess I   ll just go  tomorrow.     He loved sardines and he   d give away cans of sardines and occasionally  he bought, I think on purpose, canned milk. We didn   t need any milk.  We had cows. We had a dairy. He   d keep that canned milk in the car. He  told me it was to feed the baby calves. He had it to give to people that  22  had babies who were starving because I remember him giving out those  cans of milk to little kids. Sometimes soda pop. He liked to buy mixed  Nehi soda pop by the case. Oh golly, and those cases would disappear.  We wouldn   t get home with them. The reason he didn   t bring a lot of  people home at times to sleep, he was scared to death of fire in the barns  because they were full of hay and cows in the winter and Mother and  Dad had a terrible house fire when I was about three months old out at  their farm in the Osage. Of course, the fire trucks couldn   t get there in  time, it just burned to the ground. The only thing they were interested in  was where was I? The hired man and his wife and Aunt Ruby had me  outside. I was born in September. This was late November, it was rather  cold and they got me in my baby buggy and threw everything in there  they could think of and they got me out. But everything was gone.  Mother and Daddy had a pet parrot for years, long before I came along,  and Polly flew up in the tree. She was so frightened she wouldn   t come  down. They finally got her, but she caught pneumonia and passed away.  I have pictures of Polly. She sat on the end of my baby buggy and would  bounce up and down   you know those parrots are pretty big and she   d  say,    Jess. Come here. That baby   s crying.    And my Mother said,    I  don   t know who she was acting like because that wasn   t me talking.    Or  she   d whistle and call the dogs. And our poor doggies were just worn  out, Mother said. They couldn   t tell Polly from Daddy. That was quite a  thing when they had that fire. So forever after they were just terrified of  fire. When Daddy was a station agent in Indian Territory, he was here  before statehood. He was a very young station agent and I   m sure he was  the assistant for some of those years. They stored liquor by the barrels  and it was shipped for medicinal purposes, ho ho ho. The Indians would  come and build a fire at the doors of the depot where it was stored so  they could roll these barrels out. Which they did many, many times.  Mother and Dad, when they were first married, lived above the stations.  That was your quarters up there so you could hear the telegraph and run  down and you call the doctor, you call whatever. All emergencies went  through the telegraph and you sent messages to your family that way  because people didn   t have telephones really. And usually the station  had the first telephone in the town, too. That was another thing. You had  to be on call for that. I know of at least three or maybe more places  where Mom and Dad lived while he was a telegrapher that got burned  down and they lost all their possessions. So Mother said,    I just got to  where things weren   t really as important as people.    She didn   t have any  wedding pictures left except her sisters did. Luckily I got some of  Mother when she was really young and some of Daddy because the  relatives had them, otherwise they would have all been burned up.  I said,    Well Mom, what did you do?    She said,    Well, you put on your  23  wrapper.    They used to have something called the Wrapper.     Nightgowns were long and you held them up around your knees and  ran down the stairs so nothing would catch you on fire and you ran off  while everybody was frantically pumping.    Because you see they had  water tanks at the railroads and they could pump water to try and put the  fire out. That water was actually for the steam engines. When that was  over you were all sooty and dirty and you didn   t have any clothes or any  place to go and you went to the local rooming house and made do until  you got something going for you, which was pretty quick because as I  say the telegraph was extremely important, especially here in Indian  Territory. It was real exciting when they have a telephone and that was  Mother   s job. She could get her housework done in a flash. She didn   t  have too much to do and get food ready she could come down and be  with Daddy and she knew how to do that telegraphy business a little bit.  But her business would see about the phone when things got busy. She  would wait for people   s relatives to call to tell them that their Uncle  Elphy died or somebody had a baby or whatever was important, if they  didn   t send it on the telegraph. Lots of times you got the telegraph and  the phone call in those long ago days. They had a rather interesting early  married life. I think it was exciting.  I used to ask about the Indians. I said,    You mean to tell me they would  just       She said,    Yes, they would have war paint on and they were  having a real powwow down there burning the big doors that shut and  were bolted from the inside. Really it might have been easier for Jess to  just go down there and roll a barrel out, but it was against the law to give  an Indian whiskey.    So what were you to do? The railroad would not  look on you favorably if you were trying to do that. You might have  saved the building and I could never quite figure out what would be the  difference  (Laughs) It   d be cheaper for them to save their building, but  that wasn   t the way the deal worked, I guess. Mother said,    Well, that  was pretty interesting, you look out your window and there was a bunch  of Indians and they   re rallying, carrying on and you don   t know whether  you know those guys or not. Maybe they were ones you knew and ones  you didn   t know.    She said,    It was kind of scary.    (Laughs) And I used  to wish I would have been there. What fun I would have thought, when I  was a kid.  Things got better and the war ended. As I said, we lived in town and  Daddy still had the ranch and I remember things getting better. People  would move to a better house. Somebody   s child would make it down to  Stillwater to go to college or to OU. Some of them actually had  scholarships, their older children. The boys started coming home from  war and going to college. The pay got better and slowly all the empty  buildings in downtown Ponca filled up and you could go to town and  there were lots of people on the sidewalk. That was the highpoint of my  24  Finchum  Carpenter  Finchum  Carpenter  Finchum  Carpenter  Saturdays. Hurry up and get my work done; Saturday morning I was the  dustee. I was the duster. And oh my, I could dust fast. Then I got my  allowance which used to be a quarter, but by the time I got in high  school I had a dollar and a half. Listen, I was filthy rich.  For a week or a month or what?  A week. I had to do some chores for that, it wasn   t just handed  over to  me . Sometimes I didn   t get it, but usually around the middle of the  week when I looked pitiful, sometimes money would fall out of Daddy   s  pockets and we had a rule. If you were running the sweeper and you  found any money, it was yours.  Wow.  Who else was going to lose ten, fifteen cents or twice fifty cents? I knew  where it came from. That was between Daddy and I, that was our little  thing. Oh gosh, going to town on Saturday afternoon was wonderful.  There were a lot of people there. My friends were downtown with their  families and some of us would go to movies. We knew things were  getting better. By the time I got in high school things were very good, I  thought.  That would have been?  1948 when I went to senior high. They were good at St. Mary   s too. We  had some families there with big families and you could kind of tell. The  girls weren   t wearing so many hand-me-downs and the boys had new  suits of their own. You know, we could tell it was looking up. A lot of  those kids, their dads were in the service though all through the war and  their moms had to make due on nothing. I mean, literally I don   t know  how they did it. I really don   t, when I look back and hear what those  men were paid. It was really as bad as the Depression in many ways.  The food was scarce. Many types of food were scarce. If you had a  candy bar, my gosh. A Hershey bar, oh. It was a thing of beauty. And  you would carefully take it out of the wrapper so you could show the  wrapper off. There was a way to get them out with the tin foil left in  there somehow, so it looked like it was full. I never could manage it, but  my best friend   s brother could do it. Of course, I had to share my candy  bar with him, but we would save those candy bar wrappers because you  couldn   t get any. We never had much during the Depression. I don   t  remember a lot of candy. I didn   t have a lot of candy and other people  sure as heck didn   t. So you know, we were starving for candy and sweet  stuff. We were all hungry for sweets. The Depression kids enjoyed it  when we could get candy again. My generation were quite thecandy  eaters.  25  I went to my 60th anniversary last October from high school and that was  such a thrill because every time anybody came through the door, we   d  jump up and say,    Hooray  You made it. You   re alive     (Laughter) It  was fun and we reminisced from A to Z. Lots of the kids had known  each other from birth. I had several friends that I was in the Cradle Roll  at the Methodist church with. And as I always say, we shared beds.  There were three of us and I know all three of us shared the same bed,  because the lady that was in charge of that told me that one time, we  were all three in the same bed and that has always struck me as funny.  One of those girls is still alive; Joanne is still alive, but Barbara passed  away a number of years ago. We always make a joke about that. But you  know what, they didn   t put the boy babies and the girl babies in the same  bed  (Laughter) Which I find really funny, we were babies for heaven   s  sake  (Laughs) We were so little. We could barely walk and it must have  been a long time for church or something because we would lay down  and take a little nap and then our folks would pick us up. But church  wasn   t out until 12:00 in those days, sometimes not until 12:30. We   d  have a graham cracker and we would have a little glass of milk and we  sat on little painted green chairs. I can remember it well. There were all  these little kids in there, these little toddlers. Then we   d lay down and  take a nap. I don   t know when we heard about the Bible, maybe we  didn   t. Our first song was    Jesus Loves Me.    We all knew that one  because once in awhile we got to march upstairs and sing that for the  congregation. Mother and Dad tried to sit in the aisle so I could see  them.  Daddy had asthma and as I said and he didn   t go to church much  because he would get to coughing and it just embarrassed him to death  and the preacher didn   t have any microphone or anything and he just felt  like it bothered everybody and I   m sure it did. On special occasions,  he   d go. He wore his cowboy boots and his good black suit with red pin  stripes   little tiny red and gray pinstripes. He must have had a dozen of  those suits. They were his favorite. He had them made. He was a pretty  snappy dresser and he had small feet for a man. He wore a size eight and  he was proud of those little feet. He had handmade boots, they were  really pretty. His favorite ones were black with red sewing. I loved them.  He always wore one cuff in  which  meant your cows were paid for. He  was very proud his cows were paid for. Mom and Dad had a joke  about   she   d go with him on Sundays. Oh, Sundays were another thing.  That   s when we   d see a lot of these people walking the roads, oh my.  They   d go out to look at the cows and Mother would give Dad  50  dollars and she would buy some calves. I don   t know how she knew  which ones were hers. Then they would have a big wrangle and tease  each other until it was time to sell over whose calves got biggest,  although they ate the same thing. I got a calf. I never knew mine from  Adam. All those little calves looked alike to me. I don   t think they  26  wanted me to know which one was mine because I wouldn   t have  wanted it to  be sold . Somehow I didn   t equate these cattle with eating  cattle. I didn   t do that. I don   t know why, but I didn   t. And so  occasionally my calf would make money.  They bought what they called baby bonds or war bonds and one year,  my calf was bigger than anybody   s. I don   t know whether it really was  or not, but they told me it was. So I got to go in the bank and buy my  own bond. I was about ten. I met the bank president. He sold it to me I  thought, I don   t know whether he did or not, but I thought so. (Laughs) I  was really proud of that bond. I wrote my name up in the corner so I   d  know that one. Of course, I don't know where they kept them, but that  was thrilling. And I had a little savings account. Seems like I got a little  bitty allowance when I was little, probably 15 cents. As I got older, the  pennies went in the box at church and the other pennies I put in my little  bank account book. It was leather. Oh I loved it. They would dutifully  write in those little pennies and add it for me and hand it to me. Imagine  having the patience to do that for a child. I wasn   t the only one. There  were lots of little kids in the bank on Saturdays that put their pennies in.  Some of them didn   t have but one penny but it went in there. Or they  would empty their penny bank which I occasionally did and then I   d  have 15 or 20 cents to put in. You know, you learned those little lessons  as you went along; you weren   t too aware of it.  It was kind of thrilling to go to the grown up places. Children didn   t run  in and out of stores.  There was  no Wal-Mart type of store to run  around in. Oh my word, that wouldn   t have been the thing to do. Oh no.  Your parents would have been embarrassed if you ran amuck in a store  like that, really and truly. You were supposed to stay with your parent or  with whoever you were with. I would go occasionally with our hired  girl. We had a hired girl that came occasionally during canning season.  That   s when you didn   t go in the kitchen. Children were all kept away. It  was like a boiler in there. It was hot. There was Aunt Ruby that lived  with us and various related ladies like Clara and Ruby and one lady I  didn   t like, she was older. She pulled my hair terribly when she braided  my hair. I never did tell on her, but Mother saw her one day and she just  packed her up and took her to town. That was it. I had long brown hair  and I can still feel it. She would just yank the heck out of me. She was  really vicious. She was too old for that job in the first place. She  couldn   t go anywhere with me. She couldn   t take a walk with me or  anything, you know. I don   t know why Mom even hired her.  Usually we had a young girl that should have been in high school or out  of high school and needed a job bad and was too young to be left on her  own. Usually Mother and Dad knew the parents of these girls and they  went home every other weekend because I remember taking some of  27  them home and then we had Clara, who I adored. Her husband ran off  and left her. She had a little boy and her mother and her unmarried sister  raised her little boy and she came over to Ponca where she could make  more money than she could in Skeedy, over by Tulsa. Clara   s mother  handmade quilts for Mother. Handmade and they were beautiful. They  all got stolen. That   s the first time I saw Mother really cry was when her  quilts were stolen. The second time was when my father passed away.  Mother cried, of course, but she didn   t particularly do it in front of you,  boo hoo, a big scene. You knew she cried because you could see some  tears, but she had pretty good control. She wasn   t stiff or anything like  that. She just was rather reserved, in a way.  One of the most interesting things that ever happened to me with Mother  was social security came along I think in 1931 or    32 and for some  reason she had to have more proof that she was she. (Laughs) The  Continental was probably reviving something and wanted more  thorough records, probably the government wanted them. So when I was  about six we went over to see Mr. and Mrs. King. They had a real nice  little farm and a pretty white house with a big pond. They were older  people. They had been friends of Mother   s parents and they remembered  when she was born, Mrs. King did. She filled out the papers with Mr.  King, to prove that Mom was Mom. From Queen City, Texas they had  immigrated up to Oklahoma Territory and lived in Keokuk Falls because  Mom said they used to visit Ada. All day, you   d go in the wagon to visit  and you sometimes spent the night and came back the next day. But  usually just her mother and the girls would go because their dad stayed  there and would see about everything. That was fascinating to me  because I had always wanted to see Mother young. You know, I always  said I wished I could have been a little girl when you were a little girl,  Mother. Or Daddy. I just wanted that so bad.  We had gotten there   this just about kills me   and Mother and Dad  turned into young people. It was so beautiful. They just dropped years,  like you took off your coat and they were young. It was a gift. They   d  laugh and they talked about things I didn   t know anything about, when  Mom was in high school and little stunts they pulled, which didn   t  amount to anything. When Dad came courting. As I say, that was a  blessing because I wanted to know so bad and there I found out. We  went back several times after that. Maybe we   d been there before, it just  didn   t click. That one day, it was a golden day, it seemed like the sun  was golden, the sky was blue, the sunset was pink. It was just perfect in  every way and Mrs. King was a beautiful old lady. She had beautiful  white hair and she wore it up. She was everybody   s ideal grandmother.  You wanted to go and lay your head on her chest and be cuddled. And  she did do that. Mr. King was a very nice older man. He was gray  headed and he would kind of stand back and he and Daddy would watch  28  Finchum  Carpenter  the women. (Laughs) Mrs. King would look me over and say,    My, how  you   ve grown.    Just really make over me. That feels good for a child.  She called Mother    Anna Lee.    I was used to Mother being referred to  as    Mrs. Wheeler,    especially at work, in that capacity. I just loved  when she would call her Anna Lee. That was wonderful.  They would talk about the Depression. Some of the things I didn   t really  understand, Mr. King and Mrs. King had retired long ago, although they  still had this little farm and he had some cattle. He had a horse and he  had a plow. He used it with that horse and he had a big garden and they  got along fine and they made it through the Depression. Mother would  always ask them was there anything they needed or if there was anything  she could do for them. And they   d always say no, they were fine, but she  always took them stuff anyway. Sometimes it would be yard goods  because Mrs. King liked to quilt and make dresses. Sometimes Daddy  would bring a sack of his best feed, alfalfa seed or something that he   d  grown that was pretty nice that he thought Mr. King could try out. That  was the deal, try it out. Some corn   especially corn. I remember,    See,  try it out and let me know what you think of it.    You know, things like  that.  They had a son. He and Mother had been friends and I think they were  kind of sorry that he and Mother didn   t get married. They liked my dad  real well, so that was alright. (Laughs) But that was a golden day to see  my parents young and I just treasure that. Somehow it made it easier  when they passed away. I think of them that way. I learned a lot from  my folks and I thought they did a very good job. I don   t know if I turned  out the best, but they did the best they could in a very natural way  because that   s all anybody could do in those days. They showed me both  sides of things when they could. We had a First Street in Ponca City that  was rowdy. That   s where the prostitutes were. (Laughs)  Really?  Yes. Clear up until the    50s. The high school boys would think it was  hysterically fun to drive down that street real fast. (Laughter) But you  weren   t supposed to go on that street. You were never supposed to walk  on First Street. They were hanging out the windows, standing in the  doorways, you know,    Hi.    And some of them knew my father   s name.  That would gripe my mother to death because she would drive down that  street sometimes to get to the mill where you took your wheat and the  ice plant where Mother had a box   they had an ice locker for beef and  that was pretty advanced to have one of those. But we had all those pigs  and chickens and everything else and they had to put them somewhere  till we could eat them. Oh, Mother would just be mortified   just  mortified. She   d say,    Don   t look. Don   t look.    Of course, I looked. I  29  thought they were beautiful, kind of like Dolly Parton. They had really  pretty summery dresses on. Their fingernails were painted and their hair  was marcelled. They had lots of jewelry from Kress   s, I   m sure. And  some of them had umbrellas. I just thought they were heaven.  There were a lot of beer joints down there and they gambled in there. I  will say this, Daddy liked a beer and he did play cards and poker. Some  of them worked in there as waitresses or hung in there, so of course, they  knew a lot of guy   s names   a lot of business men   s names. Mother  would have preferred they wouldn   t say,    Hey, Jess    with her in the car   We weren   t ever supposed to go down First Street, clear up until I got  out of high school. I   m telling you, it was way in the    50s. Finally the  town decided that was enough of that, and got rid of them.  And we had a pool hall. That was another big deal. Oh, they smell  terrible. They had big fans that blew that smell out, that wet sawdust,  beer, smoke smell. You knew when you went by the pool hall. It was  kind of cool, but ugh, we used to hold our nose. There was a picture  show down here and you kind of had to walk down this way to get to the  picture show. (Laughs) It was terrible  And finally, they got them off of  Grand Avenue, but there was one left across the railroad track. It was  there till about ten years ago. By that time they had air conditioning,  kept the door shut and they just sold beer. Every once in awhile they had  a pretty good fight in there. One time somebody rode into a pool hall  up  town  on horses in Ponca City. They had those swinging doors, just like  Gun Smoke. They looked like those Gun Smoke doors, actually. And  there were always a lot of real poor people camped around the outside  hoping somebody would flip them some coins. Depression, again.  Somebody had to tell me why those guys were sitting there. Daddy said  that they   re hoping somebody wins and they flip them a dime, which he  did occasionally. We had Indians that sat and I guess they just came to  watch us, literally, we were so peculiar. I guess white people would have  been peculiar to them and maybe they thought somebody would get  them a beer. But no, no, no you didn   t do that because it was still illegal.  We had no black people uptown in those days. Occasionally O.T., the  chef for Mother, would take Mother   s car and he would pick me up  sometimes around 10:30 and take me down to Continental and I   d eat  lunch. Some of the women that cooked ate early lunch before they  served on the line because Mother said it wasn   t fair to ask people to  serve food when you   re standing there hungry. So they ate first and I  would eat with them. Then I could go down to Continental Gym and  roller-skate until it was time to open the swimming pool which was my  big, big deal. Meanwhile the food would digest. That was on Saturdays  and they stayed there until around 3:30 because they had served lunch  and most of the workers went home, I think, around 1:30. They worked  30  Finchum  Carpenter  Saturday mornings, but they did have a Saturday lunch and they worked  breakfast every day, every day except Sunday. And occasionally I got to  go to Saturday breakfast. That was a big deal for me to get to go on  Saturday and then Mom and I would go downtown sometimes   not  every time   afterwards. She   d get her own personal groceries and then,  especially in the winter when it was cold, we   d go shopping. Woo, that  was fun. I really liked that. Mother liked to read and we   d go to the  library. Oh, listen, that was it. I fell in love with that library the minute I  got in there. The way it smelled, everything was wonderful.  It was a Carnegie ,wasn   t it?  Yes, it was. Ponca was so proud to have that. It   s a beautiful library to  this day. It has a beautiful collection of paintings. We   ve got Birger  Sandzen and  Nicholai  Fechin and I don't know what all. Oh, the  paintings are divine. It   s worth a trip to see them. They had few  children   s books in those days and I   d get some of those. I thought that  was really thrilling. I didn   t have a library card. You just got them with  your parents. I was thrilled to death with my books. You usually got just  two. They didn   t have enough to go around, you know. But oh, I loved  them. When I got older, Mother would call the library and they would  have some books together and I would go get them by myself with her  card. Mother had had rheumatoid arthritis as a young woman after she  and Dad were married and she had a limp and going up those steps was  just murder, especially after she   d been on her feet most of the day, oh I  was happy to be her little errand girl and I loved it. Because oh, I   d get  to have the little bag, my school bag actually, and fill it up with Mom   s  library books.  We both read Gone With The Wind at the same time. She didn   t know  that. She read it at night and I read it in the daytime one summer. Now  that was a lesson. (Laughs) And then of all things, she took me to see  that movie. And you know, it lasted about four hours. So about where  Belle powders her boobs because it   s awful hot, she and Clark Gable had  been out saving somebody, I said,    Mother, why did that woman do  that?    She said,    Well, because she was hot.    She said,    You know, it   s  pretty warm down south.    I had never been there, I didn   t know. She  wasn   t going to tell me that was a woman of ill repute. (Laughs) I just  couldn   t get over that, the battle scenes, the whole thing. Mother was  criticized for that and she said,    I took her to see that because her  grandparents lived that kind of thing.    My Uncle Cicero served through  the Civil War.    My parents knew about that and my grandparents. How  better could I explain it to her?    And she was right. She really was right.  I didn   t hesitate to feel bad about it at all because I read the book.  (Laughs) I was disappointed in the ending because I always thought  someday he   ll come back and they   ll have other children or better yet,  31  Finchum  Carpenter  they   ll adopt some. I was always in hopes that somebody would adopt.  When my daughter was in grade school, I think about sixth grade, Moira  Shearer, the famous ballerina made a movie called The Red Shoes, and  Nancy liked to dance. I took her to see that out of St. Mary   s. They  agreed that I could take her because as I explained, when would she ever  get another chance to see this Hoffman Ballet and hear this kind of  music and see this kind of dancing? Where, when, what? Not that I knew  of, because at that time, we didn   t have much entertainment that came  through Oklahoma City or Tulsa. So the Sisters readily agreed that I  could take her. We both just ate it up. We were both just in love with it.  It was beautiful. So I repaid the favor in a way.  The Wizard of Oz was out about that time too, wasn   t it?  Oh yes, and I got to see The Wizard of Oz in Tulsa with my Aunt  Kathleen and Uncle Neil. It was playing over there and I happened to be  staying over there for two weeks. I think they planned that on purpose.  Oh my, I didn   t know whether to be scared or what. It was fantastic and  when it was black and white and turned to color, uuhh. It was just a  miracle. I was also over there one time when, I don   t know if it was  Huckleberry Fin or something like that was playing. Oh, that made me  cry. Mickey Rooney played in that and I became a lifelong fan right  there. I wanted that little boy to play with. When they got caught in the  cave with Indian Joe, I hid under my uncle   s suit coat and I watched it  through the button hole. I was just terrified. I cried and, oh, I had to sit  on his lap. I was really too big to sit on somebody   s lap maybe, but oh  my goodness. He said,    It   ll be alright. I read the book, it   ll be alright.     He said,    You can   t read the book yet.    He was afraid I   d have another  break down. (Laughs) But I did finally read that book. I read all of Tom  Sawyer   s stories. Oh those were quite the adventuresome days and in  Ponca, you see, we had free movies for kids. So a lot of those  Depression kids saw an awful lot of good movies. Mr. Wentz put them  on in our city auditorium now.  Isadora Duncan played in Ponca City. Can you imagine that? Isadora  Duncan played in Ponca City in the roaring    20s. That just gets me and I  found a playbill of when her husband was with her and I framed it and  gave it to my daughter, the one that liked to go to The Red Shoes. She  taught dancing a little bit, my daughter. She took so many classes she  could teach the babies, the little kids and she enjoyed it. Will Rogers  appeared in Ponca and visited with many people. I didn   t get in on that, I  just missed it. I was born a little too late. I remember hearing people talk  about the famous people that had come here. But of course the only one  that I really saw was Duncan Hines  (Laughs) But that   s okay.  32  Let   s see, O.T. had someone come visit him for his pancake recipes.  And he was really one of the models for the pancake box that used to  have that black chef he and two, three other people, it was kind of a  conglomeration, but I always thought it looked like O.T. more than  anybody. Of course I would, wouldn   t I? (Laughs) I kind of remember  that because they took pictures of O.T. and it embarrassed him so. I  guess black people didn   t like their picture taken. He just wanted to be  sure it was okay. He talked to Mom about it and she told him it was  alright. They paid him a little something extra. He wasn   t too sure, he  thought, well what are these people up to, you know? Very leery, and I  don   t blame him in a way. His children were real nice and one of his  sons grew up to be a lawyer and they all turned out real well. They saw  to it that they were real educated. They had a wonderful school down  there called Attucks. He saw to it that they finished high school and had  some college. And he also said,    I wouldn   t have been able to do that if  it hadn   t been for Continental and Mrs. Wheeler,    because Mother hired  him as a real young man, just newly married. Mother decided that she  needed a chef and O.T. had some experience and she taught him the rest  and he learned it and he was sure good. (Laughs)  They had a going thing about baseball games. They had a baseball team  in Ponca City for the Continental. You didn   t have to work for  Continental to be on the team, but it was mostly that. We had some tense  games. Everybody went to baseball games. Mother and O.T. would bet  on who was going to win and who was going to win the World Series.  They had a running joke about that. Sometimes Mom had to pay O.T.     it was always pennies   and sometimes he would have to pay her. I think  they finally came out even. Then at Christmas they drew names. Mother  always got O.T.   s name and O.T. always got Mother   s name. That was  how they worked that. They had their own little private Christmas party  and O.T.   s wife would come and bring all the little children and oh those  ladies just made over those kids. They were darling and she kept them so  beautifully dressed. They were real pretty. They were just real cute.  They were so nice and I liked one of those daughters about my age. We  just hit it off like nobody   s business and I never realized that she was  black. I don't think she realized I was white. We would start talking right  away. The only sad thing was they did not get to use the pool or the  gymnasium in those days. I asked a lot of questions about that, but that  was the way it was.  I don   t think they had too terribly many black people work there. I know  they had George Vann who I thought was the handsomest man I ever  saw. He looks like Denzel Washington and he was the elevator man and  the shoe shine man. If you worked in the Continental, your shoes were  shined in the office. You looked nice. You did not go to work looking  sloppy and tacky. You held your head up, you were well fed and you did  33  your job during those years. I think it made a happy town. The only  thing is, they didn   t want any competition for the workforce. So now  we   re in a fix and everybody about died when Phillips bought Conoco  out because we were told that Conoco was going to buy Phillips out. We  were kind of misled with that and so 3,000 workers from Ponca City  moved to Houston and Bartlesville. We   re having a real depression in  Ponca right now and we   ve all had to tighten our belts. Because like my  husband, he retired from Continental and has his social security and I get  some, but it   s just not stretching very well. Not at all. We had several  pieces of property we were going to sell about this time in our life, to  make us a little bit more comfortable, but we can   t sell them.  So we are having our own Depression. That   s what we find very ironic.  When I went to my reunion, my 60th high school class, many of them  said,    We were born in a Depression. It looks like we   re going to go out  in one.    We all commiserated and many of us said,    We   ll just have to  do the best we can. There isn   t anything else we can do. Our parents did  it. I guess we can do it.    Because some of those kids were real bad off. I  remember when they were in high school things were just barely  recovering and some of them went into the Service in order to get a  college education. They knew all too well and they turned around and  helped their brothers and sisters get through college. So they know very  well and we know what we   re in for and we just wonder every month  how   s it going to come out. And we have a big feel for that Depression. I  know I do. John especially does because he   s older than I am and he  really remembers it. And I guess we   ll do it. He even seriously thought  that we might have to go bankrupt. He   s never not paid a bill in his life  and never had anything like that even suggested. It might come to that. I  don   t know, I just don   t know. So that   s what swung our thoughts back  to the Depression so much the last year and a half.  Then I worry what will happen to my children who are getting into the  retirement age. My oldest daughter will be 60 and I had her when I was  18 which is utterly ridiculous. But what are you going to do with a kid  that graduated from high school when they were 15? They had to go to a  girl   s school because they were too young to come here to OSU. My dad  said,    No, no, no. There are boys down there     (Laughs)    There are  college boys down there.    Of course, it   s college. But no, no, no he just  couldn   t. I didn   t want to stay at home. What would I do? I would have  probably liked to go to Northeastern State College in Tahlequah, but  there are boys over there, again, you see. So I went to Stephens College  in Columbia, Missouri.  I already had a steady boyfriend, over my father   s dead body. Oh, he  didn   t like this. Mother thought it would be good because he was an only  child, they lived on a farm and a ranch west of town. And I knew about  34  living on a farm and ranch and it looked like it would work out. He was  a college boy. Oh, that   s what my Dad didn   t like. Oh no, he went to  OU. Oh my lord. He was just up to no good. Well yes, he was, not up to  any good at all. So we married and we struggled along for about 15  years, unfortunately Frank developed a terrible drinking habit and he  needed pills. He needed medicine because he was diagnosed once as a  manic-depressive. That   s scary enough. He   d be sober for months and  months at a time and he   d say he   d be going into town to get something  for the tractor or something   anything. He   d come home so inebriated.  He didn   t slobber or all that. He was not a funny drunk. He was mean  with his mouth. Only once or twice did he ever threaten me with  anything, he could just say the most cruel, mean, horrible things and he  never shut up. It went on and on. His father was that way, too. Now you  haven   t lived until you lived way out in the country with two drunks.  They take the car keys and hide them and his mother was stuck out  there, too.  Then when I had children, it was really scary. I tried to explain this to  my mother, how awful the situation was because occasionally I would  call her to come get me and my one child I had at the time and we  separated many times, at least three or four times. He always promised  he   d do better. No, he never did. We had to share everything with his  mother and dad, which was right because it was theirs. I never was told  how much we made. Any paperwork I signed, it was all covered up here.  I was just supposed to sign my name. Now, can you imagine that? I was  smart enough to know that was wrong. I never have known what we  ever made. But I know we made enough money for him to go to town  and buy a brand new car for cash, several times. That   s just the way it  was.  So he decided if he went back to school and got a pharmacy degree we  could move away from the farm and perhaps he wouldn   t be so upset  and want to drink all of the time because he and his dad fought like cats  and dogs. It was just awful. Verbally fight. They were both very wicked  mouths. I agreed to that. I moved to town. My mother had a duplex and I  lived in one side and Mom the other. She gave up her rent out of that      65 a month for me to live there and the kids and they could go to  school just down the street and I could also help Mother who wasn   t real  well. I did the lawn mowing and the laundry and everything I could  think of to help. We   d go along with that and every once in awhile I   d  go to see Frank. I called him one time and told him I wanted to come  down for the weekend and he said,    No, this isn   t a good weekend.     Well I knew it was, they were having a game and he loved to go to the  games and I did too. He said,    No, no. I   m having a lot of tests. I just  can   t. I   ve got to study all weekend.     35  Well deep in my heart, I knew something was wrong. You know, you  just know. And I knew that when he did come home and we were  together, there was something different about him. I think a woman  knows when her husband has been with another woman. There is  something. I didn   t want to admit it because at last we were finally  maybe going to get on our own and get straightened around some way.  So I didn   t go that weekend, but I sincerely wanted to hire a detective. I  wanted to hire a private detective. I could have afforded it. I had money  saved up, I could have done that. It would have only been  30 or  40. It  would have been nothing. But no, I didn   t do it because I thought,    Well,  I   ve got to have more faith than this.    Deep in my heart I knew and he   d  never been unfaithful before   never, ever. Women weren   t attracted to  him. He was too   I realize now, he was a little odd. He was too    artsy,  fartsy    as my daughter said. He imagined that he was going to write the  great American novel. No he wasn   t. He really, really wasn   t. He wanted  to do anything besides be a rancher and a farmer. That   s the truth.  He was very smart. He had a high IQ and that   s sometimes not very  practical.  So I came down in his little apartment and I cooked breakfast and he had  taken some plates and some cooking utensils because he knew how to  cook. There was a big platter in there and I said,    I   ve never seen this  platter, Frank. That looks like an antique. Did the landlady leave that?  I   d like to buy it off of it her if she   d sell it to me.    He said,    Oh no, no,  no, she just loaned it to me.    Well that girl had brought food over   this  young woman. What Frank had forgot was my cousin was in the very  same pharmacy class as he was in, my cousin from Holdenville. He  knew all about this and she was an extremely homely girl, I can   t get  over that. Frank wasn   t doing so well because it had been 15 years since  he   d been in college. He was a little rusty. He wasn   t as smart as he  thought he was and he had forgotten a lot. Well, she was the smartest  girl in the class   very peculiar, but smart   so he kind of took up with  her. Next thing you know they   re sleeping together.  My mother passed away and I called him to come home right now.  Mother was just his champion. If everything went wrong she said,    It   ll  get better.    She tried so hard. He finally made it home and he came  driving up with his dad. I ran out to the car and I said,    Frank, I needed  you so bad to go over to Trout   s with me and help me pick out the coffin  and make these arrangements.    I said,    I had to go ahead and do it  without you. The children are so upset. I   m just at my wit   s end.    They  just acted so strange and they came in the house and several ladies were  there that Mother knew and I knew all my life, some of the Continental  ladies. Right in front of all those people, Frank said,    We   re divorced.    I  could smell the alcohol by then and everybody else could. I said,     What?    I said,    Mother is over there at Trout   s Funeral Home. What  36  are you talking about?    He said,    Well we   re divorced. The last time we  weren   t together, we were divorced.    And I said,    I tell you what,    and I  wasn   t really smart about this, I said,    If you want to be divorced Frank,  we   ll be divorced now. But we   ll never ever go back.    I said,    When I  bury Mother, I will bury you. We will never ever resume. Ever.    And we  didn   t. But that kind of scared him. He was kind of spooked, I guess.  I did get another divorce, because I didn   t want him to have anything of  my Mother   s estate. Luckily she had tried to fix it so he wouldn   t, but in  doing so it made me have to pay a lot. I didn   t have a lot of money. I had   10,000. Two cars all paid for. One was mine, one was Mom   s and this  wonderful duplex which I   m just now selling. It brought in a little  income and we could live there. I was very fortunate. But it was really  hard, that divorce, because I met Frank when I was about six at that little  private school. He was a beautiful little boy. He was so pretty. He  looked like a Maxfield Parrish little boy. He was just gorgeous and he  was so smart. He was real quiet. I liked him being quiet because I didn   t  know what to do with rowdy boys. I wasn   t used to them. He was older  than I was   four years. He favored a girl that went to school there that  was older than me named Anne Harwell. And one day he kissed Anne  Harwell out on the playground and I said to him later, that very day,     Why did you kiss her and you didn   t kiss me?    and he said,    I   ll kiss  you when you grow up.    And that   s just exactly what happened.  A friend of mine had a brother that was a friend of Frank   s. Frank came  home from college and they wanted to double date. So she asked me if I  would double date with him. And I said,    That name sounds familiar.     She said,    He said knew you, that you went to school over there at that  little school.    I said,    I don   t really remember him, but I   ll ask Mother if  I can go on a blind date.    I said,    You know Iris, she doesn   t like that.    I  just barely could date anyway, always with another couple. And so  Mother said,    Well if it   s Iris and Jimmy and you say this kid went to  Mrs. Bartum   s.    And I said,    Yeah, that   s what they said.    She said,     Okay, as long as you   re home by ten.    Well, so I got to go. I don   t  think we even went to the movies. We went to a drugstore and had a  drink   Cokes and whatever, messed around. And sure enough, it turned  out to be Frank Hicks, that little boy that I knew. Well we were so  astounded to see each other. It was amazing. He said,    I never really did  forget you.    And I said,    I always remembered you as the little boy, one  day you just weren   t in school.       What happened to you?    He said,    My  folks moved to Wichita.    I said,    Well I   ll be darned.    He said,    Well  they didn   t stay very long. They came back. By that time I went to junior  high.    See I didn   t go to junior high so I would have missed him  anyway   four years.  He just started writing me letters from school, very flowery letters and  37  all that. I was sort of proud to say that I had a college boyfriend. He  went to OU. Meanwhile, my daddy was frothing at the mouth. Oh he  didn   t like that. And he was right, it wasn   t right. It would have made a  nice little romance, but hm-mm. And I never really did learn to do  anything. I have wept buckets of tears over that, that I did not  accomplish anything because I could have. I could have very happily  gone to any college in the world, literally. I had a fairytale notion about  that, too. I wanted to go to an English girl   s boarding school. (Laughs) I  read way too many books  I didn   t realize that my father was so ill with  heart trouble, he didn   t want me out of his sight. Mother probably would  have got on the ship, and we probably would have sailed over there and  she would have probably put me in one if things would have been  different because she would have thought it meant a grand adventure,  too. It was hard enough to get to Columbia, Missouri. It was hard on  Daddy. And when I came home for Christmas, he was not well at all that  first Christmas.  Frank and I got married on Lincoln   s birthday in February. We got  married up in Columbia by a Presbyterian minister. Mother wrote  approval for me to get a marriage license. I don   t know how she did that  with Daddy. She probably didn   t tell him. I just don   t know. (Laughs)  We went then to Denver, Colorado   Frank was in the Air Force. Instead  of going home, he went to Columbia. We were married and then we  went to Denver. Mother called me in less than three or four weeks and  Daddy was passing away. How did I get to Ponca? We flew  I don   t  even hardly remember that because it was dark and my mind was  somewhere else, but we flew to Wichita. A limousine met us from  Continental. Mr.  Dan  Moran sent his limousine to meet us and bring us  directly to the hospital. Within a few hours my father passed away. I  stayed a couple of weeks here and Frank went home. Mother gave Frank  Daddy   s little Chevy coup. We didn   t have a car, so he drove that on  home. I flew  back to Denver . It was kind of scary flying in those days.  When you got on the plane it was like this, you walk down the aisle and  you sat in your seat and were reclined until the plane got up. So the first  thing I did was throw up   I don   t think it even left the ground. I  wondered why I threw up. I wasn   t used to doing that. Come to find out,  I was pregnant, of course. And that   s how that all went.  But that airplane flight was   I don   t know if I ever made it looking out  the window. Actually to tell the truth I wanted to stay home. I didn   t  want to go back. I honest to goodness didn   t. Married life wasn   t  anything   it just wasn   t. I just knew I was in the wrong place. But  divorce wasn   t particularly common. Maybe if I could have had it  annulled, but I was expecting, so. Everybody in the whole family was  thrilled about that   Mr. and Mrs. Hicks and my mother were tickled to  death and I was just stunned. I spent that whole pregnancy wondering.  38  Finchum  Carpenter  (Laughs) But anyway in my old age I   m going through another  depression. I started in one, I guess I   m going to end up in one. (Laughs)  That   s just the way it goes with life.  I   ve covered my questions and I thank you for your time today. Do you  have anything you would like to add before we close?  No, I hope I have helped a little with the project. Thank you for letting  me share my Depression memories.  -------  -------
