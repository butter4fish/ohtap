Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions that we always ask, and they're--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --lightweight questions and they only deserve a lightweight answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first of these questions is:  Ma'am, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, can't you tell, everything.  I like most foods, and I like to cook.  I like a variety of foods.  Particularly, I think, partial to seafood and desserts, unfortunately.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Probably, blue.  Much of the furniture in this room is blue, and I like, I like color.  I don't like, you know, the darks, particularly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer.  I love summer; I love the beach; I love the ocean; the sunshine; the heat, all of that.  I love summer, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Anywhere where there's a beach.  That would be my favorite.  There are other trips that I enjoy, certainly, but beaches are my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, finally, do you have a favorite phrase or a saying?
Speaker 2: I used to always tell my children, and I--people say I say it all the time, life isn't fair.  It doesn't have to be.
Story_ID: 154030
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, can you tell me something about your family history?  I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family, and I want you to tell me as much as you know about both sides.  But first, if you can give me your parents' names, spell them for us, and their--give us their dates and places of birth.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother's name was Evelyn Gilpin Kindle.  E-v-e-l-y-n; Gilpin, G-i-l-p-i-n, was her maiden name; and she married William Kindle, K-i-n-d-l-e.  My father's middle name was DeBerry, D-e-B-e-r-r-y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said your--I'm sorry.  Your mother's middle name was?
Speaker 2: My--oh, her middle name was Althea.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Althea.  Okay.  And what is your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in Richmond, Virginia, January 18th, 1916.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was your father's name?
Speaker 2: William DeBerry Kindle, K-i-n-d-l-e.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: W-i-l-l-i-a-m; D-e-B-e-r-r-y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born June 23rd, 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born, I believe, in Springfield, Massachusetts.
Story_ID: 154031
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's [Evelyn Kindle] side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, there's quite a bit.  I can, I can go back to, certainly, to my great-grandfather, and his name was St. James Gilpin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his wife's name was Cordelia, C-o-r-d-e-l-i-a, Reese, R-e-e-s-e.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they married.  They had twelve children.
Speaker 1: Now, were they born during the time of slavery, or--
Speaker 2: I--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --or before the Civil War or--
Speaker 2: I believe that they were born during the time of slavery, okay?  They were my great gra--my mother's grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, probably, the latter part of the nineteenth century they probably were born?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  They, they had twelve children.  They had seven boys in a row, and then they had five girls in a row.  St. James was a shoe dealer.  He was the only African American to own a store on Broad Street, which was the street of commerce in Richmond [Virginia].  People thought that he was white.  He supervised white women from the back of his store, who sold these shoes to wealthy women in Richmond.  The family tale is that my great-grandfather had a chauffeur, and whenever the new shoes came into town, he would gather up all the sizes for his wife, and his daughters, daughters-in-law, granddaughters, to take a variety of new shoes; the new shipment for the spring or the fall to his home, send them by Alec [ph.], the chauffeur.  They would all try them on, you know, they would shop at home, so to speak.  And then whatever was left over would go back to the store to be sold, and that was the tale that I heard, you know, growing up.  I knew, certainly, my grandparents, and I knew many of my grandfather's brothers and sisters.  My grandmother's name--my grandfather was David Gilpin, D-a-v-i-d.  And my grandmother's name was Nannie, N-a-n-n-i-e, Burton, B-u-r-t-o-n.  She was an only child, and I know little about her side of the family except that there were some cousins that she had who were in Salem, Massachusetts.  There were three cousins, two of them lived in Brooklyn, New York and had a summer home in Sag Harbor [New York].  And the third one was a principal in the Washington, D.C. school system; the other two were nurses.  And I visited them and knew them very well.
Speaker 1: So, in Massachusetts?
Speaker 2: No.  They, they--the, the sisters grew up in Massachusetts, these cousins, but they--two of them moved to New York, the two nurses.  None of them had any children.  And the third sister moved to Washington [D.C.] and was a teacher and principal in the school system.
Story_ID: 154032
Speaker 1: Are there any stories passed down about your grandfather [David Gilpin]?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, I knew, yes.  There are stories about my grandfather.  My grandfather was the first African American supervisor of Railway Mail Car personnel.  He got on the train in Richmond [Virginia], rode as a passenger to, I think, North Carolina.  And from there, he went into the mail car and supervised the sorting and the delivery of mail, you know, on and off the train from North Carolina and down to Florida and back.  He would work for five days, be off for five, work for five, be off.  There were tales--I was the first grandchild, and my grandfather was very devoted to me.  He died when I was maybe three, but I, I have some recollection of him.  And my grandmother used to always say that he was very silly when it came to me.  He used to ask my grandmother all the time if any of their children were as, you know, as smart as I was, or did they look like me.  And, of course, you know, (laughter) the more, but he thought I was the best thing since sliced bread, as I do about my grandchildren, so that was, you know, the story.  The other story is that my grandfather was a party animal, and during prohibition, his best friend was a physician who used to give him prescription pads, and he used to write prescriptions for his bourbon (laughter) because he could imitate his handwriting, and so that was another story about my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  Okay.  Now, what about your grandmother [Nannie Burton], any stories about her?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was very much a homebody.  I remember her very, very well.  I was very close to her.  My grandmother, to me, was the quintessential, if they had them, southern--black southern belles of the time.  She had her card parties.  She cooked a lot.  She had--I remember certain things that she made like fancy foods like crab cakes, and--which to me, were fancy foods then.  She made--there was a gelatin salad.  And one of my favorites, she used to make a blackberry roll, and I have--I love to cook, and I have no idea where that recipe has gone, and I don't think I've had it since I've had--I've not had a grandmother, and it would be one thing I would kill to, to have in my possession would be that recipe, but it is something I remember.  She made her own sherbets, and, you know, that was--there were always goodies.  She was al--she also was the first person I knew to have a TV, and I would love to go spend the night with her, and she would always let me come on the weekends so that I could watch TV.  It was one of those little six-inch hexagonal TVs.  And I remember the--and I have her rocking chair upstairs, and she used to sit in that chair and rock.  And her favorite show was ['The] Kate Smith [Show'].  And sometimes after school, I would be there, and she'd sit and rock and watch Kate Smith on TV.
Speaker 1: 'When the Moon Comes Over the Mountain.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'When the Moon Comes Over the Mountain.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And 'God Bless America.'
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Story_ID: 154033
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your father's [William D. Kindle] side of the family; how far back can you trace that?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I can go back pretty far on my father's side of the family, and this pin, I particularly wore today because my Grandmother [Ethel Johnson] Kindle was born, believe it or not--I grew up in Richmond, Virginia; my Grandmother Kindle was born here in Baltimore [Maryland] and ended up here in Baltimore, more or less.  But my Grandmother Kindle--and I have pictures of her mother.  Her mother's name was Virginia Johnson, and Virginia had a sister that they called Teet [ph.], and even my father doesn't know what her real name was, but it was Teet, and his grandmother's name was Gin-Gin [ph.].  And my grandmother gave me this pin.  Her name was Ethel Johnson Kindle [ph.].  And this was her mother's pin, and Gin-Gin and Teet were freed in the emancipation, and they had been slaves on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.  And as I showed this to my children as they, you know, I was, I was trying to instill in them some of the family lore.  I said and my great-grandmother and her sister walked to Baltimore after the emancipation, and they wanted to know was it across the [Chesapeake] Bay Bridge?  Of course, there was no Bay Bridge then, but that was the, the--that's the story, that they walked to Baltimore.  My grandmother was born, she has no idea who her father was.  We believe it was the, the person that they worked for, which was not uncommon at the time.  They worked for a family, and they believe my Grandmother Kindle was left to her own devices, most of the time, because the two sisters worked.
Speaker 1: So they worked--they did like work in a household?
Speaker 2: Hou--they worked in the household, and she was left with many books.  She was a ferocious reader.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a story I heard, if you can confirm it, that she was actually locked in a room with the books?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is this true?
Speaker 2: I believe so, yes.  Sh--when she got to be high school age, and we assuming that her father supported her educational pursuits because I do not know of her working at all until after she had graduated from college--
Story_ID: 154034
Speaker 1: So she [grandmother Ethel Johnson Kindle] was able to have her tuition paid and all of that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She went to Girls'--she was sent to boarding school.  She was sent to Girls' Latin School in Boston [Massachusetts, later Boston Latin Academy], and then she was graduated from Radcliffe College [Cambridge, Massachusetts] in 1912.  She graduated from Girl, Girls' Latin in Boston in 1908, and I can document that because I have both of her diplomas.
Speaker 1: Right.  We saw them earlier. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So she had a special education for those days.  I mean, she had like a real unique educational experience.
Speaker 2: As far as we know, she was the first African American to graduate from either of those schools.  We have not documented that with the schools, but we don't know of anybody else.  Of course, my grandmother did not look like she was African American, so maybe nobody questioned it and nobody knew.  She never hid it.  One of the stories is my--we were driving to Detroit, and this is a true--true story, I remember it distinctly.  And we were stopped at one of the rest places where you eat, and my grandmother was with us, and my father [William D. Kindle] was brown; my mother [Evelyn Gilpin Kindle], my brother and I were about my complexion, and my grandmother was a very stately white-haired patrician woman, and my father walked back to the car after--from the restaurant and the restrooms and all, and he was the first one back, and in the car parked next to us, a dog started barking.  And the man said, "Oh, pardon him, he doesn't like Negroes."  And so my father said, "Okay."  And he sat behind the steering wheel.  And next, my mother comes with my brother and me, and he looks, and then the icing on the cake, and my father who had a very keen sense of humor, when my grandmother came, my grandmother got in on the side of the car where the dog was, and it was almost like the dog jumped out of his skin as, as well as the man because they couldn't figure out how this family--if we were a family, and how we got this very patrician white woman to ride with us on the highways.  So it--that was always a good family story, so--but my grandmother taught, and she always maintained a crisp Boston accent, and she wrote letters.  She read a lot.  I remember as a child being in her apartment here in Baltimore [Maryland], and there were stacks and stacks and stacks of books and magazines, and big--when she died, of course, I was grown and I was living here, so I was--had to clean out all of that, and, you know, it was just a treasure trove of magazines and books and we threw--gave away, but some we still have.
Story_ID: 154035
Speaker 1: My grandfather, her [Ethel Johnson Kindle] husband, his name was William Horace Kindle, and my grandfather was born in Columbia, Tennessee.  He had two sisters.  The sisters, they went to--one of the sisters, anyway, his sister, Emmy, went to high school at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].  At the time, Fisk had high school, and so did my grandfather, and my grandfather finished Fisk in 1912.  He was an education phys-ed [physical education] major, and he--from there, he went to Springfield College in [Springifield] Massachusetts, and my--that's where he met my grandmother.  My grandfather had two master's degrees.  My grandmother, on the Kindle side, had one master's in education from the University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio].  And my Grandmother [Nannie Burton] Gilpin also taught and went to whatever the normal [teachers] school was in Richmond [Virginia], at--
Speaker 2: Teachers school.
Speaker 1: At teachers school, and she taught before her marriage also.  So those were the occupations of my grandparents.  And I didn't realize how special it was until we were with--that my family was so well educated.  One of my great aunts was the first African American woman physician in Virginia.  Her name was Zenobia Gilpin, and she graduated from Howard's Med School [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  I didn't realize how special it was until we were with a group of my husband's partners and their wives, and we were talking about family backgrounds, and that kind of thing, and both my husband and I, you know--I am probably the least educated because all I've taken many courses since college, I have no degree beyond a bachelor's degree.  And most of our family was better educated than I am, in terms of several generations back.  And none of our white counterparts had that, and they were amazed that, you know, that we had the kind of family history that we had.
Story_ID: 154036
Speaker 1: Now, I wanted to ask you about your mother [Evelyn Gilpin Kindle], her upbringing.  What was your--you said your mother--it was your mother that went to Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: No, my grandmother [Ethel Johnson Kindle].
Speaker 1: Your grandmother.  All right. Okay.  It was your grandmother.  Now, what about your mother, what kind of life does she have and--
Speaker 2: My mother grew up in Richmond [Virginia].  My mother was a very interesting person.  My mo--my mother used to say, and she fulfilled her prophecy, that was she born in Richmond and she was gonna die in Richmond.  My mother was very much a part of middle class Richmond; because of that, I had that upbringing.  I didn't realize certain things existed or, or could--you could break con--what I thought was convention, and not be ostracized until I went to college because it was a strict, tightknit community.  It serves me well now, certainly; but I felt, I think in some ways, constrained by it, but I didn't know that I had that constraint until I, I was able to break out, go to college, and see other things.  Did not go to college in Richmond because my family had a long association with Virginia Union University [Richmond, Virginia].  My father [William D. Kindle] was the dean there.  My great uncle, by marriage, was the president at the time I would've gone, and my godmother was the librarian, and the my godfather, head of the science department; being a small school, that was just a bit much for me.  So I went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] when my grand--my grandmother wanted me to go to Radcliffe, and I really didn't want to go in the cold, so I went to Fisk thinking, well, she'll be happy if I went where my grandfather went, but my mother was very, very Richmond.
Story_ID: 154037
Speaker 1: Now, we were asking you about your mother [Evelyn Gilpin Kindle].  You know, what was your mother like and what she did?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother grew up as one of six children in Richmond, Virginia.  She was very close to her mother [Nannie Burton].  She maintained her childhood friends all through life.  Her best friend, as a child, lived next door to her; her name was also Evelyn.  One of the parts of the middle class community in Richmond [Virginia], is that you keep your friends.  They're your friends for life.  Their mothers were friends, their children were friends, and that gave them some kind of a special kind of closeness, I think.  My mother attended Virginia Union [University, Richmond, Virginia].  She graduated from Virginia Union.  She began to teach in a small community about forty miles from Richmond, called Blackstone in a three-room schoolhouse.  She went to Atlanta University [later Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] in the summers to get her master's, but she never ever really lived anywhere in her life but in Richmond.  And she was really a part of that community all of her life.
Story_ID: 154038
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, what about your father [William D. Kindle].  Can you tell us about his life?
Speaker 2: Well, my father was very different in that my father was born in Springfield, Massachusetts where my grandparents met and married, and then the bulk of his growing up years were spent in Talladega, Alabama and when my father said before had this sense of humor, and he had a very southern accent, and people would say to him--would ask him, "Well, where are you from?"  And he would always say, "Springfield, Massachusetts," because he sounded so southern. But he grew up on the campus of Talladega College.  My grandfather [William H. Kindle] was director of athletics there, and my grandmother [Ethel Johnson Kindle] was a teacher in the training school there.  They had a teacher education program, and my grandmother taught there.  My father and his sister attended that school, both went to Talladega College [Talladega, Alabama] for a while.  My grandfather went to the dean at Talladega and asked him would he please dismiss my father.  My father was not doing well academically, but not doing poorly enough to be academically dismissed.  My grandfather asked him to call in my father and dismiss him, which he did.  My father then worked for a semester and sent himself to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  It was there when my father was at Morehouse, and my mother [Evelyn Gilpin Kindle] was at Atlanta University [later Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] that they met.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father was Second Lieutenant in the army during World War II.  He was in Italy and North Africa and after the war, the circumstances that he and my mother married while he was in the army in 1942.  When he came out, he went under the GI Bill to the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and I was born there; only lived there for nine months and then we moved back to Richmond [Virginia] where I grew up.
Story_ID: 154039
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell me about growing up?  What was your neighborhood like and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Growing up, in hindsight, was a very, very rich experience.  I have a brother who is four years younger than I.  When we first moved to Richmond [Virginia], we lived with my grandparents [Nannie Burton and David Gilpin] for a short time, and then we moved around the corner to an apartment.  When I was three, we bought the house that I grew up in on Overbrook Road, and the--there's so many tales about me and Overbrook Road.  We were one of the first at that time Negroes on Overbrook Road.  The lady who lived next door one day saw me playing in the yard, and she came over to the fence, the story goes, and asked me what my name was, and I told her and she said, "Well, where did you go to school?"  And the story is that I told her, "I only go to nursery school now.  I'm only three, but my mother says that by the time I go to school, I will go to the school right back there," because there was a school a block behind us which was segregated and at that time, of course, it was a white school, but indeed that did come true.  The neighborhood changed.  We were one of the first, but I'm sure within a year or two the block was all black, and it was a very middle class neighborhood.  The neighbors knew you, the, you know, it was one of those villages.  It takes a village to raise a child, well indeed it was a village.  Sometimes, I think it was too much of a village, because I remember once as a teenager, like high school, I was walking home and when I got home--my mother [Evelyn Gilpin Kindle] taught, but certainly she got home from school driving a lot faster than I did walking as a rule.  And she was standing on the porch, and I said, "Are you waiting for me?"  She said, "Yes."  And I said, "But why?", and she said, "Because somebody in the"--a couple of blocks away had called her and told her that I was walking home from school with a boy.  I mean, and that was the way it was.  You couldn't chew gum without (laughter) somebody telling your parents, dare you do anything that was really quote unquote "bad."  So it was that kind of growing up where it was good and it was--as an adult it, you know, brings you back when you see other things to what's comfortable and what's good for you.
Story_ID: 154040
Speaker 1: How did you like school?  I mean, and where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: School was a salvation for me.  I really, really like school.  I have friends today that I started to nursery school with and graduated from high school with.  And we, we're still friends, and that's part, I think, of the Richmond [Virginia] experience.  I believe that because I went to a segregated schools system, because the people in who taught us and who were the administrators in school and who were in invested in us, you know, they make--they required you to think, they required you to know grammar, they required certain, certain character traits just as your parents did, and it was a wonderful, wonderful thing.  And they invested in you because I think they really felt that you were the generation who was going to take care of them in their old age, and be their doctors, and nurses, and clergy men, and teach their children, and grandchildren, and they had a total interest in you, and that was a good thing.  And I, although, I went to segregated schools, I would put my early education and my overall education up to anyone's.  I had--
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of the elementary school you attended?
Speaker 2: The elementary school was Albert V. Norrell [School, Richmond, Virginia], N-o-r-r-e-l-l.
Story_ID: 154041
Speaker 1: Now, when I was in the second grade at [Albert V.] Norrell School [Richmond, Virginia], I was in Mrs. White's [ph.] class and that was when the Brown vs. Board of Education [of Topeka, 1954] decision came down.  What happened was, the Virginia School Board decided that to keep the school segregated, that every parent--a parent of every child in the school systems in Virginia would have to sign what was called a pupil placement form, and this form said that the state School Board could assign each child to the school that they thought was appropriate.  My parents [Evelyn Gilpin Kindle and William D. Kindle] would not sign.  I can remember Mrs. [Ethel Thompson] Overby, who was the principal of the school and she looked just like a 1950s principal with a dark dress with a big white collar, and tie-up shoes, and the heavy stockings, and the hair in the bun come into our classroom and read a list of children who had to leave school.  And we had to leave school because our parents would not sign this pupil personnel form.  Well, I mean, we were elated (laughter) because we thought we didn't have to go to school, and we didn't, as a second grader, we certainly didn't fully understand why.  And we couldn't understand why Mrs. Overby was crying.  I mean, just tears were just rolling down her face.  We went home, and I'm not sure what day of the week it was, but all of the parents of the children who were put out of school got together and within three days we were in school.  There was a church two doors down the street from me, which was less than a block from the school we attended.  My mother did the lesson plans and sent all of, at that time, mimeographs for the first, second and third grades.  Somebody else did it for fourth, fifth and sixth, and we had school in church for about eight weeks.  The parents, the mothers, who did not work and there were several, were the teachers.  They called--like my mother was the resource person for first, second and third grades.  So the teacher, whoever was teaching, they called her every night.  I used to take home the papers for my mother to grade, she would give them feedback as to what they needed to stress in the lesson plan for the next day, and that's the way it went until we were--until the court said that we could go back to school, okay?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was--that really taught me that, you know, things can be done.  You just have to get together and do them.  So--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 1: --that was pretty intense.
Story_ID: 154042
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  How old were you when you first started realized what had actually happened?
Speaker 2: It was--I had some notion of it because of the intensity.  Well, there were two things that happened.  The intensity of it, and the anger, and my parents [Evelyn Gilpin Kindle and William D. Kindle] normally, especially in front of me, did not express a lot of anger but I could feel a tension and it wasn't between the two of them.  It was some kind of tension that I perceived being from the outside.  Once the school things lightened up a little bit, but it was hectic because my mother had to go teach in one of these schools to the children who weren't put out and, you know, at night there was--she really didn't have as much as time for me because she was doing all the other things that she had to do to carry on in the school where I was attending, and so I perceived that.  And then I went back to school, there was such a collective sigh of relief in the community, in the school, in the neighborhood, you know, and I knew that something had happened and I knew that it was important.  I didn't quite know how to perceive it then because my parents tried to protect me from a lot of what was going on.  For instance, the buses were segregated.  I only remember one instance in childhood when there were segregated buses, riding the bus and I sat in front of the bus.  I went downtown with my mother, and at the time she didn't have a car and didn't drive, and I sat in front of the bus.  I must have been four or five.  And she said, "No, please come sit with me," and, normally, I would have done it and I don't know what--"No, I'm not going to do it," and she glared at me and, you know, recalling that I don't know what made me be so defiant, but I just sat there.  And the bus driver never said anything.  And she went to the back, but when we got off the bus and we were going into the store, I remember her kind of grabbing my hand and kind of--"Don't you ever do that again.  When we go home, you will sit with me on the bus," and I did.  It wasn't until much later that I recognized what the problem was and probably why she didn't say anything else to me.  I was somewhat protected from those kinds of instances, and I used to, I guess, in my rebellious-type years, I used to be angry that I was sheltered from those, but I also know that they gave you a sense of well-being and confidence in who you are and maybe they knew better than I did.

Speaker 1: The other thing that happened in '54 [1954] that I recall, is our next door neighbor was [HM] Oliver Hill, who was one of the civil rights lawyers and who used to--who did the Virginia court cases that were a part of the Brown vs. Board of Education [of Topeka, 1954].  And the Hills lived next door to us.  They had one son [Oliver Hill, Jr.] who is an age was between my brother and me, so I don't know whether it was Aunt Bernie [Beresenia Walker, Hill's wife] and Uncle Oliver who had three children or my parents who had three children because we were--we interacted very much like one household almost, you know.  And the Klu Klux Klan [KKK], who Uncle Oliver who always describes as not being so bright, burnt a cross.  But what would happen both--in the sum--it was in the summer, so they had been watching the houses for several weeks apparently and to find out exactly where he lived to burn the cross.  Well, my mother [Evelyn Gilpin Kindle] was home in the summer because she was a teacher, Aunt Bernie was a school administrator and, of course, Uncle Oliver and my father [William D. Kindle] worked all summer.  So cocktails were usually at my house after work.  So Uncle Oliver, and Aunt Bernie, and my father would park their cars and come into our house first.  And they would have a cocktail, discuss the issues of the day and normally Aunt Bernie and Uncle Oliver would go out the back door, and there was a fen--we had a fence made between the two houses so we kids wouldn't have to go out front, we would go back and forth in our pajamas, you know. The--and so Aunt Bernie and Uncle Oliver would go home through the back gate, so they didn't know--and then they would watch in the morning, and he would come out of the house next door.  So they couldn't figure out where to burn the cross, so they burned it between the two houses.  And then, you know, that was the first time I remember the news media being there, and I used to--I gave them to Uncle Oliver a few years ago, but I used to have pictures of the actual cross that I had taken with a little whatever little Kodak camera I had at the time.  But the Richmond Times-Dispatch News Leader, they all came, and they were taking pictures, and they were interviewing, and that was exciting to me, but I knew also even though I was very young that it was important.  I wasn't sure why, but I had this little camera and I was out taking pictures too because somehow I knew it was important, and indeed it certainly was.  And Dukie [ph.] certainly had to stay at our house for two weeks, and I couldn't understand after that, why many nights my father would get up and go to Aunt Bernie's house, and it was late.  Well, the Klu Klux Klan was threatening my Uncle Oliver, and my Aunt Bernie used to sit on the steps inside her house just inside the front door with a gun.  Now, Uncle Oliver would never have a gun and didn't, but she had a gun.  I didn't know this until I was an adult (laughter).  My father would go over to sit with her to wait for Uncle Oliver to come home to make sure he was safe, but that's the kind--when you asked me about neighborhood, that's the kind of neighborhood we had.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You were right at the point of drama around desegregation?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 154044
Speaker 1: How long was it before the schools were desegregated in Virginia (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My brother, my brother, who is four years younger than I am, and I'm fifty-seven so that makes him almost fifty-three, was one of the first to attend an integrated school.  He was one of two when he went though junior high school to attend an integrated school, and I think there were two before him and then when he went, there were like eight.  I remember his first day of school when he came home, my mother [Evelyn Gilpin Kindle] said to him, "How was school?" and being in seventh grade then, he said, "It was all right." (Laughter).  And she said, "Well, what did you do?"  He said, "Normal school stuff."  So she said, "Well, what did you do at recess?  "Oh, played basketball."  So she said, "Well, who did you play with," and he said, "Black kids played the white kids," (laughter), and so she said, "Oh, who won?"  "The black kids."  So she said, "Well, what was the score?" and it was very lopsided apparently; so she said, "Well, are you going to play basketball, you think, tomorrow?"  "Sure."  So she said, "Well, why don't you mix up and--so it won't be so lopsided and, you know, play half the white boys on your team and half black boys on their team," and he looked at her in his most indignant look and said, "How would you know who's on whose team then?"  So that didn't work, but he had a great experience in integrated schools.
Story_ID: 154045
Speaker 1: What were your favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 2: Math.  Math.  All the time, math.
Speaker 1: Did you have favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  I really liked most of them.  There was one teacher and, I guess, I'm relating this because I just saw her daughter who's a good friend of mine in New York, she's--and she lived next door to us in the time we lived in the apartment and had no children, and so she used to take me everywhere also.  And her name was Grace Perkins [ph.], and she taught me in junior high school and I knew her on a personal level, you know, but she taught me--and I say I like math and the first thing I tell you is about an English teacher, but she taught--the vocabulary.  I like words, and the vocabulary and the literature was my first really exposure to that kind of thing, and she was my teacher at that point.  And that was interesting because I saw her on another level, and I didn't realize how smart these people I've been around all my life were and, you know, I saw them as more parental figures and I remember--I can, I can still remember seventh grade; what's the difference between antidote and anecdote.  Those kinds of things that we were being taught, and so all of my elementary teachers; Mrs. Minum [ph.], Mrs. Clark, didn't like Mrs. White [ph.] too much.  But they were all wonderful, and in high school, my absolute favorite was Mr. Hewett [ph.] who was my chemistry teacher and Mr. Richardson [ph.].  They were all just wonderful, wonderful people.
Story_ID: 154046
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell me about high school.  Where did you attend high school?
Speaker 2: Maggie Walker [later Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies, Richmond, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Maggie Walker--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --High school.  Okay.  Now, by this time, was this a desegregated high school or--
Speaker 2: No, it was not.  It was still segregated, and this was in the '60s [1960S].
Speaker 1: And who was Maggie Walker?
Speaker 2: Maggie Walker was the first--she started what was called the St. Luke's Society, which was a Penny Bank in Richmond [Virginia].  It later became the Consolidated Bank.  And for a time, my father [William D. Kindle] worked there.  Maggie Walker was an African American woman.  She had a granddaughter who was one of my mother's [Evelyn Gilpin Kindle] best friends.  When they restored her home, and my mother went into the home.  She said, "This doesn't belong here"--you know, she--because my mother used to play there all the time and apparently Mrs. Walker was an invalid in a wheelchair for--in her later years.  And my mother tells stories about playing on the elevator, and her granddaughter was a doc--became a doctor in Chicago [Illinois], her name was Maggie Laura Walker and she died, I'm going to say, within the last decade.  But Maggie Walker started the bank in Richmond that became the African American bank.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And high school was wonderful because in elementary school, certainly, I was restricted, and I don't mean that in a negative sense, but to the people who lived in my neighborhood.  In junior high, it wasn't much better.  But in high school, they were only two African American high schools; there was Armstrong and Walker.  And all of the children almost on the north side, which was where I lived, went to Maggie Walker, and most of the children in the west end went to Maggie Walker.  And there was--there were a lot more people there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you engage in all that kind of high school activities?
Speaker 2: I was a little bit shy and quiet.  There were--we had a chemistry club, and I used to always do projects in there.  I'd go to school sometimes at seven o'clock in the morning, go home nine o'clock at night doing these--for science fairs and that kind of thing, but I was never a cheat--I used to go to some of the, to the--we had very, very good athletic teams, both basketball and football and I went to some of the games and I, you know, I wasn't that that nerdy, but somewhat.  And I did participate in some things, but mostly I was a little more bookish then.
Speaker 1: Well, were you still interested mainly in mathematics and science?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I also liked the English, the--Miss Deberry [ph.], the French teacher, was wonderful.  And I think what sparked my interest in, in most things were not the subject matter but the person, and--but I always had good teachers, so I kind of liked it all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you graduate with any sort of honors or anything?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I was maybe--I don't remember--I just--I was, like, twelfth in my class of maybe, I think, it was 800, so I did okay.
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.  Yeah, that's real good.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 154047
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have your mind set on a career when you were a senior?  Did you know what you were going to do?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.  I was going to be an actuary.
Speaker 1: I was going to be an actuary; I was going to go to college; I was going to travel; I was going to be an actuary and live the good life--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in a big city.
Speaker 2: Now, what is an actuary?
Speaker 1: An actuary is a person who at that time, without benefit of computers, did tables for insurance, okay.  Did insurance tables and things like that; mainly for insurance companies.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, how did you decide on that as a goal, you know?
Speaker 1: Because it was really--I was really into the math part, went to college as a math major and I thought it was a field that was certainly growing and you couldn't--and they weren't a lot of black people in that, even though they were black insurance companies, they had to get the, the materials from somewhere else and, you know, I just thought that it was interesting.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What life expectancy was, and how many 2.3 children at that time was, whatever, and, you know, how they came up with that.  So that was all very interesting to me.
Story_ID: 154048
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how did you decide on which college to attend?
Speaker 2: My grandmother [Ethel Johnson Kindle] who had graduated from Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] wanted me to go there.  I did not want to go to Boston [Massachusetts], mainly because it was cold.  I had never been in an integrated school setting, and I wanted to--I knew I wanted to go to a small school.  My grandfather [William Horace Kindle] who died when I was seven had been to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], and so I knew that I would make my grandmother happy if I went to Fisk, so that was it.  I chose Fisk.  I applied to several places that had good math departments, but I knew that's where I wanted to go.  I was accepted, I even got a small scholarship and that's where I went.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you got to Fisk University in 1964, you said?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: All right.  What was Fisk like then?  I know just before you were arrived, I mean, there was a flurry of civil rights activities at Fisk College [sic].  There were civil demonstrations--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And the students (unclear).
Speaker 2: [HM] Nikki Giovanni, [HM] John Lewis--?
Speaker 1: Nikki Giovanni was still there when I was there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She was maybe two years ahead of me.  Fisk was a marvelous place.  Both, intellectually and culturally.  You didn't really know if you were getting it all.  But you did and maybe you didn't know you were getting all because everybody else was getting it all too, whether you liked it or not.  It was just what was available to you.  Aaron--you had to take art appreciation, and I hated art.  I couldn't draw a stick--my friends in college particularly used to tease me because I've always liked to read, and they would take free hand drawing from Aaron Douglas as a, as a, as an elective because they knew the final exam was going to be to draw a trash can, and (laughter), and he would put the trash can up on the desk and that was the final exam.  You draw this trash can, and I know that I would fail that--(sirens in the background)--oh, the sirens.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you had Aaron Douglas teaching drawing at Fisk?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.  And he taught me art appreciation.  You had to take that, and you had to take it from Mr. Douglas.  I would never have done that if I had--but everybody had to do it.  There was a white lady there, a Dr. Voorhees [ph.], who taught with my grandparents [William H. Kindle and Ethel Johnson Kindle] at Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama], and her mother was ninety-six, I believe, by the time that I got there.  And Dr. Voorhees lived on campus, and she had all the Talladega children over in the spring for strawberry shortcake, and she talked about our parents and our grandparents, and that was such an interesting experience because having not really had the Talladega experience, you know, here were other people that whose parents knew your parents, and that you probably even at Fisk may or may not have ever met.  There were--Nikki Giovanni was a student there when I was there.  There were just so many things going on.  The art gallery at Fisk is just a small treasure.  You know, Jacob Lawrence and just Alfred Stieglitz left a huge portion of his collection to the [Carl] Van Vechten Gallery, and it was a nice place to be.
Speaker 2: Hmm.  A gallery, the Van Vechten gallery named after Carl--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Carl Van Vechten.
Speaker 2: --Van Vechten.  New York [New York]--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --based--New York collector.  Okay.
Story_ID: 154049
Speaker 1: You basically majored in--
Speaker 2: I was a math major there [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] for two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What happened?
Speaker 2: What happened?  I met my husband [HM Keiffer Mitchell, Sr.], I got married after my sophomore year and in my junior year I became pregnant and had an 8:00 o'clock calculus class.  My son and calculus did not agree with each other very well, (laughter) especially at that time of morning.  I was sick all the time, and I said this has got to go, and I ended changing my major to economics.  And I completed my third year at Fisk, and then my husband completed his senior year at Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and we moved here and I finished in economics at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  So my degree is from Morgan, but my real college experience is at Fisk.  And there's one--and there's a judge who used to be here, David Mitchell, and it was unusual in the '60s [1960s] to have married students and, of course, by that time my name was Mitchell, and David Mitchell who became a judge here, he was pre-law and his wife, Diane, were also married about at the same time Keiffer and I were and David, Diane and I all took sociology from a Dr. P. Chike Onwuachi.  I just think the name had--
Speaker 1: Chike Onwuachi, yeah--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --he's from Nigeria.
Speaker 2: Right.  And David used to sit between us.  The three of us took this class together and he used--in those days in college used to call roll, Dr. Onwuachi would call the roll, and he would say (mimicking accent), "Mr. Mitchell, Mrs. Mitchell, Mrs. Mitchell."  And then he would always-"present, present, present."  He would always look up, he said, "Mr. Mitchell, you never have to come to another day of this class if you tell me how you do it," because Diane and I sat on either side of him and both of us were pregnant, and so (laughter) "You never have to come to this class just tell me how you do it.  You make an A."
Speaker 1: So he thought that you were wives of David Mitchell?
Speaker 2: Well, he knew better.
Speaker 1: He was joking--
Speaker 2: But he would tease every time he called roll.
Speaker 1: Onwuachi became the head of African studies at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] for in the '70s [1970s] and wrote a book.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I lost track of him.
Speaker 1: He wrote a book and he was in charge of Festac 77 in [Lagos] Nigeria, in 1977, yeah?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: P. Chike Onwuachi.  Yeah, I've met him.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 154050
Speaker 1: So you finished up at Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I finished at Morgan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I changed my major to economics and two of my--well, there were three teachers really in the economics department.  I had all three of them because my father [William D. Kindle] was in business, taught business for most of his life.  Two of them had been to Wharton [School of the University of Pennsylvania] with him, and the third one he also knew very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What are the names (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Doctor Bryson, Winifred Bryson [ph.]; it was Dr. Broda Sawyer [ph.] and Dr. Frederick Jackson [ph.].  Dr. Jackson always wore--he was a short man, always wore a red tie and a white tie.  Never varied.  And the three of them were my economics teachers for the most part at Morgan, and that was a different experience being a married student with a baby and having, you know, when people--before the teacher got to class when the other students were discussing where the party was on Friday night, I was writing my grocery list.  So it gave me two different perspectives of college.  I was--and it was very different, but I think I did--my grades were better at Morgan because I knew what I was there for.  I knew I had to--and I completed my studies there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, any other stories about Morgan?  Any other interesting things?
Speaker 2: Morgan, I wasn't really involved as a student because I went--our son was born in September, I sat out that semester.  I went for three semesters and two summers starting that February, which was the second semester and I just--I went to class, I used to have to take a baby in an infant seat when the babysitter didn't show up sometimes, and I went to class.  Basically, did what I had to do and went home, but it was still an enjoyable experience.
Story_ID: 154051
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what do you do next?  Now you got young children and--
Speaker 2: Well, by and large until my youngest was ten, I had little jobs for short periods here and there.  When I finished Morgan I went to work for the city for a short time, very short; maybe about six months and then I was pregnant with our second child, and after that I took a long hiatus.  Then after our third child, I went and I became--a real--consumer education and Ralph Nader were on all the rage in the early '70s [1970s], and I really became interested in that.  So I went up the street here to the College of Notre Dame [later Notre Dame of Maryland University, Baltimore, Maryland] and took some classes in consumer economics and I was supposed to do an internship to finish the major and I decided I really just didn't want to do that.  And so I went to a woman's fair or fair of some kind and there was a booth from the consumer protection division, and the lady asked me what my name was and I told her.  And she said, "You were supposed to be my intern." And so then I went to work at consumer protection as a volunteer and then I became a part-time worker and then for a short time a full-time worker, and I quit that after about three years and I stayed home until my youngest was ten.  And from that time on I've worked for Baltimore County Government.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're a management assistant?
Speaker 2: I'm a management assistant.  It's a glorified staff person.  I was the--like the staff person to a colonel in the police department who was like the deputy chief, and I've had a variety of jobs in social services.  I've done it for the deputy director.  Right now I work for a foster care.  And many people think I'm a social worker, but I'm not.  I do the healthcare for foster children; I do a lot of community outreach; I do the school enrollment and I'm the school liaison for the agency for, you know, the enrollment issues and procedures in the school systems.  I do a lot of setting policy and procedures; I also do the Section 8 housing program is a part of our agency, and I do the Section 8 hearings at least once a month for people who the housing officers have to terminate and they ask for an informal hearing.  I do those and make a decision on whether or not to reinstate them into their Section 8 or not.  So I do a variety of things there.
Story_ID: 154052
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your family have been very much involved in, not just your immediate family, but your extended family, the Mitchells in here, been involved in Baltimore [Maryland] politics?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: How has that affected, you know, your life here in the city?
Speaker 2: I got married when I was nineteen and moved to Baltimore at twenty, and it was very interesting because coming from Richmond [Virginia] and the background I've described and I said I always wanted to live in a big city and I came to Baltimore and many people knew my in-laws and my husband [HM Keiffer Mitchell, Sr.] and his brothers; there were four of them.  There are four of them.  And I would--I remember going--I don't remember what kind of gathering it was, but the first thing that I remember was going to some gathering when I first moved here and a lady came up to me and said, "Oh, which one are you married to?"  And I was accustomed to everybody knowing exactly who I was, so that was very different to me.
Speaker 1: Different from Richmond?
Speaker 2: It was very different from Richmond, and certainly in Richmond nobody would have asked it quite like that, I'm sure.  (Laughter).  So, you know, and--that kind of floored me and--but I grew into that.  Some of that Richmond background came to play then as now.  I know who I am and, yes, I did which one I was married to (laughter), but--
Speaker 1: They may not have (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And--
Story_ID: 154053
Speaker 1: I became keenly interested in the politics, and my son who is in politics [Keiffer Mitchell, Jr.], often tells the story that people say, you know, "Who got you interested in politics, was it your grandfather or your Uncle [HM] Parren [Mitchell], or your Uncle [HM] Clarence [Mitchell] or your Uncle [HM] Michael [Mitchell]?"  You know, somebody whose either been elected or been around it for the long--for the longest time and he said, "No, it was my mother."  And he was kind of born with it.  And I recognized that when he was about two, and one of my brothers-in-law was running for the senate, the state senate, and we didn't even live in his district but he saw some of his literature in the house because my husband [HM Keiffer Mitchell, Sr.] was always treasurer for his brothers and as he is for our son.  And in those days, he was on his Big Wheel and he wanted to go give out this campaign literature, and so he got on his Big Wheel and he said, "Can I?"--and he took it from door to door as far as he was allowed to go and then when he finished putting in every--he was so proud of himself and he came home, and he said, "Mommy, by the next time Uncle Clarence runs do you think I can go across the street?"  I mean, that was a big deal to him, and I said, oh, oh, I know what he was going to be and I did.  From that day on, it was not that anybody pushed him into it, but he was always interested and I always tried to nurture that.  I started him as a small child collecting campaign buttons, and he as a teenager had half day off on Wednesdays in middle school, and his sisters were still in elementary school.  So if there were a campaign going, we would go to every headquarters of every candidate and we would collect campaign literature and campaign buttons.  And one day, he walked into a Republican candidate's headquarters to collect one.  I think it was maybe Reagan headquarters in the 1980 or something here and they said, "What school do you go to, would you be willing to speak for us?", and he said, "Well, I think--can I have a campaign button?"  And then he said, "No, I'm a democrat" and walked out. (laughter)
Speaker 2: How old was he then?
Speaker 1: He was--oh, probably about thirteen, twelve or thirteen.  Also one of his--my father-in-law was very good friends with Lyndon [B.] Johnson and when Keiffer was about eight, President Johnson's daughter, Lynda [Bird Johnson], called him and said, that her husband Chuck Robb was running for Lieutenant Governor in Virginia and she needed help because his opponent in the primary was well respected in the African American community, and he said, "Well, I'll call my daughter-in-law and she's from Virginia."  So Keiffer and I, he was about eight, we went down and we campaigned for Chuck then and we took them all around, and, you know, with my mother's involvement in her clubs and those kinds of things, we just--and he won, and that was his first real campaign campaign.
Story_ID: 154054
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your son [Keiffer Mitchell, Jr.] got a political education early, and he's out there often now.
Speaker 2: And he always teases me that certainly he and the people that I was interested in, they were losing campaigns.  So, indeed, they were, but I knew that--I knew that the issues that these people had were good when I picked them, and there were issues that, certainly, I was interested in.  And, certainly, by that time--by the time he was a teenager or so, I was real sure he was going into politics.  And as a mother, I figured, you know, anybody can win and be happy.  You better know how to lose.  And I didn't pick losing campaigns because they were losing, but I also in retrospect think that it was a good experience for him to know what happens when you lose.  You know, where do you go from here?  Well, what happens to the issues; have you made an impact or not?  That was an important lesson.  And what--if you are the politician, what happens to you when you lose, you know, and somebody's gotta win and somebody's gotta lose.  And, and so I was glad that we got that in on the ground level because so far in his two elections, and this will be his third.  He's just won the primary for a third term in City Council.  The--and I'm hoping that he will win this election certainly.  So sometimes I hope that, you know, it would be nice as a mother if he never had to have the experience of losing himself, but I certainly think that he would know how to do it and do it graciously.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and without any real detriment to his family or his--long-term effect on his family or his ego.
Story_ID: 154055
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, ma'am, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: You know, I recently joined a toastmasters group, and my first speech was called, 'Growing up Negro.'  And I described some of the things that I've told you about today, and in my early years, certainly, I was a negro; and in my teenage and college years, I was a black person; and, now, I am an African American.  And there's several things that disturb me.  Having majored in economics, the economic disparity.  I am disturbed about what happens in the business community in this country; I am disturbed by the con--by the conservatism that seems to have taken over at this juncture in our existence.  There are lots of things that disturb me.  But in terms of race relations, you know, you saw my fifteen-month old grandson when you came in and his mother is white.  And when any--this just happened this month when my son was campaigning on Election Day.  My daughter-in-law and my grandson walked to all the polls in their area, their neighborhood, with their T-shirts on, and it's a mixed community.  And she was called an--my daughter-in-law [Nicole Kramer Mitchell] and my grandson [Jack Mitchell] were called nigger lovers, and that hurt.  That hurts badly.  There's no nicer person in this world than my daughter-in-law.  My daughter [Kathleen Mitchell] in Florida is a real estate agent, and she works with Caldwell Banker; and she would not have her picture put on her business card because when she calls people on cold call, she's articulate and people don't ask her what she is, but she felt it would have a negative economic impact on her if she put her picture on her card and sent it out to people she had only spoken with on the phone.  Those things still hurt.  We've come a long way.  She wouldn't be put out of school today in elementary school and neither would Little Jack.  However, I think we all still suffer.  I think it's important to still bring about children.  When you asked me at the beginning, what was one of my expression; it's still life isn't fair, but you have to learn and you have to be taught that to, you know, as I was taught that life may not be fair, but you make--overcoming obstacles is a part of it.  You have your family and your education, and they are good and you bring those to bear when you need to, to overcome those obstacles, and I look forward to the day when my grandson can say, I am an American.  I am somebody's son or somebody's daughter, or I went here or did that, or I believe this and not be described as a white child, a black child, a mixed child.  And I look forward to the day when my daughter, assuming she would--or my other two grandchildren who are more African or let's say brown-complected--I look forward to the day when they won't be hindered economically by putting their picture on a card; when there's no glass ceiling for women or for African Americans and economically or any other way when it's just a matter of fact; when no dog barks at a child because--or a person because they quote unquote "don't like Negroes" as my father [William D. Kindle] tells--used to tell the story.  You know, it's--we got a--we've come a long way, but I also recognize we have a long way to go and you just got to get out there and fight everyday for it.

Speaker 1: At this juncture, and you're not that old, but you do have grandchildren.  What would you consider at this juncture as, when you look at the things that you've done, as your legacy?
Speaker 2: As my legacy, I'd like--when I interview people, I always ask them--I try not to say when you die, what would you like written about you?  I would, I would like for people to say about me when I retire, or when I die ultimately, that I accepted them for who they were; I opened my heart and my experiences to them; and if I could help in any way, I did that.  And that's all.  I'd like for them to say, I taught my children well; I'd like for them to say I contributed somehow to society, and I did the best I could.  That's about it.
Story_ID: 154057
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything that you would do differently as you look back?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I've--so far, I've had a good life.  I'm looking forward to more of it; I like who I am; I feel I am terribly blessed to have the family that I've had and that I have, the friends that I have had and that I have; and, you know, I recently had an encounter where I was a little--no, more than a little bit.  I was edgy about feeling that I had gotten to where I am at my age of fifty-seven, and I had not achieved economically as I would like to.  And then I had an experience at a cocktail party with people who had achieved economically, and these were African Americans, who have certainly a lot more economically than I did; than I ever hope to have.  I wasn't looking for that much, and I looked at them and looked at what they talked about.  It was a pleasant encounter, okay; pleasant evening, but when I got back to my hotel room that night, you know, I thought I am so much better off than these people because I just felt that I had so much more to hold on to in terms of family, in terms of friends, in terms of--these people gave millions of dollars to institutions.  I can't do that.  I don't have millions of dollars, but I did go to a board meeting of the Family Tree here in which I serve, this morning, at eight o'clock to a planning committee meeting from eight to ten and that helps to--The Family Tree is an institution here, a private agency, that helps with child abuse and neglect and to eradicate that.  And I am very much involved in that.  I can't give them a million dollars, but I can go, I can make myself available to the community, I--you know, that is so much more satisfying to me than giving a million dollars.  And I am very lucky to have that opportunity and those experiences.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.

Speaker 1: Can you describe the people from left to right?  If you don't know all these people, which you probably don't know all this team.  Just describe the ones that ones that are--and the team and maybe the date, if you know the date.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I do know the date of that picture.
Speaker 1: All right.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: The date of that picture, it's the Brooklyn Giants.  It's before the Negro Baseball League was even incorporated, but this was one of the, I think, original teams.  My grandfather, William Horace Kindle, was a player on that team.  This picture was--he played with that team from 1915 to 1918, and this is a picture of my grandfather--I'm sorry, William Horace Kindle.  The person who gave me this picture was a dentist here in Baltimore [Maryland], and his name was Dr. Sykes [ph.], and this is--he's right here.  And he was a dentist and, apparently, from Mississippi and was a part--so my mother-in-law used to tell me of the Scottsboro Trials.  Scottsboro--
Speaker 1: The Scottsboro Boys, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and--but he became a dentist.  He lived here.  When he found who--my grandfather's last job was here.  Okay.  This is a picture of my great grandfather and his wife.  This is St. James Gilpin.  This is his wife, Cordelia Reese.  These are many--some of his children.  I, I'm not sure I can identify everybody on that picture.  This is--
Speaker 1: Maybe we can just--
Speaker 2: Okay.  No, I don't know who she is.  That is Bernette [ph.] Gilpin Ransom.  She died within the last year.  That was her grandchild.  That is my Uncle Bernie C.B. Gilpin; and that is, I believe, another son, Alfred.  And that is Zenobia Gilpin.
Speaker 1: So she was the doctor?
Speaker 2: She was the doctor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure who that woman is.  And that is my Uncle Bernie's wife, Aunt Alverta [ph.].  And--oh, I'm not sure who that one is.  That's St. James Gilpin, and I'm not sure who that woman is.  Okay.  That is another grandchild belonging to Bernard and Alverta; that's Cordelia and Lindell [ph.].  And that's Cordelia Reese Gilpin.  That is my grandfather, David Gilpin.  That is my Uncle Russell Gilpin, and that is my Uncle David Gilpin.  That is my grandmother, Nannie Burton Gilpin.  That is--oh, oh; I'm not sure.  That is Emily Gilpin Chambers.  That is Kate Gilpin Henderson, and that is Nellie Gilpin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what year was this picture taken, do you think?
Speaker 2: I know that my Uncle David was born in 1910, and my Uncle Russell was about two years later in 1912.  So--and my mother was born in 1916, and in fact she had a sister two years older than she and was born in 1914.  Now, my grandmother could've been pregnant with my Aunt Dorothy.  So this is either 1913 or 1914 as near as I can--no, you got to turn.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: No, that--it's right.  We scan them that way.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: It looks like it's wrong, but it's--
Speaker 1: Okay.  That is my brother, Billy Kindle and me with a Santa Claus and--at Miller and Roads.  And, indeed, my Uncle Oliver tells the story that even back in those days--this was, I think, my brother was even born, that Santa Claus came to--wanted to do something.  The Santa Claus who was a beautiful Santa Claus, so he came to my Uncle Oliver's house on Christmas Eve to see Dukie, and Dukie was so small that they said, Dukie really didn't appreciate it and so they brought him over to our house, and he says, it's the only time he seen me speechless (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, this is a picture of Virginia Johnson, my great grandmother, and she was the one that walked across Bay Bridge, supposedly, but walked from the eastern shore of Maryland to Baltimore when the Emancipation took place.
Speaker 1: These are my paternal grandparents, William Kindle and Ethel Johnson Kindle.  That was taken--I'm not sure when.  I think it was in the late '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: Now, this is a picture of my grandmother, Gilpin, and a copy of her wedding invitation, and she and my grandfather were married on June 17th, 1908 and this was not a wedding picture, obviously, but this was a picture of her from her school days when she was a teacher.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my mother, Evelyn Gilpin Kindle, and these were her four siblings at the time.  Another sibling, my Aunt Kitty [ph.] had not been born.  This is Dorothy Gilpin Riley, David Gilpin, Russell Gilpin and Joseph Gilpin.  And there was another one; Thelma, who they called Kitty who was born much later; maybe.
Speaker 2: This is at my son's [Keiffer Mitchell, Jr.] twenty-first birthday party.  This was in--when he was at Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia] in 1989 and--'88 [1988].  And this is our daughter, Kathy [Kathleen Mitchell].  That's my husband Keiffer [Mitchell, Sr.], our son, this is me, and this is our daughter, Kelly [Newhouse], who lives in Nashville [Tennessee] and has two children.
Speaker 1: I remember this well.  This is my husband [Keiffer Mitchell, Sr.] and me when we got married September of 1966.
Speaker 2: Where was that?
Speaker 1: This was in the backyard of my parent's home in Richmond [Virginia], Overbrook Road; 105 Overbrook Road.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Where is that colored picture?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Description here?
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is campaign literature of our son's campaign, and from just this September.  Just a few weeks ago.  This was a handout at the polls.
Speaker 2: Are you on one of these?  Who do we have here?
Speaker 1: Oh, that's my father and his sister.  Don't you have a picture of the children?  Can you get pictures?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can I get a description, please?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.  This is a picture of--no, it's not.  Can we take that out?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Keiffer Mitchell, Sr.:  That's my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's your grandfather.  I thought that was a picture of--
Speaker 2: UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  That's the first Keiffer.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: That looks just like your son.
Speaker 1: Keiffer Mitchell, Sr.:  My son was--
Speaker 2: Of Keiffer Albert Jackson, my husband's grandfather.
Speaker 1: Keiffer Mitchell, Sr.:  And this is Keiffer Jackson Mitchell--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Next?
Speaker 1: Now, this is a picture of my father, William [D.] Kindle and his sister, Margaret Kindle Lee; My Aunt Betty.  And my Aunt Betty was born in 1920, and it--I mean, my father was born in 1919, so this is obviously like a 1921 picture.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Next?
Speaker 1: I got that out of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Keiffer, look behind the buffet.  There's a whole thing of Kindle pictures.
Speaker 2: We got to go fast.
Speaker 1: Do you edit this part of it, or do you just let it go the way it is?
Speaker 2: Well, these pictures are utilized.  If you go to the left side, you'll see all the pictures used there.  Yeah.  The single frame is extracted for each of these still photos.  As far as the videotape, it doesn't get edited, no; but if you stream the interview and you stream all the way past to the end, you'll see the photos just as they're presented here.
Speaker 1: But no editing is done?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Our title picks it off, but putting it on the website (unclear). (Background conversations.)
Speaker 1: Radcliffe; that one.  They don't do documents.
Speaker 2: Next?
Speaker 1: This is my grandmother, Ethel Kindle; this is my Aunt Margaret Kindle Lee; my grandfather, William Kindle.  This is Frank Macklemore [ph.]; my father, Billy Kindle; my Aunt Emmy Kindle Macklemore.  She was married to Uncle Frank and this is, again, my great grandmother.
Speaker 2: Did you have a date for this?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  Well, I'm going to say it's about 1925.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Both of the sides of the family there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is a picture of Keiffer's and my wedding.  On the far left is my father-in-law and mother-in-law, Clarence and Juanita Mitchell and on the right, are my parents; Billy and Evelyn Kindle.
