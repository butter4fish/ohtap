Speaker 2: December the 31st, I believe it was 1905 [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: It sounds possible.  I know I saw her diploma from the business college [Henderson Business College, Memphis, Tennessee].  It was 1921, and you were born in '26 [1926], so I don't know.  That was probably--
Speaker 2: I think she was born in 1905.  I'm not certain of that though.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll say 1905 and put a question mark, but--.  All right, now--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Larry [Larry Crowe], caution her not to look at the lens or at me.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  She keeps her attention on you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  If--yeah, you should probably look at me rather than look at him or the lens, you know, because that way--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I have to move a little bit, but don't let that distract you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, are you--I was wondering if she--is she sitting comfortably?  She seems like she's sitting towards this way.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: All right, now, how far back can you trace your mother's family?  How far back can you go?
Speaker 2: Can I trace my mother's family?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Gee, I grew up with my mother's family.  I grew up with my grandparents who raised me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that as far back as--are there any stories about your mother's family that go beyond your grandparents, back to the 19th century or to the--any stories about slavery or Reconstruction or--?
Speaker 2: No.  My grandfather worked for the Illinois Central Railroad.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did he do?  Was he--
Speaker 2: What did he do?
Speaker 1: Yeah, for Illinois Central?
Speaker 2: Hauling and back in those days, he didn't have a railroad job.  He did freighting.  You know, if packages came in, he would pick them up and deliver them wherever they had to go.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was like a freight service for the Illinois Central?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay.  Now, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Brooks Perkins.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now what was your grandmother's name?

Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Not, not at all?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't recall them ever talking about it.
Story_ID: 639481
Speaker 1: Now is this the side of the family that has a tradition of having come from Mississippi, but not--we don't know when?
Speaker 2: My [maternal] grandfather's [Brooks Perkins] came, family came from Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They came from Kosciusko [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  I know where that is.  That's K-O-S-C--
Speaker 2: --I-U-S-
Speaker 1: Okay, U-S-C-O, right?
Speaker 2: Either C-O or K-O.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now my [maternal] grandmother's [Carrie Bailey Perkins] family, they seem to have generated here in Memphis [Tennessee] (laughter).  I don't know where they came from.
Speaker 1: Okay, they may have been here, you know, for a long, long time because Memphis was a, you know, thriving place before the Civil War (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My grandfather's family came from Kosciusko.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Yeah.  Any stories are passed down in the family about life here in Memphis?
Speaker 2: No, we--my grandfather, I told you worked for the Illinois Central Railroad.  And early on, he was always an industrious person, early on he established the business.  And all of my life, I remember growing up at home with a grocery store cause that's what they had, was a grocery store.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I guess we could have considered ourselves a little bit blessed, a little better off, you know.
Speaker 1: Was it fairly good sized store for those days?  Was it a good sized store for those days?
Speaker 2: The store was the front part of the house.  We had a pretty big sized house, and I can remember a living room, dining room, my brother's [Herschel Ramsey] bedroom, my bedroom, my grandparents' bedroom, kitchen, dining room and then there was a family room, more or less.  It was pretty good sized.
Speaker 1: Okay, was he here on the, you said, the South End of Memphis, what they call the South End?
Speaker 2: We lived on Kansas Street.
Speaker 1: On Kansas Street.
Speaker 2: Down near Parkway, South Parkway.
Story_ID: 639482
Speaker 1: Did your [maternal] grandmother [Carrie Bailey Perkins] have any stories about growing up or--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't recall.  Grandmother was always just taking care of us, the family, you know.  She ran the store during the daytime when my grandfather [Brooks Perkins] was at the railroad station.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, so your mother [DeLocha Perkins Herron] grew--did she grow up around the store?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she have a chance to go to school.  I know that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But where did she go?
Speaker 2: She went to public school in Memphis [Tennessee], and then she went to Henderson Business College [Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Now, what public school did she go to?
Speaker 2: They called it Kortrecht Intermediate School [Memphis, Tennessee]. I think that's the name, K-O-R-T-R-E-C-H-T, Kortrecht Intermediate School.
Speaker 1: Okay, intermediate school.  And then, now--
Speaker 2: She finished, you know, what was then high school there, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, at that school.  And then she went to--
Speaker 2: And then she went to Henderson Business College.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I know she came out in 1921 because I just saw the diploma, Henderson Business College, 1921.  So she was trained as a, as secretary or what did she train--what training did she get there?
Speaker 2: She took business subjects.
Speaker 1: All the business subjects?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, because I tried desperately to learn her form of shorthand, Pitman, and I couldn't.  It was too difficult for me to learn it.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: I had to take Gregg and be satisfied with it.
Speaker 1: And she taught at--what high school did she teach at?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I guess it was Kortrecht [Kortrecht High School; Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, I'm gonna--
Speaker 2: And then she taught at Henderson Business College.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 639483
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna stop her [Ramsey Shack's mother, DeLocha Perkins Herron] story right now, and I'm gonna go to your father's side of the family.  Can, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: I can give you his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nelson Ramsey [Royal Ramsey].
Speaker 1: And do you know his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he much older than your mother?  Do you, do you know?
Speaker 2: No, they were about the same age, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, you were saying off camera you didn't know a lot about him, right?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, so is there--
Speaker 2: He and my mother were separated when I was a young child.  I was only, you know, about four or five years old.
Speaker 1: And you have an older brother [Herschel Ramsey], right?
Speaker 2: He's three years older.
Speaker 1: So is there, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's no--okay.  So, but you knew, you said you had a picture of your grandmother on your father's side once, right?  Your grandmother--
Speaker 2: There was one around here.  Whether it's still around here, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Do you know what they did for a living or anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when they split up, did your father come back to see you or did he spend much time with the family?
Speaker 2: He would come and visit.  My father worked, I told you, for Illinois Central Railroad.  And we used to get great joy out of seeing him come at payday time to visit his kids.  He was very proud of his two children.  And he always came and brought money, and we were well pleased with that.  My grandparents on my mother's side [Carrie Bailey Perkins and Brooks Perkins] were not necessarily pleased (laughter) with it, you know.  But--
Speaker 1: So he, he worked for Illinois Central Railroad too (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 639484
Speaker 1: What kind of a person was he [Ramsey Shack's father, Royal Ramsey]?  Did you, did you--
Speaker 2: Jovial, good time guy, partying.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he liked to have a good time and partying, that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: That's how I remember him.
Speaker 1: And what kind of personality did your mother [DeLocha Perkins Herron] have?
Speaker 2: My mother was a studious, quasi extrovert (laughter).
Speaker 1: A quasi extrovert (laughter).  Okay.  What do you mean by that (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, she was a--first of all, my mother was a pianist.  She played the piano beautifully.  And people admired her a lot because she had this talent.  She played the piano at several of the churches that I remember our families were associated with.
Speaker 1: So you think that they--their personalities kind of clashed or something in terms of--she--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was more serious than he was.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: When you think about their personalities and their talents and their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I take after my mother.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, all right.  So you think you're more like she was?
Speaker 2: My brother takes after my father.  He looks like him, and he takes after him, the mannerisms of my father all over again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a good time boy.  He always loved to have good fun.
Speaker 1: Now, he recently--your brother recently passed--

Story_ID: 639485
Speaker 1: I just thought about, I didn't ask you a question when you gave your name.  Is there any, is there a story behind the Y in the spelling of Chrystine in your name?  Did you--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  It's just that I didn't want to spell it, C-H-R-I-S-T-I-N-E (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think I put the Y in it.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay, so you put the Y in Chrystine.  All right.  Well, tell me about growing up.  Now you--do you, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We lived on Kansas Street right at the head Waldorf [Avenue].  And it was only a block away from the public, public school that I went to.  And I was always under very strict supervision, you know.  My [maternal] grandmother [Carrie Bailey Perkins] could see me leave the door and enter the door to the, at Florida Street School [Memphis, Tennessee].  So I couldn't get into any trouble because she was--had eyes poised to tell me when I got home what I did.  And I was, I guess I was a rather studious youngster--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and rather restricted, very restricted in what I could and could not do.
Story_ID: 639486
Speaker 1: Now was, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because my mother [DeLocha Perkins Herron] played the piano, remember, at church.  And if she went, we went, at least I did.  My brother [Herschel Ramsey] didn't necessarily go, but I did.  And so it became a part of my life, we went to the Baptist churches in South Memphis [Memphis, Tennessee].  I remember going to Rock of Ages [Rock of Ages Baptist Church], down Kirk [Avenue], Bethlehem [Bethlehem Baptist Church] down on Ingle [Avenue] and when I got older, I went to Salem, Salem Gilfield [Salem Gilfield Baptist Church] which was at Florida [Street] and Iowa [Iowa Avenue; E.H. Crump Boulevard].  Those are the only churches I remember going to.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your mother would play in different churches, and it wasn't always at the same one?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was she considered (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, perhaps she had a contract here for this year, and one for another--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --place another year.  We were at Bethlehem longer than we were at any other place.
Story_ID: 639487
Speaker 1: Now can you describe for us the neighborhood you lived in and, and give us some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: The neighborhood I lived on, I lived on Kansas Street, about a--two or three blocks down from Parkway [South Parkway] at the head of Waldorf [Avenue] and Kansas.  It was strictly a residential neighborhood.  It was not a, you know, it was a family kind of living quarters.
Speaker 1: It wasn't a commercial neighborhood.
Speaker 2: No, there were lots of businesses there because my [maternal] grandfather [Brooks Perkins] had a grocery there, and there was other stores and things there too.  But that wasn't the focus of it, family more or less.  It was there to, of course, to make money, but I think it enhanced our lives, you know, more than anything else.  We, by having the grocery store, we didn't have to go out to get too many things.  We had them all at home, you know.
Story_ID: 639488
Speaker 1: You grew up during the Depression, right, what they call the Great Depression?
Speaker 2: When was the Depression?  I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nineteen--well, 1929 to 19--I guess 'til the war [World War II, WWII].
Speaker 2: I don't know anything about it.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, in 1929 the stock market crash and all that, you know.
Speaker 2: I don't know anything about it.  (Laughter) We didn't, we didn't suffer anything from--really, I don't remember anything about the stock market.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Laughter) All right.  You were born in '26 [1926], that's, you know, seven years after the Depression started.  So you know, what they called the Great Depression era, but--
Speaker 2: We--I don't remember going through what they called the Depression, you know, because as I said, we had the grocery store.  We had all the food you wanted, and we--I don't remember ever wanting for anything, you know.  We were really kind of well off more or less, I guess.  When it came to toys and things like that, we never had to beg for them.  You know, when the season came, we got them.  I don't, I don't remember the Depression.  I really don't.
Story_ID: 639489
Speaker 1: What kind of items did you sell--were sold in the store?  I mean--
Speaker 2: In the store?
Speaker 1: Did, did--
Speaker 2: Bread, milk, syrup, molasses, hominy grits, meats.  I'm trying to think, had a huge candy display case.  I can remember that because I was always sneaking in there taking some of it.  I'm trying to think what else did we sell in the store.  They sold charcoal--
Speaker 1: Canned goods and--
Speaker 2: Canned goods, yes, because that's when I learned to eat hominy, big round, white balls of--ever seen hominy?
Speaker 1: I can't--don't think so.  Probably not--
Speaker 2: You don't know what hominy is?
Speaker 1: I know it's a corn product, right?
Speaker 2: It's white, and it's about that size (gesture), and round and it was very good.  I liked it.  And we had corn, green beans, sweet potatoes, onions.  I can't remember anything that we didn't have in the store.  We didn't have to go anyplace to get anything, except the only thing we ever had to go anyplace to get anything was maybe sometimes we'd have to go and get different kinds of meat, you know.  And we'd go up on Florida Street [Memphis, Tennessee] to the stores up there and get that.  But we really, didn't get that too much.  We had just about everything we needed, you know, at home.
Story_ID: 639490
Speaker 1: Now, did people keep gardens in Memphis [Tennessee] then, you know, in their backyards a lot or did they depend on the store?
Speaker 2: For a short time, we had a garden, but my [maternal] grandfather [Brooks Perkins] worked, I told you, at Illinois Central Railroad, and he didn't have time to be doing any gardening.  And my mother [DeLocha Perkins Herron] wasn't gonna do any gardening (laughter), and my grandfather wasn't gonna do any gardening.  We didn't do too much gardening.  We did have a garden though.  I remember that.  And we had--part of our backyard was in the, one, two, three, four different sections, right behind the house, immediate- immediately behind the house was a fruit section, peaches and pears and figs and stuff like that right behind the house.  And opposite that was where we had the car and my grandpa's wagon and behind that was where we had the horse.  We had a horse.  And opposite that part where the horse was we had a cow too, for a while, I remember.  Well, opposite that was where they had the little tiny garden that they, that they had.  That, it was small.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very small.  We didn't have time for gardening.
Story_ID: 639491
Speaker 1: I want you to tell me some of that again because we were--I asked you about what the horse was used for, and you told me that--well, I asked you if it was used for a wagon and you took umbrage to that--
Speaker 2: Grandpa [Ramsey Shack's maternal grandfather, Brooks Perkins] used the horse to, for the drayage business.  That's the only thing why we had the horse for.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, and you--
Speaker 2: He would park down at the Illinois Central Railroad, Calhoun Street [Calhoun Street Station, Memphis, Tennessee], and when trains would come in and other drayage companies would come and bring stuff, he would pick them up and deliver them in the city wherever they had to be delivered because those big companies didn't deliver those things back in those days.  He would put it on his wagon and deliver it to wherever it had to go.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said you had two cars in your backyard, and your mother [DeLocha Perkins Herron] was the only one that could drive?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, my uncle [Willie Perkins] lived with us part time.  And he was always wrecking a car, always wrecking a car.
Speaker 1: Well, cars were less expensive in those days than they are now.  Cars were less expensive then than they are now, I think--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, sure, funny looking too.
Speaker 1: Had the big wheels and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you have a Model T [Ford Model T] or Model A [Ford Model A] or what?
Speaker 2: I think that's a Model T that my mother is sitting in on that picture on the wall.  But we mostly had Chevys [Chevrolet] as they called them (laughter).  I remember when I got older, we had a Nash (unclear).  I don't remember any other car we had.
Story_ID: 639492
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna get back to the question I was asking before we got kind of sidetracked.  But what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of growing?
Speaker 1: Of growing up, yeah.  Things you'd see or smell or hear in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: We lived in a pretty decent neighborhood.  We didn't have too much, you know, tomfoolery going on.  There was a scattered, a beer garden, as they called them in those days, here and there.  But we weren't allowed to go anywhere near them.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the neighborhood you lived in?  Did it have a name?  Did they call it something?
Speaker 2: No.  Just, I lived on Kansas Street, but it wasn't no--
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's on the south side of Memphis [Tennessee] or you said--
Speaker 2: When you go out Parkway, South Parkway, and get over near Florida [Street]--I don't know whether you're familiar with that part of Memphis, you're in South Memphis then.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, continue telling us about the sights and sounds and smells.
Speaker 2: It was a decent neighborhood.  As I can recall, there was only one or two businesses where they, where they sold beer or something like that.  Even--it was a nice neighborhood.  You didn't run into, you know, undesirables more or less.  And the--where we lived at Kansas and Burdock [Avenue] and Waldorf [Avenue], those were pretty decent streets, you know.  There weren't, there weren't any funny smells and odors and what not (laughter).  We lived in a pretty decent neighborhood.
Story_ID: 639493
Speaker 1: Were there a lot of kids in your neighborhood, growing up, a lot of other children?
Speaker 2: There might have been, but I wasn't allowed to get out and run around and play with them (laughter).  There might have been.  So, no, there weren't a lot of, weren't a lot of kids in my neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although there was a public school right nearby.  It was first through eighth grade and my parents [DeLocha Perkins Herron and Royal Ramsey] were kind of strict.  I wasn't allowed to, you know, just run out in the street and associate with any old scuttlebutt, you know.  You just didn't do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did the, did the children come to your store after school--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and get candy and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: They came on their way to school and on their way home from school, uh-huh.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I know a lot of stores in those days had one of the few radios around.  Did you have a radio in the store?
Speaker 2: We had a radio in the house.  I don't remember a radio in the, in store.  We had one in the house.  And there was a sitting room, was right behind the store.  There was a big room in the house that was just for relaxing, you know, you--so then when a customer would come in, you'd get up from this room and go and wait on the patron.  No, we didn't have a whole of children visiting there, not at my house.  My parents were kind of selective of who (laughter), who we visited and who visited us.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you feel about that?  Were you lonely?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or did you think--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  No, unh-uh.
Story_ID: 639494
Speaker 1: So as a, as a little girl when you were growing, how did you spend most of your time because you, you know, you say you were kind of restricted, but what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: What did I like to do?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Play the piano.  Got that habit from my mother [DeLocha Perkins Herron], of course.  I wasn't a scuttlebutt.  We didn't, my brother [Herschel Ramsey] was just the opposite from me.  He was the one who would always, ripping here and there and beyond, not me though.  I was brought up completely differently.
Speaker 1: Now, you say your household consisted of your [maternal] grandparents [Carrie Bailey Perkins and Brooks Perkins] and your mother and your--
Speaker 2: And my brother and me.
Speaker 1: And your brother, okay.  All right.  So did you spend a lot of time with your grandmother and your--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yep.
Speaker 1: Was she around more than your mother was?
Speaker 2: No, they were both there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Grandma was there because the grocery was there, and she ran it in the daytime.  And my mother was there because she lived there, but when she went to work, she wasn't, of course, wasn't there.  But grandma was always there.  She was the lady of the house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She did the cooking and the, whatever had to be done, you know, feeding us.  And my mother was out at her job, wherever it was, teaching or playing the piano or doing something, you know.  My mother was a quasi invalid.  And as a, as a result, her parents kind of spoiled her.
Speaker 1: What was she--
Speaker 2: She was crippled.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And she was really kind of spoiled and ruined.
Speaker 1: Now, what was wrong with her?  I know I see--there's a picture of her teaching school.  She's standing up and everything, but she has--
Speaker 2: There was something wrong with one of her legs.  I don't remember what it was.  But she was crippled.  And how she got that way, I don't know.  But she walked with a limp.
Speaker 1: She could get around pretty good, but she had a limp?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She could play that piano (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, did she ever play any music other than church music?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Story_ID: 639495
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about school?  Now where did--what was the name of the school that you started?
Speaker 2: I went to Florida Street elementary school [Florida Street School, Memphis, Tennessee].  And from there I went to Booker Washington High School [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee].  And from Booker Washington I went to Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, I wanna stop here and back up and go (laughter), go back to Florida Street elementary school.  Now this is--now, I'm asking questions, and it may seem like they're obvious, but, you know, this is for history.  So I have to ask you like this was--was this an all-black school, a segregated school?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All the schools in Memphis [Tennessee] were completely, you know, separate then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this was a public school, but it's just for the black children--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --or the colored children.  Now how many students were in the--or was it a large school?
Speaker 2: First through eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at least two or three classes of each one.
Speaker 1: Now was it close by?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I lived on Kansas Street, which was, let's say here, and this is Waldorf [Avenue] and I went straight up Waldorf one block, and Florida School was at the head of--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it was very close.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: No, I was just a brainy child, I guess.  I did everything.  I was the principal's pet, teacher's pet, everything.  I really was (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you, did you try very hard to please the teacher or were you--
Speaker 2: I didn't have to, you know.  They recognized whatever talents I had, and I didn't have to try hard.
Speaker 1: Well, what were your major talents?  What were your major talents?
Speaker 2: What are my major talents?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I told you I played the piano.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember having any other talents.  I didn't do any domestic work at home.
Speaker 1: Now, why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Why didn't you do any domestic work at home?
Speaker 2: 'Cause Grandma [Ramsey Schack's maternal grandmother, Carrie Bailey Perkins] and my mother [DeLocha Perkins Herron] did that.  I didn't do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, a lot of children, you know, a lot of parents want to make sure their children do some chores so they know what--
Speaker 2: I didn't have to do that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I would help out in the store occasionally, but that's all.
Story_ID: 639496
Speaker 1: Did your mother [DeLocha Perkins Herron] teach you how to play the piano or did you have a piano instructor?
Speaker 2: No, I had another teacher.  Her name was Mrs. Coats [ph.], I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have--were there any special teachers in school that you--well, you were the teacher's pet, but who was your favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had a favorite teacher in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had one in elementary school [Florida Street School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Who was the one in elementary school first?
Speaker 2: Carlotta Stewart [ph.] was my fourth grade teacher, and I loved her.  And in high school, Dora Todd was my high school teacher.  And I'd do anything in the world for Dora Todd.
Speaker 1: It's Tart, T-A-R-T?  Is it her--her last name is T-A-R--
Speaker 2: T-O-D-D.
Speaker 1: T-O- Todd, okay, all right, Dora, D-O-R-A Todd.
Speaker 2: Dora E. Todd.
Speaker 1: Okay, Todd, okay.
Story_ID: 639497
Speaker 1: Were you in organized activities in grade school [Florida Street School, Memphis, Tennessee], clubs and things like that?
Speaker 2: I was in the drum and bugle corps.  And I was in the--every year they'd have what they called extravaganza in every class.  First through twelfth grade would give some kind of dance recital.  And you had to be in that.  I don't remember being in anything else.
Speaker 1: And did you run for any offices in grade school?
Speaker 2: Not in grade school, we didn't.  When I got to high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee] I ran for office.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a lot of friends in grade school?
Speaker 2: In grade school?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: No, not necessarily.  Unh-uh.  I guess it was, you would just--that we were a little more fortunate than the other kids in the neighborhood, and it kind of made us separate and distinct, you know.  I didn't, I didn't have a lot of, no, I didn't have a lot of friends in grade school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you have a best friend in grade school?
Speaker 2: It's been so long ago, I couldn't rem- can't remember that now, that I did or didn't have a--I can remember in high school I had some special friends.  But I don't, I don't remember necessarily having any special friends in grade school.
Story_ID: 639498
Speaker 1: Well, let's go to high school.  Now you went to Booker T. Washington High School [Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you were telling me there were only two high schools really that black people went to?
Speaker 2: Just two, Booker Washington and Manassas [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I understand, and I always wondered this, and maybe you can tell me.  I've been to Memphis [Tennessee] before, and I can see where Booker T. Washington was named, you know, as a black school, but what does Manassas have to do with black people?
Speaker 2: Don't ask me.  We had nothing to do with Manassas.  They were nobody as far as we were concerned.  I have no idea where they came from or what they did.
Speaker 1: Did--which high school was the first high school for black students?
Speaker 2: Booker Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  That wasn't the first one.  Kortrecht [Kortrecht High School; Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee] was the first one.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But by the time I came along, Kortrecht was no longer in existence.  My mother [DeLocha Perkins Herron] went to Kortrecht.
Speaker 1: Right, that's the one you were telling us about.  So, okay, Booker T. Washington High School, and you got good grades and you go in there and everything.  Now did you run for class office at Booker T. Washington High School?
Speaker 2: We didn't have that when we were in high school (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, class president or--
Speaker 2: No, I don't recall us having that.
Speaker 1: Okay, did--
Speaker 2: See, you're younger, much younger than I am.  We didn't have class officers.
Speaker 1: Well, any organized clubs in high school?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You know what, Ms. Shack [HistoryMaker Chrystine Ramsey Shack], unwind your cable a little because you're starting to pull it--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Did we have what?
Speaker 1: Did you have any organized clubs in high school like chess clubs, Spanish club or that kind of stuff?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: I had drum and bugle corps, and I had the academic club, you know.  We, if you made certain grades you were in this group.  If you didn't make it, you weren't in.  I can't remember any other clubs we had.
Speaker 1: So it was like a honors club for the--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --for the best students.
Story_ID: 639499
Speaker 1: Now your favorite teacher, what did she teach, Ms. Dora--
Speaker 2: Business.
Speaker 1: --Dora Todd?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Business.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So would you help her during class like a good teacher's pet does?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  There was a little scuttlebutt about Dora Todd and my father [Royal Ramsey].  They were pretty good friends.  So that made me kind of like a pet, you know, to Dora.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you think that was true, pretty much that they were friends?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was true.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So she had a special interest in you?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And, okay.  So, now when you were in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee], had you--were your aspirations then to do something in business?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you think your growing up in a store, you know, with a store in the house had something to do with--
Speaker 2: No, that had nothing to do with it.  I just wanted to be a business teacher.  My mother [DeLocha Perkins Herron] had something to do with it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you wanted to teach business rather than have a business?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 639500
Speaker 1: Now you were in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee] in the '30s [1930s] or the late '30s [1930s], early '40s [1940s], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Forty-three [1943].
Speaker 1: Yeah, you graduated--
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you graduated in 1943.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is there anything special about graduation you can share with us?
Speaker 2: I was an honor student.  I was--there were four hundred and some kids in my class, and I was number four of the four hundred.  That's all I remember about it.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to make a speech at commencement or--
Speaker 2: No.  I don't remember that we had that then.
Speaker 1: So you don't know if you had a--well, was there a--
Speaker 2: A valedictorian or--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I don't remember that.  I know I was an honor graduate.
Speaker 1: Now how did, how did the war affect you when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: What war?
Speaker 1: World War II [WWII].
Speaker 2: I don't know about a war.
Speaker 1: It didn't make much difference then?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You know, the United States was at war with Germany and Japan when you were in high school.
Speaker 2: They were?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am, starting in--
Speaker 2: I don't know nothing about it.
Speaker 1: Starting in '41 [1941], right, you know, that's when the U.S. entered the war.
Speaker 2: I remember, the only thing I remember about the war is that my brother [Herschel Ramsey] was at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and he had to come out and go into the [U.S. military] service for a short time.  But I don't know anything about the war.
Speaker 1: It really didn't have much affect on you?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Now, did you read the papers in those days a lot or any at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 639501
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, when you were on the verge of graduating from high school, what were your prospects?  What did you want to do when you graduated?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is a good story.  I know, I was reading, tell it again.  Now when--did you get any counseling from any of your teachers or counselors about how to go to college or how to get in?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, just packed up my clothes, got on the train and went to Ohio.
Speaker 1: Now there were--
Speaker 2: They didn't even expect me.
Speaker 1: Now wait a minute now.  You said that your mother [DeLocha Perkins Herron] told you there was a group going to Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio], right--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --on the train?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now were they from Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  There were about eight of us who went to Wilberforce that year.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: They were already registered?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were registered.  I wasn't.  They were.
Speaker 1: Well, how did it--well, how do you suppose--when you look back on it--
Speaker 2: Well, we knew that all we had to do was show them a transcript, and when we got there and showed them the transcript, we knew we were, we were accepted.  I told you I was fourth in the class of four hundred and some people.  So they weren't gonna turn me down.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, but the other girls had already applied?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you were the only one that hadn't applied, right?
Speaker 2: I had not applied.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had never heard of Wilberforce.
Speaker 1: Now let me ask the question, Dr. Mickens [HistoryMaker Ronald Mickens] asked you earlier too, why didn't you go into LeMoyne-Owen [LeMoyne College; LeMoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't want to go to no local school (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, or Lane [Lane College, Jackson, Tennessee] or one of the other--
Speaker 2: I didn't wanna go there either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was not even a registered almost.  Lane wasn't hardly heard of.
Speaker 1: Or Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], you weren't thinking about.
Speaker 2: I didn't wanna go to Nashville [Tennessee].  It's too close to home.
Speaker 1: So you didn't know where Wilberforce was, but you were on your way?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 639502
Speaker 1: Tell us about that experience.  Now when you got there, what did they say?  You just, you--
Speaker 2: I remember going into the registrar's office.  Her name was Gladys Powell [ph.], and I said to her, "My name is Ethel Ramsey [HistoryMaker Chrystine Ramsey Shack], and I am here from Memphis [Tennessee].  My mother [DeLocha Perkins Herron] sent me." Not only did my mother send me, my mother went with me.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: She was out there on the campus somewhere sitting down.  So they found her and they said, "Well, do you have a transcript?"  "Yes, I have a transcript.  Here it is," and I gave it to them and they looked at it, and they said, "Oh, my god, yes, we want her."
Speaker 1: So it was simple as that?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now was paying for school an issue?
Speaker 2: No, I told you my [maternal] grandfather [Brooks Perkins] had a drayage business and he had the grocery store.  We didn't have problems with money, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my brother [Herschel Ramsey] was at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  We didn't any problem with that at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The only problem we had was my brother at Tuskegee was, he was a ne'er do well and wanted to cut classes and what not.
Speaker 1: Did he graduate from Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  No.
Speaker 1: So what did he end up doing for a living?
Speaker 2: Working for the railroad.
Speaker 1: Did he work as a porter or as a--?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know what he did for them.  He was grown then, had gone out to California, I believe, by that time.  I don't know what he did, but he didn't, he didn't finish Tuskegee.
Story_ID: 639503
Speaker 1: Did you choose a major right away at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I knew what I was gonna do when I went there.
Speaker 1: Well, what was that?
Speaker 2: Business.
Speaker 1: Okay, business, okay.  Now when you were there, the president of Wilberforce was--
Speaker 2: Wesley, Charles Wesley [Charles H. Wesley].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dr. Charles Wesley.  And the--now Wilberforce is an African Methodist Episcopal school--
Speaker 2: So they tell me.  I'm not an A.M.E. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't really know that either when you went?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm an Episcopalian (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, now, well, tell me how did you like the campus?  What was the campus like?  Where was it located and--
Speaker 2: I haven't been there in years, but when I did go back, it didn't change too much except they did get a few new buildings.  But I can still recognize Bundy Hall and O'Neil Hall and Mitchell Hall, Galloway Hall, they were all still there and looked the same.  Shorter Hall was there.  I understand it's not there anymore.  I said, O'Neil, didn't I?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Carnegie Library [Wilberforce, Ohio] was there.  We were real proud of that.
Speaker 1: And that's still there.
Speaker 2: But I don't think too much has changed.  They had a lot of temporary buildings put up on the extreme side of the campus.  And I wouldn't even recognize those buildings necessarily cause I spent my whole lifetime at Wilberforce at Shorter Hall because I was an out of state student.  And out of state students lived at Shorter Hall.  If you were from Ohio, you lived at (unclear) Hall.  And we'd--just didn't have anything to do with people who were from Ohio.  You know, we didn't (laughter).
Story_ID: 639504
Speaker 1: So tell us why you didn't associate with Ohio people?
Speaker 2: I don't know (laughter).  I really don't know.  We, I think they probably had a snobbishness about them that we steered clear of.  And we were paying healthy tuition, and they would come as state students, and their tuitions were cheaper than ours.  And we just didn't have too much to do with the state students.
Speaker 1: Now I guess it's time to kind of explain this too that at the time you were going to Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio], it was largely subsidized by the State of Ohio which created a crisis at the time of your graduation where the school actually split from the--church side split away from--
Speaker 2: At my commencement.
Speaker 1: At the commencement.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, let's not get there yet, but so that--is it--would you say then that the people from Memphis [Tennessee] stayed together sort of?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were out of state people.   And we didn't have too much to do with the state students.  We really didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you spend most of your time on the campus itself or in Xenia [Ohio] or?
Speaker 2: Until--I lived on campus until my junior and senior years, I believe.  I lived on campus until my junior and senior years.  And I lived with a family down on the highway doing into Xenia.
Speaker 1: Okay, on 42, yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know what--
Speaker 1: It's [U.S.] Route 42.
Speaker 2: She was the librarian, and I lived with Johnese Pickens.  I remember her name now.  And prior to that time, I was--my first three years I lived on campus.  But the fourth year I didn't live on campus.
Story_ID: 639505
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned librarians, and one of the great black women authors and historians was there on campus when you were there.  And he was--she was in her last years.  Do you remember Hallie Q. Brown [Hallie Quinn Brown]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you tell us something about her?
Speaker 2: No, except that she was old when I first met her and old when I last met her (laughter).  No, I don't remember anything about her.  She did walk, do a lot of walking around.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she was still walking around.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  But I don't remember anything too much about her.
Speaker 1: Did she ever make any public speeches or any--
Speaker 2: I don't remember her doing so.
Speaker 1: Okay, did the, did the, did the people on campus make--
Speaker 2: I think I remember for a time living with the president and his wife, maybe.  She didn't live--she lived right across the street from, like Bundy Hall, you remember where that was?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: She lived right up in that area.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she had a place called Homewood Cottage [Wilberforce, Ohio], I think it was called.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But, okay.  I thought I'd ask about her.  What about some of the--did you have favorite teachers and professors at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] or other people that you think were outstanding people there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had an English teacher that I thought was wonderful.  Her name was Jackson [ph.].  I remember her, and I thought she was very good.  And she was--I thought she was from the Ohio area, but she had a distinct southern accent.  And we had a couple who worked there at the time, and I'm trying to remember their names, Mack--I think the last name was McDonald, and his wife was named Jessie [Jessie McDonald (ph.)].  Both were in the English department.  I remember them as being very distinguished then.  I'm trying to remember, Dr. Milton Wright was there at the time, and he was an extremely good economics teacher.
Story_ID: 639506
Speaker 1: What was your social life like at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?  Now, here you are--
Speaker 2: What was--What life?
Speaker 1: Your social life like at Wilberforce?
Speaker 2: My social life?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: We didn't have too much of a social life when I was in school, you know, other than sorority and I guess that was, that was about the limitation of our social life.  I would sometimes go over to Dayton [Ohio].  I had some close friends who lived over there, and I'd go over there to visit them.  But other than that, and you didn't go off campus too much.  You, when you went off campus, you went into Xenia [Ohio], and that's about as far as you got.
Speaker 1: Now, did you, when you went into Dayton, did you go in to see musical productions and things like that?
Speaker 2: No, I went to see people, visiting.
Speaker 1: People, okay.  Now, were you interested in music I mean beside--did you play gospel piano too?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You didn't?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: What mode or what kind of music did you play?
Speaker 2: I just played whatever was in the songbook hymn.  It didn't matter.  I didn't play that well (laughter).
Story_ID: 639507
Speaker 1: Now, did, did you have like convocations and that sort of thing at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] where speakers would show up and--
Speaker 2: Who would show up?
Speaker 1: Special speakers and lecturers and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, that came along with your days, not mine.
Speaker 1: Well, no, they--I know they did at some places, at some schools, lots of schools.  I'd be very surprised if they didn't have anybody of national stature, black or otherwise, come through Wilberforce.  But nobody came through to speak when you were there?
Speaker 2: I don't recall it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, well, tell us a little bit about--
Speaker 2: All we, all we saw, somebody special was Reverdy Ransom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, those A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] ministers come to bless us out or to reprimand us about something, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you ever get in trouble?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I didn't think so, but I--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when they came, they came and they lectured to the whole school.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Yeah, Reverdy Ransom at the time, was he bishop of the entire A.M.E. church?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Old and decrepit and evil.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was his reputation amongst the students?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And his descendants are still there at Wilberforce, doing things.
Speaker 2: I don't know whether he has any there.  He had a daughter-in-law who was there, I remember.  She taught English, but I don't remember anybody else being there.  Yeah, he had a son there too, come to think of it.  He did have a son there.  And he was known as a kind of ne'er do well, um-hm.
Story_ID: 639508
Speaker 1: So you majored in business, and by 1947 you were ready to graduate.  Is there any other story about Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] you wanna talk about before we have you go to graduation?
Speaker 2: I majored in business, I minored in English.
Speaker 1: Now did you take very much science in school or any science?
Speaker 2: I think, I think I remember being in a freshman or sophomore science class.  I took--I didn't take biology.  I took chemistry, and there's something else I took that was scientific.  Maybe it was something like physics, but I didn't take anything that had to do with bugs and worms and all that kind of stuff.  I didn't deal with that.  That wasn't my field.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, well, tell us about the dramatic graduation from Wilberforce because there's a drama associated with it, so--
Speaker 2: Well, I remember distinctly that we were in Galloway Hall, that's where it was--shouldn't--no, we were back in Shorter Hall, Shorter Hall.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was an auditorium there.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, right on the main floor.  And Reverdy Ransom [Reverdy C. Ransom] was up there lecturing us about something.  And it wasn't necessarily kind, you know.  It was--that's when he had announced that Dr. Wesley [Charles H. Wesley] would no longer be, you know, the president.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dr. Charles Wesley, right?
Speaker 2: And when he made that announcement, that's when we all erupted, you know.  What do you mean he's not gonna be the president?  Who's gonna be it, you?  We don't want you, you know.  They started to answering him right back in very belligerent terms.  Well, if he's not gonna be the president, why are we sitting in here for commencement, you know?  And you have to sit here.  Your parents paid for you to go to school here, and you've come to the state now where you have finished your work, and you are getting your degrees.  And you can't go anyplace.  You have to be here.  We, "Don't tell us we can't go anyplace."  We would simply retaliate.  Everything he said, we responded, you know, in the negative kind of way because we will be here, and we will have commencement.  And I think we even told him that he wouldn't necessarily conduct it (laughter).  And we stood up as a class, as a whole, and on cue, somebody gave the cue, and said, "Let's go.  If we're not gonna have commencement, let's go."  We stood up in Shorter Hall and just walked out.  And he started yelling, "Come back here, come back here.  You won't get your degrees."  "We'll get them.  Our mothers and fathers paid for them.  We don't have to worry about it.  We'll get them."  So we kept walking and walked on out the back door.  And walked right over to--I remember there was a woman who was the dean of the students, students at the time.  Her name was Elizabeth Anderson [Elizabeth Mossell Anderson].  And she was, she was a kind of forceful kind of lady, you know, who kind of had her way, more or less.  And she was going to capture us and bring us back.  And we told Ms. Anderson, "You better get out the way, before you get hurt, seriously hurt, 'cause we're not going back."  "Well, you won't get your degree."  "Yes, we will.  We'll get it.  Don't you worry about it.  Let us worry about it."  And since our parents were there, we knew very well, we were gonna get it.  And we turned right around pointed at them. "We worked for them, we earned them, and so you go in there and tell 'em, and you paid for 'em.  We want those degrees, and that's it."  And I don't remember how, necessarily how we got them, but we did get them.  And--
Speaker 1: Did you get them before you left the campus?
Speaker 2: Sure, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, what did your--was your mother [DeLocha Perkins Herron] there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what did she think about it, about this?
Speaker 2: Well, I think all the parents were just kind of shocked, you know, that they had some bold and brazen children who would pull a stunt like that.  But they also knew that we had been mistreated, and we had to retaliate.
Story_ID: 639509
Speaker 1: I know on the state level, the state had an economic issue with the school and pulled the state funds back to the stuff that they had constructed and divided--so the campus ended up being divided, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to a state side which became Central State [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] stayed with the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.  But what were the issues that the students had and were concerned about?
Speaker 2: The students didn't have any issues.  Reverdy Ransom [Reverdy C. Ransom] had issues.
Speaker 1: Well, what--
Speaker 2: We didn't have any.
Speaker 1: Well, what were his issues and causing of the contention?
Speaker 2: His issues were with Charles Wesley [Charles H. Wesley].  Wesley was too popular.  People liked him and students liked him, and that was his problem.  Now there might have been some financial issues that related to the school, but we didn't know about that.  All we knew was that he didn't want Charles Wesley there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But Wesley is a very, is well known now as a colleague of Carter G. Woodson, you know, and president of Wilberforce and then Central State.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, author of several books.  So the students were basically just defending Charles Wesley?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So were you surprised when the school split up at that--after he left?
Speaker 2: No.  Unh-uh.  And I was even surprised at the state it's in now because they're still two separate entities, you know.  I'm not surprised that they didn't go back together again because if Wesley was going to remain there at the state side, and they wanted him there--the church wasn't gonna accept him or Reverdy Ransom wasn't gonna accept him.  So it didn't surprise us at all.
Story_ID: 639510
Speaker 1: Now after you graduated from Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio], what did you do next?
Speaker 2: What did I do when I graduated?  I'm trying to remember my first job.
Speaker 1: Oh, I know it.  I can-- (laughter).
Speaker 2: My first job might well have been at Wilberforce.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, assistant to the bursar, right?  Now was this your senior year or after you graduated?
Speaker 2: My senior year and my junior year, I worked in the bursar's office.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, this is 1947, and for those who are watching this, she graduated in 1947 from Wilberforce.
Speaker 2: What was that?
Speaker 1: You graduated in 1947.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that same year, 1947, you went to Hampton University [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hampton, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And there, what did you do at Hampton?
Speaker 2: Secretary to the dean of student.
Speaker 1: Right.  So how did you like that campus?  Did you compare the two campuses (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you like it better than Wilberforce?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it--did it seem to be less--well, I know there was contentious situation at Wilberforce, but--
Speaker 2: There was nothing wrong at Hampton.  Everything was--Hampton was also integrated.  As long as I can remember Hampton, it was always an integrated school.  The faculty was both black and white.
Speaker 1: Well, that's different from Wilberforce?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't realize that.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So Wilberforce was all black in terms of the--
Speaker 2: I don't ever remember seeing anybody who was anything other than black.  I tell you tell you, the A.M.E.'s [African Methodist Episcopal] ran it (laughter).  So they had all their people there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now who was president of Hampton when you were there?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Who was president?  For a while, Alonzo Moron [Alonzo G. Moron] was the president.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But before Moron was there, there was another man [Ralph P. Bridgman].  I can't remember his name now.  But there was someone else there too.
Story_ID: 639511
Speaker 1: Now, did you meet your husband at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's something that we didn't talk about at Wilberforce and it's very important.  So when did you meet, and tell us how, how, how you met your husband, and did you get married when you were still in Ohio or--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I met him my, oh, it wasn't my freshman year.  I think it was about my junior year that I met him.  And we went to a football game in Chicago [Illinois], and he had access to a car.  I don't know what--remember whether it was his car or somebody else's car.  But the car couldn't go to Chicago unless I went with him.  And two of his friends wanted to go on this trip to Chicago.  They went, but they couldn't go unless I went along, you know, and took care of the business end of the deal.  And it was then that I met him.  I wasn't going with him then.  I think as a result of the trip, we might have started going together, one of those things.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what's your husband's name?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: Arthur.
Speaker 1: Arthur, okay, Arthur Shack, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what--what's his background?  Where was he from?
Speaker 2: New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay, was he from Trenton [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We went to Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] together.  We got our doctorates together at the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's in 1973, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You get your doctorate.  But, okay, I just wanted to establish where he was from because when you leave Hampton [Virginia], you go to New Jersey.  And I wondered why you went to New Jersey, but now I know.  It's because (laughter) your husband is from New Jersey, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 639512
Speaker 1: So in 1948, you went to Bordentown manual training school [Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth] in Bordentown, New Jersey--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --where you were secretary to the superintendent.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now that's near Trenton [New Jersey], I suppose that's where--.  Now did you like living in New Jersey?
Speaker 2: I liked--loved New Jersey, uh-huh, um-hm.  I wanted to go back there when we retired, but he [Ramsey Shack's husband, Arthur Shack] wanted to come to Memphis [Tennessee], so that's how we ended up here.  I loved Trenton.  I really did.
Speaker 1: Well, that's unusual because he's from New Jersey and you're from Memphis, but you would rather have lived in New Jersey, and he wanted to live in Memphis.  So what did he like so much about Memphis?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I have no idea (laughter).  But he, he's the one who came here, and left me working in New Jersey.  And I ultimately came here.  Well, it wasn't ultimately, I guess within a, before a year was over, I was home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, 1950, you were secretary to--you got a job with Lyman Spitzer at Princeton University [Princeton, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: With who?
Speaker 1: Lyman Spitzer, right, Dr. Lyman Spitzer at Princeton?
Speaker 2: Yes, and he was the Project Matterhorn director, the atomic energy research program [Project Matterhorn; Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory].
Speaker 1: Now how did you get this job?  How did--I mean, how did you hear about that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I guess I was the best thing coming down the pike (laughter) at that time.  I was a good secretary, a damn good secretary.  And I had to get top secret clearance to work on the job.  And they had interviewed two or three other people, but they didn't pass the clearance procedure, and I did.  And I guess, that's how, that's how I got it.
Speaker 1: You know, we know when we look back at that era that there was a lot of really, just ridiculous racial prejudice--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in the United States.  And there's still some now.  But, so I guess the question becomes even more so, how did, you know, how did you overcome that or--did--was it an issue raised by Dr. Spitzer or anybody else at the time?
Speaker 2: No, I never ran into a single ounce of prejudice at Princeton, not a one, not a one.  When I went for the interview, I had no problem whatsoever until it came time for me to move into the Project Matterhorn office, and I hadn't gotten top secret clearance.  And I couldn't work there without it.  And I worked in another building completely from where Dr. Spitzer worked.  And he would come over to--from Project Matterhorn to where I was and bring work to me there because I couldn't go into the building where they had the top secret, you know, investigations going on.  But that didn't last long because they rushed through my clearance, you know.  They, somehow they managed to get it going just like that.  And I was cleared in a rather short time.
Story_ID: 639513
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  I'd like to, just to continue the questions relative to Project Matterhorn [Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton, New Jersey].  How did you find out about the project?  I mean you said, you stated earlier that you were a very good secretary.  So someone must have recommended you or how did you find out about the project?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't even remember that.  I don't remember how I found out about it.  All I do remember is that when I went to Princeton [New Jersey], we had--are you familiar with Firestone's research center?
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Firestone had four or five buildings out there on that campus.  And that's all they had.  And I was hired by Dr. Spitzer [Lyman Spitzer], and since I didn't have top secret clearance, and it was about a top secret atomic energy project, I couldn't work in the building where I was supposed to be.  And they put me in the aeronautics building.  They had an aeronautics department out there.  And my bosses would come to me at that building and bring me work.  And by the end of the day, I would have done it and get it back to them, or they would send somebody to get it, you know.  But I don't remember how I was hired or anything of the sort.  I really don't remember.  I really don't remember how I was hired.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Now, you--prior to that you were in Virginia at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Were you in New Jersey or did you go from Hampton to Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey]?  I mean was there a time period elapsed between--
Speaker 2: I went from Hampton to Princeton because I was going where my husband [Arthur Shack] was.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Okay.
Speaker 2: I had been, you know, married and living in Virginia.  And that was a little bit difficult.  So I went to--when it came back to Jersey, and that's when I got the job at Princeton.
Story_ID: 639514
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Now the Project Matterhorn [Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton, New Jersey] had two parts to it.  There was an A and B, at least according to the historical records.  The overall director was Dr.--
Speaker 2: Spitzer [Lyman Spitzer].
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  --Spitzer, right.  John Wheeler [John Archibald Wheeler], do you remember John Wheeler?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Right, right.  He was in charge of the--
Speaker 2: Physics part.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  --the physics part, the--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You want her to say that, not you.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, so tell me about your interactions with John Wheeler?
Speaker 2: John Wheeler and there was another one there, Wheeler and--I'm trying to remember the other one's name.  But they were probably (unclear)--I met so many important people during that time.  Wheeler and Van Allen [James Van Allen] came from out west some place, not California.  He didn't come from that far.  He was from some place this side of the West.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Van Allen?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Probably Iowa.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think he was from Iowa.  They--and Spitzer.  Those were the three people I worked with much closely at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey].  And most of the people who came in there came from other universities and spent time at Princeton working on Project Matterhorn.  Now, I did at--it was at that time that I also had a chance to work with Dr. Oppenheimer [J. Robert Oppenheimer] at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, and, of course, you've heard of Oppenheimer?
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Yes.  And what did you do with Dr. Oppenheimer?
Speaker 2: Reports, you know.  He would--I would go over to the Institute of Advanced Study, and he would dictate reports, and I would--about the project, and I would take it down and then go back and type it up.  They had massive reports that they put out.  And there was a fellow there who came from somewhere out west.  His name was Tuck, James Tuck [James L. Tuck], who was just as involved.  And I know you've heard Teller [Edward Teller], heard of Teller.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Yes.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: He would come from out west and come and spend two or three months at Princeton working on Project Matterhorn and then go back.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Now what were your interactions with Teller?
Speaker 2: Same (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  (Simultaneous) Same, right--
Speaker 2: --as I had with all the other fellows--
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  --right.
Speaker 2: --taking the reports and putting them together and chemical and physics equations and what not, which I didn't know anything about.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But I did when I worked.
Story_ID: 639515
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Can you give us, you know, a summary of what was your typical day when you'd go out to Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey]?  What was your typical day on the site there?
Speaker 2: My typical day was to first gain admitted, admittance to Project Matterhorn [Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton, New Jersey].  Once I got in there, it was to provide any kind of reports that the fellows wanted or needed, and that I had complete charge of the files, any kind of physics reports or chemical reports or anything like that.  Nobody could go in the files but me.  And if any of them had to dictate reports, they dictated them to me.  And I spent the day either producing reports clerically or producing them--every time they did a report, they would have to send copies to other scientists, top secret mailings, you know.  And I would have to type these up.  We used a special mailing process to send them off.  And so special that from the minute it left Princeton, I knew where it was in the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] until they got it.  And the minute they got it, they called to let me know that they had it.  It was really a top secret atomic energy investigation.
Story_ID: 639516
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  (Simultaneous) Now were people outside of the project [Project Matterhorn; Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton, New Jersey], for example, your family, your husband [Arthur Shack] or friends, did any of them know what you were working on--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  --or what you were involved in?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Did you tell them anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  What did you tell them if they asked?
Speaker 2: No, I couldn't tell 'em anything.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Um-hm.  There were four other women, at least as indicated in the picture (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Can you describe your relationship with them--
Speaker 2: Let me see that picture that you have there.  The second young lady on here was a secretary who stayed there maybe about two months.  And she went to RCA [RCA Corporation, New York, New York] and worked there.  Her sister worked there, and she wanted to work along with her sister.  The one on the end over here, Ann [ph.], was from Lawrenceville [New Jersey], which is between Princeton [New Jersey] and Trenton [New Jersey].  And she was a researcher.  So was Dorothy [ph.], the tall girl with the dark suit on, was also a researcher.  And I really don't remember these two.  I don't remember them at all.  I can recognize their faces, but I don't remember what they did.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Do you, do you remember--how did--you were the only, the four of you or the five of you were the only females in this whole project, how did--what was the relationship in terms of the men?  How did the men treat you, the scientists--
Speaker 2: They were wonderful.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They were wonderful.  They felt as though they were doing a unusual job, that nobody else could really do.  And they had great affection for all of us.  They really did.
Story_ID: 639517
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Can you give us the circumstances under which you left the project [Project Matterhorn; Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: I left because I went into teaching.  I came home to Trenton [New Jersey] and got a job teaching school.  I told you my husband [Arthur Shack] was here, and I didn't want to keep traveling back and forth to, you know, Princeton [New Jersey], although it wasn't that far.  I still didn't want to keep traveling back and forth.  I stayed there about two or three years I believe.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Now when you left the project to teach and in the subsequent years, have you kept up or--contact, did you keep up contact with any of the members of the group?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  When I left the project, they gave me a going away gift.  It was a silver, a silver bowl or something that--it was around here somewhere.  Where it is now, I don't know.  It might be over there on that counter some place.  When I left, I just left.  I didn't leave in unfriendly terms.  They knew why I was leaving, you know.  I was coming home because my husband was in Trenton, and I was commuting every day to Princeton, and I needed to change that arrangement completely.
Story_ID: 639518
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Now could you just give me a summary statement about your overall impressions of the project [Project Matterhorn; Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton, New Jersey]?  I mean how would you describe your experience there?
Speaker 2: It was unique.  It was unique.  I had responsibility for, as I said, this was the only girl who was in the office, other than myself, and she didn't stay there long.  So I was the only secretary, and everything that they, other people produced, the men, it had to come by my desk, you know, for them to get it.  And I was, I was just kind of unique.  That's all.  No one--there was nobody else to do it but me.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  So that must have indicated great confidence on their parts--
Speaker 2: They did.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  --for this project.  I mean were you aware of the significance of what you were doing?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah.  I knew it was top secret, and I knew they were working the development some phase of the atom bomb, and I also knew that they were trying to develop something that they called--I guess I can call it now, the stellarator.  And, yeah, I was aware of the significance of the whole thing, uh-huh.  And wondered how did I happen to get there, to get this job, except as I said, and I'm not boasting, I was a damn good secretary.  (Laughter) I really was.
Speaker 1: (RONALD MICKENS):  Okay.
Speaker 2: I still am.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (RONALD MICKENS):  What were your thoughts in terms of the, you know, during that period, there was a lot of dissent within the scientific community relative to the construction of the atomic bomb which took place during World War II [WWII] and the new hydrogen bomb which was being worked on.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (RONALD MICKENS):  Did you have any strong feelings one way or the other about that?
Speaker 1: No, we didn't have any dissent.  I didn't, I didn't sense any at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], unh-uh.  As I said, they brought in scientists from all across the country.  And they all seemed to work together rather amiably.  They didn't, they didn't have big fusses or arguments or--things went, went wonderful.  They really did.
Story_ID: 639519
Speaker 1: So, ma'am, that takes us to 1955, I guess, right, when you leave the Project Matterhorn [Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton, New Jersey], and, and you went on to teach at elementary school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So how did you, I mean--
Speaker 2: Taught fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Fourth grade, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, now how did--
Speaker 2: I didn't stay that long because they found out that I was a business teacher--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and they made me the head of the coop education program at Hamilton High School [Hamilton High School West] which is here in Memphis [Tennessee]--not Memphis, in Trenton [sic. Hamilton Township, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.  But before--let me ask you this though because I was curious about it when we were talking about Project Matterhorn, how did the pay compare to working for Project Matterhorn in Princeton [New Jersey]?  Was it, did it pay better to be a teacher or to work for the project?
Speaker 2: I vaguely remember that I got paid better as a secretary at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] than I did as a teacher.  When I got my first job teaching school, I think I--they announced in the paper, you know how they used to do, announced the appointment of Mrs. So and So, so and so, at such and such a salary.  They put my name and my salary and everything else in the paper.  And I recall my salary wasn't even three thousand dollars.
Speaker 1: Okay, and once again, the reason why you left the project was because--
Speaker 2: I just wanted to stop traveling back and forth--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to Princeton.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So they moved you from the fourth grade to the business department of--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --of Hamilton--
Speaker 2: Hamilton High.
Speaker 1: --High, okay, all right.
Story_ID: 639520
Speaker 1: Now your mother [DeLocha Perkins Herron] had been a teacher, and now you finally get a chance to be a teacher.  How was, how was that experience for you?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think my experience was different because by the time I was teaching I was in an integrated situation, and my mother was not in that kind of situation.  And I'm sure it was different.  In fact, when I was at Hamilton High School [Hamilton High School West, Hamilton Township, New Jersey], I don't think that--oh, if there were seventy-five teachers there, I don't believe there were over five who were black, if there were that many.
Speaker 1: Were there very many black people that actually lived in Trenton [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: They was, they were on the outskirts of Trenton, Hamilton Township [New Jersey].  It was like a little suburb almost.  And Hamilton Township had two high schools, East [Hamilton High School East; Steinert High School] and West.  On the east side of town, it was almost totally white, and on the west side of town it was just the opposite, and I was at the west school.
Speaker 1: You were still the only black teacher though, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but there weren't many of them, you know, a half dozen maybe.  That's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, half dozen black teachers at Hamilton West?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so--
Speaker 2: Hamilton East hardly had any.  My husband [Arthur Shack] was over at Hamilton East, and he was among few, very few.
Speaker 1: Now what did your husband teach?
Speaker 2: Industrial arts.
Story_ID: 639521
Speaker 1: So you were a business education instructor until about 1966, I believe, right, am I right?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the--
Speaker 1: Okay, I think so.  That's what the note we have here--And then you went--you worked for the Mercer County Community College [West Windsor, New Jersey]?  Is that--
Speaker 2: Mercer County Community College, I was still working as a teacher at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I--Mercer County Community College was in a night school operation more or less.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now had you started working on your master's degree at this point?
Speaker 2: I think so.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, now had you, had you joined The Girl Friends [The Girl Friends, Inc.] by this point in time?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't remember when I joined The (laughter) Girl Friends.  But I've been a Girl Friend (unclear) since ever.  I wish I could find that certificate of membership, but I can't find it.
Speaker 1: Were you a member when you were working on Project Matterhorn [Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we know it's some time during the time you started teaching school, I guess, that you--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --got involved in Girl Friends.  Okay.  All right, now--oh, it says here you got, you went to Rider College [Rider University], right, to get your master's degree?
Speaker 2: I got my master's at Rider.
Speaker 1: And that's in--
Speaker 2: Trenton.
Speaker 1: Trenton, New Jersey [sic.].  So you got a master's degree in what was it?
Speaker 2: Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], Rutgers I got my doctorate.
Speaker 1: Right, but your master's degree was vocational education, is that right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And you taught at Rider College too?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you and your husband [Arthur Shack] decide to go to Rutgers, right, to work on a Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell us how--how'd you make that decision together?
Speaker 2: Well, where else do you go in Jersey for a, for a doctorate?  And we didn't get a master's at the same school.  He got his master's at Trenton State College [The College of New Jersey, Ewing, New Jersey].  I got mine at--
Speaker 1: Rider, right?
Speaker 2: At Rider.  Rider was known in those days for its business programs.  And that's how I got there, but I wasn't going to Trenton State.  I don't know why, maybe because he was there.  I don't know.  And he was in industrial arts.  But when we were working on the doctorate, we had no alternative.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was there--did you take advantage of any special program at Rutgers or--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  No.  No, they didn't have anything special there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so I guess from '68 [1968] to '72 [1972], you worked on your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: I guess so.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your Ph.D. was in--what was it in?
Speaker 2: Teacher education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--okay.  And what was your dissertation about?  What was the theme of your dissertation?
Speaker 2: I'd have to get a copy of it to tell you what it's about (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Do you really want to know?
Speaker 1: Well, sometimes, it's something that's really, you know, that you're really excited about, and sometimes, I guess it's not, depending on who, you know, does it.
Speaker 2: Give me a second.
Speaker 1: No, no, I don't want you, I don't want you to get up and go.  No, if you could sit down, sorry.  I don't want you to get up and leave.
Speaker 2: Well, before we leave, I can get one.  It's in there on the counter.
Story_ID: 639522
Speaker 1: So you worked on your Ph.D., and you received that in 1973.  Now, what was--tell me, like what was that experience like?  Were there any mentors or any teachers that or experiences at Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] that really stand out that there's a good story about?
Speaker 2: I had some favorite teachers there.  I had Dr. Drawbaugh [Charles C. Drawbaugh], I remember him.  And I had, I think maybe his name was Newsome [ph.], who was the education teacher.  But other than that, I--anybody special, you know.
Speaker 1: And did you help your husband [Arthur Shack] with his dissertation?
Speaker 2: I helped him with his dissertate- dissertation.  I did all of the typing, naturally, and some of the writing because he was not necessarily good at writing and composition.  And we were working on them at the same time, and he did not want me, of course, to finish before he did.  So if he was going to finish along with me, I had to help him.  I had no alternative.
Speaker 1: Are you suggesting that you would have come out before he did if--
Speaker 2: Probably, six months or a year maybe before he did, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did--were any obstacles placed in your way in terms of getting your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, because I was both, we were both in school, in school together?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and any obstacles, you know?
Speaker 2: No, no, unh-uh.  No, I don't remember any.
Story_ID: 639523
Speaker 1: You got your Ph.D. in 1973, and 1974 you moved to Michigan.  Tell us what happened in '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: I moved to Michigan.  I don't--my husband [Arthur Shack] took a job in Michigan, that's how I happened to get there.  After he got his degree [from Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], he was offered--I don't remember what the job was now, but he was offered a job.  And that meant that, you know, I had to work or get off the pot, more or less (laughter).  So that's how I happened to be there then because he went to Michigan before I did.  He went to Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] and, also to Wayne Community College [Wayne County Community College; Wayne County Community College District, Detroit, Michigan].  And I ultimately went to Highland Park [Michigan].  But when I went to Highland Park, I was a little more fortunate than he was.  He was head of the industrial arts department, and I was vice president of a college, and ultimately, president of a college.  But I had been in the, in the state department working, and they knew me in Michigan and had known me longer than they knew him.  So that's how I soared ahead of him when we got there.
Speaker 2: Okay, now what was the difference between--that you noticed between living in New Jersey and living in the Detroit [Michigan] area?
Speaker 1: It was a world of difference.  I'm trying to think.  The social life in Detroit was richer and more involved.  But the educational life, I think, was greatly improved over Michigan and what they had to offer because I worked part time when I was in Michigan, in Lansing [Michigan], and Michigan State University [East Lansing, Michigan].  And I didn't have that opportunity in Detroit.  When I went there, I went there to the black school.  Basically, Highland Park [Highland Park Community College, Highland Park, Michigan] was a black school.  And when I was working in Michigan, in Lansing, I worked at Michigan State University.  And it was a different atmosphere altogether.
Story_ID: 639524
Speaker 1: How did you come to be vice president of Wayne County Community College [Wayne County Community College District, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Not Wayne.  My husband [Arthur Shack] was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --vice president of Wayne, not me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, he was vice president of Wayne?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was vice president first of Highland Park, and ultimately, the president of Highland Park Community College [Highland Park, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry.  I got them mixed up.  Highland Park Community College.  Okay.  So, well, what was that like?  Was Highland Park Community College--
Speaker 2: I didn't, I didn't necessarily enjoy that experience at all because Highland Park had a lot of small minded people with it and who were rather incompetent and who thought they were competent.  I didn't necessarily enjoy my years at Highland Park, necessarily at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, and we were talking off camera about how things have kind of deteriorated in the City of Highland Park [Michigan], and no police force.  The public library's closed, you know, a lot of exits removed from the expressway.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, it's in tough shape, but it's actually in, it's almost like in Detroit [Michigan], but it's not Detroit.
Speaker 2: No, it's not.  It's--I think it's literally three or four miles from Detroit at the most.  You don't know when you leave Detroit and when you enter Highland Park.  And you're in Highland Park and out of it before you know you're out of it, very little space at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were, you were president until, from '79 [1979] to 1986--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --right? And is there, are there--can you tell me what the--if there's a highlight during that period of time or some highlights?  What were the best things that happened when you were the president?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The best things that happened, I don't know.  The best things that happened was that I left there (laughter).  You didn't write that down, did you (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, what's the worst thing that happened in Highland Park, or there--or do we have time for it?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think Highland Park was a school that had, at that time, been living on its past reputation.  And they thought they were the cat's meow, and they were not the cat's meow.  That was about the worst thing that happened, I guess.  And they had a lot of faculty who had been there for a good little while.  And all of them thought they were the chief totem pole, and I guess that's the worst thing that happened, they--how they valued themselves thinking that they were the, you know, the cat's meow, and they weren't.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a story there about one of the individuals--you don't have to name them.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: But a story you could relate about what it was like--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  No, because I would name the whole staff (laughter).  I really would.  And since, maybe the person who was the most belligerent of all the staff might well be a person who's dead now, and I wouldn't want to be talking about the dead.  The one person I remember rather fondly was the man who was dean of liberal arts.  His name was Al Daas [Albert Daas], D-A-A-S, a very intelligent man, very intelligent, very dignified and very, very knowledgeable.  I was particularly fond of Mr. Daas.  He was, he was a Mr. Daas.  He wasn't a Dr. Daas.  He was, as I said, dean of liberal arts.
Story_ID: 639525
Speaker 1: There's another big project that you worked on in terms of editing a history of the Shriners [Shriners International], right, the black Shriners, Prince Hall [Prince Hall Freemasonry], his- history of Prince Hall Masons?
Speaker 2: Is that it?
Speaker 1: 'The History of the Shrine'--
Speaker 2: Is that it?
Speaker 1: --'1893 to 1993' [sic. 'History of the Shrine, 1893 - 1993'].  If you wanna hold it up, you can, and we can get a shot of it.  But that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is it, um-hm.  I wasn't the editor.  Joseph Walkes [Joseph A. Walkes, Jr.] was the editor.  I was the proofreader--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --correcting all of his mistakes, and there were hundreds and hundreds of mistakes (laughter).  And I did the same thing with the other group.  It's on the other table over here.
Speaker 1: Another Masonic group?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The 33rd degree--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Masons ['History of the United Supreme Council, Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, Prince Hall Affiliation, Northern Jurisdiction, U.S.A., Inc.: 1881 - 1998,' Joseph A. Walkes, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Now your husband [Arthur Shack] was a Shriner, right?
Speaker 2: He was both.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was potentate of the Shriners.  And I don't know whether he ever held that office or--he didn't hold that office with the 33rd degree, but he was a member. It's over here on the other table.  They look just alike--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --because the same printer did both books.  And they copied off each other, front copy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He copies their own work when they did it.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Only he uses a different color.
Story_ID: 639526
Speaker 1: Tell me about The Girl Friends [The Girl Friends, Inc.].  How did you get involved?  We don't know the date, but just tell me how you got involved with The Girl Friends?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember I was packing up maybe to leave--where was I?  In Memphis [Tennessee]?  No, I don't think I was in Memphis.  I was moving to the Detroit [Michigan] area.  I can tell you that.  I don't know where I was moving from.  And--
Speaker 1: From New Jersey, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And I had just gone into The Girl Friends in New Jersey.  That's how.  So when I moved, I affiliated with the Detroit group right away.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's 1974 then.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's when you moved to Lansing [Michigan].  So, okay.  So you moved to Lansing and there was a chapter in Lansing?
Speaker 2: No, not Lansing.  I moved to--when I moved to Detroit--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that's when I (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, and well, tell me, what are The Girl Friends about?  What do they do?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) First of all, they're about fun, friendship.  They do civic projects nationally, and I guess that's what they're about.  They don't--they're not like The Links [The Links, Incorporated] at all where they're constantly asking for money.  You pay dues in it, but whatever projects they have, the money, the financing of the projects must come from the dues that you pay.  It's not an extra assessment like The Links, and they're not like The Links where they're constantly asking you for money, you know.  Each chapter establishes its own national programs.  They follow a pattern, it's true, but it's not a demand like The Links where you must put--participate in this paying.  You must pay this or pay that.  It's not that at all.  It's really more of a fun group than it is--they do have projects, national projects, and they make wonderful contributions to, you know, community affairs.  But they don't demand money like the other group does at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what kind of projects do--national projects do The Girl Friends work on or support?
Speaker 2: Scholarship programs with younger people coming along, I'm trying to think.  Most of it is educational.  They also have a, The Girl Friends have a Girl Friends Fund [The Girl Friends Fund, Inc.] where every chapter must make contributions to this fund, and then they invest that money in community affairs.  I can't, I can't think of the many things they've done, though they do a lot of good work.  They really do.
Story_ID: 639527
Speaker 1: Now you were president--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --national president of The Girl Friends [The Girl Friends, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Right, from--and I'm, I'm trying to figure out where I've got it written down, but it's, I think--yeah, it was in the--let's see, wait a minute, hold on one second.  Let's see.  Okay, you served as national secretary of The Girl Friends--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --from 1970 to 1976, and so--
Speaker 2: I've been national parliamentarian--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and I've been national president.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Now when did you become national president, do you remember?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, parliamentarian, '76 [1976] to '78 [1978], and okay, 1979, I believe you became--let's see.  No, you weren't president then.  Wait a minute, I'm getting there.
Speaker 2: I don't know whether I was president before I became parliamentarian or not.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were parliamentarian first, and then, yeah, in 1986 to '88 [1988].  And then in 1989, you served as president of The Girl Friends Fund [The Girl Friends Fund, Inc.] for Girl Friends Incorporated.
Speaker 2: That was a different group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The fund is.
Speaker 1: Okay, from the--okay, and you started serving on the national advisory board of Girl Friends in 1990.
Speaker 2: Once you are a national president, you automatically become an advisory board member.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I'm still on the advisory board.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, well, what was it like being president of Girl Friends?
Speaker 2: Tremendous.  Tremendous.
Speaker 1: Is there an annual meeting?  At the--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, every May.  They meet for about, oh, four or five days in May, toward the end of May, and they conduct national business at that time, national projects that are underway and make extra contributions to that.  I enjoyed it, I really did.  I still enjoy it.
Story_ID: 639528
Speaker 1: What are some of the fun activities Girl Friends [The Girl Friends, Inc.] was involved in?
Speaker 2: Some of the fun things?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, they have, like most women's groups, they have dances and they have cocktail parties and I'm trying to think what else.  They take trips to different places after the conclave is over.  The chapter who is responsible for that given year, you know, the hostess chapter will have planned a trip maybe to the Caribbean or somewhere, and you can go there.  And they have dances.
Speaker 1: Now did your husband [Arthur Shack] participate too?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know there's something called the Boy Friends, is he a part of that?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what do they do?
Speaker 2: Nothing, just go with us (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But they play golf and, you know, athletic things, play cards and they entertain themselves when they're not being entertained by us.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay, so are you, are you still involved in Girl Friends here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is there--about how many members are in Memphis now?
Speaker 2: About twenty-five or thirty, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have to be--well, what do you have to do to become a member of Girl Friends?
Speaker 2: If you gain the favor of the members, (unclear) and they'll vote for you (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so no qualification beyond that you have to, you know--?
Speaker 2: Well, most of them are people of my status or more or less, doctors' wives or themselves professionals, you know.  They, themselves, are doctors or dentists or lawyers.  You don't have to do anything but be recognized at a, as a, a Girl Friend.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Don't ask me that.  I don't know.  I don't think I can answer that question.
Speaker 1: You don't have any concerns about what's going on today or any hopes that things might change or get better or--?
Speaker 2: You know, for you to have concerns, you gotta have problems.  I don't have any problems (laughter).  I don't have any problems.  My marital life turned out fine.  My husband [Arthur Shack] is dead now, of course, but it turned out fine, and my financial life turned out fine.  I don't have to worry about anything.  He left me comfortable, and I don't have any problems.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you don't have any concerns about the problems of the community at all?
Speaker 2: I guess it's a silly question for me to say, no, I don't have any, but it depends upon the people whom you associate with whether you have, you know, community concerns or not.  And I don't find myself associating with the type of people that would cause me problems or concerns.
Story_ID: 639530
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point in your life, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Anything that I would do different?  No, I think I've had a good life, he [Ramsey Shack's husband, Arthur Shack] served me well and my friends have served me well.  I can't think of anything that I would do differently.  As far as an educational (unclear) is concerned, I'm satisfied with that.  Economically, I'm satisfied with that.  (Pause) I'm comfortable.
Story_ID: 639531
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything again that you've done, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I think perhaps my contributions to education, organizational affiliations, (pause) an array of friends who were loyal and committed (pause) and I guess I couldn't end any kind of interview like without saying and the grace- gratefulness that I had the kind of husband [Arthur Shack] that I'd had, who either provided the things I wanted or needed or, (pause) and who allowed me to do the things I wanted to do and expand.  I think those, those are the things I'd be grateful for more than anything else.
Story_ID: 639532
Speaker 1: Now we were saying earlier that your brother [Herschel Ramsey] just passed away.  Is there--do you have any--well, did your mother [DeLocha Perkins Herron] and father [Royal Ramsey] get a chance to see you become successful?  What did they think about your career?
Speaker 2: My mother only died about three or four years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So she was here when you became the resident of Highland Park Community [Highland Park Community College, Highland Park, Michigan]--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, she was there.  Now my father, I told you about him.  I didn't see too much of him all my life.  My [maternal] grandparents [Carrie Bailey Perkins and Brooks Perkins] also saw me reach the status that I did.
Speaker 1: Were they proud of you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 639533
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have not asked you that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, this is the last one, this is the last one.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Pause) As cheerful, contributing to life around me, making a contribution to society as a whole, (pause) and I guess that's enough to remember me by.

Speaker 1: Now, these are the--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Five minutes (unclear).
Speaker 1: That's some of them.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, let's start with this one.  That's you when you were--
Speaker 1: That's when I finished eighth grade [at Florida Street School, Memphis, Tennessee] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Simultaneous) That one should be turned so I can get it in aspect ratio--
Speaker 1: You can look at that face and tell that was--it'd be years ago.
Speaker 2: Hold on one sec.  He'll tell you when to start talking.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead and talk, just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 1: That's eighth graduation.  The one in the white dress on this side--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on.  You gotta do it, do 'em one at a--
Speaker 1: We just did one--we just did this one right now.
Speaker 2: That's eighth grade graduation.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 2: Okay, we'll probably move onto another one (unclear).
Speaker 1: That's my [maternal] grandmother.  You can't tell it from here, but that's my grand--
Speaker 2: What's her name?
Speaker 1: Carrie Adeline Perkins [Carrie Bailey Perkins].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 2: There's a group of Girl Friends at a Girl Friend [The Girl Friends, Inc.] convention.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 2: I'm number three on the right hand side.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  In the print dress?
Speaker 2: In the print dress, third from this side.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  On the right.  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That was commencement exercise at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio]--no, not at--where was I president?  Highland Park [Highland Park Community College, Highland Park, Michigan] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Highland Park, correct.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I can't see that one 'cause it's upside down.
Speaker 2: It's a woman with a baby.
Speaker 1: That's my mother holding me.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 1: That's my mother.
Speaker 2: What's her name?
Speaker 1: DeLocha Herron [DeLocha Perkins Herron].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 1: That's me and my brother [Herschel Ramsey] sitting at the piano that we used to have right in the living room.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's do the color one--
Speaker 2: That's me at the middle top, that's me.  My mother on the right of me.  As you can tell, we look just alike, and that's me at the bottom right.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on a second.  You're getting ahead of us.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We only do one image at a time, that's--even though all of them are up here.
Speaker 2: Turn it straight up and down. That's my mother driving the old fashioned car up top.
Speaker 1: Let's do the one with her mother and car.  She made a reference to it.
Speaker 2: That's my mother and underneath me, right in the middle, below--
Speaker 1: We're not, we're not going to do all of them.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  That's my dad [Royal Ramsey].
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Which one?
Speaker 2: Top left hand, bottom left hand picture of my dad.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  The small one there with the hat.
Speaker 2: We've got a big one, trying to get the big one.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's my dad.
Speaker 2: All right.

Speaker 2: That's me taken not too many years ago.

Speaker 2: That's my mother graduating from Henderson Business College [Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  If you've got any of Matterhorn [Project Matterhorn; Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton, New Jersey] put them in there 'cause it's getting down to the wire.  We're going to have to stop in a minute.  What about that sheet that she had during the interview?  You have the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Dr.--
Speaker 1: That's my husband [Arthur Shack] and myself at a Shriner [Shriners International] convention when he was a potentate, I believe, because they have on the, five stars across here.  He was potentate with that on.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, good.  We have a couple more coming and then we're good.  So hang on just one minute.
Speaker 1: Okay, you got that one?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yes, we do.
Speaker 1: I can't see that.
Speaker 2: Well, that's Project Matterhorn, and you're right there.  The reason why we did them--we do them upside down because they scan a certain way on the camera.  We only want long ways no matter what you--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  They come out right later.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  They come out straight later.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Does that have a caption on it, Larry [Larry Crowe], with the description of the people's names or not?  That one there--
Speaker 2: It's--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  In that side panel, are those names of the people?
Speaker 2: I think it's in the blue one.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Is it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  It's upside down so I can't tell.  As long as it's in there, we don't have her name then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  We know who she is.  She's right there.
