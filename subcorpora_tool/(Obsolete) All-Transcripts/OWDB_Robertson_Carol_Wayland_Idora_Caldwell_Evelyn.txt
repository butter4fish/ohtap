 Lemons  Robertson  Before we get into our conversation, what I want to do is have each of you  state your name, where you were born and when, if you don   t mind telling me.  That   s how I   ll keep track of you when you are each talking. Okay, so if you  want to start first, Mrs. Wayland.  Well, I   m Idora Wayland, and I was born November 12th, 1919, one day and  one year after the Armistice was signed. My dad was a veteran.  Where?  Oh where, Shattuck.  Where we are today.  I   m a native.  Okay, if you want to state your name and your birth date and where you were  born.  Okay I have all this written down in case you want it. My name is Carol  Robertson. I was born Anna Carol Long, December 25th, 1913 and I was born  on the Shaffer Homestead, seven miles south of Gage in Ellis County. My  father staked a claim there and then he built the home and the little building  out there. What else do you want to know? Anything more about my childhood  or do you want to wait for that?  We   ll let you identify yourself so you can talk.  Well, I   m Evelyn Caldwell   January 3rd, 1925. I was born in Gage on a farm  south and east of Gage.  Okay, well, now you all can jump in and talk whenever you want and I   ll make  sure we get them down right. Do you want to tell us about your childhood?  Well, I was kind of a puny kid, but I was born Christmas morning and the  evening before my daddy and my sister Thelma had gone to the country  school, Pleasant View country school to the program. I was born early the  morning of December the 25th within a little three-room house the pioneers  5  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  had just built up. They had to improve it to keep their claim. I remember more  about my early childhood than I do some of the other things about the early  days. I think the early days were pretty typical probably of everything that  you   ve got. My mother was German, her parents were born in Germany, and  there were eight children in her family. They lost a daughter right after they  landed in New York, and my father   s people were from England and Ireland,  so I   m from that kind of a heritage. I   m half German because my mother was  full-blooded German.  I didn   t know that till the other day.  That   s right because you two had got together and talked about the questions  the other day. What did your dad do?  My father was a schoolteacher in Indiana. He went to Valparaiso for his  training. Then he married and had a son, and the son died and his wife died.  All of our neighbors didn   t know anything about that, but he was pretty  heartbroken. And how he and mother got acquainted, Mother was an RN from  Chicago, and the doctor had sent her out to care for my daddy   s wife and so  later then he asked Mother to marry him. And so, on September 1st, 1908   my  mother   s 30th birthday   they were married and my Uncle Albert and his wife  were married the same day. Mother and Uncle Albert had stayed in the home   at Reynolds  to take care of my grandparents until they were gone. So Mother  and Daddy were a little older than most of the people that got married. Mother  was on her 30th birthday when she was married, and Daddy was seven years  older than she.  Thelma was born August the 17th, the next year 1909 and then I was born four  and half years later. A little longer than that, nearly five. So my parents were  getting kind of old, and my baby sister was born on May 15th 1917 and by the  time she was six years old, she was an invalid. So that tells a lot about my  childhood. We were on the farm and Daddy had gone to Shattuck and he was  like some of the rest of them out there. It wasn   t what it was cooked up to be  so he went out to California, he and Mother. And he didn   t like it, says,     Another Chicago.    So they came back and Daddy went on to carpentry work  and he worked at the lumberyard. Now I will be hesitant, and I   ll get my words  mixed up.  You   re doing just fine.  Anyway Daddy worked, he took the embalmers    course when he was in  Chicago, so he worked for Lowell and Lane, I believe was the name of the  furniture store and the mortuary at Gage. He embalmed for them but he didn   t  like that. If Mother hadn   t been a nurse and gone with him, he   d stop that. He  was a very sensitive person and grief of people you know at that time was too  much for him.  From there I went to a grade school at Pleasant View and then 1923 we moved  to Shattuck because Daddy wanted his daughters to go to high school, and he  6  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Caldwell  Robertson  was going to do other work. When they were in Chicago my daddy was  superintendent in construction of the Argo starch plant. So he built some  houses out north of Gage in the early day, late 1918, I guess, and I got to go to  country school and I was very studious.  What was going to a country school like?  Well, I thought it was heaven (Laughs) because I enjoyed learning things and  my daddy encouraged me in that. And it really was, the whole neighborhood,  was just like family, and so that was great. I know that I was very studious,  even as a little kid I was. I wanted to learn and my daddy tolerated me. But I  was kind of ill and I remember him walking the floor with me because I had  trouble breathing and he whistled to me and I can still hear my daddy  whistling.  But our teachers were very important, at one time the teacher stayed with us. It  was just like any early neighborhood, I assume. My highlight thing was the  summer as soon as the harvesting was done, the whole community gathered at  a little locust grove for a picnic. And that was wonderful, just everybody came,  and all the kids and I remember getting ready for it because through the winter,  the grove didn   t get any attention. My daddy was building and he was doing  this that and the other. When spring came and the harvest was done, we started  cleaning up the grove. And that meant trimming everything up and raking  everything up and building swings and tables, you know, for the party. Of  course, the family all got chiggers all over by the time the picnic was there.  We were really scratching.  What did you do for chigger bites then? Because now they make medicine, you  can get it at Wal-Mart. What do you put on it then?  My mother being a nurse knew all of the stuff and I think her mother was very  much on herbs and things that way. Oh, we took soda water baths, salts.  Alcohol, kind of refreshing, make it cool.  There was spice things that they used as a lotion. But I don   t remember. I do  remember something, that Mother had a medicine cabinet in the bathroom, and  there were bottles in there and I didn   t know what they were, but I found out  what it was later. Mother would get it at the pharmacy in Gage, and it was a  glass bottle about this wide and this deep and this tall, had a cork in it. On the  front of it said,    Spirits    (Laughs) and I didn   t know what that meant. But I  knew that in the wintertime if we got colds or got pneumonia we had a hot  toddy with spirits in it. (Laughter)  But anyway that was one of the things. I just realized in older years as I think  back, my mother   s mother must have been terrific on herbs and things that  way, because mother knew what to give for everything, it seemed like. Of  course, Grandmother had lived for a number of years in pretty critical  condition and mother had taken care of her. So what she had in the medicine  7  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Caldwell  Robertson  cabinet was things that had been handed down to her, and then the things she  had learned when she had been in training.  When they married, well, Daddy told her she could take care of the  neighborhood all she wanted to and they   d managed to take care of the kids,  but she was not to charge anything for her services. So she never did, but when  there was any need in the neighborhood she went and sometimes she   d be for  like, her aunt   s daughter was born and she nearly died when that happened. So  mother was with them for about two weeks. Our neighbor ladies, one of the  girls from the neighborhood stayed with us weekends while mother was busy  nursing. I think she delivered about every child that was delivered out in that  neighborhood. You know, out seven or ten miles from town it was pretty hard  to get a doctor out there and they came horseback or in a buggy or something.  So, that was because I was born in    13 instead of    23.  But school was wonderful. We had kids of all ages and the teachers were  pretty good, at least I got to go right along with the eighth graders. We had a  spelling bee every Friday and I got to where I could spell down the eighth  graders, so I was a pretty smart kid when I came in. (Laughs)  Was spelling your favorite subject?  Well, I liked it because that was a fun thing. We had spelling bees and if you  could stand up there a long time and not be spelled down, why that was  something. I remember our Christmas programs and we   d have different plays  and all of that.  Tell me about the Christmas programs at school.  I don   t know how to tell you. We sang songs and we had little plays, and little  things, read some scripture, thank goodness, and of course, the story of Jesus  was always wonderful. We had Christmas trees and exchanged presents, drew  names and things like that.  So would each student then bring a present to trade, or did the school do that?  No, we didn   t do that. We just drew names. We just brought one present for  whoever   s name we got. And we had pie suppers where we baked a pie and  sold it to raise funds for anything.  What   d they call that, literary?  No, the literary is when we had somebody in.  Pie suppers.  Pie suppers. Why, we had them. But all of those things, the whole community  participated in it, and you found out who was the good cooks and who was the  bad cooks. I know that my mother could make the best butterscotch pie of  8  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Caldwell  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  anybody in the country.  Butterscotch pie, I   ve never had that before.  You haven   t?  That sounds kind of good.  That was my brother   s favorite. When he was little, he   d come in he   d be real  hungry and he   d say to my mother,    Oh, mommy, make me scolly pie      (Laughs)  Is it like a pudding type pie?  Yes, it   s a soft type pie.  Huh, that sounds good.  You can even get it instant.  The kind that mother made, she had to burn sugar.  That   s hard to do, too. I   d hate to do that.  My mother made cheese out of the cottage cheese. We   d put it in butter and  melted the cheese in the iron skillet. That was real good, we liked that.    Course  she   d bake bread regularly and in the spring of the year we could hardly wait  till the onions and radishes got big enough to pull. So we didn   t let them stay  in the yard very long.  We lived on the creek, a ways up from the creek on the hill, and would fix  little picnic boxes with fresh garden stuff. About the time when we kicked off  our shoes in the spring and went barefooted was time to start having a picnic.  That was the size of our picnic, and it was usually just the three children or  maybe we had neighbors that lived less than a mile from us, and so we kids all  got together. It was fun. We dug sand out of the creek that was wet and built  castles   that was fun   and sometimes they would last for quite a while. If it  was the right time of the season, the water would come up and we could dig  ditches around our castles and really have fun doing things like that.  Of course, harvest was always a big time and the neighbors would share their  farming with the neighbors next to them or something. I know that the  Hendersons had a header and my daddy was a good stacker and had his own  equipment for the harvest. The harvest would maybe be part of it on our place,  then on their place, and change back and forth as it needed cutting and stacked.  Later in the summer or fall was thrashing time, and Mr. Wright, Billy Wright,  had the thrashing equipment. Then after him was a Mr. Barnes that thrashed.  But we kids had the privilege at noon when the thrashers were in to eat, we  could go in the header barge and tromp the wheat that was in there so that the  9  Lemons  Robertson  Caldwell  Robertson  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  grain would come out, and then we would take that out, and mother would  help us wind it. That   s where we got our money. Daddy would haul it in and  sell it for us, and if we had any money for the Fourth of July, that   s where we  got our money from.  And what did you do on Fourth of July with that money if you had it?  Well, there was usually something going on. I remember one time we went  down to Davidson   s for a big celebration. It was a new time for airplanes and  there a couple of men flew in, and Mr. Davidson was a representative at that  time. So it was a political-fest, I   m sure probably my first exposure to politics.  But that was something and way down there it took all day to get there because  of sand hills.  Now sand hills is another subject. When I married, I married a young man  from Arnett and he had a mail route, what did you call those?  Star route.  Star route down to Peak and that was down in the sand hill country. We had a  Model-T Ford, and when we   d have these big windstorms, they would blow  out holes. Some of that land was pretty hard and then there would be a bunch  of sand and it   d blow up and make sand dunes and but it would leave a hard  place in the road which was pretty rough usually, but that would be    blow  holes,    I believe they   d call them. Then when it would rain, well they would  hold the water.  So that was kind of an experience that was nice. We enjoyed it much because  we were both pretty much outdoor people. I was his substitute, but you know  you weren   t afraid of anything. The whole neighborhood knew that they was  gonna get the mail today maybe. I remember Romy bought a windmill.  Somebody was moving from one of their places down there. Of course, that  was ranch country and all that and that   s what we had in town then. He built  this tower for an old windmill, and we had water on our place in town instead  of city water. We had our own, and it was very fascinating. I met an awful lot  of people on the mail route that I would never have met otherwise, and they   re  still very dear people. It was a pretty rugged neighborhood down there. I mean  that   s where the bootleggers and the     Oh, really.  Out of the sand hills.  Now that   s a new story. No one   s told us any thing about that  (Laughs)  Well, I can mention a bunch of names down through there, and those people  were wonderful people. I mean they had a terrible reputation. Who were the  boys that Dr. Newman knew and waited for them when they got shot? Do you  remember hearing about that? They were friends of the Dixon family down  10  Wayland  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Caldwell  Robertson  there and of that bunch and the Wagnons, they holed up down near those  Caldwells.  Oh, you mean Bonnie and Clyde. (Laughs)  Well, Bonnie and Clyde were with that bunch.  And their name really is Bonnie and Clyde?  Yeah, it was, uh-huh.  That   s kind of funny.  They were more from down south farther. But oh, why can   t I remember the  name of that gang?  Was it Caldwell?  No, the Caldwells were in on that, I mean they had their own stills. I guess  you would say the word. The Caldwells and Jack, he was on Romy   s mail  route, they were all on Romy   s mail route so I got acquainted with them, but  they were always very good people. I mean if you had any problem you were  just going to be taken care or you knew you would. But I can see the places  yet. The Dixon boys where they lived. One of them was involved with that.  Oh, yeah. (Laughs)  And the Wagnons, and well there was a bunch of them. But that was kinda out  of the neck country. I mean it was just a good place for them to hide out down  there along the Canadian River. So that was some of the early stuff. I was  already married and I wasn   t married until    34.  You got married in 1934?  Yes, I was born on Christmas Day. I was married on Easter Sunday.  You like the holidays, don   t you?  Well, it happened to be April Fools Day, too.  Oh no, was that on purpose?  Well, that was in the dirty thirties, now the thing in the dirty thirties that I  should talk about was, of course we had an outdoor toilet, and I   m so grateful  for my bathroom.  We   re thankful for our inside commodities.  Water in the house. We were fortunate. My daddy being a construction person,  11  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Wayland  we had water in the house but it was a pitcher pump in the sink, but we had a  cistern down under the porch. Our house was a small five room bungalow with  a porch on three sides, concrete porch, and underneath that concrete porch was  where the cistern was. So, we always had good cold water in the summertime  and it didn   t freeze up or anything like that.  But I was going to tell you something else. What was it? After I was married  in    34, I went into the Christian Church. I   d been a Methodist before that and  so I got involved. We didn   t have children. We had always wanted children, so  I got involved very much in the children   s work and in church work.  Was that the church of your husband? Why did you change churches?  Because I read my Bible.  Okay, okay.  I could just about as much work as I could find time for and then I started. One  of the questions asks,    What was your first salary?    Well, I hadn   t had a salary  before because we weren   t allowed to charge the neighbors for anything. So I  got to working at anything I could. I worked some at the bank. I worked for the  old Nulls and anything that I could find where they hired anybody because we  didn   t have a lot to go on. My husband had decided to be an electronics  technician, so he was doing that correspondence. So he sold wind chargers. If  any of the people down there that had any electricity at the time it was the  wind that provided it. So down in the south country he sold wind chargers.  Let   s see, I got involved in politics and we don   t want to put in that what I  would tell you. Because my daddy changed politics whenever somebody ran  for office that needed his vote in the primaries, well then he would change his  politics so he could vote for them in the primaries. So early I learned that, well,  I enjoyed American literature and politics and history and all that stuff in  school, so I kind of got exposed to that and then when I worked for the Nulls,  well I really got exposed to it, and then I worked in a print shop where  Beardsley worked there, so they got pushing me into politics. Of course I  enjoyed it, and I was always meeting interesting people, but I even ran for  office because nobody would run against a woman and those guys pushed me  into signing to run for county clerk.  (Laughs) When was this?  Well, that was along the later part of the    30   s, and always I was somewhat  involved in politics. But when I was 20, when I got married, I went to the first  party meeting that I   d ever gone to and I went to the democrat meeting because  that   s the way I had signed up, to be a democrat that year, and my Dad was a  democrat that year.  That   s what we did this year.  12  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Caldwell  Wayland  Robertson  Caldwell  Robertson  There wasn   t any particular thing that did it. That   s just the way it was. So on  went the meeting, but the man that was a newspaper man was there and he was  the big shot in democratic politics, and I made up my mind I was on the wrong  side of the fence. So I went the next day and changed my politics.  And then during the war when I was overseas, no, I was not overseas but we  were running around looking where he had to go, and I got to go everywhere.  But my mind made up what I was going to do when we got back, and what I  was going to do was to work in American politics and get a two-party system  in Oklahoma, cause we didn   t have a ghost of a chance if you were a  republican. Well, that   s what I did and that   s where I started my working for  Henry Bellmon and then for Dewey Bartlett. That was great.  You worked for Henry Bellmon? In our presentation we did, we bought his  telephone from his office as part of our special collections. We have the  telephone from his office so we have it in the car actually. That   s pretty wild  you worked for him.  Yeah, I was very much involved in politics. But all that time, too, I was  involved with kids. I took kids on political trips with me. I   ll tell you, I must  have had the most wonderful husband in the world because if anything came  up that had to do with politics or church, well, I could go and take care of the  kids and this that and the other. So it was pretty nice and we liked the same  things.  We liked the outdoors, he loved to hunt and I remember he got me a .22 rifle  and when we were carrying mail we would shoot quail along the way down  and on the way back. So it was a nice life, there was something that I thought  would be interesting and I   ve forgotten now what it was. Can you remind me  of what it might have been?  Well, I was going to ask you something else. Maybe you   ll think of it after I  say this. The group we talked to just before I came over here said that there  was a real problem with coyotes around this area, that you had coyote drives,  rabbit drives and coyote drives, you guys remember those?  Yes, this morning as I went after the paper early, I could hear those coyotes.  You remember the drives, I don   t remember that and I   m younger than you  are.  You don   t remember the drives. Well, you were in town.  There were people that were more involved in that probably.  There was a question about the woman   s doings and we canned. We had  garden for the whole neighborhood. My uncle was somewhat handicapped and  he lived with us but he was one of those German gardeners that knew how to  fix everything whether it was curing meat of every kind, head cheese and  13  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Caldwell  Robertson  everything they did and that was for the whole winter, the canned stuff. At  harvest time we dug potatoes and the worst job was picking the peas and  canning food.  You asked how was food stored and what was typical. We had a cellar, a  basement under the house, and it had big concrete shelves down there and  that   s where we had our canned stuff and our sausage and meat and stuff that  way. A separator was down there and I milked cows and cared for the  separator.  The cream separator?  Yes and carry the buckets of milk down there to separate it and then take the  cream back up and put it out in the   we had a storage tank that Daddy built  out of wood, a long one that was our refrigerator in the summer. It was cold  water right from the well. It ran through that and then on out to the stock  tanks. So we had a storage place for fresh stuff. There was something that I  was going to tell about that was interesting for me. But I can   t think what it  was. I need to tell something about the duster.  Sure.  The thing that was most frightening for me was shortly after we were married,  Black Sunday, you may have heard of that one, Black Sunday. We   ve always  pretty much gone to church regularly. Sunday afternoon we decided we   d go  down to High Walks. They had a little pond back on the spring and we   d fish  up there. There were a lot of persimmon trees and a lot of other pretty things  so we went out there. We left right after lunch or took our lunch with us. I  don   t remember. But it   s a spot probably 12 miles down there, I don   t know  really, from Arnett to the river. It must have been something like that. We had  gone, parked our car and gone up to the pond. Romy went to get a drink and  when he came back he said,    We   ve got to go. There   s a big cloud coming in  from the north.    Well, by the time we got our fishing tackle back up to the car,  that had hit. I was sitting in the driver   s seat and he stood right beside me in  the car and I couldn   t see him. Now that was the most drastic thing that I think  I   d ever endured.  Did it scare you?  Oh, yes.  Yes, it scared us. If you knew anything about the scripture you know what it  says the    moon will turn dark    and this that and the other. So we just had the  feeling like we have today that this is the end of time, and it was very drastic,  and we had to sit there. Of course, we knew the way in and out, but it was  pretty rugged getting up to where that was and I guess there wasn   t anybody  home because we didn   t even stop at the house, we just tried to get out of there  and on the road home. But all the way home it was just creeping along because  after that lifted. Why, you could at least begin to see where you had been and  14  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  where you were going but it was very frightening to the whole community.  But the dust storms were perpetual and you could depend on them. Every  morning I   d dig out and I mean dig out of our little house. It was not a very  sturdy house but at least we had a home. But we had windows and we had  doors and it was all housed in. The dirt came right through it. I mean it did  everyday and night. In the morning before noon it would clear out and you   d  clean it out, but by the time the evening came you were soaking you sheets in  water to hang up in front of the windows and doors. It would come right  through the sides of the house, and you know people say,    Yeah, but if you  had a brick house it wouldn   t.    But it did.  The Hamres had built a new brick house and their attics would get full of it  and if there was any seam or anything around your door, why it would pile  inside. That of course was what was making those places down in the sand hill  country, the blowouts because it would blow out till you   d hit hard dirt, but  also then everything that they raised out west came in, all of the thistle and the  weeds and everything like that came in and planted it in our yards. We had a  windmill and we just let it run and it watered our garden but we got the  darndest batch of stuff growing in it. It didn   t belong to our part of the country,  you know.  I can only imagine  But we enjoyed that sort of thing. We enjoyed our mail route down south  because we saw prairie chicken that I   d never seen before and other things like  that, so that was very interesting. But about school, when I came to Shattuck I  was really astounded.  In what way?  With the school system. Of course, I wasn   t used to a one-grade school. They  came in here for the 4th grade and we just had 4th grade. We had one teacher,  but the subjects were so easy, I   d been through them all. But the kids were so  jealous. I was making the honor roll, and they called me teacher   s pet, and I  was no more the teacher   s pet and of course, I was a sensitive kid. I was  nervous so I would cry because it was that way, so I learned that you just don   t  answer all the questions, you do this, that or something else. But I was  interested in school and I thought I would be going on. I loved every bit of it.  It was just wonderful and I had a lovely teacher and I loved them. But a bit of  jealousy, and we had German people   maybe that hurt worse.  Yeah?  Out in our neighborhood, they didn   t even know that we were German, that  Mother was German. Came into Shattuck and moved in beside the Weiberts  over there and Mrs. Weibert didn   t speak English. She was German. She came  to see Mother one afternoon. I knew that it wasn   t a very happy occasion for  Mother. She was having a struggle and that evening she told Daddy, she said,  15  Caldwell  Wayland  Caldwell  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Caldwell  Robertson  Caldwell  Robertson     That   s the hardest days work I ever did.    See, Mrs. Weibert was a German  that had been shipped to Russia, she was a Russian German, so it was like, her  language was so different. See, Mother was High German from Germany, and  I guess that   s the old-fashioned German. But anyway, so Mother got to where  there were several people here that spoke straight German, and we had  neighbors when we lived out there on the highway that Mother could  communicate with. Marcella, my ill sister, when she was studying, of course,  she just loved these dear old German ladies and my uncle August would share  some German. But I didn   t get exposed to that. I would love to have, and I   d  love to be able to speak German, but now we have lost that in our community.  Do you speak German, Hon?  No, I   m not German.  I   m not either, but we   ve been around it for... But I don   t speak any of it.  Well, these kids don   t either, from the German families anymore. The world  war did that, didn   t it? Then you weren   t allowed to.  That   s right.  So then that changed things. Nobody knew my mother was German, and these  kids that made these nasty remarks about flat heads and all that, they didn   t  know what they were talking about. Some of the finest people came in from  the south to go to school here.  But it was different. I mean that business of everybody being in the same  family was different. Then there was the jealousy of the bankers and then the  jealousy of the Ingles because they were in the grain business. If they had  anything, well there were jealousies and that just was never a part of my life.  I think schools were so cliquish even.  Well, yes. That   s what I   m saying.  Even then?  Oh, yes, back then they were worse than they are now, I think.  Of course, coming from a one-room school where we all were in the same  room and then you come into town, well the classes, the grades were different,  that was quite an adjustment, I   m sure.  But you know, I had parents that there was no prejudice one way or the other.  Uh-huh, I didn   t come from that either.  So we didn   t notice it and they didn   t let us notice it.  16  Caldwell  Robertson  Caldwell  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  I didn   t know anything about it till I was probably     You didn   t know anything about if somebody had a crooked nose like I have.  You weren   t allowed to mention it. I remember when we had to go back to  Indiana for a funeral and there was a colored lady that sat across the isle on the  train, had a couple of children and I tapped my hand on Mother and said     Mother, Mother there   s a nigger, there   s a nigger.    Boy, I found out when I  got home.  You didn   t speak that word, did you?  I didn   t use that, there was no difference. We didn   t have too much of that.  When you have something to overcome that in the family, well, you don   t  dwell on that. But those were things that were different. So it was like going  from Shattuck to OSU. I don   t know whether there   s that feeling in the  college. I wasn   t privileged to go.  I don   t know. It changes each year depending on who   s going to school there  now, I think.  That and who the leadership is I suppose.  Right. One of the things you didn   t mention, but you said you lived by the  highway for a while. Did you ever have any tramps or hobo type people come  by?  The folks lived here after, oh, I guess by the time I was married or I was in  school anyway, and they could count on feeding. That was Depression time  and there were a lot of people moving, looking for jobs. I think they must have  given the name of where they got something to eat. Most of them would ask,     Now is there something I can do for you?    But Mother always had food and  she fixed breakfast for them, and Daddy had his chairs in the backyard and he  enjoyed visiting with the men.  Really?  Really. Oh yeah.  A lot of people of people we   ve talked to said,    Oh you   d want to feed them  and get them out of there as fast of possible.    But for him to talk to them,  that   s different. Well, Mrs. Wayland, do you want to tell me about how it was  different for you?  Well, I can   t compete with Carol here.  (Laughs) She does have quite a good story.  I was born a twin, I had a twin brother. We were supposed to be the first set of  twins born in Shattuck, so we were kind of petted. But my twin brother died  17  Caldwell  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  just before we were three, with some kind of a stomach problem and I think  they called it Summer Complaint at that time they tell me. Did you ever hear  that?  I   ve heard of Summer Complaint.  I don   t know whether it was appendicitis or what. We lived at the edge of town  here. East, in town, but we had an acreage and my parents moved their house  from in this neighborhood out to about six blocks east.  That must have been quite a process. It   s a process now moving a house, so I  can only imagine.  I think one of the questions was how come our parents moved here.  Why did you come here?  My grandparents came from Indiana. They moved to Iowa where my mother  was born and then my grandfather was quite a historian and was fond of the  west and he was a young lawyer, which was most of the time a starving lawyer  in those days   I think he went to the same school my dad did.  Oh yes, they were at Valparaiso, Indiana. They all went to school up in  northern Indiana   college. I   ve had trouble in working with this separating  the Depression from the dust bowl.  And you know what? You don   t even have to do that if you don   t want to, just  talk about it all in one big chunk.  Well I mean in my mind it   s all kind of together, and then we ran into the war.  So I   ve always been real interested in genealogy and I studied a lot of that is  one of my hobbies. Just the other day I found I had a cousin, born in Shattuck I  didn   t know. A distant second cousin.  My parents, after they moved our house out to the edge of town, everybody  always had chickens no matter whether you were in town or not, we had our  chickens and the eggs. She   d always had chickens and my brother   I have a  living brother, Bob McIntosh, and he got pneumonia and almost died and they  said for Mama to have him outside a lot, so she she   d raise more chicken and  more chickens.  So when they moved out there why they got a pretty good sized incubator and  it was in the basement. I always think.    My goodness, how that could have  caught on fire. Wouldn   t that have been terrible?    But it didn   t. And mostly  my mother did that and my daddy had a garage when he got home from the  service. He lost a lot of money. People couldn   t pay their bills, so he went  broke. He didn   t have any kind of job for awhile there but different work. In  18  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  fact I remember his telling that he dug holes for the telephone line going up  across the hills over here for a dollar a day.  My grandparents, my great grandparents, Lucas who moved from Kansas  down to Bridgeport, Oklahoma, which is down on I-40 now except you can   t  find it now  Anyway he had a store down there but he wanted to move up and  prove up on land, now have they told you about that?  I   ve heard some people talk about it, but I haven   t heard your version so you  can tell me if you want to.  My grandmother was a nurse and she married my grandfather McIntosh  because she worked in the Santa Fe hospital up in Kansas and he was ill. So  she had nursed him there and so they met and married. Well, the great  grandparents and the grandparents came down on the river where she was  talking about down in the sand hills where the bootleggers were. They weren   t  bootleggers. (Laughs)  Now come on, tell the truth.  Put some color in that, Idora  Let   s put some color in that.  Anyway my grandmother was Doctor Newman   s nurse down in that area. She  was a licensed nurse. Doctor O.C. was the doctor at Grand, which is no longer  there, but it was a county seat at one time. She lived about five miles, they had  proved up on land, about five miles east and when they proved up on land,  they had to live there for so long. My grandfather was a mechanic on the Santa  Fe railroad. He would be gone a long time and she lived in that sod house, if  that   s what it was, I think it was wood, by herself. But Doctor O.C. Newman  would send her a message somehow, I guess by cow? (Laughs) By horse, and  she would go deliver babies and things. She was a very good nurse.  So the great grandparents decided to move to Shattuck. He was a carpenter,  and there are several of his houses still being used in Shattuck. So she came,  too. I don   t know, I can   t imagine how anybody lived down in the sand hills, a  woman by herself. But my daddy was with her.  There were several women that did.  So he wanted to get away, too. He went to a little country school, and he  wasn   t a very good student I don   t think. My mother said one of his teachers  told her how ornery he was. Took a donkey to school or something. So they  moved up here, too, and she was Doctor O.C.   s nurse up here.  I remember where she lived.  I went to school in Shattuck and I was in what we called primary. I started  when I was five, before I was six. I wasn   t a very good student, I don   t think,  because I couldn   t tell six from seven or something (Laughs) and my numerals  19  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  were all people in a family, in my mind, and I finally learned them.  My parents kept   this was when we still lived here in town, they let girls  come into the country to live in town. They didn   t have buses at that time or  anything and they lived with them. I remember when I was in the primary, we  had a girl living with us which was just like a sister and she was a senior. I  remember one day I was kept after school, after the noon hour. There was a  path from here up to the schoolhouse, do you remember? Anyway I remember  Juanita was her name, and she would walk, I had to run real fast to beat her  home. I didn   t want anyone to know I had to stay in. I remembered all the  names of all my teachers when I was in grade school on. I tried to be quite  studious. I wasn   t valedictorian, I   ll tell you that. (Laughs) But I did and my  ambition was to go to college. I participated in band.  What did you play?  I played a baritone.  Really?  I wasn   t very good. I wasn   t too good at anything I did, I don   t think.  I would have thought you would have played clarinet or flute or something like  that.  I wanted to, I wanted to play a clarinet but my mother wouldn   t let me for  some reason. She thought there was too much to buy reeds.  Our house was a very modest house. I don   t expect any the other ladies had  told you but I don   t remember, I guess when I was about 15, the WWI veterans  were offered a bonus. So we built on another room, and that was my room. But  I helped tote plaster and mix the plaster for my dad. I lost a few pounds that  summer, too.  So you helped build this room that became your room so that was probably  kind of fun actually. Work but still fun.  My parents did start this hatchery. My daddy was city water superintendent for  30 years, I think, but we all worked in the hatchery. I think the question was  how many were in our family? I had my brother Bob, which was four years  younger and our activities were our band and study and 4-H and church  activities, and movies. Saturday night movies. Did anyone tell you at one time,  you   re too young, but anyway they had continued stories at the movie on  Saturday night? And they   d leave it going thump thump thump on the westerns  and you had to go back the next Saturday night to see what happened.  How much did it cost to go to the movies?  A dime.  20  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  A dime? That   s pretty good.  If I   d had a dime, I could go to the show, but I didn   t have a dime.  That   s a pretty good deal.  Why yes, when Harley and I were dating, we went to the movies and he would  have a dollar for the evening. So it wasn   t too expensive then. When I went to  Oklahoma A M, or Oklahoma State, room and board was  20 a month. I had  a room that was at the end of the hall in Murray Hall, you know where that is?  It was the cheapest room you could get.  When were you at OSU?     37.  So I know when it was  20 a month. Because it   s not now   No, I know it got more expensive than that when I was there.  Yeah, it did.  Oh, let   s see. As far as people living with us, I started to say that, we had some  boys come, rural boys, and they   d come and work for us and we had a little  room in the basement where they   d stay.  But you were talking about the farm hands or the boys that lived with you,  that   s where we stopped.  They were farm hands, I think. As I said, my grandfather was a lawyer and  didn   t make very much money. My grandmother kept students that came to  school. She had an upstairs and they did their own cooking and everything.  They kept these boys usually. But she like to keep the boys better than the girls  because the girls were too fussy. You didn   t have to worry about the boys  needing so much water and everything, because she had to carry the water up  and down the stairs.  I expect the ladies you talked to a while ago talked about raising chickens a lot.  That was a mainstay and we had, everybody was raising chickens and sold  eggs in town and it helped to support all of us.  Yeah, they talked about raising ducks, too; one family raised ducks.  Yes, the Germans raised geese mostly.  That   s where we got our pillows from.  In fact there was a German man, I think he   s still alive, and he used to get our  phone number mixed up down on the farm with Harley   s brothers. He raised  21  Robertson  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Robertson  Caldwell  Robertson  Caldwell  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  geese and this man would call up about every Thanksgiving or Christmas and  he   d say    Have you got any damn geese yet?    (Laughs) and I   d have to tell  him I wasn   t the one that had the damn geese   He wasn   t saying    damn,    now was he?  That   s the way he meant instead of    dam   , he meant    them.    He was running  it together. I graduated from college in    41 and in those days, it was kind of  hard to get a job at that time.  What had you studied?  I was a home economics major. I don   t tell that to people that look at my  house. (Laughs) But I couldn   t find a home economics job. So school was  ready to start and the Whites from up north, their son   and it was the Pleasant  View school   but it was in a different locale. There were only six students but  they didn   t want them to come to Shattuck for school, so they came in and  asked me if I would come out and teach their school. I had never been in a  country school.  Uh-oh, she was in for a surprise, huh? (Laughs)  It was worse than coming to town school  Mrs. White tutored me on what to  do, but I still was a pretty dumb teacher. But anyway, I stayed with a family  and my mother would come out and get me every Friday evening and bring me  back Monday, so I wasn   t there all the time. Carol mentioned head cheese. Do  you know what that is?  No, I don   t and I was going to ask you but I forgot. What is that?  They make kind of a lunchmeat out of it.  We put it in crocks and sealed it in the top with   that   s another thing, we  made our own lard and that was in there. And that was, how do you say you  cook the lard?  Render. You render it.  Render the fat you know from pigs and then you season your sausage or, it   s  more, your head cheese is more like sausage.  Don   t they take the meat out of the head?  That   s where they got the name.  Okay.  Yeah it   s the trimmings, you don   t throw anything away.  22  Lemons  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Caldwell  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Caldwell  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  Okay.  Well when I     Souses, that   s the German name for some of that kind of stuff.  My lunch everyday that I was out in the country for four days was a sandwich  of head cheese, and I just don   t like that word  It was Souses.  Souses, uh-huh, that   s the German name for it.  Anyway, I learned a lot.  That was quite and experience, I imagine.  So the next year I taught at Fargo and three years I taught at Fargo and then I  was getting married.  When did you get married?  1945. Harley and I met, he was from Arnett and I was from Shattuck,  competing towns. We met first at 4-H Club camp at Stillwater, we both were  there. Then we met at a football game again and that was our first date. We  were married in    45. Harley had volunteered for the service but he had had  polio and he didn   t pass. We were married by my grandfather. He was county  judge at that time. Ronnie, our son, was on the road pretty quick. So, pregnant  women didn   t teach school at that time, so I had to resign at mid-term for a  semester and he was born in June of    46. Then we had another son and he was  born in    55 and he was hurt in an accident.  Well, we don   t have to talk about that if you don   t want to.  As far as the dust bowl, I remember it blew everyday. Are you old enough to  remember that?  I was old enough to remember that mother put sheets at the window and when  you   d get up the next morning if your mother had a quilt on the bed, you  know, it   s how they   d quilt their favorite prints. That was just a silt, you  couldn   t see the pattern where it settled in through the night.  I remember one time I took a nap in the after noon and then I got up there, is  my silhouette.  I try to image what it what that must have been like I   m sure that after a while  you   re like,    There   s my dust again.    But I just can   t even     But you see we had had such long dry spells before that started blowing and  we were brought into it slowly and worse and worse because it became dryer  all the time.  23  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  The black duster, I don   t know whether any of them have told you they tried to  outrun it? (Laughs)  No, that   s a new story.  That was when I was in high school. I was a sophomore in    35. Bonnie Brown  was our neighbor 3 blocks away, and we were always the best of friends. I had  had the measles and my mother would not let me outside but Bonnie would  come up to play with me or visit. We   d been playing Greek mythology or  something but Mama said,    Well, we walked each other back and forth these  three blocks,    she said,    Well I could go out and walk half way with Bonnie.     Well, we got out to the street and started down the road and here was this  rolling dirt coming in. That came in from Colorado, didn   t it, the dark? Well,  Bonnie started running north and I turned around and ran south.  You weren   t even going the same direction  (Laughs)  So we both got home before it hit, but it was really coming in and my folks  had gone, the women, my grandmother was there, they   d gone down to the  basement. Grandfather and my daddy went out to the hatchery which was  down low and a half dugout kind of building. Grandpa had picked up a wet rag  to put over his mouth, to keep the dirt out. After everything was over he  noticed he   d gotten a cloth that had a rotten egg in it. (Laughter) We always  teased him about that. But I remember that.  Yes, we all wore a lot of leftover clothes at that time. Somebody always  handed them down to us. I remember I had a navy suit. Grandmother McIntosh  was a nurse at the Western State Home at Helena for orphans. Sometimes, it   s  a pitiful story, but people would bring their children there and they   d always  buy them nice new clothes to come to the orphanage and then they took them  out of those clothes and they were in cotton dresses. Sometimes I   d be wearing  the orphan kids    clothes. But at that time we had to do what we could. Anyway  I had this navy suit that somebody had given me and that was really hard to  keep clean during that dusty weather.  Oh let   s see, that dirt that you were talking about sifting in. Our son lives in the  old homestead house and he did some remodeling a while back and this silt  from those dust storms was clear up to the sills, just real dark fine dirt. I think  I   m talking to long.  No you   re fine. You just keep going until the tape runs out if you want to.  Well, I   ll go back here a little bit, you asked about gypsies?  Yes, I was, and I put that down to ask again.  Gypsies and tramps. I remember when there was a gypsy group and that was  before I was, oh I was just a little kid, but I remember gypsies going through  here and camping across from where we lived not two to three blocks from  24  Robertson  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Wayland  Caldwell  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  here. Then the tramps. My Grandfather Barnett fed every tramp that came  through town, and they had their houses marked or something, the people who  would     Yeah they always come back, people come along that heard about it.  I don   t know they always put an X out on the house or something they did.  Grandma Barnett, my mother used to tell, good Grandma gave away a  beautiful rocking chair, we   d have now an antique, to a lady that was coming,  they   d come through town in a covered wagon. She had a baby and she didn   t  have a rocking chair and Grandma gave her her rocking chair. She fed them  all, whether she had anything to eat herself I think.  Were you ever scared of the gypsies? You mentioned that your dad was talking  to the hobos and tramps in the back yard.  Well these were just people that were just walking to try to find work. They  were down on their luck. The folks never turned anybody down that I know.  We   d came up we   d find somebody out there talking to Dad eating and visiting  but Daddy learned some very exciting things and he was getting old and he  was in poor health so it was a blessing to him to have them. He was traveling  with them.  Vicariously, right through them? What about you, were you guys scared of the  gypsies and tramps that came by or the same sort of thing?  Well I was probably just four years old. One thing, my daddy built the first  radio in Shattuck.  Is that right?  There weren   t many radios in town.  Now he was getting into my husband   s business   Yeah, but that was before your husband was here, wasn   t it?  No, I think Romy probably made the first one in the country because he was in  school.  Well this was when I was four years old, I remember people would come to  our house to hear the radio.  I think WSN or whatever it was from Ohio was the only place, Chicago and  Ohio were the only stations on the air, so you didn   t get much of anything but  squawks.  Carol mentioned about having a rude awakening coming to a town school. I  had a rude awakening when I moved to the farm  (Laughing)  25  Robertson  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Caldwell  Wayland  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  We reversed it.  I first moved to the farm when we were first married and we didn   t have water  in the house, no bathroom, no electricity.  Oh, no thanks  (Laughs)  But we survived it all.  Yep, and we   d been married 55 years, so it works. I can   t think what else I can  tell you about us.  Well, I do want to ask you one thing that was not on that list of questions, it   s  been coming up a couple time, the past couple interviews. People have been  talking about having bed bugs and what you had to do to get rid of them?  You even got it in the lumber, in new lumber.  Yeah, how do you get rid of them? I mean, what do you do if you have bed  bugs?  Well, there was stuff available, I know that, of course Daddy was building the  home and Mother whatever it was that   s some more that she knew from her  background. When we moved in Chicago, they had bed bugs and they had, she  knew what to do about it. But it was in the furniture and I mean in the walls  and when they plastered they put whatever this was, Blue Vitriol or something  in the glue and that killed them. But it was a good idea to find where they got  them built into it but she knew what to look for, we were pretty fortunate. You  think when you were building a new house that you would never have  anything like that.  Right don   t have to worry about that kind of stuff.  And Uncle August when he moved into the Shaffer place there were bed bugs  in there and he took the little jar lids from the canned stuff and put coal oil in it  and put it under the bed.  Legs of the bed.  I don   t remember, I remember being in a motel one time that happened   Well it was more or less common, I guess, back then but we were fortunate we  knew what to do. We got rid of them before they ever got to us.  One lady that was talking about bed bugs said that she didn   t have in her  house but she said,    Once you had them, you didn   t want to have them again.     That   s right.  26  Caldwell  Robertson  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  I imagine.  We were going to Indiana in the car. We traveled slowly then because there  were no roads and we   d have to camp places. In Illinois I believe it was, folks  said,    Well, you can stay in the barn,    and there were fleas and my sister got,  she was the one everything bit you know, she really looked a sight by the time  we got where we were going. But there was all kind of varmints and we didn   t  have insecticides and things you know like we have today.  Well, I think I   ll close mine out by telling you something about feed sacks.  Okay.  Did anybody mention that over there with the other group?  They mentioned that they made tea towels, but they didn   t tell me about  anything else.  We made everything out of feed sacks. They were printed, most of them were  printed.  Expansion flowers.  Uh-huh, and the white ones of course had to be bleached to get the letters out  of them and you made tea towels curtains, drapes, and dresses and when I went  to college in    37 I had went in feed sack dresses.  Did that bother you at all?  Everybody did it.  Well after you got to college we found that that was not the thing. My mother  and grandmother got to work and made me some more suitable clothes. But  anyway when the women and men would come, when the men would come  into the hatchery where we sold feed they would say,    Well, she wants this  pattern right here.    And you   d have to have about three sacks to get a dress. I  worked in the hatchery quite a bit and we   d have to dig, move those sacks over  till we got to the right colored sack. In closing, I want to add a little bit. When  I did go to school, college, well I needed a job, and so we had a legislator here  Bert Larason. He was a democrat, wasn   t he? Anyway, and by the way, his  daughter is Drew Edmonson   s wife.  I must have talked to his wife.  Linda is her name.  Mrs. Larason, she lives in Woodward.  That was Bert   s wife, Margaret Manuel Larason.  27  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Wayland  Lemons  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  I talked to her; she was my very first oral history.  She was the teacher in this little rural school the year before I.  Well now, that whole story goes together because she was telling me about  being at that school.  Yes, she had quite an article in the county history about that school.  Yeah, how funny is that?  But anyway we went to A. Frank Martin, the man who placed students for the  jobs on the campus. He said, I remember so plainly, he said he   d like to get  kids from western Oklahoma (Laughs) because they   d lived through the dust  bowl   So let me close with that question, how do you think living through the dust  bowl and the Depression has effected who you are today, what have you  brought with you from living then that shows how in your life now?  Well I think maybe we   re a little more saving and frugal maybe, than we  would have been. What do you think?  Oh, definitely. If we didn   t have the money we didn   t buy it. So we didn   t have  things.  What was that quotation? Do you remember? I can   t remember what the  quotation was.    Make it do, do without,    or something like that.  Yeah, well that   s the same philosophy. There was something that you were  talking about there at the last, and of course, I   ve lost it now but I would not  care, it was before the bed bugs I think.  We were talking about gypsies, was it before that?  Well, gypsies as far as I was concerned as just people more or less talking  about it. We didn   t run into any gypsies.  You know I think I remember when there was a Ku Klux Klan here.  Really?  Now I was frightened of that. That was when I was real little, too.  So when was that?  Listen if there was any immoral person around, well the Ku Klux Klan took  care of that, that   s about all we   d hear about it.  28  Wayland  Robertson  Lemons  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Caldwell  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Oh, about 1924.  If somebody was a questionable reputation, well the Ku Klux Klan would  probably clear it up.  So was the Klan down in the sand hills, where the bootleggers were?  No, this was in town.  They would usually be more or less, not many of them would be from an  organization a little farther away or something. I don   t remember of any of our  neighbors being in the clan. Their philosophy might have agreed, but they  didn   t spread it out any. We didn   t have colored people, honey. Right in  through here the colored people are very few.  Shattuck wouldn   t let a colored person spend the night.  I didn   t know that.  I   ve always heard that.  Well I don   t think with Shattuck     Well I think it   s revoked now.  We had a city council that was pretty bad and I could name the men for you.  Do you remember Mr. Seibenlist, John Seibenlist? They tarred and feathered  him. He was a German fellow and he was a preacher and I wouldn   t have  known that but they were our next door neighbors.  I didn   t know that.  Well, see you learn something that I shouldn   t have told you.  That might have been a secret.  But they didn   t talk about it because there was a lot of people that were very  upset at these politicians that did that sort of thing. I could name them for you,  too. But this hurt my daddy badly because people being that mean could be so.  Right.  And John didn   t talk about it. He talked with my dad about it.  John Seibelist. He ran a church, didn   t he?  He was a Russellite.  Oh, Russellite.  29  Robertson  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  Lemons  Robertson  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  But they were good neighbors. His wife was a German woman and his mother  was a German woman, and she could talk with mother because she was part  German. She and Grandma Wagner.  She came a generation behind me so I   ve got things ahead of her.  in reference  to Idora Wayland  I remember your Grandmother Barnett. I thought she was  the prettiest woman, and she always wore a hat that was beautiful and  generally they were purple. She wore purple.  She was a milliner from Shattuck.  Oh okay, that would explain all her hats then.  Katie Peters was a milliner here after Grandma Barnett.  Katie Peters, of the Peters family of Shattuck, huh?  Uh-huh, they had the old Santa Fe Hotel down here.  Mr. Peters answered the phone down there when I called down, and he said  that was his great uncle or something.  Yeah, actually he was going to try to come with us today, but his schedule  wouldn   t allow him to come. Because he kind of works in a different area. He  works in special collections but he works in a different area of special  collections and so he couldn   t come today. But when we come back to Shattuck  he wants to come with us.  Well, I can show him a few things where the Peters was and Mr. Peters, the  last on that lived here had a place down here on the west part of town. The  home is still there I think.  I don   t really remember them.  And Katie married, I can   t remember the name. But when we had a cousin that  remembers her because she married a man out there in Harmon neighborhood,  Katie did. It was a longer name some kind of bottom or something, the kid got  a kick out of her name you know. He   d always ask about it.  In my genealogy work I found somebody way back there had the name  Pleasantbottom.  Rather unfortunate name for them   That was another thing that bothered me when we came. Everybody had  different names, the German people, their names were different. You had to  get used to the Seibenlists, Schoenhals, and the Pshigoda. And all those were  different names. We were just Apples and Adams.  30  Lemons  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Robertson  Wayland  Lemons  Robertson  Smith.  Yeah, and Jones and that out in our neighborhood.  Well I remember when I was a child the German ladies when they   d be in  town and they   d kind of congregate together and talk German all the time. But  you know, you don   t hear that anymore. The young people don   t even know  how to speak German.  Well, they haven   t learned the German language. We didn   t have any school  and when the war came along, it changed people   s thinking because we were  fighting Germans, and so that changed things. Mother never had any neighbors  out there to talk to. My uncle and mother, but they didn   t visit that way, he just  told my little sister what this was and what that was and what it meant. But she  got a bang out of it. She couldn   t do much of anything else. Then when we  came in to town, Grandma Stevens and Grandma Wagner both spoke, theirs  was more botched up some with Russian. I think Grandma Stevens was more  straight, High German I think they call it, but it was very different.  You spoke about genealogy; I was very interested in that. Whether it was bible  genealogy or whether it was a neighborhood or what. When I reminisce now, I  think about the Adams family. Well, the oldest one was Gladys and then there  was Ruth and then there was Iva and there was the boys there was several of  those and then one more girl and I could remember all the names but I   ll tell  you the Alzheimer   s takes that away. I   ll be thinking of those things and then  I   ll want to ask Evelyn. By the time I see Evelyn that day, well   I have  forgotten who I wanted to ask or what. But that   s the way that you talk about  the Whites and I   ll remember their families, Charlie White, and Mrs. White.  She was a schoolteacher, you said, Charlie   s wife, Charlie   s wife, Manon.  Oh Manon?  She was a schoolteacher.  That   s the one that carried me through my first year of teaching. (Laughs)  In your new world at the country school.  Since some of those that she came along afterwards well I remember from way  back when my folks     -------  -------
