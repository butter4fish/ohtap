 Milligan with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State University. I am in Purcell, Oklahoma. Today, it is March 21, 2016, and I   m talking to Ron Fishburn. This is for the Oklahoma State Stories Oral History Project. Done, that   s it. Okay, let   s just start with   tell me a little bit about yourself, who your parents were, a little bit about your family, where you   re from, all that good stuff.  Fishburn Okay, I was born in Norman, Oklahoma, on July 8, 1933. My mom and dad were married in California, and then they left California to come back because the Depression was going on. My grandfather, Tol Moore Fishburn, had a couple of farms in this area. My dad wanted to come back and help his dad save the farm because the Depression was going pretty strong in the 1930s. That was how I got here. I was born in a little deal in Norman, Oklahoma. I wasn   t expected to live. I was born with a open heart valve and a closed bile duct, but the doctor, which was just in those days was a country doctor, more or less. He told his nurses don   t let me cry for twenty-four hours, so they walked the floor. This is my story that my mother told me; this was her first baby, I was. Anyway, that   s why I   m here today is because somebody cared enough about me to walk the floor and save me.  The next thing they did, you know, found out my bile duct had closed up, my heart was back in good rhythm, and everything was working. That   s why I grew up in Oklahoma. I came to Noble, Oklahoma, from the hospital. It was a little clinic, actually. There wasn   t a hospital in Norman then. The only hospital in Norman at that time was the one out at the Institute, what we call the (we called it) crazy hospital. It was where my grandfather, Pulliam, had died later on. I made it, and so we lived in Noble the first few months of my life until I was a little, round, fat baby. Then we moved over into what we call the bottoms across from Noble. Grew up on a farm there as far as the first, until I was six years old. Then I had to start first grade. My first grade was at Ladd School, which was two miles away.  5  I walked to school every day that summer. Then Dad realized that that wasn   t going to be a good deal to raise a young boy because I had a brother by then. There was two of us at home. I was six, and he was four. He traded part of the farm for a grocery store in Goldsby, that was right across from the schoolhouse. In 1939, I was six years old, and we moved to the grocery store. When my brother and I walked in there and we saw the candy counter, we all went crazy. We lived there from 1939 up until 1946. I was in the seventh grade at Goldsby then when my dad bought another farm down by Purcell. We all moved to the Purcell area and bought us a little sixty-acre farm there. It had running water. It was modern  That   s the first time we   d lived in a modern house.  Milligan Even when you had the grocery store?  Fishburn Yeah, we just had a outdoor toilet. We lived in a room   our family lived, my brother and I and my mother and dad, lived in a room not much bigger than the one we   re sitting in right now. It had a bed in it, and it had a little place to cook a little bit. We were very poor people, you might say, but we didn   t know it. We just had fun because we could run around outside and play on the playground at the school. The schoolhouse was right there, and if Mom wanted us to come and eat supper, she just banged on a pole out in front of the grocery store. We sold gasoline there all during World War II, and that was where I spent World War II. They built the air base right by Goldsby, which there   s the airfield now. My brother and I would sit on top of our old store building there and watch the old airplanes fly off and on, and come and land, and go. They were the old yellow Stearmans. We got a real insight into aviation as little kids. We loved to see airplanes fly. I   ve got a picture out here of one. I finally got to fly one of them as I became an old man. (Laughter) I   ll tell you that story later.  That was the beginning. We moved to Purcell then as a seventh grader at North School. There   s a picture of it around here somewhere or another. I graduated from the eighth grade and went to Purcell High School and was in FFA, Future Farmers of America. That was a big thing right after World War II. The Korean War came on, and my ag teacher says,    Ron, you don   t want to be drafted into the Army as a private. You want to get to be a officer if you want to go to war.    I said,    That sounds like a good deal.    He was able to get me a hundred-dollar scholarship to go to Oklahoma A M College in Army ROTC. I took that, and I went up there to interview about going to school at Oklahoma A M. I told them,    I have to work. My parents are too poor. They can   t send me to college.    He says,    No way you can go to college and work  It   s not possible.    I said,    That   s the only way I can go. I know I can do it.    He agreed, the guy that was running the program for kids to get jobs at college. Finally he agreed,    Okay, we   ll let you work in the cafeteria.     6  They had just built Bennett Hall, which was a brand new place for everybody to live, one of the largest men   s dormitories in the United States at that time. I got a letter back, said,    If you can come up before school starts, you can work in the cafeteria feeding the training table for the athletes, the football team, and you get paid fifty cents an hour.    So I did. I just packed up. My mother took me up to Stillwater in the old red pickup. I got out, and I walked into that great big ol   building, and I said,    Wow  This would hold a bunch of hay, wouldn   t it?    (Laughter) I got my start in college by working in Bennett Hall. What was so neat about it was that all the guys I worked with had already been to one year of college, so they wanted to teach me everything I needed to do to be ready for my freshman year. I lived in Hanner Hall because Bennett Hall was full. My first year was in Hanner Hall, and then I had to ride my bicycle over to Bennett Hall. It was such a fun deal, and I enjoyed it so much, working around all those people.  I hadn   t found any girlfriends or anything, so I was studying all the time. My first semester at Oklahoma A M, I made a 3.5 GPA. Of course, that would be the last time that ever happened. Anyway, college started its own. It was really a neat experience. After about three years of it   you had to declare a major, had to pick out something that you wanted to do. Most all my friends were just with the agronomy course. They were taking different things, animal husbandry, or they were taking chicken raising or   . I looked, and there was only five graduates a year in the soil science program taught by Dr. Fenton Gray. I thought, well, now that probably would ensure me of having a job whenever I would graduate. I started in the soils program with Dr. Gray, and there was two other people named Reed, Robert Reed and another Reed. They took me in, and I could work in their soils lab. I did all this stuff. Dr. Gray even let me be an assistant in mapping soils for him in one course, things like that. Whenever I got ready to graduate, I had a soils agriculture degree in soil science.  That was opened up   Eisenhower had hired a guy, the secretary of agriculture, that would map all the soils in the United States for agricultural purposes. Doc Gray says,    I can get you a job.    He signed me up with the Soil Conservation Service in 1956. I got the job. Dr. Ralph Murphy, he was the soil scientist that was heading up the whole program for the United States. He was a soil scientist that was heading it up out at Boise City, Oklahoma, in Cimarron County. We were going to map Cimarron County starting at that timeframe, so I arrived in Boise City, Oklahoma, February 6, 1956. I got out there, and the tumbleweeds was going right down the Main Street. I said,    What kind of world have I come to?    We laughed about it, but I made some of the best friends in the world out there. Doc Gray had told me, he said,    Ron, you   ll go out there, and you will have such a good time. You will find the prettiest girl in Cimarron County, and you will take her to be a wife.    I thought, that   s crazy. And that   s what happened. 7  Milligan Really?  Fishburn I married Pat Robinson; she was the prettiest girl in Cimarron County. My friend Ferris P. Allgood, he married Aggie Cooper who was just   we were all in the same group of people because we were college graduates in a little bitty town. All the high school girls were looking for a college graduate. That   s how it all happened, which was really interesting. That ended my soils deal, so I came back to Purcell with my wife. I hadn   t even told my parents about it. When I got here, I said,    Mother, here   s your new daughter-in-law.     Milligan How did they react to that? (Laughs)  Fishburn They loved her, they did, and took her in. They knew that I   d made the right decision, and it worked out good. That marriage lasted forty-nine years, and she gave me seven kids. It   s sort of interesting how that   and I   ll lay it all off on Heavenly Father. There was a higher power, and I   ve always believed in that. That was really an important thing to realize, that you don   t just happen into this, but there   s a plan that   s laid out by a higher power, which I call my Heavenly Father. That   s why I   m still alive today. Anyway, I got to that point and got back here to Purcell. Had a farm machining business, sold tractors and traded, got into the motor freight business and stuff like that, you know.  Milligan I have a couple of questions about   this is going way back to earlier, but I   m curious. Since your dad bought a farm in 1946 and you all moved to Purcell then, it sounds like Tinker Air Force was building up around you where you were before, right?  Fishburn Well, no, Tinker wasn   t.  Milligan It wasn   t Tinker?  Fishburn No, it was Norman, the Navy base at Norman. See, that all came into play in 1941 and    42. That   s why Max Westheimer Field now, (you know the big air field at Norman that they give back to the city and everything) that was a Navy base in 1941.  Milligan Right, oh, okay, I see.  Fishburn We were watching the airplanes. They would fly from Norman down to Goldsby, and that was their training field there. That   s how that all worked.  Milligan So did that   1946, right after the end of World War II, did that have anything to do with the timing of the move, or was it just a coincidence? 8  Fishburn The move was at   Dad bought land   . He had started the Allis- Chalmers  business in 1939. They closed it down for the war effort. Allis-Chalmer went into building tanks and everything else. He lost his business then, so he went strictly farming all during World War II and lived at the store in Goldsby. We did that from 1941 on up to 1945. Then he was able then to get back in the Allis-Chalmer business. That   s what brought us back to Purcell. That   s why he decided to buy a farm in Purcell. We sold the grocery store and got out of that. He usually tried to sell everything in seven years. That was his sort of deal, that he liked to trade every seven years, which turned out to be sort of right in his whole life, that he changed stuff and moved or did something or another.  He was a good business man. He was probably not as   he was too good, really. He worried about people more than he worried about making money, but he always made enough money, and we always had a good time. When we bought the little farm, he had borrowed eight thousand dollars to buy the farm. She says,    We   ll never be able to pay for it     She couldn   t stand to be in debt. You know at the end of the first year, he had already made enough money on his cattle, he paid for the farm. She didn   t like for him to borrow money, but he was the kind of person that liked to use other people   s money to make money with. He wallowed around, and we did all right. He always took good care of us. He was very well known and liked by everybody in Purcell, Oklahoma.  Milligan He was primarily a cattle farmer?  Fishburn He did cows. Hogs was one of his big ones, too, both of them. He would grow the grain for them all and stuff like that. That   s why I grew up on driving tractors, plowing fields, and doing all of that, up until I went to college.  Milligan So how many siblings did you have? Just the     Fishburn My little brother, just one. Mother couldn   t have any more kids; she could only have two.  Milligan So I know that part of you ended up going to A M, it sounds like, because you had an FFA teacher who was a good counselor.  Fishburn Oh, yeah, excellent man. If it hadn   t have been for him, I would not be where I   m at today, I   m sure. Paul McKinley was one of the greatest agriculture teachers because the one we had before that was just sort of a bum. Back when the war started, all of those people went off to war. Our ag teacher that I had in 1946 timeframe, he couldn   t pass the physical. He was able to become an ag teacher. We didn   t know it. Us kids, we liked him 9  because he just partied with us. We had a great time. Then it was fortunate that when the war got over and the guys got back from war and went to school up at Stillwater and all become ag teachers, that   s when the FFA program really started to really mature and build good programs. I got to be on the last two years of that. My brother was in all four years of the good guy. He had two different ones.  Milligan So out of all the different places, was there a reason that Oklahoma A M was what you were looking at?  Fishburn It was agriculture.  Milligan So you knew at that point you were going to do something in agriculture.  Fishburn We just knew it. I went to that institution, and when I arrived up there, they took good care of me, let me work. I worked my way through it, all the four and a half years. They were   it was like home. Stillwater just became my second home, and it still is today. Stillwater is still   that   s why I wanted my kids and my grandkids and everybody to go to Stillwater, because it was home. The institution is so good. It was just fabulous.  Milligan So two questions from that. The first one is you were   so you were able to work on campus and pay for all of your tuition, all of your room and board, everything, for the four years?  Fishburn Because tuition at that time was forty-eight dollars a semester.  Milligan That   s still a lot   Fishburn Yeah, but I worked for fifty cents an hour. If I took and worked 120 hours a month, I could get sixty dollars. That paid for all of my room and board. My dad, because I worked for him in the summer, then he gave me the hundred dollars to pay the tuition.  Milligan So that paid the tuition for the whole year.  Fishburn Yeah.  Milligan Got it.  Fishburn Isn   t that amazing?  Milligan It is amazing.  Fishburn When I graduated, I didn   t owe anybody anything.  10  Milligan That is amazing.  Fishburn I had a college degree. I was the first one of the Fishburns in my grandfather   s line to have a college degree.  Milligan So did your   was there a college degree on your mother   s line?  Fishburn No   but she did graduate from high school at Oklahoma City. What   s ironic is that the building that my mother went to high school in and graduated from is now the building that was bought by the Oklahoma City University Law School and where my son is going to college.  Milligan Full circle.  Fishburn Isn   t it amazing?  Milligan Yeah, that   s great.  Fishburn Whenever I was up there visiting the dean at Oklahoma City University, I said,    This is where my mother graduated from high school.    She said,    Oh  Can I see a yearbook?    I said,    Yeah, I can bring up the yearbook for you.     Milligan That   s pretty cool.  Fishburn It   s amazing, that   s what ties everybody to Oklahoma. That   s why my oldest son wanted his kids to go to Oklahoma State University, so his oldest daughter did. The others have gone to different places, but they all   it   s just neat to have   . The house I   m living in right now up here is a hundred-year-old house, and I refurbished it. It   s been our home since 1958, 515 North Eighth Street.  Milligan So when you moved back with your wife, Pat, you all moved into that house?  Fishburn I bought it to be moved. It had to be moved off of Main Street. By buying the house for fifteen hundred dollars, and here it is a four-bedroom, old, old house, but it was in good condition. I bought it for that, and then I had Roy Dollar move the house up on the present site for eight hundred dollars. Took it from Purcell Main Street, up on Eighth Street, and then I had another friend of mine that made all the foundation for it for another thousand dollars. Then I found another friend who was in the plumbing business. He plumbed it, put in a septic system and all that. Then I started working on the structural load by cleaning it, fixing it, and all that. That has been our family home since the kids were just little bitty guys.  Milligan So you kept that house even though you   .  11  Fishburn Was in the military.  Milligan Yeah, you moved a lot.  Fishburn My mom and dad lived in it most of the time.  Milligan Got it.  Fishburn It   s interesting how that all works.  Milligan Yeah, right?  Fishburn It   s home, and so when I got ready to retire from the military, we had the meeting of the family. At that time, we had four children that were high school age, or grade school and high school. I said,    Where do we want to live,    because I owned land in Utah, I owned land out in New Mexico. They said,    Oh, Dad, let   s go back to the old big barn.    That   s what they called it. Pat, my wife, said that would be a good idea, so when I retired in 1980, we came back to the old house. Didn   t have any air conditioning or heat or anything, but it was solid. I spent the next two years refurbishing that old house before I went to work for real estate. That   s where we raised our last four kids was that old, big house. Now they think it   s   they come back home. It   s home.  Milligan Yeah, I can   yeah. We   ll come back to how you got to all that.  Fishburn Yeah, come back to all that.  Milligan Let   s go back to Stillwater. So what was it about Stillwater that gives you that feeling like home?  Fishburn It was because when I went to work in the cafeteria, then that became a fraternity. We all guys that worked in Bennett Hall, we washed pots and pans, and we did all this stuff. We made the best friends, and we were associated with each other. We even associated with all the girls that lived in all the other girls    dorms because they were all working the same way. The dieticians were so nice that they let us all mingle. Whenever we were going to have a get-together, like in Bennett Hall, our dietician would let us have square dance down in the basement. We organized square dance clubs, and we danced our way through college that way. Met all the girls, met the boys and the guys. So many of us, I didn   t marry one of them, but my friends all married a lot of those. Whenever we had our fiftieth anniversary, graduation, then there was one other couple that showed up, and I hadn   t seen them in fifty years. They remembered me.  12  Milligan And you remembered them, it sounds like. So how did you   when you had square dances, was it just the kids who were working in the cafeteria?  Fishburn Yeah, just the girls and boys. We started out dancing just boys and boys, and then we got the girls all involved. We figured out ways because those kind of kids were really good people. They were just good ol   country girls and good ol   country boys, getting together on Saturday night and just enjoying   . Sometimes we   d go to church on Sunday morning. That was the kind of things that built that relationship that was a family of people, that became our best friends forever and ever and ever.  Milligan So that stayed your primary cohort while you were in college? Even though you were in the school of agriculture, that was your primary cohort?  Fishburn Yeah.  Milligan How did you     Fishburn Oh, I wanted to be invited into a fraternity and stuff. I examined that, but I didn   t like the fraternity guys. I mean, they were good guys, but I thought it was a lot of fun that as an independent I could date some of the sorority girls that were presidents of the Pi Phis or all that stuff. (Laughs) It was fun  We had the Student Union, which was really a center focal point to go dancing in the Student Union all the time. They had special programs there. Then we had our special programs with all of the kids we worked with.  Milligan Yeah, so when you did the program with the kids you   worked with and you would have the basement square dances, did you have recorded music?  Fishburn Yeah, there was a guy, an older person, a man and his wife, who liked to teach square dancing. They found out about us, and   they would all volunteer, then, to come. Finally, we were so good that a group of us, we danced together as a group, and we would go up to Ponca City. When Oklahoma City had a big national square dance festival, we went to that. It was stuff like that. It just expanded. It all started in the basement, and it just got bigger and bigger and bigger.  Milligan It does sound like it got bigger.  Fishburn It did  It was great because then we got all the freshman girls to come in, and here we were, sophomores and juniors. We had the pick of the litter. It was a lot of fun.  Milligan So you recruited the freshman girls to come dance in Bennett Hall, or was it grown out by then?  13  Fishburn Way grown out by then. We had other places. It   s amazing how back in that generation, you didn   t have all of this stuff that they have now to mess with them. We had to figure out our own stuff. I didn   t have a car at college until I was a junior. We just didn   t have any vehicles. It was too expensive. You couldn   t afford one. My first little Ford car I bought from my cousin, I bought it for  150. I worked all summer and made  150. It was a    41 Ford Coupe, and got to take that to college. The next time, I got a Model A Roadster; took it to college. Stuff like that, but we could always figure out ways because in the summertime we   d work real hard and make some money.  Milligan Did you   what did you need a car for at school?  Fishburn Just to haul girls around.  Milligan Primarily just to date?  Fishburn Yeah, that was the main thing. That   s the only way you could get a girl out by herself was in a car. (Laughter)  Milligan Where   d you go?  Fishburn Out to Boomer Lake. Isn   t that amazing what all you do? But that   s part of life and part of growing up and seeing that because we made friends with people that I   m still friends with today. We all went to college together, and then we did some things. It has brought that OSU symbol into our whole family just because I went off to college back in 1951. It   s amazing. It is just so interesting.  Milligan It   s interesting how it stays with you.  Fishburn It does, you know it? Then you see your children, your grandchildren, probably won   t be too many years the great-grandkids will all be   . They   re all getting educated. Every one of my children have a college degree. Every one of the boys has a commission in the armed services. They   ve all been successful parents. They   ve had ups and downs, some have had divorces, some have had this, but they   ve all worked it all out, just like Brett who just called me now, checking on Dad. That   s what it   s all about  It   s whenever your kids come back to you and bring with them the love that they have and appreciation for their mother and for their father. They all want to come back home to the old big house.  Milligan So is that what brought you back to Purcell?  Fishburn Yeah, they all voted for it, yes.    We want to go back to the old big house.    They called it the old big barn. Didn   t have any central heat or air or 14  anything in it, hot, and we got here in 1980. A hundred degrees, no water, every lake is dried up.  Milligan Were your parents still alive by then?  Fishburn Yeah, my dad was. My mom wasn   t.  Milligan And still lived in Purcell?  Fishburn Yeah, my aunts and uncles all lived here.  Milligan Is that what brought you back in the mid-  50s when you came back to Purcell?  Fishburn The   50s   my mom and dad, yeah. I knew that was home, and I didn   t like the job. I hated the job I had. They cancelled the job I had with soil conservation as a soil scientist and put me in as a work unit conservationist. It was more of a political job, and so I worked it for a year, I guess it was. I hated it, so I said,    I   m going.    Dad said,    Why don   t you come on home?     Milligan So that was through the Department of Agriculture.  Fishburn Yeah, so I checked out of the net and came home in January of    58 with a new wife and a new job to work for myself, hauling motor freight and selling farm machinery.  Milligan I bet you knew all about it.  Fishburn Yeah.  Milligan When did you and your wife get married? If you didn   t tell your parents until you came home in January, when did you     Fishburn Yeah, we got married on January   . I   d have to look and see, but I think it was, like, the fifteenth of January,    58. January of    58.  Milligan So you married her right before you left town and   .  Fishburn Run off to Clayton, New Mexico, because that   s where her mom and dad had got married.  Milligan Oh, really?  Fishburn In Clayton, New Mexico.  15  Milligan Isn   t that   well, I   m going to not make any assumptions, but why would one run off to New Mexico to get married from Oklahoma?  Fishburn Because it was cheaper and easier. We were running out of town; we were escaping.  Milligan Escaping who?  Fishburn Anybody. (Laughter) That was a tradition. You could run over to New Mexico and get married, and nobody would know about it.  Milligan But usually you only did that if you didn   t want somebody to know about it.  Fishburn That   s right. We didn   t want nobody   she was pregnant.  Milligan Oh  So did her parents know that you all were dating, and knew that you were going to get married, or you just took off?  Fishburn Oh, yeah. There was a long story behind all of that, but it was really real. I made a decision, which was really another prophetic decision because, like I told you, the old professor had told me that I would marry a girl in Boise City. She was the best thing that ever happened to me, and she was ready to leave. She wanted out of Boise City so bad because her parents and her weren   t getting along at all. She was tickled to death, and we didn   t invite anybody to the wedding. We just went off and got married.      Milligan Let   s go back to soil conservation. What I know so far is that you chose it because there were few people in it.  Fishburn That   s right, not a lot of graduates. In the soil science business, you had to take physics and math and all kinds of stuff that the normal ag guy at animal husbandry or something like that didn   t have to do any of that stuff. It was a tougher course. Like plant science and soil morphology, see, I took chemistry. I guess it was either eighteen or twenty-six hours of chemistry. You had to do all of this as part of the curriculum that Dr. Fenton Gray and his associates, the Reed brothers, were all there. I figured that if you took the most difficult one that you should be able to make a living out of it. That was what it was all about, was that becoming a soil scientist assured you of starting out with a GS-5  pay grade , and then in the first year you could get to a GS-7, and hopefully you   d get on up the line. It had been very slow in the past because there had been not a lot of soil scientists develop, but it did. I was on the very front end of all of it.  Milligan So it was a program just starting up when you got into it?  Fishburn Yeah, it was just starting up, yeah. 16  Milligan I see. Were there fewer people in the program because it was new and because it was     Fishburn It was tougher.  Milligan    harder?  Fishburn It was tougher. It was hard, took a little longer. I had to go an extra semester. I did it in four and a half years instead of four.  Milligan So when you got started with the schoolwork and soil science, what did you think about it when you were doing it?  Fishburn Loved it.  Milligan Really?  Fishburn Yeah, I was working with soil. I was mapping soils, I was working across it, watching it, seeing what was going on. It was an outside deal. Then the epitome of all was that whenever I got to go do the soil mapping itself, I did the soil mapping as a course at Stillwater. I mapped a quarter section of land for Dr. Gray. He wanted me to come back as an assistant deal, so I got to work another semester teaching the kids to map soils. I took them out on the farm, and we did all the stuff. That was fun, and I knew it was something I liked to do. When you like to do something, that   s good. It worked. Whenever I got to Boise City, Oklahoma, they   d just started a brand new team there. The team was made up of some good friends of mine. One of the friends became a lifelong friend forever, and I still visit him in Utah, him and his wife. We dated together; we run around together; we stayed in the same apartments together. It   s one of those kind of friendships. Those kind of things is what made it all work.  Milligan Did you know when you chose soil science that there was a pretty good chance you were going to get a USDA job upon graduation?  Fishburn Well, Dr. Gray said he thought it would be. That was no guarantee, but he thought. He said,    I   m in on the ground floor of it.    He was  You got to get in the ground floor with the guys that you want to go do with. It wasn   t something that I had to go out and beg somebody for a job. My friend who had graduated a year ahead of me, he couldn   t find a job because they hadn   t started this program. He had to work for the State of Oklahoma going around checking   because he had so much chemistry and everything like that, he was checking cafes and stuff, seeing if they were all sterile and everything.  17  Milligan Oh, yeah, like food inspecting.  Fishburn Whenever this program opened up, then all of us guys who had done this a year before, we graduated a year   luckily, I was right on the ground floor. I just walked right into a GS-5 soil science job with the Department of Agriculture.  Milligan So right when you graduated, basically.  Fishburn Yeah   because I graduated in January, and on February 6, I was in Boise City, Oklahoma, mapping soils. I walked in and said,    I   m here.    They said,    You   re too young.    I looked just like that picture right there. (Laughter)  Milligan Oh, that is young. So there were people that had come in to start the office that had graduated from A M the few years before   .  Fishburn One year before, basically. Most all of them took other jobs. My friend, Allgood, he had been out a year or two, so he was ready to go. He wanted to do that. He was good at it. He was a brilliant young man.  Milligan Is that your friend who was doing food science?  Fishburn Yeah, he was a brilliant young man. We had known each other in college a little bit. We hadn   t been real close or anything because he was also doing different living standards than what I was. Anyway, I never regret that I made that decision because that   s what really   if it hadn   t been for that, and I hadn   t gone to Boise City, Oklahoma, and I had not met Pat Robinson and she got impregnated, and I married her so that we would have children, then   . It all works  Today, that   s why I   m here today is because all of that stuff. You look back on it now and see why it all happened. It was all because Heavenly Father was taking care of you. You just got to believe that.  Milligan You had a lot more examples of how your life fit together than just that, I think, moving forward. I   m curious. Right before we come back to, sort of, how that moved from your time moving back to Purcell, since that soil conservation office just started, what was your job? What were you all doing? What was the work?  Fishburn What I did, we had aerial photographs of every piece of ground in Cimarron County. We went out and did it by sections, 640 sections. We would walk over that ground, and we would determine the type of soil that was in that. Then we drew lines on that map of the soil deal. We had names for every piece of soil that there is, whether it   s Renfrow or caliche or whatever. It was all different kinds. We mapped that soil because that would give production information to the soil conservation, the ASC  Agricultural 18  Stabilization and Conservation  office, who was going to pay people to farm, for soils and what kind of nutrients you had to put into that soil in order for it to grow wheat or   . It was dryland farming out in the Panhandle. We later introduced irrigation, but we knew President Eisenhower had hired Ezra Taft Benson to be the Secretary of Agriculture. He was a great agriculture man, had his doctorate degree and everything from out at Utah State University.  He knew what he was doing, and so that   s why he formed   they got Congress to devote money to run these programs to map all the soils in the United States. That would be productive because this had gone on in Israel and other parts of the world, mapping soils. Ralph Murphy, who was our boss, had been around the whole world mapping soils. He knew soils like no other man in the world because a soil has a certain depth and it has all different zones in it. You dig holes and you make sure   . Nowadays it   s all computerized. Then days, it was a shovel and a probe. We were the guys that invented all of this, what we have today. That was what was so fun was that we were traveling around in pickup trucks, mapping soils by county by county by county, going all over the state of Oklahoma. That   s what my friend finally, he did that all of his life. He did it for the next forty years.  Milligan Did I hear his name right: Allman?  Fishburn Allgood.  Milligan Allgood.  Fishburn Yeah, Ferris P. Allgood.  Milligan Oh, it   s his last name, got it.  Fishburn Yeah, Ferris P. Allgood, he got his PhD from Oklahoma State University in soil morphology.  Milligan All right, and he did that for a long time afterwards. He made a career of it.  Fishburn He made a career out of it. He worked at it until he was sixty years old or more. He retired from the Soil Conservation Service, but I beat him a long ways by retiring from the military as a lieutenant colonel.  Milligan In 1980.  Fishburn Yeah. (Laughter) It   s all interesting how     Milligan It is   19  Fishburn    that works.  Milligan Yeah, it is. I wonder if there is a significance on why you all were centered out in the Panhandle.      Fishburn That   s where it started from.  Milligan That   s where the office started from, but   .  Fishburn No, that   s where the soil   they picked out the soil in Cimarron County and Beaver County and Texas County, all the way across there. That was the beginning, why the Department of Agriculture decided that was a good place to start it.  Milligan Did that have anything to do with the Dust Bowl then, all that?  Fishburn Yeah, I   m sure it was.  Milligan Yeah, I just   .  Fishburn It was all connected.  Milligan The assumption is easy to make. I just didn   t know if there was any clear   .  Fishburn Because we even had some traces of the Dust Bowl, and we even had some Dust Bowl targets that we changed the way the soil was protected with cover crops and all of this kind of stuff that was not available in the 1930s when it all blew away. We saw the effects of that.  Milligan That were still lingering.  Fishburn Oh, yeah, yeah. It was programs. Like this friend of mine, he was there in the   30s, and he was a boy. My mother-in-law grew up in the Dust Bowl. She had seen all of it at the time when they had to have wet sheets over the windows so they could breathe and everything like that. She was born there in Cimarron County.  Milligan Your mother was?  Fishburn Mother-in-law.  Milligan Oh, your mother-in-law, right.  Fishburn Pat   s mother.  Milligan Right. 20  Fishburn That was a connection that was sort of interesting. It   s all part of   I always bring it back. It was part of Heavenly Father   s plan to save the soil for man to live on so we can have soil today and grow crops. Now agriculture is just plumb out   it   s gone, when you see what the machinery and other stuff   . Right now we have less farmers, but we cover more ground than any other thing in the world.  Milligan What you   re saying is that   s a huge advancement just beyond God.  Fishburn Just beyond, that was so far ahead of what anybody thought about in 1950, where it would be at seventy years later. To be able to live through this and see it, to what has happened, it is a miracle that you   re able to live through all this time and know that you were part of what made something happen in today   s deal.  Milligan Yeah, that is pretty cool.  Fishburn Agriculture is great. You grew up in it. My dad was a great   he liked machinery. He had started out with threshing machines and stuff like that. He wound up with Allis-Chalmer, building little combines so he could   . He believed in all of that progression for machinery because Grandpa Fishburn, my grandfather, was a mule man. He thought that only mules was any good to farm with. My dad sold every mule in the world to get tractors into the hands of people in the    30s.  Milligan So he helped people convert from animal labor to machinery?  Fishburn Right here in Purcell, Oklahoma, in 1939.  Milligan Was that his first business?  Fishburn No, he was in electrical business and stuff like that. He was a mechanic. He was an electrical man. He even built radios and sold them to Indians and stuff. He did all kinds of stuff because he had gone to school at La-Ray Automobile School to learn about electricity. His electrical experience, he could make radios; he could sell radios. He could build starters, generators, magnetos, everything that there was about electricity for the farm work as well as the regular work, yeah.  Milligan Did you pick up some of that?  Fishburn A little bit, but my oldest son is expert at that. He inherited all that characteristic.  Milligan Is your oldest son named for your    21  Fishburn His grandpa.  Milligan His grandpa, so, your dad?  Fishburn Dad was Lewis Fishburn, and my oldest son was Tol Moore Fishburn, named after my grandfather.  Milligan Oh, your grandfather. I thought you   d said that somewhere in there.  Fishburn Yeah, that   s right.  Milligan After you collected a wife, you moved back to Purcell. You mentioned a little bit about that, that you had purchased a business or went into business with   .  Fishburn Yeah, I did. There was a man   and my dad knew a lot of people because he   d been here for years. There was a guy asking if   . He said,    Ron, I could get you a motor freight business, and we can use the building down here in Purcell,    that Dad owns. We owned a nice business, so we built a deck on it. I came back. I   d been making three hundred dollars a month at the soil conservation business. That was my salary, thirty-six hundred dollars a year. I came back to Purcell, and I could make as much money hauling freight in my pickup as I did then. I could make three hundred dollars a month. I was in the Army Reserves. I was second lieutenant, and I could make money by   Reserve building was right here where we   re sitting right now.  Milligan Here in your     Fishburn Yeah, in this building. The office wasn   t like this or anything because I   ve redone all that, but anyway, this was where I had my business. Army Reserves, that paid me about fifty dollars a month or something like that. Money like that helped out. I drilled, and I went to Fort Sill to train some, and different things. I was in a unit right here in Purcell. Come down every Tuesday night and drilled. Make about ten bucks or something.  Milligan So you did that on top of   .  Fishburn Being a freight man. I was selling and trading, anything could do. If I could buy an old tractor and fix it up and sell it, make a dollar, that was all right. I could trade anything. It was a fun job, and so started raising children on that type of income. Then one day, sitting right here in this building, my Reserves sergeant come by and said,    Would you like to fly airplanes?    I said,    Oh, man, would I     (Laughs) They said,    We   ve got an opening coming up for a helicopter pilot.    I said,    Where do I sign?    (Laughter) The 22  summer of 1960, I spent all that summer doing physicals, taking tests, examinations, and everything to try and pass everything. I could pass the physical all right; that was no problem with that. Then I was qualified to be an aviator, go to flight school at Fort Rucker, Alabama.  That   s where I traded, quit my motor freight agency. Gave that away  Just gave it to a guy. Of course, he ruined it. I mean, he quit within six months. He didn   t last. It was too much work. I was off to flight school; left my wife and children right here in Purcell. We had two little boys, Tol and Brett, and Pat stayed in the old, big house. I went down there because I wanted to go down and fly, make sure I soloed so that I could know that I was going to stay in the program because they was washing out. Fifty percent of the people got washed out. Sure enough, I thought I was just going to be   they had a new kind of program, a new kind of airplane. My instructor was really a good Oklahoma guy that liked me. He got me through the program to solo.  Milligan The one that was in Alabama?  Fishburn Yeah.  Milligan He was from Oklahoma?  Fishburn He had been born and raised right here. He was a World War II fighter pilot. We had all those old guys that were teaching us young guys. That was back in 1960,    61.  Milligan What did your wife think about it when you told her,    I   m going to give up this really strong paycheck and then move toward this other thing   ?  Fishburn She was with me all the way. Never even griped one bit. She never, never said that I couldn   t do it. I had so many of my friends    wives who told them they couldn   t fly, or they couldn   t do this, they couldn   t go to war, they couldn   t do anything. She knew that the main thing was to have a happy husband.  Milligan Was she a happy wife?  Fishburn Yeah. She was the best wife in the world, turned out. Forty-nine years of just great   and she always went with me. We lived all over the United States. We   d stay a year or two in one, three, whatever. We joined the Mormon Church, and that was what was the catalyst that made our life so good.  Milligan Talk to me a little bit about that. I think you mentioned that you joined the Mormon Church in 1963, so it was after you were flying. It was after you had really gone full time in the military, correct? 23  Fishburn Yeah, I   d already graduated from flight school. We   d been in the Methodist Church during that time. I arrived at Fort Carson, Colorado, in 1963,    62 actually. I had a two-year assignment in the military to do more flying. That   s what I wanted to do because I needed to get more hours, more time. Didn   t realize there would be a war come along. That was not in the future, at least for me, anyway. I hadn   t thought about that.  Milligan This was on the tail of the Korean.  Fishburn Yeah, right after Korea, see. Then we had advisors going over to Southeast Asia. I wasn   t worried about that. I was just wanting to be in the military, flying helicopters, and that   s what I got a job doing. They assigned me to the 5th Mech Division  5th Infantry Division (Mechanized)  in Fort Carson. I was in a air cavalry unit that we had helicopters we could fly, but they were very primitive, so primitive that we had to almost make believe we were doing what we were doing.  Milligan How is that?  Fishburn It   s really interesting, but I got to fly little ol   baby helicopters, little two-place helicopters, all over Colorado. That was gaining experience, and that was what you wanted to do, was to learn. We   d go out and chase coyotes and do things and have fun.  Milligan You went from school in Alabama   .  Fishburn Yeah, back here to   . See, I went through the  Cessna  L-19 Bird Dog   I went through fixed-wing first in Alabama. Then I got back to Purcell, and I didn   t have a job. I was working part time for a company up in Norman for a little while, awaiting orders to go to chopper school down in Fort Wolters, Texas. I didn   t get to Fort Wolters until about January because I   d got back out here about October, November. They had that little break in it, so we just lived in the old, big house. I worked to make enough money to buy beans and taters and stuff. Then I got orders to go to Fort Wolters, Texas, so I was back making money again. As a lieutenant on flight status, I was making six hundred dollars a month, which at that time was good money, going from three hundred dollars a month to six hundred dollars a month. It all worked out, and then I was at Fort Wolters, graduated from there in the    62 timeframe. I was only down there about a year or two years.  Then I applied for active duty to go back in the military permanently, or to some degree permanent. I put in that; my Reserve guys helped me do that. I got back on active duty, so that   s when I went to Fort Carson because we had a two-year assignment in the military. That was going to be a good deal. Got that going, and then we moved to Colorado. Then after one year, they 24  came along with this program of being an advisor going to Vietnam (they didn   t call it Vietnam; they just said    Southeast Asia   ) to help the forces over there with flying helicopters. We were going to fly the H-21    Flying Banana     Piasecki Workhorse Helicopter . It was a twin engine, big ol   airplane, eighty-eight foot long. It was being used there a lot because it had come out of the military surplus thing. They said,    You got to be qualified in a bigger helicopter.    They invented the Huey, the A-Model Huey. We had one of them at Fort Carson, Colorado. They let me get twenty-five hours with an instructor in that Huey before I went to   .  I got that twenty-five hours, then they said,    Okay, now you got to go to Fort Rucker and get H-21rating.    So I went down there that summer, got that rating, which I loved to fly it. It was really a big ol   bird. Then I had orders to go to Southeast Asia.     My wife, she had been baptized in the Mormon Church. She said,    Before you go to combat, you ought to get baptized. That will make me feel better because you   re going off to war.    Of course, she was really sold on the Latter-day Saints Church. I said,    Okay, I   ll do it, to experiment with it to see if that   s really what we think it is.    We thought it was really going to be an excellent church to raise our family in. It all worked out. I went off to Vietnam, had just been baptized in    63, April 6 of    63. I got to Vietnam in the summer of    63, and that   s when I got assigned to fly Dustoff helicopters, Medevac. Had five helicopters in Vietnam at that time. They needed ten pilots. They had nine, and I was number ten. General  Richard  Stilwell said,    You   ll go over to the Medevac bunch and fly.         Milligan Is that what you thought you were going to do?  Fishburn No, I had no idea I was going to do that.  Milligan What did you think you were going to do?  Fishburn Just fly the old H-21s, hauling troops around. This was an exciting project because you were going out and rescuing people that had been shot up or shot down or what have you. Medevac was like the MASH hospital. That was what we were assigned to, a MASH hospital, just like the one that you watch on TV. It   s just like that; it   s really real.  Milligan Really?  Fishburn I got to fly with some guys checking me out in the situation of flying in combat, getting shot at for something or another. My buddy, Bill Scanlon, was an old Marine guy, so I was flying with him. He was a expert at flying the helicopter, so I got to learn really well from him. That was really a neat experience, and I survived  I only got to fly Dustoff for six months, then I went to gunships up at Pleiku for another six months commanding a platoon of   gunships, helicopters. We   d put guns on helicopters. Didn   t have the 25  Cobras or any of that kind of stuff back in those   . We were inventing all that kind of stuff. We went out and had fun covering the guys that were putting troops on the ground, and we would cover them with fire support around them. It keeps the bad guys, their heads knocked down or something or another. It was interesting to do all of that, and made it.  Milligan So you were over there a year. Is that right?  Fishburn Yeah, one year. Didn   t see the family for a year, but I talked to them. You couldn   t even talk to them on the telephone, but I was talking to my mother the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated. I was in a hotel in Saigon on leave while we was getting a helicopter worked on. I was able to patch through on a patched line with the civilian radio guys that could do that. I was talking to my mother, and she said,    I   ve just watched it  John F. Kennedy   s just been killed     I was one of the first guys in Vietnam to hear that he   d been assassinated.  Milligan Oh, gosh, how   d you feel about that?  Fishburn You knew it was going to happen. You thought,    That   s sad,    but it doesn   t stop the war. You just keep on going. Lyndon B. Johnson became the president immediately. When I got home at the end of that tour, Lyndon B. Johnson was president. Kennedy was dead, and then we started the real Vietnam War.  Milligan Yeah, you were there on the really early years.  Fishburn Very first of it, yeah. I stayed until the very last.  Milligan Explain to me that. So you went over in    63, came back in    64, so you saw that there was turmoil. So you knew. Was that     Fishburn I became an instructor pilot to train the warrant officers. If I wasn   t in Vietnam, I was training people to go to Vietnam, so I did that for ten years. Then I went to Command and General Staff College in    71, which is really a select college for Army officers. I didn   t like it, but you had to do it in order to be promoted. I was a major in the Army at that time. I didn   t think I   d ever make lieutenant colonel, but I went to that school. Out of that school, they picked ten majors to command air cav troops in Vietnam in    72. That was the epitome of what I   d always wanted to do, was command an air cavalry troop in combat.  Milligan Really? What made you want to do that?  Fishburn Because I   d been trained to do that, and you always want to command because you   ll have three or four hundred kids working for you. You want 26  to go out and whup up on the bad guys. You want to be a successful leader. Teaching leadership is what it   s all about. That   s what I got to do, and that was what I liked because I wanted to be the epitome of leadership in the air cavalry business. Now it   s worldwide, but that was the beginning of it all.  Milligan So from    64 until, well, for the next decade you were an instructor of some sort and moving up the military ranks at the same time. So where did you   when you came back, did you come back to Colorado?  Fishburn No, I came back   I had left Fort Rucker as an instructor. When I came back, I came back to Mineral Wells, Texas, to the primary helicopter flight school there to teach warrant officers how to fly basic helicopters. I was their platoon leader, chief of operations and stuff, and teaching flying. I was flying. I had students that I taught how to fly and stuff like that.  Milligan Were there things that you learned that made your experience unique having spent a year in Vietnam by that point?  Fishburn Yeah.  Milligan Do you remember what some of those, some of the things that you were able to share were? Like, what were some of the points that you made sure to tell the students you were training that would probably go on to that?  Fishburn What I learned to do was that I had an ability to fly with young pilots that wanted to be pilots, to make a determination if they were fit and if they could cut the mustard on being a combat pilot. My instructors sometimes would give up on guys, and they   d say,    I don   t think he   s going to be able to make it.    Whenever they had those kind of people, I said,    Let me fly with them. I want to check them. I want to see if we can teach them how to fly good enough that they can do that.    As a leader, I would talk to them and tell them   . You got to be a leader. You got to be able to understand people and do things. That   s what I did. I had that ability to teach leadership, and my guys made it. There was two people that I worried about, and they were two warrant officers. One was named Nutt, and the other was named Nussbaum. We had worked and worked trying to get them certified. I thought that if they were flying with, if Nutt was flying with a pretty good pilot or Nussbaum was flying with a pretty good pilot, it   d probably be all right. When they went into the other phase of training, they had two ends: Nutt and Nussbaum. The next bunch of guys put them together in the same airplane, and they flew it in the ground. Killed them.  Milligan That   s something you knew     Fishburn I always remembered.  27  Milligan    was a bad situation.  Fishburn I didn   t think they were   I never dreamed about that happening. It happens, so you learn to do that. You have to deal with death in helicopters and airplanes. When they make mistakes, it kills them, but you   re trying to train them to where they   re good enough that they won   t   . Sometimes they just get too excited. We were training them down at Fort Wolters, Texas. I remember one night this crackerjack warrant officer, he thought he could fly low level at night. He flew right into the highline wires. Killed him, just come apart. Stuff like that. You hope that they will be smart enough because there   s no such thing as an old, bold pilot. There   s old pilots, but there   s no old, bold pilots. They   re all dead. That   s what I always taught them. You can   t monkey around with something like that because it   ll kill you. That   s what I teach my kids.  Milligan Did you have to learn that yourself, or did somebody teach it to you?  Fishburn Yeah, I learned it. You learn all of that by doing it. It   s a background because I   m a little bit older than everybody. I   d been in the Reserves and stuff, so I was an older lieutenant than most lieutenants were. Then I was an older captain. I stayed a captain for eight years, or major, I guess it was, for eight years. Maturity makes you safer.  Milligan Do you think that it made a difference that by the time you started flying, you already had a wife and two kids at home?  Fishburn Yeah, that   s a big, better deal because they   re very important, the family, because you want to live to raise your family. I never took a lot of the chances. I probably took chances, but they were calibrated chances. I never dreamed about dying. I always knew that I could handle it, even though I had some close calls. I knew that the good Lord was on my side.  Milligan I think that   s interesting because it was so, so close from the time that you decided to get baptized in the Mormon Church. That was a big faith decision, to the time that you left for something that was really dangerous, a year  So one of the things that you said was when you decided to get baptized, it was your wife had made the decision for herself, and you thought you   d try it and see how it fit you. So how were you able to make the decision of whether it fit when you were a really far way away from most Mormon churches?  Fishburn I had faith. You got to have faith, I think is the key element. Things happened that I was still alive and that I had been spared. When I   after one year of flying combat, and coming back to San Francisco, and landing on American soil   because we hadn   t been able to even let anybody know we 28  were Americans in Southeast Asia. Couldn   t wear a flag or anything like that.  Milligan Because it wasn   t official yet that the US was involved.  Fishburn Wasn   t official. So to come back to good ol   San Francisco, and then I said,    Heavenly Father, there must be a plan.    That   s when I told my wife, I said,    I believe the church is real. It   s true. It   s got some things we want to work with for the rest of our life.    I thought that, and then I exemplified it by the fact that I changed my whole lifestyle of what I was, no more smoking or drinking. I quit. What we call    live the word of wisdom.    It works. Once I started all of that, the kids started to growing. Then I got involved in Boy Scouts. I wanted to raise my boys to all be great Americans. The military fit me; it was what I wanted to do. I loved it. When you love a job, you want to stay with it forever. You never quit.  Milligan Did you have that same passion for it when you were just in the Reserves?  Fishburn In the Reserves I loved to fly because I was different than anybody else.  Milligan How   s that?  Fishburn I could fly  Nobody else could do that.  Milligan Because you were in the Reserves and could fly.  Fishburn Yeah, see, I had a helicopter that I could get from the Reserve unit, and fly down here to Purcell, and land in my backyard.  Milligan Did you do that?  Fishburn Yeah. (Laughter)  Milligan I can   t even imagine that.  Fishburn That really impressed my neighbor who was in bed, sick, because she had a stroke. When I took off, I flew right over her house, and she said,    Oh, Ron, that is so great. You did that just for me, didn   t you, so I could see it?    Stuff like that. I still give airplane rides to people that   . Just the other day, I took a little boy. He wanted to go fly so bad in my little airplane.  Milligan Do you keep one hangared around here?  Fishburn Yeah. He came down, (his grandpa brought him down) and his mom came along and his grandma. I took him for a ride all round in the little 150. We landed, and then the grandpa come over and said,    My daughter   s never got 29  to ride in one of those. Would you let her ride, too?       Yeah, get in     I took her for a ride around the area. You know, people enjoy doing things that they   d never get to do in their life. Never had those two people ever been in a airplane.  Milligan Had you ever flown before you took up the offer?  Fishburn No.  Milligan How did you know that you were going to like to do it?  Fishburn I don   t know. My brother was flying. He liked it.  Milligan Your younger brother was flying?  Fishburn Flying for the Navy, yes. I just always   because we   d watch those old airplanes take off and land up at Goldsby when I was a little kid. I thought that would be   . I had rode in an airplane in the 1930s at Norman (there was an airshow there of some sort) in an old Ford Trimotor. My dad took me for a ride in the airplane, and thought that was pretty neat. We got to fly, and we thought the little cars are what we wanted. That was what this little nine-year-old boy told me. When we got back, he said,    Oh, I want to get some of those little cars that were running around on the ground.    (Laughter)  Milligan It   s true.  Fishburn I get to help people a lot. This friend of mine that ran the grocery store up here, why, his son and his friend had been over to Ada. Coming back from Ada one night, they ran off the road and hit a big deal and killed both of them. They couldn   t find them. They didn   t know where they were at or anything. This one boy who worked there, he was an assistant manager. His wife woke him up at one o   clock in the morning. Says,    I just had a vision. Call Ron Fishburn right now. He can find that crash site.    He called me right about midnight, one o   clock, and I said,    Yeah, we can do that. Meet me at the airport at daylight in the morning, and we   ll search.    I took off from the airport at Purcell at daylight. I flew directly to the crash site, and there was the pickup in the ditch that they had driven into and killed them.  Both of them were sitting there. Both bodies were in the pickup. Things like that let you know that somebody talks to you. A guy had lost his ol   cow, was down in the river. She was having a baby calf. He said,    Ron, could you take us flying on the river so we can find the ol   cow? She   s having a baby.    We went out and flew the river, found the ol   cow. She was in the woods. He couldn   t get to it on a horse searching because you couldn   t see through the bushes. He went back to the airport, he got in his pickup, went over and got on his ol   horse, went out there, and brought the ol   cow in with a baby. 30  Things like that makes you have talents to do that nobody else can do because you have the ability to fly. That   s what   s so fun.  Milligan And you   re still doing it.  Fishburn Yeah, still doing it.  Milligan So I know that you retired out of the military in 1980, so you went to   what was the school that you went to in    71 or    72 that you said you didn   t want to do?  Fishburn Oh, Command and General Staff College.  Milligan Why didn   t you think you were going to like it?  Fishburn It was work; it wasn   t flying. It was schoolwork, but you had to do it in order to be promoted. It was one of those deals. I enjoyed it because I was a Scout leader and I did a lot of other fun things with the family. It was a family deal, and I got to be with them before I was chosen to go to Vietnam out of that school. They all said,    Where are we going to live?    I said,    Well, my boys are about high-school age,    the two oldest ones, Tol and Brett. I said,    I think we better go to Utah. I want to serve as a   I can get a job out there when I get back from Vietnam as a ROTC instructor. That way the boys can do church,    what they call   it   s a release-time church program that you can do while you   re in high school when you   re in the Utah country where all the Mormons are. That   s what I did. It worked.  Milligan So you moved the family to Utah because you   .  Fishburn I bought a house in Utah.  Milligan Yeah?  Fishburn Yeah, bought a house in Utah, and I went to Vietnam. Pat stayed there with six kids.  Milligan Brave woman.  Fishburn Boy, she was tough. It was the coldest winter that had ever happened in Cache Valley, Utah. Went to fifty below zero. It froze the water pipes in the ground. I took leave, (this was in    72) so they let me have some leave to come home. I was commanding the air cab troop at Pleiku. I got home, and everything was froze to the ground. I spent the next ten days getting everything, put heat back in the house that was good enough to keep it all from freezing. They said,    Okay, the war is going to be over.    I called them, and I said,    Do you want me to come back?    They said,    Yeah, come back 31  and stand down the troop.    I got on the airplane and flew back to Vietnam. Got there and stood down, give all the stuff back to the bad guys, closed down my office, everything I had. When I started to leave Vietnam, I had to hitchhike a ride on a VC airplane. I got down to Saigon, and I was still trusting people. A Vietnamese offered me a ride back down to where my headquarters would be. He was being so nice, I decided I   d get out at the   . I said,    Let me off right here at the PX, and I   ll get you some stuff out of it.    Soon as I got out of the Jeep that had all my stuff in it, he drove off. He took everything I had. All I had was what I had on me, just my flight suit. I never did find that. Lost everything, my records, everything that I wanted to take back home to Oklahoma.  Milligan Walking out the door.  Fishburn So I gave all of that to the Viet Cong. It all worked out, though. I got back to Utah, and they let me stay on as an instructor at the university. I did that until   . Finally had to get orders to move because they only let me stay there four years. I said,    Well, where are you going to send me?    I was talking to my people. They said,    I don   t know. We don   t know.    I kept calling up there, and finally the little ol   gal that answered the phone, (I don   t know, she might   ve been the cleaning lady there or something) she looked on the desk and said,    Looks like they   re going to send you to Fort Knox, Kentucky.    I said,    Fort Knox, Kentucky, I don   t want to go there, not as a staff officer.    I weaseled around, and I said,    I want to go to the defense information school over by Indianapolis,    so I could become a person who was involved in advertising and public affairs and all that.  They finally let me do it. I tried to get them to let me get a master   s degree at the university.    Nah, it costs too much money.    Wouldn   t do that. I went down there. Then I had to take a little ol   staff job as a lieutenant colonel in the brigade. It was just sort of a muffy job. I did it because I was over there at the ROTC headquarters, talking to the general, saying,    I want out of this mess I   m in.    My friend, he was head of the advertising and public affairs for ROTC for that region. He said,    I   m going to retire.    I said,    Okay, I want your job.    I went over there and convinced the general that I needed that job. We pulled some strings, and I got the job for another two years by staying at Fort Knox. They were wanting to ship me off to Korea or somewhere or another as an unassigned deal.    Don   t want to do that.     Milligan Why did they want to send you to Korea?  Fishburn Oh, it   s just they don   t have any spots for lieutenant colonels. They had one there, so they just want to get rid of you. I said,    You just   .    In my mind, I said,    Okay.    They said,    Okay.    Finally, they agreed. The general, he wrote a good letter on me. Said,    I want him over here.    I did. I stayed that two years, and then they came up wanting to still run me off somewhere. I 32  said,    That   s the easy way. I   ll just retire,    because I had my twenty-some years in. Had twenty-six years.  Milligan So retired in 1980, right?  Fishburn Yeah, 1980. Got back here in September.  Milligan Came back to Purcell. I have one question about that, and then I think we can come back to   . I think this is really interesting and significant because you were at the beginning of Vietnam before it was Vietnam, and you were at the very end. You helped close it out. What   s the insight? I mean, there   s that whole time period. You saw it all from one perspective or another. I   m just curious.  Fishburn My perspective is it was a job well done. I didn   t mind it at all. I have no regrets. I think I did more good with people, with young soldiers, young aviators, young people, and as a commander I was able to influence people for good. I was not a renegade type, bar-hopping person, but I was   . To prove that, which it identified that this one young warrant officer that flew for me, he was a bright young man. He was just out of college. ... He had taken a lot of pictures of our operation. He went on back home; he got out of the military. Went back and joined the Reserve forces in Wisconsin or somewhere up in there. We never talked to each other again. That was thirty years later before he discovered through the Vietnam Helicopter Pilots Association, that Ron Fishburn was still alive, living in Purcell, Oklahoma. He couldn   t resist to give me a call and check in with me. He had gone on to the Reserves, and he flew for the Air Force and in the Reserve deal. He made colonel and everything. He had really done well. He was so tickled. He sent me a picture of me walking down to a meeting in Pleiku, and he said,    Ron, you   re the greatest leader I   ve ever had.    Whenever you have a young guy that grows up and says,    You   re the best commander that I   ve ever worked for in my life,      . I said,    I didn   t ask for anything. I was just doing the best I could.     Milligan And it sounds like you recognized that was a skill you had     Fishburn Yeah, it was.  Milligan    and tried to develop it.  Fishburn It was a leadership skill, yeah. I did that   even after all of this, my leadership skills then continued on.  Milligan So you came back to Purcell. Your family voted to come back to the big barn, so you moved back to Purcell, out of all the options you had.  33  Fishburn Yeah, and you know why I came back here? Because I hadn   t a bit more landed here than the mayor said,    Ron, would you serve on the city council?     Milligan So you walked back in the town doors, and you were already tapped back in.  Fishburn Yeah.  Milligan You had family. Your dad was, I think, a pretty strong businessman in the area, as well.  Fishburn Oh, yeah, he was a good businessman. They knew Ron Fishburn as the hero of Purcell, militarily-wise.  Milligan Did they keep up with your military record pretty well, people in town?  Fishburn Oh, yeah, they was in the newspaper all the time. My mother was always bragging about me. Every time I   d come back from Vietnam I   d give talks and tours and stuff about war, helicopters and stuff.  Milligan So even just coming back to visit your parents     Fishburn Come back on leave, yeah.  Milligan    people knew. So you came back, joined city council. You did some other stuff, too.  Fishburn Oh, yeah, I did everything.  Milligan You joined back in the business world.  Fishburn Yeah, I come back in the business world. Went to real estate school at Red Carpet. Got my real estate license because my brother was in the real estate business in Norman, running a program up there. I thought,    That   s probably not a bad idea,    because Mary Wilson, who had the Red Carpet Real Estate Company in Purcell, she said,    Ron, you get free training,    I mean, the whole school. I took the Red Carpet course and got my real estate license. That was a start, so I went to work with her. They were all so nice to me. They let me sell stuff that was hard   they helped me through all the deal. It was a good deal, and I did pretty good. I never made a lot of money out of it, but it was sort of a fun deal.  Milligan You did it for thirty years, right?  Fishburn Yeah. I helped a lot of people, and that   s what it   s all about is taking care of your little ol   town. What all do you see in town right now? You see the new 34  water system, the new police and fire station, and all that is from my foresight. When I got here in 1980, we didn   t have any electricity. Every time you   d turn on your electric, it was liable to go out because United up there would burn all the electricity. The lines were all weak. The town would go into darkness, and the water wasn   t any good. Knew we needed a new water system; we needed a new sewer system; we needed a new electrical system. We did all of that. I served on the city council for about a year or two. Then you had to run for office, so I said,    I might as well because they appointed me to be this job.    I ran, and there was another guy in town that was real favored. He just smoked my chili. I mean, I didn   t even have a chance. He was almost voted in by acclamation by the people, J. C. Miller.  The city then suffered through all of that for the next three or four years. One day, a group of citizens came and said,    Ron.    I said,    What?       Would you run for city council,    because you had to be a Democrat to run. There   s no Republicans allowed to run. I wasn   t a Republican; I wasn   t anything. They said,    You and Don Woolly, would you run to get this city back on its feet, going in the right direction?    We said,    Well, I will if you   ll vote for me, but you   ve got to vote because these old guys that are on there don   t want to change anything. We need all this changed.    Some of them changed from Republican to Democrat so they could even vote in the city election. I said,    If Don and I get elected, we will make this a non-partisan election from now on. We   ll go back just like what the school board is.    We ran, and we smoked their chilies. We were put in, and I never had another opponent for fifteen years.  Milligan You stayed in that long?  Fishburn Stayed in actually a total of eighteen years.  Milligan So how did you get all that change effected? It   s obvious, I will tell you. You drive into town, and you see it.  Fishburn You just start working on it. All the people wanted to do it, and the city council. We had to get the city managers. We had good people thinking good positive things. We just kept work   we got the water deal done. You just got to tell people what you want. You got to have vision. You got to say,    Okay, we want this and this and this and this.    First, they say you   re crazy, and then once   . It   s just like a guy gave us an old caboose from the railroad, Santa Fe Railroad. They said,    Well, we   re just going to pull it off down to the junkyard.    I said,    No, we need to pay respect to the Santa Fe people. Let   s make a Santa Fe Plaza on Main Street. We   ll put the caboose up here on Main Street. We   ll block off this one street right next to the Love Hotel,    which is a very historic building.    We   ll put all this in there, and 35  we   ll make a Santa Fe Plaza.    They said,    Ron, you   re crazy  You   re nuts  You can   t do that. Nobody will let you close down a street.     I said,    Watch, watch, watch.    We closed it down, put some railroad track down up there on that Main Street, and put that caboose on there. We brought in some   at that time the Desert Storm was going on, so the people that had gone to that, we made a monument to put out for them. Made a monument there for the family that gave the caboose, had been great people in the railroad. Even found an old Civil War monument that was laying out in the graveyard out there that needed to be brought in and cleaned up, representing the history of all this country of Purcell. Once it was all in, the first time a guy ran for governor, I had him come down and stand on the back of that caboose and talk. They said,    We sure had a good idea, didn   t we?    (Laughter) Stuff like that is why you do it. Some people said,    We   ll take a bulldozer and push that thing on down the hill,    or something.  The positive people, the guy that run the Love Hotel, he was just tickled to death. You just sway people and show them that good things can happen. We dreamed about all the Purcell police and fire facilities. We knew that it had to be done some time or another because they was living down there in a little ol   bitty rat hole. They said that was Fishburn   s folly by building all of that out there, getting the bonds and all the money together and stuff. To build a fire station, police station, that is top of the list. They all still say,    That was Fishburn   s folly. He wanted all that.    It all worked out whenever we had a really unusual murder in town of a little girl being put in a box and cut up. They found it, and that was when the national media came into Purcell to examine all of that. They saw what a super police station and fire station we had and everything. They said,    Purcell   s not just a little hillbilly town after all, is it?     Milligan So what was the pushback from people who didn   t think that that was a good use of their funds?  Fishburn Money.  Milligan It all came down to money, not because it wasn   t needed?  Fishburn No, they just don   t want you to spend anything. They want you to stay the same. They don   t want to see growth and development. To be on the city council, you got to be twenty years way ahead of everybody else. If you   re not twenty years ahead, you   re not going to get anywhere.  Milligan Do you think you have a good representation now?  Fishburn Yeah, my son   s on the city council.  36  Milligan Good, you better say that  (Laughter)  Fishburn Yeah, we have. We got some good guys over it now. We had to go through some times of real bad, very backward-thinking people, is what I call it.  Milligan Where   d your kid land? Speaking of having   one son   s obviously here. He   s on city council.  Fishburn He   s going to law school. He   s here.  Milligan He   s the OCU?  Fishburn Yeah, and then Brett, number two son, is in Krum, Texas. He works for an oil company. They buy, it   s not oil, but it   s propane gas. He   s been in that business ever since.... When he got married and came to Purcell years ago, I got him a job working for a gas company in town, reading meters. He has brought that all the way through. He put himself through OU by reading meters for the Lone Star Gas Company. He went into the Navy. When he graduated from OU, they sent him to the naval flight program. He went through their program, made ensign. When he started flying, he liked to fly, but there was a lot of other parts of it he didn   t like. He stayed in the Naval Reserves the rest of his life. He got his twenty-seven years in it, but he never did fly anymore. He flew about 120 hours or so, something like that. He got checked out, did all that stuff, but he was more interested in horses than he was airplanes. Brett is such a good guy. He raised four good children. They lived down in Krum, Texas. He lived in the Dallas area, and then he went on down to the Woodlands in Texas by Houston and worked for gas companies. Always a natural gas guy. That   s what he used all his life.  Tol, the oldest boy, he was commissioned to second lieutenant out of the University of Utah. He wanted to go in the military, but he couldn   t get in because it was in the Reserves status. I kept talking to some people in Washington. Finally, one day I was talking to this lady up there, and I said,    I got a son that wants to be an infantry officer really bad. He wants to come on active duty because he   s a Reserve-type guy.    She said,    I   ve got a slot.    I called him on the phone, and I said,    Tol   .    He was working on Volkswagens for an Audi dealer right then. I got him out in front of the car, and I said,    I can get you into Fort Benning, Georgia, to go to the basic officer training course there tomorrow. Would you like to go?    He said,    Oh, yes, I want to go so bad     Sent him down there to go through that, and he came by here on his way. I loaned him my old pickup to drive down there. He ordered a pickup from a guy here in Purcell. He went to Fort Benning and went through the training down there. He was a second lieutenant, but they had to send him to a basic infantry officer course because he   d been in another branch.  37  He went through all of that, and then went to Airborne Ranger stuff and all that. Got pneumonia while he was in ranger school and almost died because of his lungs, got pneumonia and stuff. He finally got through ranger school. Of course, when he got through, by the time he got out of Fort Benning, they sent him to Alaska, and that was 1986. He   s never left. His wife made him get out of the military. Of course, he divorced her then because she become ornery. He was the kind of a guy, about like me, that never gave up. He always figured out a solution for everything. Very good mechanic. He worked for Volkswagen and Audi and all of those guys. He always made a living. If he wasn   t doing the job he was trained to do, he would work on the side. He wound up, kept getting more education. He got a master   s degree in technology from the University of Alaska. He was a tenured professor at the University of Alaska, and they fired him. They closed down his department because they didn   t have a room. The union said,    Oh, we can save you  We can save you     I said,    Your unions can   t save anybody.    Sure enough, they couldn   t.  Then he went to work   . He had some friends over in another department, working for the State of Alaska, training Eskimos how to run engines to make electricity out in little villages. He worked on that and made a lot of friends in the electrical business through the state. One day, the guy running the Greens Creek mill down in Juneau, (they were mining for silver and gold and lead and zinc) they needed an electrician. They hired him to go down and run that program because he was a expert on running programs from the computer end of it and making electricity. He worked for them. They paid him a hundred thousand a year, and they flew him back and forth. He worked two weeks down there and two weeks back home. He got tired of that. He didn   t have a wife; his first wife had deserted. He kept charge of the three girls. He never turned loose of them, even though they lived with their mother. He never gave up on them. One day, then, there was another company called him up and wanted to hire him, so he said,    I   ve got to work for six digits. I don   t work for any less than that.    They said,    Okay.     He got in with them, and they were just starting up a deal. They were different kinds of engineers. He was an electrical engineer, and they were mechanical engineers. That didn   t work, but then the opportunity came available in Anchorage to be working for the electrical department for the City of Anchorage. The salary was about twenty thousand dollars lower than what he wanted to work for. They said,    Go ahead and apply for the job. We   ll take care of all that.    He went ahead and applied, and they hired him as superintendent of electricity for the City of Anchorage and for Palmer and another little town. First month, he got a seventeen thousand dollar raise to get him back up to where he wanted to be. He   s there today, right now, and he   s been there about two years now. He   s had to rework the whole system of people, and that was what they were needing bad, the right people doing the right things. 38  Milligan So leadership skills?  Fishburn He   s really happy; found a good wife. He married a lady that he had met rock climbing in the rock gym. She had never been married, and she had been working for a project in the Arctic. She   s a very good engineer, and she is brilliant. She graduated from Cornell University. I don   t know what it is, but it was all about math and all that stuff. She   d taken some jobs around the world, and she was running the whole computer system for the school system in Anchorage, Alaska. She had been around the world and come back. He was over at the rock gym because he likes to climb rocks. Met Kathy over there, and she still had never married. She was still a genius at school. Nita and I had got married; this was in    07.  Milligan That   s your current wife.  Fishburn Yeah, my current wife. We   d just gotten married. We hadn   t told anybody. We did the same thing.  Milligan You have a habit of that.  Fishburn Yeah, and then Tol and Kathy got married, and they hadn   t told anybody. They called us and said,    We just got married.    He married this   boy, he did a good a job on this one. She   s a perfect angel.  Milligan So that   s three of your kids. So you got a few other kids. Are they just around? You don   t have to go through their whole thing. I just want to know where they   re at and what they   re doing.  Fishburn Tate, he went to the OSU architecture school. He married there and married his classmate in that. When he graduated, he graduated ahead of Margaret. He went to work down at Dallas because OSU has a real good program with the guys in Dallas. He went down and worked for the company down there. When Margaret graduated, she called Tate. They were just buddies. She said,    I   m going to Albuquerque. That   s where we want to go to be architects.    Tate said,    Okay     We moved her; I did. We all moved her out to Albuquerque. They hadn   t got married yet. We got them an apartment and everything. Ol   Tate, he walked into the first place, an individual architect deal, and they hired him on the spot.  Milligan So are they still in New Mexico?  Fishburn Yeah. He   s brilliant, too, about architecture. He started out in engineering, but then he found out he was a better artist than he was an engineer and that he could see it all. He   s got a mind that he can visualize a building before it   s ever even conceived. He did so good up there at Stillwater in the 39  architect school. He   s got a really good business in Corrales, New Mexico, right outside of Albuquerque. They built them a  750,000 home on a five-acre apple orchard that he paid a million dollars for almost.  Milligan Wow.  Fishburn Just unbelievable. They raised four children. They   re a private business, which was slumped this last year, but it   s all bounced back. Tate, he stayed in the Army Reserves, too, for a long time. He was a good military kid, too. Then Leah, our daughter, she was in Alaska. That   s where she met Joe. She had been married to David Thompkins here at Purcell when she first got out of high school. David had already been married once, and he had one boy. He was a good guy, and he   s still a good friend of mine. We work together a lot. She was wanting to have babies, and he didn   t want any babies. I said,    Well, get this divorce done.    I went out, saw an attorney, and said,    Here   s  250. Give Leah and David a divorce.       Okay.    Of course, she wants to go to college at OSU. That was what we did, sent her. She went up to OSU and was going to school there. One summer, the kids in Alaska, Tol and them, invited them all to come up. They all went to Alaska for the first time. While she was in Alaska, she met this kid, really a good guy, Joe Ballard. He was a returned missionary. He seemed like a really good guy. They got married, and they had that little baby there. (Gestures to photo)  Milligan That   s a baby.  Fishburn Then there   s some more of them on the backside, all kinds of babies. They did really good for a while. It didn   t work. They   re in the process right now of getting a divorce. Their oldest daughter is fixing to graduate from high school, and the second daughter is a junior, I think. Then the third daughter, she   s a barrel racer. She likes to race horses. Leah has done a good job, but it   s just been a sad case of what happens to people when they don   t get along   can   t make it.  Milligan They still in Alaska?  Fishburn No, she lives at, they moved back to Rio Rancho, New Mexico. Leah had been in Desert Storm. She had the GI Bill, so she used her GI Bill and bought a nice home in Rio Rancho. Joe was working on the North Slope. He   d work up there two or three weeks, and be home a week or two, back and forth. There was a power struggle between Joe and Leah because when Leah was running the home, then he would come home and want to run it. That doesn   t work. That   s the worst thing you can do. If Joe would   ve been smart, he would   ve come back home and walked in and said,    Great job  It   s going good. Keep running the place     But, no, he came in, he said,    They can   t do this  They can   t do that  They can   t go out here,    put all these rules down. 40  Milligan Yeah, that   s hard.  Fishburn It   s tough. I don   t know whether you   ve ever experienced that, but if you do, you know what it is. That   s what winds up in a divorce.  Milligan So they   re in New Mexico, and then you   ve got     Fishburn They   re in New Mexico.  Milligan    your other daughter.  Fishburn Now this is Ronda. She was going to OSU. She took this course in fashion design. Really did good in it. Went to work and took her internship with an outfit down in Oklahoma City. In this process, her boyfriend was Matt Evans. Went through flight school in Enid. He was always coming down, squiring her around. They decided to get married. They got married, and she went into the Air Force with him as an Air Force wife. He came down to Tinker, flying AWACS planes. That was his first duty assignment. They started off really good. Their first child was this little baby there, the little girl. She   s grown up now, just about. He stayed in because that   s what he wanted to be. He wanted a career in the Air Force and then go to work for Delta Airlines. He played that. He   s a very smart guy but comes from a dysfunctional family. His mother and dad never lived together, but good guy, hardworking, money pinching. I mean he saved every penny.  Milligan Are they still in Oklahoma, then?  Fishburn No, they traveled around the world, went to Okinawa. They   ve been everywhere, flying. All the time she was doing that, she used her degree. Like, she was in Okinawa, and then she worked for AAFES  Army and Air Force Exchange Service  going to Korea to buy clothes and stuff, and all that. They do all of this, and she finally winds up   their final assignment is Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska, which is the coldest place in the world to live. She had got hitched up while they were living in Honolulu, because that   s where he was flying out of there. They bought a home in Oahu, right down by the beach, pretty close, but now it has become closer to the beach because it   s right along   . They made a good investment there in a nice home.  She goes in with Ann Taylor. Now she   s become a manager, running stores for Ann Taylor because of her expertise. She   s very good at it. They did all this, and then he gets out of the Air Force. Before he even gets out, Delta hires him. He just goes down to Atlanta, and they sign him up to start flying airplanes out of New York City. They got him transferred down to LAX, Los Angeles International  Airport . By the time they got all that done, then 41  he was able to retire. He started flying out of LAX. They went down to find a place to live, and they went to Huntington Beach, California. They just the other day bought them a nice, big, four-bedroom suite overlooking the Pacific Ocean for  750,000.  Milligan I   m sure. That   s crazy. Good for them.  Fishburn The kids liking it. Their daughter is a really good volleyball player. She   s probably going to get to play volleyball in college because she   s good enough, now a senior in high school. The kids are doing good.  Milligan Do you have one more, one more kid?  Fishburn Ronda and Leah, and then Rocky, that   s the three younger ones. Then Tate and then Tol and Brett. We had lost one in a car wreck.  Milligan Rocky.  Fishburn No, Lorne was killed when he was seventeen years old. Graham Madison is the youngest boy; he   s the one that   s in law school. Tol is the oldest, Brett is number two, then Lorne was number three, but he   s dead now. We had those three to start with. After we joined the church, then Pat wanted more children. So then we had four more. The doctor said that,    If you don   t want your husband to have to raise seven kids by himself, you better not have any more babies.    She agreed, finally. She didn   t want to. She   d had one tubular pregnancy and almost died from that. The doctor had said,    Here you are. You   re old enough that you don   t need to be having more babies. Seven is plenty.     Milligan That   s a lot of kids to keep track of.  Fishburn But she did a super job. I mean, she was the best wife any man could ever have, boy, just the greatest. She supported me my whole career, from the day we got married. We made a decision when we got married. I said,    We   ll raise the kids.    So many people don   t ever get married. They get their girlfriend pregnant, but they never do marry. Back in those days, you was a bum if you didn   t marry your girlfriend that was pregnant. I said I couldn   t be a bum then.  Milligan So do you think that you all would   ve parted ways if you, if that hadn   t have happened?  Fishburn Oh, yeah, I would   ve never seen her again. If she hadn   t been pregnant, I would   ve left Boise City, and no telling where I   d wind up at. Wouldn   t be where I   m at today, though, I   m sure. That was all part of the plan that we didn   t realize. Isn   t that amazing? It   s the legacies that you see when you 42  look back, see. You don   t know you   re building all that at the present time. You   re just trying to raise a family, and make them good, and get them educated, and keep them out of jail with everything. It   s tough. Leah was probably the most   she liked to run around more than anybody. She was a wild, little girl all through high school in Purcell. She liked to race cars and everything. She had a lot of fun, but she had talent. I taught her how to fly the airplane. She was the best student that I ever had. I taught her every trick in the   I just taught her everything I knew. She flew fifty hours in fifty days in my little Cessna 150. She took the check ride with my friend and got her private pilot   s license. That   s a picture of it right up there.  Milligan I see that, above the bear.  Fishburn Yeah, above the bear.  Milligan So do all your kids fly?  Fishburn No, just Leah and Tol. The rest of them don   t want to fly. They get sick at   . Ronda, you smell the airplane and get sick. They   ve flown with me some, but they don   t want to fly. They don   t have that desire. They got other passions. Bicycle racing, there   s Tol on the bike. See that right there? They race bicycles; they race everything. They ride in all this stuff. Very athletic, very healthy people. There are no fat ones. (Laughs)  Milligan Well, neither are you. Even now, you   re retired, and you still obviously stay busy because we   re where we   re sitting right now and listening to you. Your phone rings a couple times a day, more than a couple times. You definitely stay busy.  Fishburn It   s what it is when you help a lot of people and do things for people. They like to come in and visit. When they   re having troubles or don   t understand what   s going on, they will come around and talk to you. Everybody in town, they say,    How can we find you?    I say,    Just go in anywhere to ask for Ron Fishburn. They   ll tell you where I   m at.    They know that I work in the temple in Oklahoma City every Tuesday and Thursday. I   m up there. Nita and I are there. Pat and I did that for years. When I married Nita, she was Pat   s good friend, and we never quit. I can now say that I   ve had two of the best wives in the world. Never believed that I could do this that would be so good to raise all of this bunch. It   s the best legacy I   ve ever seen.  Milligan Lifetime of work. We   ve been talking about two hours right now. I wonder, since we   re at the end of this, if there   s anything else that you wanted to talk about or anything else that   .  Fishburn I don   t think. Well, I pretty well told you a lot of stuff.  43  Milligan I knew five minutes into the conversation that we could spend twelve hours and still not get through it.  Fishburn Oh, yeah, we could talk here forever.  Milligan The hard part is getting through the basics of it. What I think is interesting and what   s useful, I think, for this project is to get a good understanding of sort of who you were growing up and what your family, your time at OSU, and what that helped shape.  Fishburn That   s the best time of my life. I look back at college up at Oklahoma A M as the crux of everything that made me what I am today. If it wasn   t for that, if I hadn   t have gone to Stillwater back in 1951, I would hate to think where I would   ve been. It was the foresight of teachers. I had a good English teacher in high school that went all the way from seventh grade, all the way through with me. Stuff like that, people that had confidence that Ron Fishburn would amount to something. When I was a freshman in high school, I just,    Where am I at?    I come off a little ol   grocery store up in Goldsby. I   d never seen real people in town, all these guys and gals that were completely different from what I   d been raised around when I arrived in Purcell. It   s all been part of that. I think that   s what makes life so important is that you pay attention to what   s going on in the world around you. Don   t be afraid to take on tasks that maybe you don   t know what   s going to happen or not. I credit my English teacher and my agriculture teacher as being positive influences that told me that I could amount to something. When I went to college with Dr. Gray up there, says,    You can do it.    He was my mainstay. Those kind of people are what really build it when you   re young.  Milligan I also think it   s interesting that you feel that   s such a pivotal time because you only stayed with your degree, you only used that degree for   .  Fishburn Just a little while, yeah, just a couple years, but what I learned from that is if you find something that you love to do more than anything else, then do it. Don   t stay with something just because it   s paying you money. I said,    I don   t need the money. I just want to do what I want to do.     Milligan That   s why you ultimately left the soil science business?  Fishburn Really, it was a political thing. I didn   t like it.  Milligan You just didn   t like it, yeah.  Fishburn I was sick. I wouldn   t even want to get up in the morning and go to work. If you know how that comes out   .  44  Milligan It sounds like they took you from the job you went into that you liked and moved you into something     Fishburn Moved to something I didn   t want to be moved to. See, it was all because they kept telling me,    It   s money, money, money     My friend, Ferris P. Allgood, he didn   t worry about the money. He took the job because he loved it. I was interrupted in my career there by the military, six months active duty for training, that I had to leave the soil science business for six months. When I came back, it was gone. The boss there said,    Oh, don   t follow them. That   s not any good. You   ll never amount to anything  Money  You   ll never make GS-9.    I believed my buddy there. He said,    I   ll make you the soil conservation district chairman,    whatever it was, district executive. Being young and you   re starting out another career, and then you say,    Maybe they   re right.    I said,    No, that   s the wrong direction. That   s not the right way. I   d rather go back to Purcell and sell farm machinery and run a freight business than to be a work unit conservationist, working the paperwork.    I had left what I liked to do, and that was map soils. When I figured out that I loved to fly and I was able to fly, then I said,    I   ll never leave it.    I   m never going to quit   Milligan And you still fly.  Fishburn Still flying, and I   ve flown and flown and flown. I still love to go out and take off in my airplane. It   s the greatest feeling in the world to taxi out, and put the power to that little airplane, and fly up and see the world. There   s something about it that   s magic. That   s what keeps you going. I mean, it   s just fantastic. You see those helicopters up there on the wall over there. See, I   ve flown all of those.  Milligan On the June 2011 calendar?  Fishburn Yeah, and there   s Orville and Wilbur up there. I just finished up reading their book The Wright Brothers by  David  McCullough, which is the best Wright brothers book that has ever been printed. It   s just like a bible of aviation. That   s why you see all of these pictures of aviators and everything. I never gave up. In Rotary Club, I   ve been there twenty-some-odd, thirty years. Rotary district governor, Rotary president, I   ve done everything that you could do in Rotary because I enjoy the people.  Milligan I think that sums up a big part of what we   ve talked about, and a big part of what you   ve been able to say about your life. I think at two hours and fifteen minutes I   m going to stop     Fishburn Okay.  Milligan    because that   s a long time for anyone to talk. (Laughs) 45  Fishburn Well, it is some people, but Ron Fishburn is different. (Laughter)  Milligan You could keep going.  Fishburn It   s because I love life so much. I know that I have a great family, and I know that I have made right choices. When I made a bad choice, I was able to solve the problem. Instead of telling Pat,    Well, you   re pregnant. I   ll just leave. You   ll have to figure it out yourself,    I said,    No   .    I thought about it, thought about it, and I thought,    Boy, that would be a horrible mistake to leave a little baby in this earth life without a father.    She is too good a girl. We didn   t know each other really, didn   t even know. After forty-nine years and I married her, I knew that I had a lady that was greater than any person that I could have ever picked out and found. Heavenly Father put her into my arms. I was smart enough to follow it. That   s what I   ve been able to do is follow the premonitions.  Milligan I think the good advice there, as well, (and we will end on this) but I think the good advice there is to follow your instincts, as well, right?  Fishburn Yeah, it is. When it   s good, do it. Don   t do bad things; do the good. It   s just like this lady I spoke to a while ago. She had had a real bad injury, and she was having to be   . I said,    I   ll never throw your stuff out of the mini-storage.     Milligan From your storage business.  Fishburn Yeah, she was worried about that, that she hadn   t paid me. I said,    Don   t ever worry about that. Don   t ever worry about money. We   ll get it. We   ll figure it out.    She was so tickled. That   s what life is all about, is serving others because the Rotary theme is    Service Above Self.    I learned that, service above self. I   ve worked for the RYLA  Rotary Youth Leadership Awards  Program now for twenty-five years. I   ve been with over a thousand kids in the last twenty years, helping them through programs.  Milligan What   s the RYLA Program?  Fishburn It   s a leadership program for young juniors that   s coming out of high school. Rotary, we have a program, and we go to   it   s a five-day program down at the lake. Bob Usry is the man. He   s the man that he was asked to do it, and he asked me to help him. I   ve been with him ever since. This was our twenty-third or twenty-fourth year.  Milligan Well, those are good skills for teenagers.  46  Fishburn Nita goes with me. She helps me. Pat didn   t like to do it, so she didn   t go. I didn   t want her to go because she was home taking care of babies and stuff, kids, not babies. Nita is a lot more like me. She likes to be involved, and she does so many good things, same way.  Milligan Sounds like you both do.  Fishburn We got the best team going. We didn   t tell any of the kids. Now they   ve all accepted her as my best friend and good buddy and everything.  Milligan That   s good because it   s been about eight years since you   ve been married.  Fishburn Eight years. On July 2 it   ll be eight years.  Milligan Right close to your birthday.  Fishburn And that   s what my daughter   s birthday right there is, July 2. Ol   Ronda, she was named after me.  Milligan I guess that   s true. I didn   t even think about that.  Fishburn We don   t spell it R-H; it   s R-O-N-D-A.  Milligan Makes sense.  Fishburn She   s college educated, done good. Brought in all these good looking kids. This little booger.     Milligan Cute babies.  Fishburn Isn   t that something?  -------  -------
