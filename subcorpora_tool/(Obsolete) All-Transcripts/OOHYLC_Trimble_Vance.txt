 Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Today is July the 16th, 2013. My name is Tanya Finchum along with Alex Bishop and Sara Bolin. We   re with the Oklahoma State University, and we   re in Wewoka today to speak to Mr. Vance Trimble who turned 100 on July the 6th, correct?  Yes.  Thank you for having us into your home today. Let   s start with having you tell us, for the record, when and where you were born.  I was born in Harrison, Arkansas on July the 6th, 1913 at eight o   clock in the morning.  And your parents, what did they do for a living?  My father was a lawyer, and my mother was a poet and writer.  Okay. And what brought you to Oklahoma.  It   s a very long story. My father was mayor of Harrison, Arkansas, and in 1919 there was a railroad strike on the Missouri   MNAR, Missouri North Arkansas Railroad, and it led to mob rule in Harrison. He was the mayor and he took the side of peace, against the mob rule, and was blackballed at being a lawyer. He decided to go somewhere else and he went to Okemah, Oklahoma, in 1920.  Why Okemah? Were there any ties to Okemah?  I don   t know. Well, yes I do. Oil development had just developed in the Cromwell field, which is close to Okemah. Okemah was the rail point for the oilers and the derricks and rigging that came into the oilfield, and 5  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  it was a lot of lease play and so forth. A very active court system there was a result of the land operations.  And how long did you live in Okemah?  Lived there until 1929, moved to Wewoka.  And when did you graduate from high school?  Nineteen thirty-one.  From Wewoka?  Yes.  And what was your favorite subject?  Recess. (Laughs) I didn   t really have a favorite subject. I was, of course, I was the editor of the school paper. The time I was in high school, I worked as a full-time reporter on the Wewoka Times Democratic covering the courthouse, writing sports, and every kind of news. I would hop up to school about nine thirty in the morning and leave about three so I could cover the courthouse and so forth. I didn   t have any strong subjects. I still don   t know algebra, though. I was excused from the final exam and from the time I was fourteen I was a hunt-and-peck typist. I tried to, I mean I was required to study touch typing in high school, thirty minutes a day. (Laughs) I barely ever made the thirty. I finally made it but at my job I was typing a hundred words a minute, hunt-and-peck. Of course a lot of errors, but they could easily be edited. I enjoyed English. Nothing else stood out.  What were you getting paid to do that?  At the paper?  Yes.  Well, in Okemah, when I started at age fourteen, I made a dollar and a half a week after school and on Saturdays. So when we moved over to Wewoka, I went to the paper and applied for a job and they hired me at fifteen dollars a week. So I made fifteen dollars a week there.  That was pretty good money, too.  Well, it was alright.6  Finchum  Trimble  So after high school, what was next?  Well, you know the Depression was on then. It was terrible, and I had two or three other newspaper jobs around here, Seminole and Maud, and papers were going busted. I mean they weren   t going busted but they were rocky. They were retrenching savagely and it was hard to keep a job. I had always tinkered with my father   s Underwood No. 5 Typewriter, I don   t know whether you   re familiar with them or not but they have a bar on the back the carriage, slides on. It gets sticky from dust and so forth so I used to keep it working, knew quite a bit about the Underwood.  Elzene and I had an old car that cost me thirty-five dollars, a    26 Chevrolet coupe. Had four bald tires, a rusted out muffler, pretty bad oil leak and a broken trunk lid without a handle that had to be kept shut with baling wire. We were lucky gasoline was then about only twelve cents a gallon. I decided, we decided to hit the road. We had with us a little fox terrier named Gypsy, and so we, I just went from town to town trying to find a newspaper job. We went east as far as the Atlantic beaches in Florida and west as far as Pike   s, to Pike   s and up Pike   s Peak, and couldn   t find a newspaper job. In many towns I would take a screwdriver, a pair of pliers and a can of oil and solicit from offices and stores and repair typewriters, adding machines and cash registers. The repair of which I learned more and more as we went along, and then after a year and a half then finally I got jobs in Okmulgee and Tulsa and Muskogee.  I kept stepping up. In Tulsa I joined the Newspaper Guild, which is a union of course. Dick Lloyd Jones found some reason to fire a bunch of us who joined. Sports editor had some hot checks out and so forth. I was the last man hired and they had what they called a    staff reorganization,    which put me out. It was just to break the union, which he did. Years later in Washington I met Dick Jones and he said,    Vance, if I   d known you were going to win the Pulitzer Prize I wouldn   t have fired you     I said,    Well, Dick if you hadn   t fired me I wouldn   t have had the opportunity to win it.    And wound up in Beaumont, Texas, Port Arthur, Texas, telegraph editor there for a couple of years, and applied for a job on the Houston Press, which was the number three paper in Houston, Scripps Howard paper. They didn   t seem to be interested so I subscribed to the paper, and I was still in Port Arthur, subscribed to the paper for a month and I analyzed it, and sat down and wrote a critique on what changes needed to be made, what would improve the paper. So they offered me a job, and I was there seventeen years.  I started on the realm of the copy desk as a copy reader. Then they offered me a job as city editor. They liked my attitude and knowledge of 7  the business and previous city editors. It was a very competitive, tough, mean job, because we were struggling to stay up with two bigger papers. Previously, the longest term for the previous city editor was nine months, and the managing editor was a smart guy, but a martinet and couldn   t quite make up his mind about things so I decided to stick it out. I lasted a year and a half, and then I was moved to cover city hall and the federal building, and a whole bunch of stuff. I had practically every beat in town. Then had a new editor come in, I was brought back to the city desk and then promoted to managing editor in 1950.  In 1955, Walker Stone, who   s from Okemah and liked me, admired my work in Houston. I was really on fire in Houston. I was the most aggressive managing editor they   d had in a while and we scored a number of important scoops or developments. So Walker came down and said he wanted me to come up to Washington and shake up the National Bureau, Scripps Howard Newspaper Alliance. So I got to Washington, and I started not to go. My daughter was in her senior year of high school in Houston and she was head of everything. She was a big leader, and I seriously thought about not taking the job in Washington, but I was smart enough to do it, and she did well in Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. So my job was to run the night desk. That meant to lead out the wire. We had twenty-seven papers from New York, San Francisco, Cleveland, Houston, Birmingham, Knoxville, Memphis, Albuquerque and so forth, and I did a real good job on that, they said.  Washington was very dull compared to the type of work I was doing in Houston which was hands-on, and you   d get a hold of somebody and make them talk to you, and in Washington it   s press conferences, and everybody   s kind of laid back in the news business. So, on my own I decided to go out and look for stories that I could do off the payroll, off the clock I guess. And I ran across a book by Raymond Clapper who   d been the Scripps Howard correspondent for many years, had a great success in Washington. He   d written a book on nepotism in Congress, and it   d been thirty years and I thought,    Well, it   s about time to take another look    and I looked. I found that 20 percent of the members of Congress had relatives on their payroll and it was very suspect about whether they were doing work or not. I spent several months going through the records and checking every member of Congress, of course there   s 535. So I got a pretty good story together in the Washington Daily News. The banner, it took up the whole front page, and every day I   d get a new story, a new angle and so forth.  So for about six months I had a daily story, you know, a lot of Iowa, a lot of Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, various places, because not much was going on. We didn   t have any George Zimmerman or Egypt or anything that was hot burning so my story caused a lot of grassroots 8  Bishop  Trimble  Finchum  Bishop  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  outrage. Lyndon Johnson was then majority leader of the Senate. Result; (laughs) a congresswoman named Iris Blitch from Georgia, I believe it was, spent about an hour and ten minutes on the floor of the House berating me. I was up in the gallery listening to her. (Laughs) Anyway, a lot of things happened, but Lyndon Johnson felt the heat, and he and Walker were good friends so Lyndon asked Walker how to get this stopped. And Walker told Lyndon, he said,    We ought to do something.    So first thing you know Lyndon, and I think it was about June something, Lyndon decided to open up the secret payroll records of the Senate, bring them more up to date. Didn   t fully open them up, but he did something. See that   s the Washington Daily News. See this? (Gestures) They pour hot silver on this, bend it and pour hot silver. It goes on the press, prints.  I   ve never seen this.  This is calotype, and then you press this mat that   s wet and dry it in the heater and pour the plate that prints.  I didn   t know.  I   ll be darned.  Anyway, that was the reason I won the Pulitzer for National Reporting for that year plus the Sigma Delta Chi Distinguished Correspondence Record for Washington coverage and also the Raymond Clapper Award. That   s a triple crown in journalism. It   s been done before. It was done in 1950 by an Associated Press correspondent, but it   s rare.  And that was 1960?  Well, the work was done in    59. The prize was awarded in    60.  Were you surprised it was getting honored like that?  Well, I didn   t submit it. As a matter of  fact , E.P. Dutton  Publishing Company  wrote me and wanted me to write a book about my work and I said,    I can   t do it,    because I was a great company man. (Laughs) I should have written it. Anyway, I didn   t. The Scripps submitted the stuff, not me.  Were you surprised?  Oh yes, I was terribly surprised  And gratified. There   s a trade publication, Editor   Publisher, Scripps Howard has been advertising on the back cover for years and years and years. My picture appeared 9  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  there every time I won. The last one said,    Triple Crown Winner      So how long did you stay in DC?  Well, I was there until 1963. Two or three things happened after I won the prize. The editor in Houston wanted me to come back and be the managing editor for a short period, well about three or four months, and I went back and it was kind of awkward. This managing editor is sitting over here and I   m here running things in his front yard, you know. Anyway, and then I was sent to El Paso. The editor out there was sick and I was out there about four or five months as acting editor of the paper and then I came back to Washington. Walker Stone took me to lunch one day and said,    Vance, we   re going to offer you The Kentucky Post, and I   d advise you not to take it. You go up to New York and talk to Jack Howard and see what you think, but don   t take it. We   ll probably have a bigger paper for you later in some area that you   ll like better.     I   d always wanted to run my own show, you know. You know how it is, to be head man, to be in charge like you are, and so what I did, I told Walker, I said,    I   ll go look at it first then I   ll talk to Jack, but unless pigs are running in the street I want to take it.    (Laughs) It was practically that bad, very run down newspaper, and I turned it around. Had a lot of fun there, did a lot of things. Like for instance, I got all the candidates for office lined up and asked them to come in and meet the new editor and get their picture made to run in the paper and tell me anything they want to tell me. Then I would slide over to them the Wonderlic test, business aptitude. You   re familiar with it?  No.  You   re not? Very good test. Associated Press was using it for all their new hires. It   s actually an IQ test. The nominal score is thirty, and several things happened. I told them I was going to print their scores in the paper, and one guy made a thirty and he advertised,    I   m the fellow you want because I   m Mr. Average     (Laughter)    I   m right in the middle      And one guy who   d run for mayor about eight times, of Covington, took the test. I told them they could only take it once, but he scored zero, and my heart was too heavy to do that so I let him take it again. He scored zero again. (Laughter) I let him take it a third time, still failed.  One guy came in and I offered it to him, told him what we were doing. He threw up his hands, exploded. He was a lawyer. He was practicing in the town of Covington, and he stormed out and filed suit against me for interfering with the election practices laws of Kentucky. So I had a very 10  Bishop  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  smart guy in the state capitol, and he discovered that this lawyer, I   ve forgotten his name, had sweet-talked some clerk with a lie at Frankfurt into issuing him a law license for Kentucky. I printed that and he immediately left town.  Well, anyway, I had a lot of fun and uncovered a lot of things at The Kentucky Post. It was a great experience. The WCPO story     Former Northern Kentucky Newspaper Editor, Vance Trimble, Celebrates His 100th Birthday     quotes a whole lot of people that worked for me, a lot of them came down here, and the things I did. You say you saw it. Did you see my picture in jail?  Yeah, what   s that about?  Okay, well, anyway it kind of told what was happening there. Next question.  Do you want to tell that for the record?  Well, it   s printed.  He   s read it, okay.  That   s the photograph.  Well, I want to know what your role was in getting Northern Kentucky State College     Well, when I went there the paper was strictly a democratic paper. Republicans didn   t get in at all, and I changed that. I made it an independent paper and we gave the Republicans as much space for what they did as the Democrats got. I was not a community leader. I don   t believe in that. I wasn   t that smart, didn   t have that much time. I had a job to do, and I stayed off of boards. I got trapped on a couple like the Cincinnati Museum of Natural History, and one of the, I don   t know. I avoided them, but I did work with the paper to try to develop things that were necessary. I was one of the strongest drumbeaters for the college. I could see a great need for it, and other people joined in. I was not alone, but I helped it and kept the idea alive. It took two or three or four years, I   ve forgotten.  And were you present for the ground-breaking?  I don   t remember.  And that was in Covington?11  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Well, it was in Northern Kentucky. It   s closer to Newport than Covington.  Okay.  Or Fort Thomas.  Well, in 1963 that   s when JFK was assassinated. Do you remember?  Oh yeah, I remember that very well. Walker Stone and some other people from Washington were visiting me and we went out to a restaurant on the Dixie Highway for lunch. There were about five or six of us. The story came on television right while we were in our meal, and I promptly left and went to the office to develop our coverage and response and reaction.  On events like that, are there other ones that stand out?  Oh yeah, the supper club fire in Covington, Beverly Hills Supper Club at Newport. That was a big thing, a real disaster, two or three hundred people killed. It reminds me a lot of the Texas City disaster where a cargo ship blew up and killed about five or six hundred people. That was probably about 1951,    52, something like that. And we had hurricanes in Houston, left and right you know, and I did a lot of coverage of that, directed coverage, too.  You mentioned Walker Stone, was there anyone else that was a mentor or role model for you?  Paul Miller was my first mentor, and my best   not my best necessarily, but one of my best. Are you familiar with Paul Miller?  A little bit.  Well, Paul was from Pawhuska. He went to  Oklahoma  A M. He was editor of the O   Collegian, I think, as a sophomore. Walker recruited him because Walker was a graduate of A M. Then, of course, that was during the Depression and Paul   s father was a preacher, minister. He was about twenty-four and he came down to Okemah to be editor of the Daily Leader, thirty-five dollars a week. He grabbed me and pulled me in as a cub, and he got sick for about a week and I put out the paper for him. (Laughs)  I used to have to go down to the telegraph office and get the bare bones report. We had what   s called a pony report. You have to embellish it. 12  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  You have to know the first names and who the people are that are in the pony report, you know. Paul was really my best mentor. He got me a prospect of a job at OU to be a correspondent for the Daily Oklahoman. He didn   t go back to A M, he went to OU to finish up his college course. I was married and I couldn   t see how I could carry it so I didn   t go there.  Paul was always a friend and we stayed associated throughout his life. As a matter of fact we visited  when  he had the stroke. He went to Gannett Newspapers. He went to the Associated Press as the president and went to Gannett Newspapers as publisher, developed the USA Today and other things. After he had his stroke he was in Palm Beach, Florida. We went to visit him, Elzene and I went to visit him two or three times. His wife was very friendly to us. They got married in Columbus while he was with the AP Bureau there. She was a society editor at The Columbus Dispatch. Very nice people.  Paul was having trouble with one of his boys, Paul Jr., and I hired him in Kentucky as a reporter. They were estranged. I hired the boy as a reporter, sort of an intern I guess, started as an intern, became a reporter. And I was able to talk to Paul Jr. quite a bit about his father and told him some of the outstanding things he probably didn   t know about his dad. You know how it goes. So he went home for Christmas, or some holiday, and they became father and son really again, and Paul thanked me for that. I think I did him a good service there.  You   ve mentioned Elzene a couple of times. I   m assuming that   s your wife?  Yes.  Do you want to talk a little bit about her? How did you two meet?  Well, she was a senior at Wewoka High School and I was a junior, and the start of school, I guess that would have been    30, I was walking down the hall and a girl came up to me with a book and said,    John Wesley, here   s your book back.    I said,    I   m not John Wesley, but I   ll take the book,    and she said,    Oh, no you won   t.    Anyway, turned out she was in my journalism class, and I was named editor of the paper, the school paper. It was a four-page print paper that came out, I think, weekly. It was a real job to do. Anyway, she was the business manager so we were put together a lot and we started going down to  the drugstore . She would go sell an ad to the hardware shop, fifty cents, you know. We   d take a five cent commission and go to the Robert   s Drugstore and get in the back booth, there was a record player, and get a nickel coke and take two straws and split it. That was eighty years ago. 13  Finchum  Trimble  Eighty years ago. Anyway, we were in love, and we got married as soon as we could. Then the Depression hit us, you know. It was tough. I was laid off by the Times Democrat, that   s when we started travelling around the country.  Where did you go on your honeymoon?  (Laughs) This is kind of an unusual story. I was nineteen. I had to get my parents    permission to get a marriage license, and I was working then in Seminole. I had a car. It had a busted motor, and I was hitchhiking back and forth between Wewoka and Seminole. My car had a water leak and came into the cylinders and would blow the gasket out. I had to replace the head gasket very frequently so my car was on the brink. We were going to get married at noon or one o   clock in Holdenville, seven miles over here. I bought Elzene a platinum ring for ten dollars, (laughs) that was pretty expensive then. We went to Holdenville and got married about one o   clock.  We   d already rented an apartment over here, about three blocks from here, and there was a M P Grocery here, called Ma and Pa Grocery. So after we came back from getting married with her friends, a couple brought us back, we went down to M P and bought groceries, two bags of groceries, probably about five dollars, two big bags. You know things were cheap then. Bread was ten cents a loaf and eggs ten cents a dozen. The butcher would give you a soup bone, not the same now. Anyway, so we went up to the apartment, and I had to go to work at four o   clock in the afternoon in Seminole, worked until, you know, four o   clock in the morning. I was the news editor of the Seminole Morning News, and so I had to hitchhike over there and work until four o   clock in the morning, and then at four o   clock in the morning I had to hitchhike back, at four AM. Fortunately there was a bread truck that made a run over here about that time and so I got a ride back. Elzene had been a home ec student and she had several good recipes including salmon loaf, with the ketchup sauce, and two or three other things. One time we made a cake together and the dog wouldn   t even eat it. (Laughs)  Anyway, one week after we got married, I got fired and I hesitated. What had happened, Elzene was making seven dollars a week at the florist shop down here, and I was in Maud and they got me to come over to Seminole. I got twenty dollars a week there so that gave us twenty-seven dollars a week. We thought we could get married on that, and I lost my twenty a week after we got married. There were no jobs and this is wild as hell. So the Times Democrat, of course this was during the Lindbergh kidnapping and the other important events in our age, disputes and so forth, and everybody wanted the paper. It was three dollars a year, by mail I guess, out in the country. I found out that I 14  Finchum  Trimble  could go out and get the subscription list and go around the county. They had a guy in a car doing it, a guy named Scotty, but he was kind of lazy. So I got the subscription list and a carrier bag. I had some premiums to offer like Gem razors and Outdoor Girl beauty products, two or three colors of rouge and face powder and had a Wewoka cookbook too.  So anybody that re-subscribed   they were all in arrears. Everybody on the list owed at least three dollars or six or whatever. They hadn   t paid and they hadn   t been pushed, but I didn   t have any car. I mean my car wasn   t running so I had to hitchhike. I   d go out to a section line that was indicated by people on the list, and then you   d have to walk up, you know. There were probably about one or two houses on a section line. You   d go to the farmhouse and you   d walk there at about nine or ten in the morning, because you had to get out there and the farmer would be sitting right there having a cup of coffee, right? He was not. He was out in the field about a mile away or maybe a little less, but was it my end of the field or is it the far end? (Laughs)  So I   d have to tramp down these furrows, or wave if he was close enough, and he would want to re-subscribe to the paper, or not re-subscribe. He wanted to continue his subscription, because he was still getting it, but he just couldn   t see spending the three dollars. He   d reach in his pocket, pull out these long purses. You   ve seen those, farmers have folded over long purses. He   d just be standing there and reach down and he   d pull out his bills. He had, it looked like, five or six dollars, you know. There was no credit for farmers. It was terrible.  Anyway, I knew he wanted it but he didn   t want to part with the dollar bills, and he owed three back. I said,    Tell you what I   ll do. I   ll mark off what you owe. We   ll just start fresh.       Oh, I   d like to do it,    (long pause) and I said,    Tell you what I   ll do, too. I   m supposed to give you one premium but I   ll give you one for every member of your family.       Oh, I   d sure like to do that.    (Long pause)    Okay, I   ll tell you what I   ll do. I   ll give you two years for the price of one.    I was making up the rules as I went. So we   d make a deal, but he wouldn   t part with his money. He   d give me gallon buckets of molasses or live chickens or I don   t know what all I got. I   d put that in a tow sack and have to hitchhike back to town, go to McGlassons    Produce and trade it in for money, go down to the paper, get out my list and privately mark paid up two or three extra years, but that only lasted three or four weeks, you know, but it kept us alive.  Sure.  That   s a long wedding story, isn   t it?15  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Well, you never did answer, where did you go on your honeymoon?  We didn   t have any.  Didn   t have one?  No, we were in love and it, you know, it wouldn   t have mattered where we were.  What did she do?  Well, she worked at the flower shop, she     But as you moved around did she     Oh, she just kept working there until we had to go hit the road.  Okay, and in Houston what did she do?  In Houston?  Yes.  Well, we had a series of apartments and then I went to the Signal Corps in World War II and was editor of the paper at Camp Beale, California. I was a non-commissioned officer. I was a tech three staff sergeant. They had me writing some speeches for the buck General, I   ve forgotten his name, anyway, and running the paper. It was not a port of embarkation. It was the next step up, assembling area for troops that were going to go to the shore and then be going to the Pacific, really. So we had AP guys, all kinds of guys there and come through. John and Ward Hawkins, who were authors, Saturday Evening Post writers. Their first book I think was Pilebuck which was made into a movie, and we had a lot of good people, good photographers and everything. It was a weekly paper, four or six pages, printed by the Marysville paper and I   d go in and make it up and so forth.  So when I got out of the Army, I came back home and I said,    I think I can build a house for five thousand dollars in Houston    so I went around and talked to a bunch of architects, and then I drew some plans. One architect had a great thing, it wouldn   t fly now, but he had a nice building with corrugated asbestos transite on the sides, and it   d be very strong. Well, it was pretty strong and it looks nice so I bought a lot in West University Place in Houston and it was, I think, only fifty-feet wide but two hundred-feet deep so I designed a long house. I had the garage sticking out in the front and then you go back to the courtyard, 16  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  and used corrugated asbestos on the sides of it, and I think it was pretty close to five thousand dollars. I got a home loan, company loan, on it, and the contractor who built it was named Steel. (Laughs) He got the house almost completed, and I was in bed with the flu or something, he came over and got me out of bed to go over to Eastside Bank in Houston and go on his note for, it must have been five hundred dollars. He said,    If you do this for me, I   ll have your house finished two weeks from today.    I haven   t seen it since so I had to turn that house over to the building and loan. They finished it and sold it for a good profit. It was a good location, good design.  Then I designed another house closer to downtown Houston, about two miles from the Rice Hotel, right in the heart of town. I got bids on that, and it had two bedrooms, one bath, a carport and a garage, and it finally cost me sixty-five hundred dollars. I think the lot was about a thousand dollars. Now, since then, it   s been sold. The highest price I   ve heard it was ninety-eight thousand dollars. You know the land itself is worth that in Houston. It   s right between River Oaks and downtown. I was on  Vermont Street  which becomes Reba Drive in River Oaks, it   s a straight shot. I got the street black-topped along with the forming of the neighborhood coalition. What was the question? I   ve forgotten what your question was.  I   d asked what Elzene did for     Oh, okay. So        in Houston.  Elzene was very smart, very energetic. I mean she was always trying to work and do something and be helpful. She became a great bridge player and delved in ceramics and painting things. She has better ones than these (gestures to paintings), but she didn   t stay in painting very long and didn   t stay in ceramics very long. She was a great hostess, great entertainer, and it was extremely helpful there. When we went to Washington she became great friends with some of the buddies of Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson, and also Sam Rayburn and his crowd. We were invited to a number of receptions in the White House. As a matter of fact in the East Room of the White House, one group of editors was there, it was a pretty big party, and our friend from Fort Worth who knew Lady Bird and Lyndon real well, better than we did, longer, danced up to Lyndon and Lyndon cut in on Elzene. (Laughs) She danced with him in the East Room.  We later on spent a lot of time with Nixon, went to one of his prayer breakfasts in the White House. Elzene was very thoughtful, very helpful 17  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Bishop  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  to people, and she was a great cook, knew a lot of things. Everybody loved her, and just amazing. She was not frightened, but she was retiring and she, you know, she was the one who was the nicest person at whatever gathering it was, and people recognized it and gave her credit for her honor and her courtesy. And she was very good looking. Let me get one of these. When I published my mother   s poetry I got this book. I used her and Carol Ann for the cover.  Are they poems that your mother wrote?  Yes.  Okay.  She died in 1940 and so I didn   t have a chance to do much for her then. The picture I like in here the best is     Is this your daughter on the front with your wife?  That   s my wife and daughter. Well, there   s part of the sixty-five hundred dollar house in Houston. Take that with you.  If you   ll sign it for me later.  Well, I   ve got a new signature, a new autograph. You got a pen?  It   s a pen. (Signs VT100) That   ll work.  I had to sign some autographs when the people were down here  for my birthday celebration .  We stopped by the singing tower on our way into town     You did?     and we saw some of the poetry.  Did you like the poetry?  We did.  Yeah.  The tower   s very nice, too.  Thank you.18  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Do you want to tell us the story of how that came about?  Well, of course Elzene   s death, see it happened on July 5th in Covington. Carol Ann had come out for my birthday which was going to be the next day, and Elzene had been   (phone rings). Now where were we? My memory   s getting weaker.  You were going to tell us the story of the tower.  Oh, yeah. Well, so Elzene wanted to be buried by her mother in that cemetery, along with her sisters and so forth there too, and so I brought her back. We had the funeral here and buried her, and I hadn   t anticipated anything. I just couldn   t leave so I decided I would move into public housing authority over here. I thought I   d be here for a few months and that   d be it. Back in the cemetery, you may have seen, very back, far to the boundary, back behind the singing tower is another building back there. Where the tower is was a yellow building that was full of junk and had one toilet that was always locked and you had to hack in to get into it. I figured I couldn   t do anything there so I was going to build a pavilion back where the other place is in the back, and I even had an architect design one, flying roof and so forth. I went out there every day sleeping at night out there on a cot a time or two. (Laughs)  Anyway, we   d been down to the Bok Tower in Florida when we were driving around the country, I guess that was our honeymoon, and we were impressed by that tower down there so I knew about singing towers. They had an actual carillon and brought people over from England to play it, you know. It was a pretty expensive thing, but anyway I got to thinking there was a possibility of building a singing tower out there for Elzene.  I knew the city would not want to tear down this yellow brick building which was a memorial building for Judge Cutlett so I got some people to figure out how it could be hoisted and moved over to the back part of the cemetery some place. I drew my plans and got everything in order and went before the city council and they accepted my proposal, and I agreed to remove the yellow brick building. It was the only place I could see that. As a matter of fact that   s such a small area on the southeast corner I had to measure it by inches so a car could come around that corner. There   s a tombstone right there so I had to figure things almost micrometers, you know.  Anyway, I got the idea and built it, and I tried to get some other people here who have relatives in the cemetery to join me and in that case the 19  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  dedication would have been different, but nobody was interested. There   s a lot of oil money here but people are pretty tight with it and I couldn   t   so I decided to do it myself and fortunately found some good people. I had to measure everything very carefully. I put a pool in front and the two little girls were down in the pool in water. We had a fountain there and the apparatus to make it move and it turned out that--  and then I had to find a sculptor to make those and everything   turned out that the water spraying on the bronze discolored it so I eventually had to take the things up to a studio in Norman and have them refinished and brought back and remounted, fill in the pool. I don   t know, everybody seems to like it.  It   s very nice.  It cost me more than I thought, but it was worth it. It cost  150,000.  The music   s a nice touch.  Well, I programmed it, but you see when   that has a chip, recorded music. It   s not on tape like some of the other ones were. It worked pretty good except if we have a lot of the light blinks, the lights go off and then they come back on. Unless they   re off for thirty seconds, the carillon doesn   t have time to recycle and sometimes causes problems. I think it turned out pretty good.  It turned out very good. Did you design your house in Covington, too?  Yes I did.  So you   re creative in multiple ways.  Well, while I was here I built a car from scratch.  A car?  Yeah, a Model T Ford. My father, one of his clients had a salvage shop down here, and put my older brother in charge of liquidating it because the guy needed the money. He had to go to prison. So I went down there and found a set of beautiful wire wheels that were not bicycle thin but were very small, very beautiful white wheels, which was unusual, kind of like an old hot-mobile or something. Anyway I found a good frame, found a new front and back head and a Bosch ignition system, which were just, would be about    30,    29 or    30, and so I assembled it. It was a Model T but I turned the springs upside down so it would be about as low as cars are now, and I then I had some hoops made and made a racer body for it, covered it with heavy canvas and lacquered it and put some 20  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  dope on it and painted it, and it was kind of an interesting car. I drove it quite a bit while I was in high school.  My house in Covington, it was kind of a Frank Lloyd Wright style. I visited several Frank Lloyd Wright houses, and I don   t like his floors, you know, they   re solid. You drop a glass and you   re going to be sweeping up pieces for a long time. I designed and built a house in Chevy Chase, Maryland while I was in Washington. At that time everybody was coming to Washington, of course they always do, but there was a big surge. I made about fifty thousand dollars on selling the house so I took that to Covington and put it in on my new house. I designed it, but I don   t know whether I   ve got a picture or not. It was five thousand square feet, built on the hillside above the Ohio River looking over downtown Cincinnati. It was a spectacular house. It   s been sold twice since. The present owner, I think, is the father of the owner of Clear Channel Television, or I think he sold it. I don   t know about now, but he was at the time they bought the house.  Fallingwater?  What?  Like Fallingwater?  No, it   s not on a ledge. I built a gazebo in the back and a garden room on it and a little fountain. Elzene wanted several more columns on the house, and I found some in a salvage yard over in Cincinnati, built a little arbor in the back. Fallingwater was more or less copied by Sam Walton in Bentonville, Arkansas. It   s not exactly the same but they   ve dammed up a creek and they   ve got part of the house going over it. I   ve visited there a couple of times.  You did a biography for him?  Yeah.  After retirement?  Oh, yes. Well, while I was working I wrote my first book which was The Uncertain Miracle: The History of Hyperbaric Medicine, and I was invited to come down to the Houston Rotary Club by a friend and speak about it and I did. And they circulated that to other Rotary Clubs. (Laughs) I talked in Omaha, Kansas City, Jacksonville, Florida, Cincinnati, and a couple of other places. Doubleday printed the book but I think they only had it run about two thousand copies. It was a marginal book. They didn   t know anything about it. Not many people at that time 21  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  were talking about hyperbaric medicine, and doctors were kind of afraid of it because oxygen is toxic. Unless you know what you   re doing you can kill people, which is pretty easy. Then after that I was working on E.W. Scripps    book which was published by Iowa State University at Ames. I had a contract with Doubleday but the book ran too long for them. It was 495,000 words. (Laughs) Scripps is a fantastic guy. Then I did  Sam  Walton, and I did Happy Chandler, and then I did Chris Whittle and others.  How would you pick who you would do?  Well, I didn   t know anything about   I knew about Scripps. I just found out about hyperbaric medicine from Harland Sanders, Colonel Sanders, Kentucky Fried Chicken. He was going up to St. Barnabas, New Jersey to a hyperbaric chamber about every six months and taking a refresher dive. It does increase the oxygen in your brain and that lasts for a few weeks. It perks it up. I didn   t know about Walton. I just heard about him and I was down in Florida, went by one of his stores, very small. So I really, I decided I could do the book and so I wrote a proposal for a New York publisher. I knew enough. He was at that time the richest man in America, and was an interesting character so I wrote about a page and a half proposal and sent it to about twenty New York publishers. A few responded and declined my offer and some ignored it, and somebody who was working in a car wash in Austin, Texas also submitted a proposal, I found out. As a matter of fact I think he heard about mine and called me up.  Anyway, nothing happened and one afternoon I got a call. The guy said    This is Dick Marek at E.P. Dutton,    and he said,    I got your proposal on Sam Walton, and I   d like to talk to you about it. I   ll pay your way if you   ll fly up here Monday and see me.    I was in Covington then of course. I said,    Well, I   m selling so I   ll pay my own way and I   ll see you.    So I went up and we talked about twenty minutes and he said,    I   ll give a  40,000 advance to write the book.    And of course you know in a book proposal you get half on signing a contract and half on completion of the manuscript so the advance gives you an opportunity to pay your expenses while you   re doing the research and so forth. Anyway, we had a deal. (Laughs) I went first down to, how much do you     do you want this detail?  Yes, go ahead.  I flew down to Arkansas and went to Little Rock and went to the newspapers there, to see what they had in their morgue, and start collecting material. It happened that Sam was speaking at a club there the same day so a couple of reporters and I went over and joined the 22  Finchum  Trimble  crowd, and when Sam got through I went up and introduced myself and told him I   d like to come to Bentonville and talk to him. At that time he was pushing    Made in America    and was getting some blow-back on it, and I think he thought I wanted to talk about that. Anyway, he gave me an appointment and told me to check with his secretary, Becky somebody, and confirm it, and when I called to confirm it she said,    Well, Mr. Walton can   t see you. He   s under contract with Doubleday and he   s supposed to dry up all sources, so he can   t see you.     Later on I went to Bentonville and stayed there a few weeks and talked to everybody, and every time somebody would tell me something or hint at something or I   d ask a question, they   d run and tell Sam, you know. Finally he called me up about this    Saturday night massacre,    when he hired a guy named Ron Mayer to be his successor as CEO and then fired him after a love affair with one of the secretaries or something. I never found out about the detail and how it happened and when and so forth. I was back home and Sam called me up and said,    I know I   m not supposed to talk to you, but if you   re going to do this you ought to have it right,    and he told me his version of what transpired. I ran across a lot of flags and explosions in my research, and the first thing I know I   d be getting a call from Sam. He talked to me quite a bit, and gave me a lot of information. He hired three writers to do his story including, you probably know him, the sixty-six road (Route 66) guy in Tulsa.  Oh, Mike Wallis?  Yes, Wallis, and then he hired the bureau chief of Fortune magazine in Atlanta, and then he hired   so he fired them all. They didn   t please him. When I tried to talk to them, he had a confidentiality agreement with them. They wouldn   t give you spit, you know. So anyway, I got it all myself. And as far as, I don   t know how I got connected with Chris Whittle, maybe somebody on the Knoxville News Sentinel suggested it. Anyway, I spent a lot of time in the News Sentinel morgue and with other people in Knoxville. It was a really good book.  Chris didn   t know whether he wanted to talk to me or not so he asked me to come down and had me for dinner in his mansion, his building there. He checked me out and said I passed muster so he started talking to me, and wound up that I talked to his father and mother and a whole bunch of people. Well, he had a sister, too. She was very helpful, and two or three people gave me a lot of information. Chris even let me talk to his psychiatrist in New York. I   d never had that happen before. The guy, I talked to the guy about six times on the telephone and the windup, Chris was in New York most of the time, and every Saturday morning at ten o   clock we would have a conversation. The publisher of the book named it Empty Empire, and Chris went through the roof, so did I, 23  because it was not an empty empire. Chris came up with the title Empire Undone, which is was. (Laughs)  He dealt with some publisher in London, and of course I don   t know what London would say about that, so I called up and got his secretary and made an appointment, talked to him in London by phone, about two weeks to answer something, and I got him. I did a lot of research on Chris, and I liked him a whole lot and he seemed to like me. He had a good idea, as you probably know, to get an idea and go sell General Motors or Canon or somebody on it, camping with the photographs, and this, that and the other. They would give him an advance and support the project, and he got it and had his profit, and did tremendously good work. Then when he decided to buy all those televisions on his own and put them in the schools and take his revenue later, it just didn   t work.  Happy Chandler was a very interesting story. I   d known him and liked him, and he was quite old but he was active and alert. He lived in Versailles, Kentucky which is pretty close to Lexington, and I would drive down there every morning, be there by nine o   clock, about five days a week, and we   d talk and then I   d eat lunch with him. He had this southern cook, you know, wonderful food (laughs) and then I   d drive home. One time I was down there and a snowstorm came and I couldn   t drive so he gave me a pair of his pajamas, and I slept in his guest house. He was a lot of fun and he loved Elzene.  You were asking about Elzene. You know, when I was in Covington, it   s a very strong Catholic town, and the bishop there is, you know, a little count or lord I guess. He has a lot of weight. I printed something in the paper that made him mad. I don   t know what it was. It was a trivial thing, but he let it be known, and I didn   t like that. I wanted to find some way to   I was right and he was right, you know. Well, I wanted to find some way to make friends with him and I did, through my lawyer who was also a Catholic   s bishop   s lawyer. We would meet out at the lawyer   s country home, and the bishop got to knowing me and knowing Elzene. We were all there together, and you know sausage making and dinners and derby parties and this, that and the other, so Elzene invited the bishop to come to dinner. Whatever she had in her attitude charmed the hell out of him. He would make trips to Rome and he would sidle over to her,    Take this, don   t tell anybody.    It   d be a necklace or something.    I didn   t bring anything for anybody else.     And we went over to his, the bishop   s, house several times, and they popped up with a World Health Organization meeting in  Rome . The bishop was going, the lawyer was going, the lawyer   s wife, a group of maybe eight or ten, so they invited us to go. We paid our own way, but they invited us to go and be part of it. We went, we had an audience with 24  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  the pope. It was the public audience, you know, it has a big stage and a lot of bishops and cardinals and everything up there. This was Pope John Paul, and he spoke in about six languages and took his time. When he came down off the stage and came up the center aisle, all the women stood up in their chairs trying to see him, trying to touch him. (Laughs) Anyway, I guess that   s too much of that.  Are you working on your own autobiography?  No, I   m not. I probably should have, not so much for public sale, but for the family and actually for myself. I can remember back to four, five and six pretty well. I remember my brother and I getting out and starting to dig a hole to China. We were going to   it was about three feet square. About the same time my grandmother died. That was my first knowledge of death, you know, intimately. I remember details like, while we were waiting for the funeral, which I guess was two o   clock in the afternoon, my brother and I, my older brother and I were on our own, and I remember buying an all-day sucker, which was grape and it was kind of lumps, like cobblestones, on the tongue, you know. It   s strange that you remember those things. I remember being seduced by, at the age about seven, by Mary Ward Mitchell who was about ten or eleven or twelve. I don   t know, but she   d been to California, apparently had some sex experience of some kind, came back. She lived across the street from our house, and I don   t know what happened. I   m not sure what happened but I know she   I was there.  We   ll come back next year and read it.  What   s that?  Your autobiography. We   ll come back next year and read it.  Well, you know, I had to tap a telephone to solve a big mystery in Texas. One of the college coaches showed up to speak at the Shamrock Hotel all bloody, went and washed and cleaned up, made his speech. At that time, which was about    51 or    52 somewhere along in there, there were a lot of betting on sports, and coaches were suspect and alumni leaders and I don   t know. It was in the air. So this coach wouldn   t tell how he had his   he landed at Hobby Airport, came about fifteen miles to the Shamrock, that   s a pretty long stretch, and we kept trying to find out what happened, and (laughs) I was managing editor then, I guess, and my city editor did an unwise thing. He told the president of the college that we knew that he knew who beat up the coach, which was totally untrue. It was a good cop, bad cop push, you know. Anyway, and so the college president blasted the hell out of us, but at that time we had AP, UP and International News Service. We got a really black eye for 25  yellow journalism so I just said,    Well dammit, we   ve got to solve this thing.     So we set out to do it, took quite a bit of time, and it turned out that our number one suspect was the husband of the coach   s secretary, who were having an affair, and her husband found out about it so he beat the coach up. So we started at the airport and covered everything to the Shamrock Hotel and got the district attorney to call in our number one suspect. When you   ve got a good paper you can do things like that, and the husband denied everything. The district attorney had done his best. Everybody had done their best but I knew that we could get it if we stayed at it so we found out that this couple had moved to Houston and they lived in a big warren of apartments. The sheriff was a friend of mine so I told him I wanted to tap the guy   s telephone. We were going to try to push on it. So the sheriff got the pair   s cable numbers and the connection appeared in a five or six block area, four or five places.  I rented an empty apartment. I told a lie to the owner and told him I had a guy coming to work for me and I didn   t know whether he   d like it or not but I paid a week in advance, got the apartment. It had a phone in it, went over to this junction box across the street where the couple   s phone was also hooked up. So all I had to do was hook my phone to their terminals, but there were four sets of terminals up there. I had to go up the pole four times, got a big bruise on my hip from hanging on   thigh from hanging on the   not everybody likes this or appreciates it, but I thought it was necessary.  Anyway, we got the phone tapped, and I had a recorder there hooked up to our phone. The city editor, who was a bad boy on the case, he called the husband and said that the newspaper there identified   said,    We finally broke the story and we   re going to print it tomorrow,    and it wasn   t me. So we kept listening on the phone, and heard the boy ringing out and a woman answered. He said,    Mother, let me talk to Dad.       Well son, he   s already gone to bed.       Well, it   s important. Get him up.    So the father came to the phone and the boy said,    They say they know that I did it and they   re going to print it tomorrow. What should I do?    And the father said,    You   re just going to have to keep your mouth shut like you have been.    We knew then we had the right people, and the right story.  So I had our lawyer, who happened to be   oh, who was it? He was one of the Nuremberg prosecutors, Leon Jaworski. Well, I guess y   all haven   t heard  of him . Anyway, he called up the coach. It   s not illegal to tap a telephone. It   s illegal to expose what you learned, what you overheard. So Leon just pretended we knew everything that happened, had these documents in front of him, and the coach confessed, and, but he had previously lied to the president of the university. The coach said 26  Bishop  Trimble  Bishop  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble     Well, let me get through the spring practice I   ve got, and then I   ll issue a statement Monday that I knew who beat me up and that it was a personal matter.    We agreed to just print that on page one without anything else, but the president was upset that the coach had lied to him, telling him he didn   t know who it was that beat him up. He fired him promptly, and I was   you know, I felt bad about it but it was one of those things that I believe I should have done.  I was playing bridge in Washington with Lou Nichols who was at that time the number two guy in the FBI, and I don   t know how we got to talking about past experiences, but I relayed the story. He said,    Vance, stop. I   m off duty tonight, but you broke the law. Don   t ever repeat that story to anybody again.    (Laughs) All that   s aside.  What university was that?  What?  What university?  I haven   t said yet. (Laughter) I haven   t said yet.  Sounds like you always were up for a challenge. You liked a good challenge. Alright, let   s fast-forward a little bit. So you turned 100 recently. Can you talk a little bit about that day, your birthday?  Oh, sure. I was surprised   well, I know that 100 is a news event, and I knew that I was involved. I   m not necessarily modest but I didn   t like the attention, and I first rejected the idea of having a reception party. Finally I agreed, and my daughter and my nephew   s wife and some other people here, city friends, arranged everything and kind of issued a general invitation. To my surprise my first administrative assistant in Covington, who later became executive assistant to the publisher of Scripps Howard. She had an important job like buying jet planes and stuff like that, really high up. She now works for the TV. It   s in Knoxville. What is it?  HGTV  The television branch of Scripps. Anyway, she came, brought her husband.  And one of the first girl reporters I hired, Nancy Moncrief Phillips, came with her husband, and Tom Scheffey, who was one of my early reporters, came from Hartford, Connecticut, and Carl West, who was editor of the Frankfurt paper for thirty-four years, came. He used to work for me, he came down, and we had a couple of cocktail parties here when they arrived. Then on Saturday we had a rolling brunch and then another rolling brunch here on Sunday, and we all went to the country club from five to seven o   clock. There were about a hundred of27  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  my friends there. Carol Ann had a photographer who shot pictures and everything. I spoke for about twenty minutes, and the governor sent a proclamation, and the city had a    Vance Trimble Day,    and a couple other things. I don   t know what they were, and that was about it.  Everyone wants to know what   s the secret to living that long?  I laid it off on you. I made a big joke out of it, your requesting my recipe for longevity. I don   t know if we were talking about it or not, but I told them I got pressed and pressed and pressed by the professor, and I finally made up something. I said,    First of all stay in love, eat right, not too much whisky, no cigarettes, don   t walk under any ladders, and watch out for black cats.    (Laughter) I got two or three laughs there, tried to make it light. Paid tribute to my parents and my daughter and my wife, and talked about the spotlight turning on you when you get to be 100, you know. Let me turn on this air-conditioning. I was where?  You were talking about your party.  Oh yeah, well that about covers it. We had a real good time.  Lots of cake?  Well, I hate colored cake so we just had two or three kinds of cupcakes made for the party, some message on them. As a matter of fact I couldn   t read it.  So what do you plan to do next?  Listen to books and keep breathing.  And writing?  Oh no, it   s too difficult. I   m almost through with the computer now. I have Dragon Naturally Speaking dictation system, which is good, and Zoom Text.  Well, you could record your history and let someone else type it, for your autobiography.  Well, I   ll tell you what, my memory is not as good as it should be perhaps, but it   s not bad. You know, I can recall a lot of stuff, and snips and snatches, but a lot of things I   ve just forgotten. Sometimes I suddenly think of something that happened that I   d forgotten all about. (Laughs) Too many people, too many years.28  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Bishop  Trimble  Well, tell us what a typical day is like for you now.  Okay. I usually get up about six forty-five and I come in, put the coffee on. I   ve got one and a half housekeepers, I   ve got really two, and my main housekeeper comes and fixes  breakfast . Coffee is ready to plug in and I drink coffee and look at the TV news, and use my bicycle over there to keep blood flowing in my feet. I found out that   s very helpful. Then I read the Seminole News. I used to read the Daily Oklahoman too, but it got to be too difficult. It   s not worth the effort, and the Oklahoman has changed. I don   t know if you read it or not, but in about the last two or three months they   ve changed their news editor, and their make-up is different. I don   t know whether you   ve noticed it or not, but some wild stuff. They   ve done a lot of book-type things with initial letters, which is really kind of hard to read, and they took all the national and foreign news, capsuled it into one ten-point, twelve-point headline which is too difficult. I mean, I just used to scan it for the headlines, if I saw something I   d try to read it, but it   s too difficult.  Then we have to consider grocery shopping and things like that, things around the house that are going wrong. Our oven is on the brink now. I had to have a repairman come in. It took him a while to figure that out. I go out and get the mail about two thirty in the afternoon, and I have medication three times a day. I have congestive heart failure so I take medication for that, and I spend a lot of time listening to the digital speaker there, because it   s very helpful and very entertaining and informative. I don   t send much   I have a secretary who comes, used to come every day, in the evening, for a couple of hours to take care of the bills and some correspondence, this, that and the other. She now only comes twice a week. She   s coming tonight, five thirty, be here until seven thirty, and she records a lot of the books from the Library of Congress, very convenient, puts them on a flash drive and they   re very helpful, and that   s about it. I go to bed anywhere between nine o   clock and one o   clock, sometimes if I can stay awake I listen late, but if I can   t, I don   t.  Till one o   clock, that   s pretty late.  Oh, I know it. I   d say that   s probably two or three times a month, not too often. Usually I go to bed about nine o   clock. I don   t sleep well at all. I sleep about an hour and a half at a stretch.  Well, what I want to know is, when history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  Nothing. No, I   m really not kidding. I   ve had too much attention I think, really honestly. It was fun to have people know who you are, and if they 29  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  know who are and they help you. If they know who you are and they fight you, that   s not so good, but I only wanted to be known, to be respected and have help in whatever I was doing. I have been helped by a lot of people, you know, and I can   t begin to remember them all. When I won the Pulitzer I got this stack of letters about this high of important people that admired what I did, and I didn   t even save them. I should have.  My papers, we built a room onto the library down there, Elzene and I did. Elzene mainly collected   we had about five thousand books and we wanted to donate them down there, and they didn   t have room so we paid to have a room built on and it expanded the library quite a bit. Then I had to get those books evaluated for tax purposes, and I called OU and tried to find somebody who could put me in touch with a person who could do that. I got ahold of Don DeWitt at Western History Collections and he recommended David Dary, who was the then head of the journalism department, and got with David. But Don said,    How about your papers, could we have them?    I said,    I don   t think you want them. There   s just a bale of stuff.    No, he wanted them so I shipped them all down there. I think they   ve got a four or five-foot file under a lot of important people. They   ve got it in inches. (Laughs) Anyway, my Scripps research papers are at Ohio University. I   ve got a lot of stuff saved but I don   t know what it is, it   s been so long since I made use of it. My nephew, a psychiatrist in Dallas and another of my nephews were going to come this weekend, and they   re both interested in our family history. I   ve got papers on my grandfathers and my parents and so forth, and I think they want to look over that.  And where did they come from, your grandparents?  Well, my maternal grandmother was born in Tennessee. She was a big leader in the ME Church, South   real big. She wrote two books of poetry, and her husband was a lawyer and he was captured at Vicksburg and escaped and later was a United States Marshal at Fort Smith for    Hanging    Judge Parker for a few years. My mother had to be there, she was about twelve years old or something like that. I never knew it, though, too late to talk to her about it. I think Colonel Crump was an Arkansas-born. My grandmother was born in Tennessee, I guess. My father was born in Bowling Green. His father was born in Frankfurt, Kentucky, and apparently was an agent or salesman, maybe a travelling salesman for a shoe manufacturer in St. Louis. He lived later in Harrison  Arkansas  and I think died there, not too sure about his mother. You know some things you should take care of when the time is right, and some you wait too late for.  We all wait too late. That   s it. That   s what I have. Thank you for 30  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  sharing.  Certainly.  Is there anything more you would like to add?  The strangest thing that ever happened to me, I think, was while we  my wife and I  were traveling around in a beat up Chevrolet. I was driving and we were down in Arkansas on the opposite side of the Mississippi River from Vicksburg, directly across. I had overhauled the engine and a wrist pin came loose and went through the block and ruined the motor. See, the block has the pistons in it and the crankshaft and so forth. We only had a few bucks, I don   t know, three, four, or five. I don   t know how much it was. So we spent the night on the Arkansas side.  In the morning   there was a toll bridge over  the river . I think the toll was probably fifty cents. There was a guy there, some kind of little store there on this end of the bridge, the Arkansas end. I told him I arranged for the guy with a truck to push us over to Vicksburg. That meant a dollar and a half in tolls because the two going over and the one coming back. I had to pay his and I had to pay him something for pushing us. (Laughs)  We   d never been to Vicksburg, and we were going to cross the bridge and cut across on the Mississippi side. We were going up the highway we   d never been on before, a two-lane road. The guy stopped behind me and came up and said,    Where do you want to go?    I said,    I don   t know. I   ll flag you.    So he kept pushing. I looked over here to the right and saw a big hefty lot and I flagged him. It was about two blocks from the highway. He pushed me over there and I paid him off. We were right there in the middle of that big vacant space. It turned out to be a cotton gin yard. Here we were in Vicksburg and it was about July the third. Vicksburg fell on July the fourth and it   s a sad place. No place to go and solicit the typewriter repair work. So here we were out here in this thing and it   s going to be a couple of days until I could go to town and try to get some repair work.  I had this car fixed to where the backseat came down and Elzene put sheets in there. We   d go to the filling station, brush our teeth, and come back and put on our pajamas and go to bed just like we were home. Anyway, so that evening I think at the filling station I got to tune up their typewriter or cash register or something, got a couple of bucks. I said,    Well let   s walk downtown,    which was about ten or twelve blocks away,    and see what it looks like,    because we   d never been there. I was going to have to kind of figure out some strategy for seeking work to make some money. 31  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  We were going down the right side of the street and came across a thing that had a little old picket fence. It was kind of a court or houses facing each other with a court between them. I just accidently looked over to the court in front of a house. What do you think I saw? I saw a Chevrolet block  No head, no pan, just the block with the pistons, crankshaft, and everything in it, no transmission   and water in the, it had been raining I guess, water in the pistons. That   s exactly what we need. That   s what we   ve got to have  You know, in order to repair our motor and get our car going again. I think it   s mysterious that I was led to that. I can never get over that.  So I went to the door and knocked and some nice looking guy came out, working man. I said,    Who owns that Chevrolet block there?    He said,    I do.    I said,    Is it for sale?    He said,    Yeah.    I said,    How much?    He said,    Two-fifty,    two dollars and fifty cents. I said,    I want it, but can you hold it until Monday evening?    He said yeah he would, because I didn   t have enough money to pay him. I had to go find work to make some money. It turned out that he was an out-of-work automobile mechanic. I asked if he could help me and he said,    Yeah, for a dollar a day.    This was deep depression.  Anyway, I went to town the next day and made nine bucks, and we bought the thing. He and I went out there and stripped down my car, took the radiator off, took the transmission loose. With our backs, we didn   t have any crane, we hoisted that whole engine out, took the head off it. It had valvinated valves and we had to adjust the tappets. It was quite a bit of work. Put the transmission all back, put the pan on, fill it full of oil and everything. Took us two days to do it, but finding that block I thought was   it still hits me as very mysterious. I just can   t get over, I really can   t.  A little bit more than luck.  Well what I was desperate for, I was led right to it. Who did that?  I don   t know.  (Laughs) Well anyway, but part of that was I went to a newspaper office and they wanted two typewriters fixed. I said,    Okay, I   ll get on this here.       No, no  You have to take them to your shop.    I didn   t have any shop. (Laughter) So I put these two damn heavy typewriters under my arms. I was on the second floor, walked down, then I looked around. Here I was in the middle of Vicksburg. I saw a building up there. It turned out to be city hall and police department. I walked in there with these typewriters, and I saw some cops coming out of the room, turned 32  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  Trimble  Finchum  out to be their locker room. I went in there and there was a big bench. I shoved the revolvers aside. (Laughter) Nobody challenged me. I put these typewriters down, got out a can of gasoline and everything I needed. It   s a wonder I got out the building, you know, with no permit and anything like that. That was part of that day. Well, I know you all have to go.  Went through some rough times, but here you are.  Here I am   What would you ask a centenarian if you were doing the interviewing?  Oh I   d ask them the same thing you   re asking, precisely.  Okay, that   s good to know. (Laughter) Thank you.  -------  -------
