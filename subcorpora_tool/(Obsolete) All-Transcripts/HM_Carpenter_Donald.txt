Story_ID: 616375
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And management compels me to ask these of everyone.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There kind of like a warm up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the first question is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food? Yeah, yeah I do come to think of it, ground beef.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I love ground beef.  I could probably eat it every day.

Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: California.
Speaker 1: And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I haven't really--I have a multitude.  It's kind of hard to even think of one, one, one right at the moment.  Probably I don't, I, I can't think of one.
Story_ID: 616376
Speaker 1: Well I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side [Robert Adams].
Speaker 2: Okay
Speaker 1: But we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Okay good (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her name is kind of an interesting name, Modestine, M-O-D-E-S-T-I-N-E.  Her maiden name is Truesdale [sic.], T-R-U-E-S-D-A-L-E and Carpenter [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter] is her last name.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a story behind the name Modestine that passed down in the family?
Speaker 2: If it is, they never really mentioned it.  I've never, never really heard of anyone else named Modestine, so it's certainly not a common name.  We were, it was down in the South and I would imagine probably in that era. She was born in 1928 and could have easily been named by some of the people my grandmother [Lillie Travis Truesdell] worked for.  I would imagine it's not a typical common Afro American name I can tell you that. So I would imagine (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it seems like it's like an embodiment of modesty, female modesty or something, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that women are striving for.  I just wondered if there was a story that--
Speaker 2: No, if, if it is they never mentioned it.
Speaker 1: Okay, do they call her that Modestine the full name do you think?
Speaker 2: Well, down there they call her Mody, M-O-D-Y--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and very few people call her Modestine. Some, some of her people, some of the people here call her that, but mostly down there they call her Mody, M-O-D-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is June the 28th, 1928.
Speaker 1: And was she born in Tyler [Texas]?
Speaker 2: She was born in, in, in Terrell, Texas.
Speaker 1: Terrell.
Speaker 2: Right out of Dallas [Texas], about thirty miles from Dallas.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them?  Can you trace them back to slavery and if--?
Speaker 2: We can't quite--we, we, interesting enough, we--in our family reunion, as I mentioned we had a double six generation a few years ago and I am well aware of all the members in that particular generation.  I am in the fourth generation of this, of that six.  My mother is the third; yeah, I'm in the fourth generation.  So, much more knowledgeable on my mother's side than my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, well I'm asking about your mother's side now and so you, now I, I was shown a picture earlier when we came in of your, was that your great-grandmother or your grandmother?
Speaker 2: That was my mother's grandmother--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which was my great-grandmother, my daughters' great-great, and my granddaughter, great-great-great grandmother.
Speaker 1: So how far back does your great-grandmother go?  When, do you know approximately when she was born and where?
Speaker 2: She's been dead I beat you about fifteen years.  She was about ninety-six when she died, so ever how you do the math.
Speaker 1: She was born in the 19th century, 1890s apparently (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, somewhere off in there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but did--
Speaker 2: I can't, I really can't go any further.  I've heard them--
Speaker 1: Did she talk about her, her mother and grandmother at all to you?
Speaker 2: Well, we came to Utah in 1952 I was nine years old.  They were in Texas, so we sort of went back and I really didn't, other than the family reunions, really didn't talk with her a lot in terms of the old history.  They were in- kind of interesting.  They were quite secretive.  You know I, you know I would say, "Well, how is the connection between this and that?"  "Oh we don't want to talk about that."  I don't know what was going on back there, but they just didn't talk a lot beyond her generation.
Speaker 1: Do you think it had anything to do with the trouble that black people would perpetually be in, in the South with, you know with the circumstances being the way they were with segregation?
Speaker 2: Yeah I don't, I don't think it was a lot of closeness in the family though.  I think it was, I get the impression that other than my great-great-grandmother, great-great-grandmother and her sister and her brother there seemed to have been conflict between the family members, 'cause it never extended beyond them.  You know we never talked about uncle this and uncle that.  It was just her, her sister, and her brother, so it was, it obviously was something going on (laughter).
Story_ID: 616377
Speaker 1: Now did your family on your mother's [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter] side own any land or did they, what kind of work did they do?
Speaker 2: My grandmother [Lillie Travis Truesdell] and great-grandmother mostly were domestic workers, working in homes, white people homes at that particular time.  They were not educated people.  They were good people, just simply not educated, good church people.  So, as I remember, my grandmother worked in the kitchen in a school, and they worked for rich white folks back, back in that era.  Not really highly educated, but, but you know good common sense (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now did, did you know your grandfather's [Oscar Truesdell] on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any--
Speaker 2: Never knew any of them.
Speaker 1: Great-grandfather or grandfather?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay, was there any stories about what happened to them or what?
Speaker 2: Well, I know my grandmother was married a couple of times and I've seen pictures of her.  His name was Robertson [ph.].  I've seen pictures of Mr. Robertson, but I've never heard them talk too much.  I think he died.  There was one before him.  I have no idea, no idea what--it was kind of interesting when I was born see my mother was only fifteen years old, so we were raised--my, another lady--my grandmother didn't really raise my mother, so it, we were raised by sort of an adopted aunt (background noise) in Winona, Texas, so I mean it was (background noise)--
Story_ID: 616378
Speaker 1: We were talking about your grandparents [Lillie Travis Truesdell and Oscar Truesdell] and your mo- your, your relatives on your mother's [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter] side.  Well, what did your mother say about growing up in, in Tyler [Texas]?  How did she like it and what were her impressions of Tyler?
Speaker 2: Well, you have to almost go back to that era, 1943.  It was typical of what was going on at that time in the South, very difficult.  She was a young girl with a baby, and I think she, as I remember, took a lot of heat with her just being fifteen years old and having an illegitimate child and I remember her talking about how she had to go out and work and pick cotton and do things just in order to, to, to take care of me.  She didn't really have a lot of family support, so it was just kind of the two of us, and I think that's probably why even today the relationship she has with me is quite different than her other children because we went through a lot of, a lot together and like I said she didn't really live with her mother, she lived with sort of a foster aunt and so the relationship was a little strained, I think, between her and her mother.  In fact, her mother had children that are younger than me, so I have aunts that are younger than me.  Just, it was, and then of course she, my grandmother was married to another guy.  He was a sailor and so she was busy with her life.  So, my mother really didn't feel she had strong family support, and she had to quit school, I think, in the ninth grade to go to work to take care of me and, which was quite a struggle for her.
Speaker 1: Okay, now so she--now, so you were raised, you know, at least your early years were spent in Tyler too right until what, what age, what age did you come to--?
Speaker 2: We left Tyler in 1952, is when we came to Utah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So from '43 [1943] to '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: So you were about nine years old.
Speaker 2: I was nine years old when we came out here, rode the train.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother had three other children by then.  I think she married my stepdad in '46 [1946] or '47 [1947], somewhere off in there.
Speaker 1: Okay and he was Carpenter [John Carpenter]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 616379
Speaker 1: Now let me go back and--now, so your mother [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter] she had to drop out of school--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, well I, well let, let me--well I should just go to your father's side.  And I don't know how much you know about him, but well I'll ask--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know who my real father is.  He was--
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah so I'll ask you for two father information.  I guess your blood father (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I guess yeah.
Speaker 1: --and your stepfather.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So your, your birth father--
Speaker 2: My real father was about, as I remember I know who he is.  He was--
Speaker 1: What was his, can you give us his name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His name was Robert Adams, A-D-A-M-S, Robert Adams, and he was about ten years older than her, so he was about twenty-seven.  I think it was a big fallout in terms of a twenty-seven year old man taking advantage of a fifteen year old, fourteen year old girl.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But interestingly enough, I didn't necessarily have a relationship with him, but I had a stronger relationship with his mother [Lola Brown] who stepped up to the plate and helped my mother take care of me.  She was very fond of me, my grandmother on that side.  So any interaction I had with him was just because of her.  In fact, she tried to keep me in Texas when my mother moved to Utah.  She opted not to, to go along with that.  So, I know my father.  I know his children and never was necessarily a close relationship.  My stepfather, who she married in--
Speaker 1: Before we get to him--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay good (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I just wanna ask you some more questions about your birth father.  What do you know about the ancestors on his side?  Is there anything about his family that stands out or did they--?
Speaker 2: They lived, they lived in Jasper, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I used to go with my grandmother to Jasper, and he was the only child that she had.  So, I knew all of her sisters and her brothers in Jasper and cousins and et cetera.
Speaker 1: Were they farmers or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah they lived in rural Jasper [Jasper County, Texas] in Huff Creek [Texas] sort of in the country, and in fact interesting enough as we talk about it the, the Byrd murder they had down there, that bridge is right, half a block from one of the old homesteads.
Speaker 1: Oh, the murder in--
Speaker 2: In Jasper.
Speaker 1: Jasper, Texas.
Speaker 2: A few years ago, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's where the, the, a man named Robert Byrd [sic. James Byrd, Jr.] was drugged behind a pickup truck (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah they drug him right by--I have property there, my grandmother's home.  But, it's off in the woods and it's just kind of property there.  I don't know what I'll ever do with it.  I can't imagine anyone wanting, wanting to live--it's kind of nine miles out in the country, what they call Huff Creek.  But it was interesting when the murder did occur they had it on TV and low and behold that was the house (laughter).  It was really, really weird.
Speaker 1: Yeah, when Robert Byrd was killed, yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Just the old bridge right, half a block, if that far.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So, I had knowledge, of course I was quite young now and my grandmother who came from Tyler [Texas] probably saw herself as more affluent than those country people.  So, as I remember when we went to Jasper, particularly to Huff Creek, it was kind of like city folks coming to the country, so we were kind of treated a little different.
Speaker 1: So your grandmother and your great-grandmother you said they did like day work for rich white people and they were considered more urban than, than country (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --people in Jasper, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah my, my, my grandmother on my father's side worked for quite wealthy people in Tyler, and they were quite financially good to her, so she maneuvered quite well I'll put it that way.  She was Seventh-day Adventist and so we were, she was quite hooked into that experience as well.  But she, it was, she only had the one son and so I was the connection for her.  She wanted more than anything really to raise me and to, to let, she often asked my mother, "Give him to me, I'll take care of him.  You can't take care of him."  You know and my mother never would really do that, but my mother told me that when she couldn't really take care of me I probably stayed with her a couple of years and she said she very much appreciated her stepping in.  She couldn't have made it without her, and I often talk, "Well, why didn't your mother help you?"  But, it was a strained relationship there, so she was very indebted to my real father's mother.  She has been dead about ten years.
Story_ID: 616380
Speaker 1: Now what did Robert Adams do and where did he go?
Speaker 2: He was in the [U.S.] military.  He was a professional gambler, hustler.  I remember I heard him say he came from the military you know in that era, and I've never really known him to work other than in Tyler [Texas].  He gambled quite a bit.  He was a street hustler.  He had a very nice wife.  His wife was a school teacher, and she more or less took care of me.  He was probably a well kept person, a ladies' man.
Speaker 1: Okay. Married to a school teacher.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A very nice lady and they had three children.
Speaker 1: Now did you get to know him, I mean really as a, as a father?
Speaker 2: I never really referred to him as a father.  He was just Robert Adams to me.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: I think my [paternal] grandmother [Lola Brown] struggled with that, but that was just the relationship.  It was never no secret, of course we'll get to that, who I considered my father is my stepfather [John Carpenter].
Speaker 1: Okay now--
Speaker 2: I mean it was no question.  I never really carried his name--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --until we changed it.  I was a Truesdell just like my mother [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter].
Speaker 1: So he took really no interest in you in those early days?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Until he got older.  It's another story to that though (laughter).
Story_ID: 616381
Speaker 1: Okay let's get to that in a minute, but let me ask you about your stepfather.  Wha- can you give us his full name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, John Carpenter.
Speaker 1: John Carpenter.
Speaker 2: John Edward Carpenter.
Speaker 1: And what about his ancestors and his people?
Speaker 2: I probably can only talk about his mother [Bernice Carpenter].  We were talking somewhere around '48 [1948] when my mother [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter] married him.  I was about six, six years old, something like that, and we left there in '52 [1952] and so I really don't know too much about his people other than his mother.  But I knew all of his brothers and sisters; there were about nine of them.  So I knew all of them.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now was he, what kind of work did his family do or did he do?
Speaker 2: All of them were mostly domestic type workers, although he had training in radio repairman and that was one of the reasons we came to Utah--we can talk about that later in terms of what got us to Utah.  He went to a radio school in Tyler [Texas], and when he was seeking better employment he got on at Hill Air Force Base in Utah in 1952 because of that training.  That's what got us to Utah.  Although he was probably out of all of his brothers and sisters the most, as I remember, probably did the best.  He's a--made the greater effort to better himself.  That's why we left the South.
Speaker 1: So, he earned a position at Hill Air Force Base (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hill Air Force Base as a radio technician and did quite well, retired after many, many years.
Speaker 1: Is it in, in Ogden [Utah] or Salt Lake City [Utah]?
Speaker 2: It's, well Hill Air Force Base is about five or six miles from here, one of your military installations.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay now about what year was your stepfather born, you know?
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-four [1924], August the 16th, 1924.
Speaker 1: So he was, okay four years older than your mother.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty-four [1924].
Story_ID: 616382
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about him [Carpenter's stepfather, John Carpenter].  What kind of personality did he have?
Speaker 2: My--him and my mother [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter] had ten children, and I was the oldest, and the one closest to me is six and half years younger than me.  It was never no question in my mind that even though I was his stepchild I was, I've never felt the sting of being a stepchild, because shortly after my mother married him they automatically just changed my name to Carpenter, which caused some real problems later in life.  In fact, it's only been about fifteen years that I've been able to get a birth certificate straight 'cause I had to go to court and everything to get it straight because I knew it would cause problems later with Social Security [Social Security Administration] because actually on my birth certificate it was Donald R. Truesdale [HistoryMaker Donald Carpenter].  So, I had to go to court and I had to hire an attorney.  I had to deal with Austin, Texas.  Then I was born with, a midwife delivered me in the country in Texas and they had my birthday all screwed up.  It was, it was a mess.  I had to certi- my mother had to certify I was born on the 27th.  When she turned in the paperwork, she put the 29th and so it was complicated and tangled.  But to my father, even in later, later years, particularly as I progressed on, he often said to me, "Out of all my children even though you're not my natural child, you're my best child," because I was very appreciative of, 'cause I knew what my real father [Robert Adams] had done, and I knew what had happened with him and I, you know, what I am today he helped me to become that.  So, far as I'm concerned he is my father, no question.
Story_ID: 616383
Speaker 1: Is there a story as to how, well first is there a story as to how your biological father [Robert Adams] met your mother [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter]?
Speaker 2: She told me that he was in that timeframe, '42 [1942], just returned from the war [World War II, WWII], I guess he might have had probably money saved up or something and he was an older and she told me that she always felt that he took advantage of her 'cause she was so young.  He was about twenty-seven, and she was only fourteen and you know the glitter and glamour of an older guy and whatever goes with it.  He was just something in that era, and he was quite, like a say quite a ladies' man.  So, she was probably fascinated with all of that until the pregnancy occurred and then he disappeared as typically happen.  So, he really never, really never, never helped her.  So, she often told me had it not been for his mother [Lola Brown], she don't know how she could have taken care of me.
Story_ID: 616384
Speaker 1: Now how did your mother [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter] meet your, your stepfather [John Carpenter]?
Speaker 2: Well, she was living in Tyler [Texas] and he was in Tyler and I never really talked with them about how they, how they met, but at some point you know I guess they pro--I remember down where we lived it was kind of like a hangout for on nor- in north Tyler.  At that particular time you know you had the black folks lived in north and other people lived in south Tyler, and I think it was through that green top I think I heard her say you know she met him and they courted.  When she first married him, I was living with my real father's mother [Lola Brown], but I would always come back and forth over there.  In fact, when they left and came to Utah in '52 [1952], it was some discussion about me staying in, in Texas and not coming with them.  And as I recall her saying he was very adamant, "No, he's coming with us."  So, I mean he was signaling to her, you know, it isn't about a stepchild, he's part of the family, so I came with them--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which was very traumatic on my grandmother.  She really never recovered, 'cause I was that child that she lost in her son [Robert Adams].  So, but she was very, very good to me, my grandmother, financially and taught me music and she, she did quite well, my grandmother on my father's side.  She was probably a little more educated than the rest of them, and she maneuvered quite well.
Story_ID: 616385
Speaker 1: When you think about the personalities of your mother and your stepfather [John Carpenter] in particular, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My mother, no question.  Her and I be--she had so many children and they were so close in particular when we came to Utah I had to really kind of step in and help her quite a bit with those children, and even now my father was a good person, but in the early days he drank quite a bit.  So, I had to be the buffer quite a bit between him and her and she depended a lot on me because she was quite young.  See she was only about twenty-two, twenty-three when we came to Utah, so she was a young woman herself.  In fact, my mother and I are more like brothers and sisters than mother and son.  In fact, I call her Modestine [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter].  I don't call her mother, I call her by her name.  And, but we--I know what she went through for me, so therefore I'm pretty wired close to her, which gets into a whole lot of things later in years, but she make great sacrifices, I mean no question in my mind.  I can name them, go through them.  So, we have quite a close relationship.  In fact, she says to me all of the time, even today, "If I lost any of my children," the most difficult one would be if she lost me.
Story_ID: 616386
Speaker 1: Now, sir, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: The thing I remember the most probably was back in Texas.  As I mentioned, my [paternal] grandmother [Lola Brown] on my dad's [Robert Adams], real dad's side was Seventh-day Adventist, so she was one of these missionary kind of people.  And we used to go all over the country towns around Tyler [Texas] with the little magazine that they, kind of like Jehovah's Witness [Jehovah's Witnesses] and--
Speaker 1: That's on your, your, your birth dad's side?
Speaker 2: Um-hm yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: See remember now I stayed with her, on these pictures that I'm giving you, there are pictures of her and me.  I was a little, looked like three or four.  So, we used to go to church on Saturday and when the Sabbath start Friday night when the sun go down, nothing moves, and we go to church on Saturday and then all during the week I follow her around selling the little magazines at the Seventh-day Adventist used to--so, I remember a lot of being involved around a lot of older people just by nature of following her around, which I think probably have contributed to the great love I have for old people.  I have a unique relationship with older people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I think it all probably was tied into all of that because it was just me and her and her husband [Oscar Brown] and he used to drive us around and we, we would just walk the streets and you know I would be with her and I remember that quite well.
Story_ID: 616387
Speaker 1: Earlier memories in Texas I went, at that time I was going to segregated schools in Tyler and so I have some memory of that kind of experience, T.J. Austin Elementary [T.J. Austin Elementary School, Tyler, Texas].
Speaker 2: Now, yeah I'm gonna ask you about that in a second, but I wanted you to--now can you describe the house you lived in, in Tyler and maybe the neighborhood.  Was there a black side of town (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah we, well it was a house.
Speaker 2: One story, two story?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was just, (gesture) it, it was a (gesture) typical house in that era in, in the neighborhood, and there were kind of a mixture of some of the school teachers had nicer homes and we, we had a decent house.  My grandmother had a better house on my father's [Robert Adams (ph.)] side.  She was more upscale, so I think a lot of times I always like to get back over there because she had running water, indoor bathroom.
Speaker 2: That's in--
Speaker 1: In Tyler.
Speaker 2: That's in Tyler, okay.
Speaker 1: On my mother's [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter] side they still had an outhouse, so naturally it was better living.  But, it was better in many respects.  I think that's why I kind of migrated over there because the food was better.  She had, I was the only one.  I didn't have to compete.  I had to compete on the other side, so I was kind of the, kind of spoiled because she worshiped me, so therefore she made sure I ate well, slept, clean environment, and she had a piano in her house and she was--Lola Brown was her name, and she sort of lived the lifestyle of a middle class Afro American back then.  Certainly you know, it was, it was just different.
Speaker 2: This is your, your father's mother?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  I considered her a high stepper of that era.  I think she projected that image.  She worked for some awful wealthy white folks that really took care of her too (laughter).  And then it was just her and her husband [Oscar Brown] and me, so it was a different ball game and over there where there was a house full.
Speaker 2: So was there, is there a black side of Tyler, Texas?  What do they call (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Does it have a name?
Speaker 1: Well north Tyler.
Speaker 2: North Tyler, okay.  Okay--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah back, back then absolutely.
Speaker 2: Now what, what--we always ask this question, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 1: Well, there was, if you go back to the '40s [1940s] if, like I said all the black folks kind of mixed together and the, back then as I remember the ones that were quote, teachers, you know you had the school teachers and then you had the laborers kind of, but it was not a lot of separation in terms-- it's just the houses were much nicer.  Brick homes versus the shanty wooden house.  So, there were some spots that were better.  There were some spots that were deplorable, as I recall.  I remember my grandmother's sister she really worked for some wealthy white folks, and they built her a brand new house and boy I, we used to love to go down there because that was such a nice house, you know.  I think they built it in 1951 in a newly developed section, and boy that was good living.  But, my grandmother, great-grandmother had a nice house too though.  You know back, back then if they worked for the right family you know and they were loyal and long-termers they made sure that, you know the people that worked for them lived somewhat comfortable. I remember my mother [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter] as I mentioned, my grandmother was a cook in the school, so she used to, we ate because she always would bring the leftovers from the school home with her every day.  I remember us running to the bus to meet her, so we, cause we knew she had food.  So, she really did feed us on that side of the family.  Of course when things were skimpy on that side, I could always run to my other grandmother [Lillie Travis Truesdell] and always be assured that my needs were met.  But, like I say it, it kind of reminded me of the early existence of this town when we moved here.  You had the educated, uneducated, but because of the composition it was hard to distinguish, (laughter) you know.  As we talk later about Utah, some of that will come into play.
Story_ID: 616388
Speaker 1: But, as I re- as I recall you know it was, church was the center of things.
Speaker 2: Now did you all belong, what was the church that--
Speaker 1: Liberty Baptist Church.
Speaker 2: Liberty Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Liberty Baptist Church in Tyler, Texas.  My [maternal] grandmother [Lillie Travis Truesdell], my great-grandmother, my great uncle they were deacons and deaconess of the church and so it was a sense of community.
Speaker 2: Okay, now so, so church was a big part of growing up, being in church?
Speaker 1: Al- always have been--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --for me.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now did you get assigned leadership positions as a youth, and?
Speaker 1: Well, when we progressed on to here I am a musician, I play the piano and organ.  I played for the church for forty-seven years. So church has been a major component in my life.  In fact, I'm quite active in the church right now, chairman of the trustee board.  We'll get to that later, but.
Speaker 2: Okay, which one do you attend here?
Speaker 1: New Zion Baptist Church [Ogden, Utah].
Speaker 2: Has that been your church home since you arrived?
Speaker 1: Um-hm fifty-one years.
Story_ID: 616389
Speaker 1: Now was, was popular culture music part of growing up too? I mean did you hear a lot of the popular stuff (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I pro- I probably because of--I started playing for the church [New Zion Baptist Church, Ogden, Utah] when I was about fifteen, and so I was so programmed that direction until it's been really for me a lot of gospel music probably has been the major driving force for me just by nature of playing for the church, which I think sort of started me a different direction than typical people my age because I never was out there in the world too much 'cause I was so wired to the church.  And it's almost like as I look back thinking, gee did I miss something?
Speaker 1: Now did you have a lot of friends?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I've always been more connected with older people.  But, I think what I am today has been the byproduct of my involvement with older people.  Even in this community here, the older people tend to think a lot of me.  They really do.  And they've done a lot for me and they claim me.  It's a bunch of people that claim fame to what I've done, you know, and so I have a special connection with old people, but it's, I, I didn't necessarily fool too much with people my age.  And I think that's how I got tied so in the Masons and all of that because of being around older people.  But, when I was, my, like I said my mother [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter] had a lot of children and we were very poor, but a lot of these older people like with my grandmother took care of me.  They made sure I had the right clothes to wear to church.  When I went away to school, they gave me money.  They did a lot of things because I was a nice kid (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 616390
Speaker 1: Tell us about school.  Was--now what was the name of your school in--
Speaker 2: T.J. Austin [T.J. Austin Elementary School, Tyler, Texas] in Texas.  That was--
Speaker 1: Okay, T.J. Austin.  Was it named after a black person, educator?
Speaker 2: Principal, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  T.J. Austin, was it called T.J. Austin High School?
Speaker 2: No, well it was elementary.
Speaker 1: Elementary school, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) See when I came here I was in the fourth grade, so it was quite a, quite a shift for me.  I had went to all black schools in Texas and when I came to Utah went right into an integrated school, white teacher the whole nine yards.  So that was somewhat of a cultural shock.  It was just simply different.  I think I even had pictures of that first year.  So--
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in school at T.J. Austin?
Speaker 2: Not that I really remember, just you know the basics.  I don't remember anything.  Like I said I was in about the fourth grade, third or fourth grade when I came, so it was just you know the basic three Rs, reading, writing, math.  School has--I've always saw even at an early stage education as a gateway to self-sufficiency.  So, I've always had a great, always have been programmed.  I think that's why even today I have the Ph.D. because school, I reco- I saw that as the avenue.  So, I've really pushed hard over the years.
Speaker 1: Okay now did you have, were there any special teachers in Tyler [Texas]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: What did they do?  What were their names?
Speaker 2: Ms. Butler [ph.], Butler was one, as I remember her name.  She's probably--like I say I was a kind of kid who was very mannerable to old people.  You know they kind of liked kids who, "Yes ma'am," "No ma'am" and very attentative. So older people have always--I wasn't sassy with old folks, and I always gave them the respect that I felt old people should have, never called them other than Mr. or Mrs. or to that extent.  So, so they, they've always, even as I remember in Tyler it seemed like I was the teacher's pet (laughter). But it was just 'cause I wasn't, I didn't act out and I was easy to, I just didn't cause problems.  It just wasn't my nature.
Story_ID: 616391
Speaker 1: Now when you, when you were nine and moved to--
Speaker 2: Utah.
Speaker 1: --Utah, you moved to Sa--
Speaker 2: Sahara Village [Layton, Utah] that's out in Clearfield [Utah].  That's about fifteen miles from here, 'cause that's where the base was when we came here.  Hill field [Hill Air Force Base, Utah] is a military base about ten miles from here and what they had was base, off base housing for [U.S.] military installations and so most of your poor people stayed, we stayed in the ones in Sahara Village.  We stayed in the ones in Roy [Utah].  In fact, there were three of them.  I think we stayed in all three of them, sort of cinderblock kind of facilities.  Mostly black people who worked for the government stayed there.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's see so did you find it hard to make the adjustment you know to school in Utah as opposed to where you came from even though it was integrated (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really, not really--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I, as I think back about it I, you know I, Texas was Texas, Utah was Utah and I think we lived a little better in Utah than in Texas.  So for me it was, things were better.  So, I've never, I've never really been shifted into that black militant sort of framework.  It's never been a part of me, and as we talk a little later in terms of where I'm at today, I think a lot of that has, has to do with it.  It just you know, the adjustment for me as I remember was, I don't remember a struggle.  I do remember when we first came to Utah in '52 [1952], particularly in Ogden [Utah], we still had to separate in the movie houses, African Americans sit upstairs, but I've never gotten caught into that.  As I progressed on through the system, I did maneuver quite well with the other races. (Gesture) Just never been a problem.
Story_ID: 616392
Speaker 1: Okay so it wasn't a problem.  Now you were treated kind of special in Tyler [Texas]--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --you know, but did you miss that?
Speaker 2: Well, any, any kid I think that is, shows potential and not a problem, teachers just tend to like those kind of people, you know, and I think I carried with me from there to here those same kind of attributes that you know--I, I've always shown a lot of love for older people, so naturally people embrace young people that exhibit that kind of behavior.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, it, it's worked well for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were there any special teachers in Utah?
Speaker 2: Probably more when I got to high school and certainly through higher education I can name numerous people who have just opened doors I couldn't open.  I mean it's, it's just even to when I started teaching, see it's a close gap between my master's degree and when I started teaching at Weber [Weber State College; Weber State University, Ogden, Utah].  I graduated in '72 [1972], and I started teaching in '73 [1973], and I beat out people with Ph.D.'s because the department chair of that program have always said, "You're my son."  And the last day they closed the job he said, "Come up here I got a job for you."  So, I mean I, I've just so had those kind of, kind of things.
Speaker 1: So now did you, now what high school did you attend in Utah?
Speaker 2: Ogden High [Ogden High School, Ogden, Utah].
Speaker 1: Ogden High okay.
Speaker 2: At that particular time, you had the East Bench [Ogden, Utah]--
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry what was the name of the grade school as a matter fact I don't think I got that?  You went to T.J. Austin [T.J. Austin Elementary School] in Tyler [Texas], then and--
Speaker 2: I went to T.J. Austin, then I went to Sahara Village Elementary [Sahara Village Elementary School, Layton, Utah].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I went to North Davis Junior High School [Clearfield, Utah].  I went to also Lewis Junior High [Lewis Junior High School], that was in Ogden [Utah].  We moved around quite a bit.  I went to Roy Junior High School [Roy, Utah], but I only went to Ogden High School and that's where I graduated in 1962.
Speaker 1: Okay, now were you involved in clubs in high school?  Did you run for class officer or that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Not really because I worked.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I worked for Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company] and Kress' [S.H. Kress Company].  And when I was about fifteen here again my mother [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter] had so many children we were so poor I had to work, so my after school activity was working.  I've been working for many, many years.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you have--well what kind of jobs did you work?
Speaker 2: When I worked at Woolworth, stock boy, cleaning, and doing that kind of stuff.  One of the things that happened when I graduated from Ogden High School I was one of the ones that played for graduation at Ogden High School when I graduated from there in '62 [1962] 'cause of my musical abilities and--so I, I you know I, here again if it wasn't work it was the church, work, and trying to better myself 'cause my goal was always to go to college, so I mean I focused on that.  I kept that focus.  That kept me pretty busy really, and then plus as I said my mother had so many children I had to help her.  You know I took care of a lot of those children, changed their diapers and cooked for them, you know.
Story_ID: 616393
Speaker 1: But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, now did you have a favorite course of study in high school [Ogden High School, Ogden, Utah]?
Speaker 1: Probably had to, probably, probably be in the social science arena because when I went on to college my undergraduate was in social work and sociology and then I went on into the master's program in social work--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and then the doctorate is in education.
Speaker 2: Okay, I just wanna, now you graduated from high school in '62 [1962]--
Speaker 1: Sixty-two [1962].
Speaker 2: --when you were a senior did you know where you were gonna go to college?
Speaker 1: Not really.
Speaker 2: Okay did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 2: Did you have any counseling, any help about it?
Speaker 1: Well, at that particular time we only had Weber State University [Ogden, Utah] here, Weber State College at that particular time, so you know I knew it wasn't possible financially to go anywhere else, so that was sort of where I had hoped to go to, to Weber State.  And at that time, I was working for the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  I was a mail clerk in '65 [1965] when I started.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you didn't go right out of school?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you worked--
Speaker 1: When I first graduated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) worked for the post office.
Speaker 1: --I went to work in construction, and then I worked there two or three or four months and I went to work for Wonder Bread, got a job there in the bakery flipping bread, cupcakes, Twinkies.  Then I took the Civil Service Exam in '65 [1965] and got a job working in the post office and did quite well there.  I worked California Sectional Center [ph.], was working the front desk, you know stamps, selling stamps.  But even with that working there throwing parcel post, I started myself to Weber because I knew I could do better than that.
Story_ID: 616394
Speaker 1: So, I was working, married, see I married--I graduated in May 29th of '62 [1962], but I got married in May 15, 1962.  I was actually married before I left high school [Ogden High School, Ogden, Utah], so you can see I went from family, school, marriage.  I have been married for forty-six, forty-seven years, long--
Speaker 2: Tell us how did you meet your wife?
Speaker 1: Well, we started going together in the seventh grade.  Ann [Elizabeth Washington Carpenter] and I have been connected for a mighty long time and then in '62 [1962] through the relationship Ann got pregnant and so I did what was the right thing to do, I married her.  Really a lot of opposition from her mother and my mother [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter].  In fact, neither one of them attended the wedding they were so angry (laughter) about the whole episode, but obviously it had to be the right thing because here we are forty-seven years later still married.  So, I mean I never really had that street--'cause I had responsibility.  Sixty-two [1962] I went to work, did what I had to do.  Went to work for the bakery working nights, went to work for the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], went to school you know so it's--I haven't had a lot of time to lollygag up and down the street.
Story_ID: 616395
Speaker 1: Weber State [Weber State College; Weber State University, Ogden, Utah] in 1965.  Now what--
Speaker 2: Finished in '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Okay what was that like when you were there?  What was Weber State like, did you like it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it was, well I had some professors up there that really mentored me, Dr. Clark [Raymond Clark], Dr. Poe [William Poe], Dr. Ashdown [Rex Ashdown].  I mean they, they really helped me, I'll put it that way, and opened doors I couldn't open and were able to help me get to some financial assistance, 'cause I was, you know I had the one daughter [Tamara Carpenter Larry] and I was working and I was trying and I was struggling.  But, at that particular time it wasn't many blacks at Weber State, very few Afro Americans, so it was, it was during that era.  A lot of concerns, you know, '65 [1965] Johnson's [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] war on poverty program came into existence, Upward Bound.  There was a lot of emphasis toward helping minority students get into the system.
Story_ID: 616396
Speaker 1: Now was your family involved very much in the Civil Rights Movement as such?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh. Unh-uh. No, not at all that I can remember.  No, my mother [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter] was raising children.  My dad [Carpenter's stepfather, John Carpenter] was working and doing his thing, no.  They had the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] that was quite strong at that particular time, but I don't remember them ever involved in anything really.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you were out of, you were at Weber State [Weber State College; Weber State University, Ogden, Utah] when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But did you, what did, how did that affect you and what was your impression of Dr. King in those days?  Did you, did you identify with the movement in any way?
Speaker 2: I at that--I'm trying to think back in '62 [1962] I had just gotten married and then I remember we had an Afro American guy here Marshall White, the Marshall White Center [Ogden, Utah] that's over here.  He was a black police officer that was killed in November of '63 [1963], and I think Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was killed in October of '63 [sic. November 22, 1963], so, so I remember that quite, I remember that very well when both of them died.  Then I, I've never been really off into the I'm black, I'm proud kind of movement, that militant kind of movement because it really never was me.  And I never really by nature of how I carried myself I never really had major confrontation with the white race.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really never have and, but even when I was going to school probably of all Afro Americans went to Ogden High School [Ogden, Utah] I probably fitted in better with that East Bench [Ogden, Utah] white crowd, you know, because I tended to accent those attributes that didn't make me abrasive, you know.  I've always with anyone looked at attributes that people had that I might have desired.  So one of the ways that helped me was to emulate those things that I saw that perhaps would get me to my ultimate goal, you know, it's, and it's worked very well for me with, in the black communities and white community.  You know I think that's, that's probably where I'm at today right here in this.  I'm, I'm, I'm here because somebody else made sure, you know, so it kind of works that way.
Story_ID: 616397
Speaker 1: So what was your major at Weber [Weber State College; Weber State University, Ogden, Utah]?
Speaker 2: I took a--my major was sociology--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my concentration was social work, and my minor was anthropology.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now, so did, were there any special teachers, you know, that helped you along at Weber?
Speaker 2: That whole social work department.  I think I was their favorite son (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now was there any other black students in the department?
Speaker 2: If it was, it couldn't been no more than about two or three as I remember. Some of the athletes.  You know we were--back then didn't--didn't then and still don't have a tremendous lot of black students that go there.  I think when I finished Ogden High School [Ogden, Utah] it could, could, maybe ten or fifteen Afro Americans was in my graduating class of '62 [1962].  You know it's not a lot of black folks in this town anyway.  I mean it used to be more, but it has really, even looking at the whole state what 1 percent? Not very--nineteen thousand of us.  You got more in your town in two blocks.  So, it makes a tremendous difference.  It's not a lot of us, so just by nature and go back to '52 [1952] it was even a different kind of experience.  So, I mean you know, it, it was just, it, it, it just didn't operate like that, so you had to learn how to survive in this, in this and it was more heavily--when I first came here, this was strictly high level Mormon country.  It has changed quite a bit, which has brought tremendous pressure I think on the Mormon church [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints] because so many outsiders are coming here bringing a different perspective.  When I first came to Utah, I mean, it was, it was nothing open on Sunday; now nothing closes.  They had a much greater halt on the state than they do today, so, so naturally you know to blend in and to survive you either took on some of the characteristics of what you were surrounded with if you wanted to survive.
Story_ID: 616398
Speaker 1: I was asking you, I was gonna ask you about like how you felt about, especially as a sociology major, how did you feel and when did you first find out about the death of Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in 1968, that being April the 4th, '68 [1968] and you would have been a junior then I guess in, in college [Weber State College; Weber State University, Ogden, Utah]?
Speaker 2: Let me back track just a little.  We had in Ogden [Utah] a Hi-Fi murder where we had black military people robbed a store downtown Ogden and killed about three or four white people, one of which as a prominent doctor's wife.  In fact, my mother's [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter], it was her doctor's, his wife, and that really set off, or that was the--I can't think of their name now.
Speaker 1: Now that was in, was that in '67 [1967] or--
Speaker 2: No, no that was, it, it was, I guess I'm a little, little, ahead of myself.  That was in the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was after Dr. King okay.
Speaker 2: That was after that.  I'm trying, I think I was at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] when Dr. King, but he was a very special person to me and I, I don't remember, I remember little in terms of some--I think everybody here was saddened that he had died, but I think there was as I, I don't remember a lot of negative encounter I had, you know, in terms of--because I think what he stood for and the message that he preached wasn't that far out of line in terms of you know why do we, why can't we pull this thing together and why does it have to be this abrasive approach?  We can bring about change through negotiation, you know, talking, resolution, rather than--I never really got into that hardcore militant framework (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, even in the Civil Rights Movement though did, were there any civil rights activists that took to the streets or did they have to take to the streets in Utah to--
Speaker 2: We didn't have to.
Speaker 1: --change any of the segregationist policies?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we did some things like with the Marshall White Center [Ogden, Utah] over here in '66 [1966].  That was in '66 [1966] the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] marched against the city because what it kind of flowed from, in the early days the Marshall White Center was an NCO [non-commissioned officer] club for Afro Americans that couldn't fraternize on these military.  See we had three of them here at one time, and so they built that in order that the black military's NCO was off base and then when they closed that it became the community center, which I participated in, in the late '50s [1950s] and then when the grant money came in to build the Marshall White, Afro Americans in the city felt that was a replacement of the Wall Avenue center, but yet when they built this big building and they wanted to put a white director, so that had a tremendous backlash.  When I grew up in Ogden, this whole area here was a black community.  It doesn't exist anymore.  There is no black community in Ogden.  The Hispanics got it now see, and I see this same thing here.  Actually I serve about 70 percent of my clients (unclear) and Mexican Americans, no question in my mind and I work quite close with the Hispanic community and I have them on the board and I think the signal is coming very clear if you serving that many Mexican American kids and you're community action agency is serving Mexican American families, we find it interesting we have no Hispanic in a leadership position.  I would dare venture when I leave you're gonna get a big push, but they right at the moment seem to think, you know, well you have a lot of sensitivity to Hispanics.
Story_ID: 616399
Speaker 1: Back to the college days when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed there was, so you said there was some, some agitation on the part of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] for change and that sort of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, but, but if I, if I go back to Weber State [Weber State College; Weber State University, Ogden, Utah], particularly in the department I was in, Dr. Clark [Raymond Clark], Dr. Poe [William Poe], Dr. Ashdown [Rex Ashdown] they were type of people who were very committed to helping minority groups pull themselves up.  So, they set the pace in the classroom setting, no question.  Ray Clark worked close.  They were committed to in social work, education to poor people, so poor people automatically pushed quite heavily minority groups and they taught heavily from that slant in the classroom settings, so they had tremendous power in the classroom because they talked about the oppression of poor people, so they were able to keep down too much conflict in the classroom setting itself.  It, it just was the way he did things in terms of finding resources.  See when I went up against the college for tenure when they hired me they hired me as an instructor.
Speaker 1: Okay we're getting way ahead now of ourselves, but I was trying to get to that moment when--
Speaker 2: Well, but it's all, it's all tied to--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I just wanted to get you through graduation first and then, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, get me graduated, all right.
Speaker 1: So, so there wasn't any, were there any commemorations for Dr. King after he passed away or did, did any--
Speaker 2: As I remember at that time I was involved in the Black Scholars United at Weber State, and we had a guy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that like the black student union?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had a black guy from Oakland [California] that was kind of from that movement, and he really took the system on at Weber in terms of the Black Power movement by kind--I remember that now--and I remember he was so with that Oakland mentality that he kind of frightened a lot of people at Weber.  But, Dr. Clark who was chair of the department of social work was the white professor that didn't back down, but he, he was able to refocus all of that anger in a proper direction and even though--this kind name was Robinson, Junior Robinson [ph.]. I mean he was hostile, he was angry, and he was militant, but he liked Clark because he felt he was for real.  And so the administration kind of had him to be the white faculty over the black student union, and so he as a great buffer between, between the forces.  He didn't ignore what was right and moral and ethical, but he also felt, tried to instill there's a way to do it more like in Dr. King's style.  You're not gonna get anywhere bumping heads because you don't have the power.  You don't have the power to do anything.  The more you bump and threaten and all of this, nothing will happen, but a better approach would bring about some kind of change and so Ray took a lot of beatings from fellow faculty because of his heavy commitment to helping minority students.
Speaker 1: So this is Ray Clark, Dr. Ray Clark he was head of the sociology department?
Speaker 2: Twenty-five years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Twenty-five big ones. (Laughter) Forrest [HistoryMaker Forrest Crawford] knows him quite well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That whole gang, Ray was just there.
Story_ID: 616400
Speaker 1: After you graduated in, in what, '69 [1969] I guess it was.
Speaker 2: I finished in the, in the winter of '69 [1969], but graduation took place in May of '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay graduated in 1970, no.
Speaker 2: So I had to, you know I missed the summer, the fall, spring graduation of '69 [1969].  I think I finished that winter quarter and so I had to wait.  Now they do it different.  They graduate twice a year, but at that particular time.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well when you graduated what were your prospects?  Were you looking to get a job right away or?
Speaker 2: At that time when I graduated, I left the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] and went to work for Clearfield Job Corps [Clearfield Job Corps Center, Clearfield, Utah],--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I was in that whole system, and I dealt with a lot of the, you know at that time the Crips, the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] Crips and the St. Louis [Missouri] gangs.  You know Job Corps was a big thing in--historic in '65 [1965] it was in his hay day in the early '70s [1970s], so I was a supervisor at Clearfield Job Corps for about five or six years.
Speaker 1: So you got the gang members from L.A. and from St. Louis that would come here (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh Lord are you kidding.  I mean that's, the recruitment for kids for Job Corps they didn't come from Utah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They came from L.A., them L.A. Crips, them St. Louis gangsters, D.C. [Washington, D.C.], New York [New York].  See we had a center for fifteen hundred kids.  I mean it was, it was a fun job, but it was a challenging job. And th- you know and interesting enough one of the things that I did when I was there, first of all I tried to get them hooked into the church and then a lot of them stayed in Utah.  We had a college placement program, that's a little later about that though, but one of the reasons they put Job Corps centers in places like this is to get them off the streets and let them know in an environment where it's not hostile and aggressive that you can survive.  A lot of them would say to me, "What you guys call the ghetto here is good living from what I'm used to."  A lot of them stayed in Utah because they say, "If I go back to the streets I know what it's, what it holds for me."  And we had a lot of kids relocate and stay right here in Utah because they felt it was a place that they would get away from that hostile environment, and that was a great experience when I was at Job Corps.  Although I left in '73 [1973] and went to Weber [Weber State College; Weber State University, Ogden, Utah] because I felt I could make a greater, greater contribution there.
Story_ID: 616401
Speaker 1: So 1973 now, now what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what offer did you get from Weber [Weber State College; Weber State University, Ogden, Utah] to leave?
Speaker 2: I never--well I had just gotten my master's in '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to work for Weber County Mental Health [Weber County Mental Health Center, Ogden, Utah] as an intake psychiatric social worker.  The same group of faculty that mentored me through undergraduate, through graduate--Ray Clark [Raymond Clark] had strong applicants, you know you would think that well a master's degree up against a Ph.D. in terms of academic achievement, but he was very determined, said, "First of all we need minority faculty."  See I was the first tenured black at Weber State Uni- University, the very first.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were put on a tenured track in '73 [1973]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Not, no, no, not, that didn't happen then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I hired in, I hired in as an instructor because of lack of experience.  Ray Clark, who was department chair, took the whole academic center on and he went through and found fourteen people that had graduated the same year I graduated that started as assistant professors, and I was an instructor and he took the institution on big time.  He stood before faculty center.  He raised more hell than alligator when the pond went dry.  He, he took the whole system on, and I think at that particular time he got branded kind of a nigger lover because he was a white man fighting.  He believed in what--that's why he had so much power with Robertson [Junior Robertson (ph.)], who was very militant because he knew Clark was for real and Clark wasn't afraid of them, to call his hand for bullshit, but yet support him when he had a legitimate complaint.  And Ray always said, "Before I leave here you're gonna be the next chair of this department.  I'm gonna see to that."  And sure enough I was for nine years.  I bossed them long as I could (laughter).  But, Ray was, ray was very committed to helping me to reach the goals when I went on into the Ph.D. program.  I went to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  Ray knew a lot of people, and he could maneuver a lot of things and made sure that I was well taken care of.  See when I went to graduate school I had a full ride scholarship in child welfare, you know, plus a stipend when I went to Chicago.  When I went to the University of Utah [Salt Lake City, Utah], Ray Clark was Mr. social work in the state of Utah, great credibility.  So, I mean you know, and he often said to me, "Whatever I can do to help you reach your goals, I'm there."  And he, he proved himself all the way to the bitter end.  He's still alive.  He lives in Salt Lake [Salt Lake City, Utah].  Weber done a lot of things with him and et cetera, so I'm getting lost in all of this.  Where--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 616402
Speaker 1: It's 1973 and you're just, you're hired.  Did they hire you in as a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went, I went to, I went to Mental Health [Weber County Mental Health Center, Ogden, Utah] in '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: Weber County Mental Health and I worked there about a year and a half and then I went to Weber [Weber State College; Weber State University, Ogden, Utah] 'cause they had a faculty position.  So, after I got the promotion to assistant professor, then you get on academic rank, you get on the tenure track.  That was in seven- about '74 [1974], I think that's when that happened.  And then I was on a terminal contract with Weber in '80 [1980].  I had a lot of trouble with the tenure committee because you know they, they pretty stern now.  If you don't make, have a doctorate in seven years, you're out.  Ph.D. is a dime a dozen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't get your Ph.D.?  You hadn't had your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: I got, I got that in '86 [1986]
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Eighty-six [1986] is when I go the doctorate.  But, that last year they had sent me a letter from the tenure committee saying, "You don't have your doctorate, so you, you'll be terminated June of '86 [1986]."  But, we knew that was coming and we fought with the tenure promotion committee.  In April of '86 [1986] is when I got my clearance for that Ph.D.  I never will forget that day.  I called Ray Clark [Raymond Clark] 'cause I defended the dissertation and all of that.  But, I was so angry by then 'cause of what I had went through at that university.  It was almost like I wanted to tell them to take this paper and stick up their ass.  I mean I was hostile.  And at that time when I handed them the paperwork I was on a terminal contract.  Not only was I awarded tenure, but promoted too to associate professor at that particular time.  When Ray a little later stepped down as department chair 'cause he had been it for twenty-five years, he made damn sure the mechanis- mechanism was in place.  At that time when I was granted tenor, it was only about two or three Afro Americans at Weber State, I still claim fame to being the first black tenured at that institution after a hundred years of existence.  So, I think right around about that time Forrest was just coming on the scene, one you just interviewed--him and them, and they were all students of mine and I mentored them, took them on trips with me 'cause I was director. (Unclear) practicum and that whole gang have done very well.  Forrest have had his battle with them too don't kid yourself (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's [HistoryMaker] Forrest Crawford, right yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah he's, he's, he's, but he weathered the storm and did well--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --through the whole Ph.D. experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in, in 19--so in '86 [1986] you finally get tenured, you're the first black tenured professor at, at Weber--
Speaker 2: Weber State.
Speaker 1: --and promoted to assistant professor.
Speaker 2: Associate.
Speaker 1: Associate professor, okay, and--yes associate.  So, how long did you--now you became chairman of the department you said for nine years right?
Speaker 2: I left as, I took a sabbatical in 2003.  I left the chair in 2002, so nine years before that would have been what?
Speaker 1: Two thousand and--
Speaker 2: Nineteen-ninety something. Six, seven, ninety- about '93 [1993], '92 [1992], somewhere off in there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I chaired the department for nine years.
Story_ID: 616403
Speaker 1: Tell us what was your Ph.D. dissertation about?
Speaker 2: At that time, I--it's somewhere over there somewhere. I was doing it on success and failure in the Job Corps setting is what I did it on because I had had access to a lot of data looking at the impact of higher social economic, how much more prone students were to be successful in the Job Corps setting, which we found nothing no different in what we already knew in terms of the higher the social economic level the kids come from, the better they were more prone to the predictability of graduates of the Job Corps program.  I looked at some things in terms of how perhaps we could tailor the system different to, to make kids more--because at that particular time, most of your poor program graduates were white students or Asian American students.  The Afro American students were just coming through the system bull shitting, leaving, you know not graduating or et cetera.  So, we were looking at what could we do better in the program to braise up the where we had kids who were full program graduates.  I still believe very strongly even today that you know the ultimate goal people have got--I recognize that you know you sort of gotta maneuver the system to survive, but being whatever don't work.  You've gotta be competitive because you, you see a lot now in terms of a lot of people are yelling discrimination.
Story_ID: 616404
Speaker 1: You know, I tell people in this system, some of the people in this kind of setting, well I have experience.  It don't mean nothing, 'cause when some of you people leave right now when I hired, applied for this job there were three with Ph.D.'s, two had law degrees that applied for directorship.  So, if you think the salary they pay for here you're gonna get it at a bachelor, baccalaureate level you've got to be crazy.  They're paying enough that they can demand.  So, I was up against Ph.D.'s, law, lawyers, but I also was director of this agency and was chair of the board for seven years and took this agency through tremendous crisis that it was in, and that's a whole another story the battle I had with firing a black administrator [H.C. Massey].  You, you, you don't know half of that experience.
Speaker 2: Well tell us about what happened?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) The guy I just told you about over there ran a wonderful program, but he didn't understand how to negotiate with the broader environment, had that militant (unclear).  When I came on the board, I was brought on by him because I had the Ph.D. to be the sounding board against the establishment.  Well, I really thought it was pro- perhaps racisms, discrimination just from the outside looking in from what I've been told, but when I got into the system I found out it really wasn't racism, it was accountability.
Speaker 2: Oh there was, what was the, okay was the institution failing in some way or what?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They were on a terminal contract.  It was mismanagement of, not so much mismanagement but performance, accountability, and so where we had the big fallout with me and him was I said, "I look like a fool running around yelling discrimination when that isn't what these, f it is that's isn't what they're using to get you buddy, it's accountability."  I could not be from that university [Weber State College; Weber State University, Ogden, Utah] and damage my credibility saying it's, it's racism.  It wasn't racism.  It might have been undercurrent, but they didn't have to use racism to get you because they could get you good in terms of lack of performance, so I was chair of the board of trustees.  So, it got to be a big battle ground between the Afro American community and the white community and this agency, and I took a terrible beating.  The white folks--the black folks said that I sold out to white folks and I destroyed a black person at the expense of--it was a mess.  I got articles in there where name calling.  One preacher came to the board meeting and said I was an uncircumcised something.  It was a mess.  It was a mess.  NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] picketed against me.  It damn near destroyed our church [New Zion Baptist Church, Ogden, Utah], and that was in '97 [1997].  But, I took the region on.  They had, they were under a terminal contract.  They were taking the program.  They were taking the CSBG [Community Services Block Grant] program.  I went to Denver [Colorado] and fought with them, but I had a powerful board of trustees that I had put together.  I had two attorneys, the mayor, two mayors, the county attorney.  I had a strong board.  In fact, they said you got the most powerfulest board in the region, Region 8, and I went to Denver and met with them and looked them square in the face and said, "You know we can fix it.  Now if you wanna take it, take it, but if you really want to work with us and fix it," I led them two years ago to an agency that had 263 findings.  Our last prism we had zero findings, perfect prism review for a Head Start.  I am now as a result president of U- CAP [Ogden-Weber Community Action Partnership, Inc., Ogden, Utah] of--for the Community Action for the State of Utah.  I'm chair of the Region 8 board for Head Start.  I'm on the National Head Start [National Head Start Association] board.  I'm in D.C. [Washington D.C.] six times a year.  But, it's because I learn the game from them very well how to negotiate change.
Story_ID: 616405
Speaker 1: All right, now, now did the former director [H.C. Massey]--he had a lot of support.  Was there any reason why he had so much support, I mean?
Speaker 2: He, he really did--this building, that building he was at the cutting edge in terms of his fight for poor people, but I think what he failed to do was recognize you still can't alienate yourself from the power base.  You gotta understand where the control really still is and so you're not gonna get around the influential people with money or who make decisions.
Speaker 1: Was he doing the right thing here or not, that's what I guess what I'm asking?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I, I think it was an attitude of flipping them off.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he just refused to be accountable to them or that is?
Speaker 2: Well, I have to be a little careful with this.  One of the things that is against this agency [Ogden-Weber Community Action Partnership, Inc., Ogden, Utah] right, today the government have a $674,000 lien against this building because they declared income that wasn't necessarily taken, but the management of the Head Start funds were not kept at an arm's length between this and that Senior Villa [Senior Villa Housing, Ogden, Utah].  So, Head Start money was used to pay for this building when it should have been cost allocated.  It had to do, they found no evidence of tampering with funds but cost allocation of created the problem.  I said to them when I got into it with them, "It makes me no difference."  I don't own the building.  No one owned the building, taxpayers own this.  So, fine I said to the feds, "If you own half and I own half and you said," I said, "One thing about it I don't have six hundred thousand dollars to pay you, so what are we going to do?  We got a problem."  "Well, as long as we have a program for Head Start kids, then we don't have no issue."  I said, "Well great, then I own half the building, so that means we get to keep contract." (Laughter) You know you gotta be just as slick as they are in that particular sense.  So, we were able to negotiate it out.  I mean we've done some tremendous things like the disability housing.  But, you can go in there flipping those people off or you can go in there with a good business plan and they have the ultimate power.  I mean I've had people on the state board that believed in what we were trying to do to bring credibility back and we have tremendous credibility.  The U.S. Bank [U.S. Bancorp] just gave us twenty thousand dollars.  I mean before people would not give this program the time of day.
Story_ID: 616406
Speaker 1: So, when I left Weber [Weber State College; Weber State University, Ogden, Utah] after thirty-two years I took a sabbatical to see if I would like this before I really retired.  I mean this has been such a fun job [at Ogden-Weber Community Action Partnership, Inc., Ogden, Utah], just a fun job and the people have worked so well with me; we made tremendous--but, let me just take you to this and then we'll come back.  One of the things that I'm doing is this Senior Villa [Senior Villa Housing, Ogden, Utah] over here we have this whole complex.  I'm naming that building after him because I really do think Mr. Massey [H.C. Massey] was an early crusader and paved the way.  Now, I've caught flack from the white community, but I'm chair of the board of that senior villa, and I think it's a great healing venture.  I think that Mr. Massey perhaps made some mistakes, but not intentionally just you know needed a better system.  And I think I'm here today because of his great work and I intend before I leave here and before he died to say, "You know all your work was not in vain."  So, I've said to the board of trustees, the mayors, "You may not like what I'm doing, but guess what you can't stop me.  I'm gonna do if it's the last thing," so on the 2nd of April I think we're having the dedication.  He's excited.  I think it's been a great healing thing for the black community because it got really split, you know.  And I think it took me all these years, eleven years, to show them you know if race- if it's racism we need to call it racism, if that's what it is, but there is a difference between it and accountability.  Had I played the race card I would have been a dead duck like the president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  People not buying into playing the race card when that really isn't what it is.  But, if it is, then that's what it is.  But you gotta be careful with that one, you know, and I can say with my experience, with what I've done, I was just as qualified as any of those people that applied for this position.  I may have had an edge, kind of in the sense of being chair of the board, but I resigned according to the by-laws in the timeframe, but I was smart enough to keep that job at Weber before I retired and took this job.
Story_ID: 616407
Speaker 1: Mr. Massey [H.C. Massey] and I was in the same church [New Zion Baptist Church, Ogden, Utah].  The church split, the preacher split; it was a mess.  I thought many times I wish I hadn't done it.  The price that I paid was greater than I had anticipated until there were many times I wish I would have just walked away [from Ogden-Weber Community Action Partnership, Inc., Ogden, Utah] and said, "Let it work itself out," but--
Speaker 2: Was there, was there a time you tried to explain yourself to them?
Speaker 1: Continuously.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But people hear what they want to hear.  In the eye sights of some I did, I broke a code in the black community that you don't break.  "You don't help white folks take down black folks, they do it very well themselves."  That's what they told me.  Said, "And you got pimped (laughter) in the whole experience."  And that isn't what it was about because I knew well they had already contracted with Ogden City School [Ogden City School District] to take the program, Head Start.  This is a $5.5 million program.  They, the State of Utah had already contracted with FTT [Futures Through Training, Inc.] to take CSBG [Community Services Block Grant], the community action side.  It was a done deal.  They had already made the arrangements and what I tried to tell them all these minority people that worked there, "You'd been out of a job because if the school system would have gotten it, they'd a put teachers with credentials in the classroom teaching these minority kids.  You people that have worked your way up through the ranks, not by education but through job experience, you're out the door."  So, I tried to convince them you can fight to the bitter end supporting this it didn't make no difference.  The people who had the power to shut it down had already made the decision.  I went in there with my credentials and challenged them because I had a job, this wasn't my job, so I could say some things, and I, it wasn't no need of me going in there arguing with them that the accountability piece wasn't accurate 'cause it really was, but anything broke can be fixed.  Now the fruit of the pudding, are you willing to let us fix it using the resource of these people with technical knowledge.  Well I had some strong people on the board.  Like I said a county attorney, the mayor of Ogden city [Ogden, Utah], the mayor of Washington Terrace [Utah], affirmative action officer who was an attorney.  I had the right cronies on there (laughter), people, and some of these people had been on the board for ten years, and they said to me, "We're gonna stay right there with you until you restore this agency." And we really, we've come an awful long ways, but I had a little disagreement with them bout honoring Mr. Massey, but I, I have to do what I have to do.  And I made it very clear to them I'm doing it because I feel it's something I need to do.
Story_ID: 616408
Speaker 1: What are some of the major accomplishments of the agency [Ogden-Weber Community Action Partnership, Inc., Ogden, Utah], you know since you, you been in charge?
Speaker 2: We had absolutely no credibility. None.  We had all the major partners had pulled out from us.  We had no community support.  We had total chaos.  We have now major partnership with Weber State College [Weber State University, Ogden, Utah], with ATC College [Ogden-Weber Applied Technology College, Ogden, Utah] with the banks, with the professional community.  I probably have the strongest board of--I have--in community action you have a public sector, a private sector, and a low income sector.  I probably have the strongest public sector of any of these boards around here for these kind of agencies.  But, a lot of it has to do with my many years of working with them.  If people believe in you, they'll support you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When we went--this agency couldn't make payroll.  We had to, they had to borrow a hundred and fifty thousand dollars on this land where this building over here is in order to make payroll.  When we built this 08-11, the state gave me a forty year deferment of payment of that in order to clear the deeds to build this building that we just built, which I named after a black woman who was chair of the board here for twenty-something years and put her property up to save this building.  I figured it's something I wouldn't do.  If anybody was naive enough to put their personal property up to save this program, then I'm gonna name the damn building after them; that's what I did.  Mr. Massey [H.C. Massey] put his up too to save the program, so I'm naming that one after him and when I retire I'm gonna name this one after me (laughter).  But anyway, that's, that's here nor there.
Story_ID: 616409
Speaker 1: So this will be your last job you think as such (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm just, I've got to stay until we've overcome the obstacles.  I, I don't know how much longer I'll stay.  I, it's really a more rewarding job to me than when I was teaching school.  That was an easier job, but this job is more rewarding in the sense that--well it think one of the things that have worked, I've had a career, I've had positions, so I don't have nothing to prove other than to come here and help the staff here.  I'm not coming in on an ego trip, I, I've been there, done that.  And these people bust their butts for me, and a lot of these people have been here twenty years they know a hell of a lot more than I know about Head Start, but they are so committed and since I've been here I mean they make sure that--it was the staff that led this agency [Ogden-Weber Community Action Partnership, Inc., Ogden, Utah] to a zero finding, which is very unusual in the Head Start world.  But one of the things I like about it is that it's put me in contact with people I never would have met at the college level, you know like Bob Coard [Robert M. Coard] out of ABCD [Action for Boston Community Development] out of Boston [Massachusetts].  I don't know if you're familiar with him.  You really need to do him.  I mean he's got the biggest community action program in the United States, Coard, ABCD.  He's got four thousand kids in the Head Start program.  But, at the nation, at the, at the regional and national level the contacts that I made have just been invaluable, and I think his help helped the, helped the agency tremendously.  It's no secret in terms of people knowing about the troubles of this agency, but people coming in saying we want to help has a lot to do in terms the network that I've developed with it and we're making progress and we're, we just don't have those problems anymore and so I've got to stay just long enough that I get the seed planted where it continues to grow.  It's got to do even better when I leave, and I'm trying to look at succession planning that when I leave you don't have to go all around the country to find a new director, you have one right here, right here in this agency.
Speaker 1: To have, so--
Speaker 2: People who and I've convinced the board we need to do succession planning.  I've made sure that the managers understand if you want this seat it's gon- you gonna have to have at least a master's degree to get it.  So, through your T and TA [training and technical assistance] plan I sent them to this Johnson and Johnson Institute in California [Irvin, California] to get that certification, the Head Start certification, you know the career development.  I'm saying that, "My last hoorah in this agency is to see--I got five managers.  One of you five ought to get this job.  I want all of you to be so qualified until the board is going to struggle with who to give it to because you paid your dues."  And I think when people feel that they can, if, if I work hard, if I do what I need to do, I might have chance to be promoted when something come up.  And so it's, it's, it's, it's work, worked well and I mean I have great respect in the region.  I'm, like I say, president of the Region 8 board.  I deal with Denver [Colorado].  I deal with D.C. [Washington, D.C.], deal with them all.  And it's really been a fun job, in particular with the state level CSBG and that whole system.  I, it's, it's worked out really well, so it's been a great experience for me.  Actually I'm having more fun here then I did at Weber [Weber State College; Weber State University, Ogden, Utah].
Story_ID: 616410
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --what, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: My big concern not only for black community but minority people, minority people 'cause I'm really aggressive with this Hispanic component here because 60 percent of Mexican American kids are not graduating.  Our Head Start program we have babies having babies, nothing but kids bringing kids to Head Start.  We having nothing in here but problems in the classrooms from these kids coming from drug invested homes.  We're having tremendous behavioral problems in the classroom setting because the kids are coming from hostile environment.  We have in the black community, even in Utah, per capita.  You go to Utah State Prison [Draper, Utah] and see what you see.  You go to Weber State College [Weber State University, Ogden, Utah] where are the black students that are going to college?  I'm really raising a ruckus with preachers.  You know spiritual and churches are all well and good, but why are we not planting the seed to get these kids educated so they can be competitive?  Run around here--you know I see all these Hispanics are sorted to marginal jobs up where I live.  They cutting the grass, they doing all that work that the rest of us don't want to do, all the fast foods.  You know they doing all the dirty work of society, and the other folks are getting the job.  But, if you wanna be competitive first of all you got to have an education and there, it can be done.  I've been fighting with the Masons.  Sponsoring a basketball team at Marshall White [Marshall White Center, Ogden, Utah] means nothing.  We ought to be giving scholarships to help black kids go to college if that's what the youth grant, the Prince Hall youth group ought to be doing.  They can go to Marshall White Center and play basketball all day.  That isn't where the need is.  The need is are we putting our money where our mouth is?  I challenge, I'm challenging the trustee board of our church [New Zion Baptist Church, Ogden, Utah] what are we doing to help--see Reverend Davis [France Davis] do a great job in Salt Lake [Salt Lake City, Utah].  In fact, he is such a fine person, those with money have established a France A. Davis endowment scholarship at the University of Utah [Salt Lake City, Utah] because of him, you know.  It takes people with money to start those kind of things.  You know when he built that church [Calvary Baptist Church] over in Salt Lake the Mormons gave him eight hundred thousand dollar land to build that church on 'cause they got it.  The ECHO [ph.] matched him $1 million dollars to build the church.  But now he have to be careful.  You not gonna bad mouth that group of people and then turn around and beg for money; it don't work that way.  They believe in him, the senators, Hatch.  Senator Hatch from Utah is the only one that come back when he have his church anniversary, at his anniversary, Hatch comes from D.C. [Washington, D.C.], a very powerful senator in Washington, Bennett [Bob Bennett].
Speaker 1: Orrin Hatch, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Because Reverend Davis he's not afraid to take a stand against something that's injustice, but he's also one who is always looking for a win/win resolution.
Story_ID: 616411
Speaker 1: And we may--I disagree with some of them on the board [of the Ogden-Weber Community Action Partnership, Inc.].  We're not very, they're not, some of them struggle with what we're doing with naming this building.  I said but you know through all of what we went through, we ought to be committed to some point where there's an opportunity to heal the community.  That's what we ought to really be about.  You're either with me and so they say, "We're coming."  I say, "You need to be there, you're board members."  If the truth was known in a lot of things, some of us just didn't get caught.  If you wanna start talking about who ought to be in jail or who, who have done wrong.  Some people just don't get caught.  So, yeah we all got skeletons, but I think the good that this man did outweigh the mistakes.  And I really think that you didn't put him [H.C. Massey] in jail, so obviously it wasn't no financial irregularities, just mismanagement in terms of cost allocation.  See, I have to be very careful in this program.  I have a historic program.  I have a CSBG [Community Services Block Grant] and the, the utilities for this thing run five thousand dollars a month, the light bill alone.  I've got this grant and this grant.  I've got a cost allocated across space to make sure Head Start is not paying more than what their fair share ought to be and all these different programs that I'm running has gotta be cost allocated.  Well, first of all his mistake was he didn't have a good fiscal person.  I hired a good fiscal person.  I pay them, I don't tell them to do things illegally, and I hold them accountable.  If I go to jail, you going with me.  So I, I don't know nothing about, you know, general fiscal oversight, but I pay you to keep me clean.  You keep me clean, I'm happy.  You mess up and she's had nine audits, no audit exceptions.  And I tell them real quick, we don't do nothing until we talk to the fiscal and we do it according to the guidelines.  So, I think he's big problem was he got a person in there that didn't know nothing about accounting you know.  And even in getting people in key position, my managers I mean they've gotta be competent.  Smart people I like to surround me with them because they'll take care of me.  Dummies irritate me, people with no abilities.  I don't care what color they are. So--
Story_ID: 616412
Speaker 1: It's all really tied back to my whole notion that my hope for Afro Americans be prepared for the 21st Century because white folks can yell reverse discrimination.  When we hire here, I've gotta be able to say I hired the most qualified, not just because you are who you are or whatever.  And I'm smart enough to know if all things are equal in terms of qualifications, something is gonna tip the scale, right, in terms of who you ultimately pick.  You got five people highly qualified and one job, now what's going to be is it gender, is it race, is age.  What am I using to justify and I know that people will come back and challenge and say, "I noticed you hired such and such a person.  I look that they're in a public agency, their credentials versus mine, how do you justify that this person is more qualified?"  A legitimate question isn't it?  And I'm telling our young Afro Americans just because your Afro American is not gonna get it in the 21st century.  You've gotta be prepared.  You know even in programs like this we find sometime I have to do a background, BCI [Bureau of Criminal Investigation] background check on people who work here particularly with these kids.  You got all these problems in the past and you clean your life up, you done a wonderful job it doesn't matter.  I can't get around that BCI.  And I've got to justify if I hire people with a felony working with kids how can I assure, well particularly with child abuse, I can't do nothing with them.  I can argue some things, but some things I cannot get around, you know, and so I'm real concerned in the community, in the neighborhood, in the church, with the Masons, with all these organizations that I'm with, what are we really doing.  You know one of the things I've had to do in Ogden [Utah], I've had my Ph.D. for twenty-two years, something like that. Why do I have to argue with--why do I have to apologize for having a doctorate?  I'm not saying I'm no better than you, that's not what I'm saying.  But, I'm saying at least with that I can get to certain spots you can't get, but when I get there I can help you, you know.  So, I've--it's much, much, much better, but it's got to do with Utah.  It's got to do with Utah.  Where you come from, you got tons of educated professional Afro Americans, so it's a whole different ball game.  But one of the things that's unique in this area you don't see a lot of difference between the educated blacks and the ones that have worked hard, particularly in, in an area where, with government installations.  Some of those people who have been there a long time might be GS12s, GS13s; they make pretty damn good money, more money than the college graduate.  They don't have the credentials, but they have the life experiences that have put them in positions, you know, through whatever process that they have the financial power.  They may not have the doctorates and all that kind of foolishness, that's well and good if they have a doctorate, but you don't have any money.  Wh- what good does it do you?
Story_ID: 616413
Speaker 1: We always ask this question too--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and when, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I probably--one of the things about me I'm not a type of person who throw a rock and hide my hands; that's not me.  I probably have been too blunt when maybe it might would have been better had I understood for some people to get to where I'm at it's a progression kind of thing.  A lot of people have said to me, "It isn't what you say, it's how you say it that pisses people off" (laughter).
Speaker 1: Let's, let's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pro- probably true.
Story_ID: 616414
Speaker 1: We were talking about one of the things you would do differently and you said you might express yourself a little differently around things at times, but then again you're not so sure if that's really the--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --problem.
Speaker 2: You know we're, we're, I firmly believe that we're in an era where everyone is look, many people I'll put it that way, I've never seen such, people wanna blame someone else.  It's, it's, don't want to take responsibility.  It's always blaming someone else for their predicament.  And I'm saying you know we gotta get above that.  Quit, take a look at yourself.  What is it that I'm doing or how am I a part of the problem system.  There might be others that are part of it too, but we all have some responsibility and I just think that people ought to be responsible.  I like being responsible for me.  I also recognize where perhaps I can use some help.  I'm not opposed.  I don't need to know all things, but I want to be in a position what I don't know I'm not, it takes nothing from me to ask you if you know.  Take nothing from me, I'm gonna be a winner if I have the kind of relationship with you that you can tell me--you don't know all things.  Different people know different things and it, it really irritates me that people don't take advantage of opportunities of resources.  I said to people here we might have forty thousand dollars left in our educational funds because people won't go to school.  I, I don't even understand that.  Here we have money to help you, the mission of Community Action [Ogden-Weber Community Action Partnership, Inc., Ogden, Utah] is to bring people in, build them up out, on to better things, and we have educational assistance and you won't even go.  I absolutely agree that after forty years somebody is saying your teachers under reauthorization have to be more, have to credentials.  In 2011, half the teachers here have gotta have a college degree.  I have no issue with it, because I do think that it is the right of Head Start kids to be taught by people who are competent, and I'm saying I wanna help you.  Whatever I invest in your education I can't take it from you.  No one can take nothing from me, I've earned it.  So, I'm saying why do you, why don't you go to school?  The people we bring in as aides in the classroom, so I've implemented policies that say either get your CDA [child development associate] or you're out of here in two years.  And I fired last year six people who thought I was bluffing.  I mean this is not glorified baby-sitting, you know, this is pre-K [pre-kindergarten].  We're training.  The intent of training Head Start kids is to make them on even keel with middle class kids, and you're basically talking middle class white kids.  And if you're gonna make it through the educational system most of them drop out because they can't compete, you know, in that particular sense.
Story_ID: 616415
Speaker 1: I'm real concerned about education and wish I could get more people to catch on that we need to be talking.  I've even with some of these ministers--you know one of the reasons that I think that these in your city, in your state, I can't think of his name Parson [ph.], that minister in Ohio.
Speaker 2: I'm not from, you said was--
Speaker 1: Parson, I think--Is his name Parson?
Speaker 2: Was it Pryor [ph.] you're talking about? (Unclear)--Parsons.
Speaker 1: No, well, what we're finding particularly in the black church we're finding many young blacks are leaving these traditional black churches and going to these interdenominational because it's more than just, just running across the pulpit screaming and yelling.  They're talking, teaching people how to live more effective, how to make these marriages work, how to raise kids, how, financial planning, how to live successful.  Pe- young people are looking for that.  All this stuff that we did traditionally is just not appealing to young educated people.  They're looking for something to help them live more in harmony with the environment.  And, and it seems to me that we need to, to make that kind of shift.  We need to be you know helping our young people to, to enjoy their youth, but also to start focusing, to set goals, to be aiming towards something, you know.
Story_ID: 616416
Speaker 1: And I see the church as a major vehicle. I see, you know, the, the thing Forrest [HistoryMaker Forrest Crawford] started Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.].  Yeah, it's great, but now let's look at what are we doing to have an impact on young Afro American women, girls, that they look up to you in those red dresses and they say, "Gee they emulate something that I want to be."  And I think they're doing a much better job than, than in the past.  Of course, I'm nervy enough to tell them that.  Sometimes that ain't what people wanna hear and--everybody wanna feel good, just make me feel good, say something to make me feel good as opposed to saying something to make me think differently or think where do we need to go, go from here.
Speaker 2: So, you're really not sure whether that's something that you need to change or not?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure I wanna change it, but I think my life would have been easier had I not been so blunt.  I don't have would have--but interestingly enough in due time a lot of it tend to work itself out (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Okay. Now, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in due time.
Story_ID: 616417
Speaker 1: The other part of this question is when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: That--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Now what is it?
Speaker 1: I think that in spite of my somewhat abrasive approach that people ultimately say we didn't see the end when you started this, but the end result is what we had hoped for, but it was just your way of getting there.  I think that's been with the church.  I think it's been with everything that I'm involved with.  I've had to get heavy-handed to get people to get on the train, on board.  But once the train got to moving, people I think were able to say you, you made a mark, you made a difference.  They didn't, they really didn't understand where I was ultimately going.  I think that this program ought to be accountable, but it ought to be accountable in terms of services that we're rendering to the families, to kids, and I think we've proven that, but I had to take, make some hard decisions to get it to that point.  I think that's been the problem in the church, you know.  I've been somewhat heavy-handed, but over the years they've been able to see, "Gee we've sure benefited."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: "We've sure benefited from you being in the driver's seat."  We got a new preacher now, and I'm kind of am tired of the fighting, I'm tired of that, but the preacher said to me, "I really do need your wisdom, your leadership to help me," and I'm not sure I feel like because in order to get some of the things that he's interested in, in terms of faith base- faith-based initiative.  Like I told him I got three 501(c)(3)s right here in this organization, this one, that one, the one over here.  I got grant writers.  I've got the resources here that I can divert back over there to help them, but I don't need to come over there and argue with you guys about what we need to do in order to get the job done.  I've got access people on the board, Flying G [ph.], one of your big outfits here.  I got a board member that gives away free computers.  I can get access, you know.  What, rather than fighting with me, use me (laughter) to help you.  I mean it ju- it just makes sense.  The mayor of Ogden city [Ogden, Utah] sits on this board.  The mayor of South Ogden [Utah] sits on my board.  The mayor of Harrisville [Utah], I got three of them.  You know when we went and got the money the chair of the--Wyckoff [Utah] is one of the mayors and that's how we got the hundred thousand dollars to subsidize this disability housing unit.  So, you gotta have your contact, and you gotta have credibility with the people who have the power to make things happen.  But, people are not just supporting anything now.  If I support you, can you deliver?  So, the black community is very happy of what is being done, and they know I'm up against a little criticism.  I took the heat to fire him, and I'll take the heat to do what I think is morally and ethically right and that is to name that building because he sacrificed a lot to get it built.  He made a few mistakes, but his goodness outweigh.
Speaker 2: That's Mr. Massey [H.C. Massey], right?
Speaker 1: And I think he's certainly worthy, and he is so happy.  I think it's, I have peace with myself--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and that's important to me.  Those, you know I, I just feel good about it.
Story_ID: 616418
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.  Now you've been married for a long time.
Speaker 2: Long time.
Speaker 1: Do you have any children?
Speaker 2: I have two daughters [Tamara Carpenter Larry and Leslie Carpenter Joe]. I have a daughter (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --(unclear) she is born in '63 [1963], '62 [1962].  She's forty-five?  I think so, and my other daughter was born in 1970.  I have three grandkids.  I have one great-granddaughter and I think I have, you know, Ann [Elizabeth Washington Carpenter] and I have weathered the storm and whatever I am Ann helped me to become that and I'm--very much appreciate it and good relationship with my children, haven't been to jail or anything and pretty heavy handed on my son-in-laws [Thomas Larry and Jason Joe], but I've worked with them and helped them.  My youngest daughter's husband got his MSW [master of social work].  I've worked with him and got him, helped push education, push it with my grandkids and, and we have a close immediate family structure.  I think with my mother [Modestine Truesdell Carpenter] and all of her other children she's had, half of them that has done really well, but she got another half that they just don't quite get it yet in terms of their responsibilities.  They've been in prison.  They still think they slicker than the law, and they, and I keep telling my mother, I say my dad [Carpenter's stepfather, John Carpenter] is dead now and I say, "What are they going to do when you die?  They gonna have a big problem, but as long as you enable them to depend on you, that's all they're going to do."  But, she's a mother.  You know how that goes and I wish it could, it could have been.  I've seen people come from big families and all the kids go to school and become successful and if no more than just getting a good job and being responsible.  That's been a great disappointment in terms of some of them that, but I--my mother beats herself up and I say you know you did the best, you got a clear conscious.  You did all you could.  I survived it.  I came out of the same household, same experiences; I made it.  So, I think that's why a lot of times how she beat herself up with the children at least, and my dad said, "Before I die, you are my child that makes me look good as a parent, that I've done something."  You know that's kind of sad, that's, but you know parents want to look at their children and think, "Gee, when they turn out pretty good then maybe I didn't, I did some things right."  But, it doesn't matter I've seen kids when I was teaching school both parents had Ph.D.'s and kids were nothing but little criminals, thugs, druggies, runaways.  I've never seen so much professional people crying about the problems with the kids that are disobedient and you think, "Gee smart as you guys are and all of this and that's what you got?"  I'm almost to a point maybe raising kids is no more than simply good luck.  Some people do nothing and their kids turn out great.  Some people do all the right things and the kids turn out you know not so well, and so you wonder and a lot of people are blaming themselves, you know, "What could I have done different?"  I probably wouldn't do it too much difference because I'm still committed to standing firm on what I believe--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I have gotten old enough that if people dislike me for having a conviction, then it's too bad.
Story_ID: 616419
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have not asked that we need to talk about and discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I would think you probably through all what I've said can fill in the gaps (laughter) you know in terms of who I am, who am I as a person.  I, I have to speak in church Sunday and I--and one of the things I probably will say and I know they'll be on pins and needles wondering, "What the hell is gonna come out of his mouth?" But I am really glad I'm at, I'll be sixty-five years old in September, and I was saying earlier one of the things I've been--that's why I was excited about you guys coming, because one of the things I've been trying to get the black community in Ogden [Utah] is to pull together the history.  I have tremendous history of black folks in this area.  In fact, I have all the documents and I probably should do something with it from 1934 I think until right today because it's a small enough community, all of the Afro Americans who have died and so it's just a tremendous--I spent many months in the mortuaries going through records and finding this data.  You can't do it big cities like you because I've, I've known and it's a wonder, and pictures of all these churches and all these church members and I, and one thing I probably will say Sunday I am so appreciative of having lived through these eras.  I saw Ogden and the black community when it was really at its peak, I mean and it's, with the railroad here it's been some interesting history.  And when Mrs. Goodwin [Julia Goodwin] died, she probably was in that picture Forrest [HistoryMaker Forrest Crawford] showed you '99 [1999] in December she was probably one of the first black school teachers in Ogden and she's got wealth of stuff that she's collected over the years, just--and when she died her daughter said, "My mother said give it all to you."  I have all of it, and I've been trying to convince these churches you know we should get a room and this history should be put there.  Because I'm not sure my kids are interested in it, but it's too much rich history.  When I die, what's gonna happen to it?
Speaker 1: So you're saying it needs to be institutionalized, yeah by the community (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and I've had some people here, some other people who said let's write a humanities grant to work on this.  We ought to be saying that on the other side, you know.  So, I'm trying to get people, I tried to write the history of masonry in Utah, masonry in the Colorado jurisdiction.  They just don't seem to be interested in.  I love understanding the past, and I understand where we are today because I have such a thorough knowledge of the past how we got from there to here, and I find it fascinating and you know I wouldn't trade nothing.  Although I'm getting to a point where I'm winding down.  You, you, you can't keep this pace forever, you know, and it's, it's, it's, things are changing, changing tremendously.  I'm beginning to see even in Ogden a bigger split now between the educated Afro Americans and the regulars up on that hill where Forrest is.  I think we have about eight or nine Afro Americans teaching up there, but you never see them.
Speaker 1: That's at Weber State [Weber State University, Ogden, Utah] right?
Speaker 2: Never see them.  They don't, they not in the neighborhood.  You know they, just different.
Speaker 1: You said that the land that this building occupies used to be the black community and it basically doesn't exist anymore (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.  I was raised right over there, but I think it's a shame.
Story_ID: 616420
Speaker 1: I think my legacy and they say it to me, "We really like you because you didn't let that Ph.D. separate you from the everyday people." And it really didn't.  I'm still in the neighborhood.  I don't live in the neighborhood.  I live up there with them, but, 'cause I can do it, but I'm still with the black church.  I'm still heavily involved in black organizations.  I play for most of the funerals of all the old black folks that when I die promise me, I pl- and on this death thing I've got, I bowl all the funerals.  I--interestingly enough all these people, older people came here with the railroad.  They came together and they're dying together, and we don't have very much left with the old population group, but I don't play for the church anymore because I'm not into that progressive church music.  I, I still am a hymn anthem solace music.  I don't like all that street music and you can't tell the difference, so I opted not to do anymore, but the old people have asked me, "Please when I die will you play for my funeral?"  And I, you know I play.  I don't charge.  You know them morticians say, "You can get, make you some money," and that's not what's it about to me.  I find it a pleasure to play for those people's funeral.  I don't need the money.
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: So it's, so I think that people say to me, "In spite of your accomplishments you still haven't forgotten," and I really haven't and, but I credit whatever I am today is because of them (laughter).  I really do.
Story_ID: 616421
Speaker 1: Now this leads actually to the last question.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the last question is, I guess in the natural progression, it's similar to legacy but a little bit different.  And the last question is how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I would hope that I'm remembered, that in spite of how I tried to accomplish goals, that I really had a sense of caring and commitment to people and really tried to make things better for mankind.  That's how I'd like to be remembered.  And I think that I get the impression that maybe that might be.  A lot of--I, I went through, when I went through this period of all of this, it was a lot of uproar, but I stuck firm to what I believe, but I'm beginning to feel the benefits of we didn't see the end, but we really do see that what you were after wasn't for personal gains, but it was to make it better, a better experience.  I, I'm, I'm, begi- I'm, I didn't think I could, I didn't think I would make it through this, I really didn't, and there's a lot of days I regretted even doing it 'cause the price was too great.  But now that I to this point, all that I did was the right thing to have done, and I'm beginning to see some of the hardcore people who were very adamant against me are beginning to come back around and say--you know because I, I haven't forgotten, even with the hostility in the church I stayed with the church.  I could have walked away, went to them other churches.  I tried to do it, and I couldn't do.  I couldn't, you know, and I do a lot of things still.  I want to share--with things I have access to that they don't have access to I really want to help get it back to them, to those that--you know we, some things that I can do that it's just the network that I have and the partnerships and the relationships, but it's really all ultimately wired back to helping people.  Every, everyone have not had the same opportunities, the motivation that I've had.  They just haven't had it, nor capacity, and so I want to give back some of my motivation, some of my capacity, and some of my opportunities to help people who haven't had it.  And that's important to me, you know.  I travel a lot.  I buy a lot of stuff, music, a lot of stuff I buy, but I don't mind sharing it because they don't have the opportunity to travel.  I'm in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] six times a year being on all these boards.  You know I'm gone all the time, not expense for me, but when I go I'm always looking for something to bring back to share with, you know.  And you know, I mean this town is limited particularly in Afro American stuff because you don't have the base here.  Twenty thousand black folks in the whole state is not saying much is it? So naturally you're not gonna have the back culture that you have where you came from.  But, when I go to your kind of cities, I'm always exploring, you know, what's out there.  Music, you know I have a repertoire of music you wouldn't believe, all kind of music, you know blues, gospel, jazz, you know and people, and I got it all computerized and people say, "I'm looking for such and such.  Well, let's look in the computer.  If I got it, you're welcome." I'll make it for them; I don't care.  You know you were looking at those things there.  I'm often with them other folks with CD, collecting old CDs, DVDs and boy we just having a ball.  And so anyway that's what I'm about.  I, I think folks are beginning to understand me a little better, I think.  I'm not experiencing the hostility that I once experienced because what I believe in I stand behind it and I'm not afraid to say what I think and not afraid to be criticized.  I would like to be liked, but I'm not gonna sell my soul just to be liked; that's not me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Does that answer it (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I think so.  Thank you very much.
