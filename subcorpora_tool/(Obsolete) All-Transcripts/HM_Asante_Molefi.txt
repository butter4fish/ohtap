Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers, our videographer is Matthew Hickey. Sir, could you please give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes, my full name is [HistoryMaker] Molefi Kete Asante, M-O-L-E-F-I, K-E-T-E, and A-S-A-N-T-E.
Speaker 1: All right. And, sir, is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir, there is a story behind my name. Molefi Kete Asante is a name that I legally took in 1973. In 1972 I had traveled to Ghana for the first time. And I had a name that I had been given at birth which was, which was Arthur L. Smith. And I went to the library [Balme Library] at the University of Ghana [Accra, Ghana] and asked them if they had my first book which was called the 'Rhetoric of Black Revolution' [Arthur L. Smith], and they said yes, we have the book but when the book came in we thought that the person was an Englishman because the name was Smith but look you're a black guy. And it convinced me that I should not have that name. So, I, I went up to Kumasi [Ghana] and I met with the, at that time Asantehene, Opoku Ware II. And Opoku Ware II told me that really what day were you born? I said I was born on a Friday. He said, "Well, your, your first name ought a be Kofi. That's one of your names but I'm gonna call you Kete Asante." Kete means one who loves music and the dance, and Asante is a common name among the Asante people in Ghana. And I chose later that year the name Molefi from southern Africa in solidarity with the South African struggle against apartheid. It means one who keeps the traditions in the language of the Suto people.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's the Basuto, B-A-S-
Speaker 2: Yes, the Basuto.
Speaker 1: --U-T-
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --O.
Speaker 2: You got it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The Basuto, yeah.
Speaker 2: T-H-O [Basotho].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right. So, and, sir, what is your date of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is August 14, 1942.
Speaker 1: And where were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born in Valdosta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay. Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: V-A-L-D-O-S-T-A, Georgia, G-E-O-R-G-I-A. And that's in the southern part of Georgia, Lowndes County, right.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You were saying earlier it's near Waycross [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Near Waycross-
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and near the Okefenokee Swamp, near the Florida state line, that's me.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what is today's date, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Today's date, May 23, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are at the Molefi Kete Asante Institute for Afrocentric Studies at 5535 Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Story_ID: 637137
Speaker 1: Now, before we get into depth there are five lightweight questions that I'm compelled to ask you that only require a short answer. The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir. My favorite food is sweet potatoes.
Speaker 1: Okay. And do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do. Most of my colors are earth tones, rusts, or brown, beige.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes, favorite time of the year is the fall.
Speaker 1: Okay. Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Ghana in West Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have. And that phrase is, it is not enough to know. One must act to humanize the world.
Story_ID: 637138
Speaker 1: All right. Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history. I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Arthur Smith] side but separately and then we'll put them together. Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is, it's complicated because my mother gave us several names for herself. One is Lillie Belle Wilkens, W-I-L-K-E-N-S, and the Belle, is B-E-L-L-E. And the other name is Lillie, L-I-L-L-I-E, is Lillie, Lillie Belle Wilkson, W-I-L-K-S-O-N [Lillie Belle Wilkens Smith]. I'm, I, I, I don't think my mother was ever quite sure what her last name was.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, so, sometimes it was spelled Wilkson and sometimes Wilkens (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wilkens, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is April 1, 1917.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Naylor, N-A-Y-L-O-R, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family and what were they doing in history?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know very much. I mean, I know that my mother for example was raised by someone who was not her mother, whose name is Mary Day. Mary and John Day raised their children and raised my mother along with their children. The, the, the Day family lived in the rural area outside of Naylor, Georgia, and they took in children who, who did not have parents or whose parents were away. And so, my mother was raised by them but my mother, my mother's mother, had been raised by them and her name was Cora, C-O-R-A. And Cora really had my mother when she was about thirteen or fourteen. And, and she left my mother with Mrs. Day. And, and so when she came back, when she was about twenty to pick up my mother and to take her with her, my mother refused to go, she decided that she didn't know who Cora was, she was really going to stay with Mrs. Day and, and so she stayed with Mrs. Day. And so, that's part of the confusion I think in terms of her, her name. I mean, she, she had a brother, my mother had a brother and she also had a sister, so there, there were three of them but there was one father and three mothers. And so, so the history of my mother is basically, not well known. It is said that the father was a big red man [Alfred Wilkens] but we, in our history we don't know exactly what that meant. And so, she was born. But what we did discover, just through science, DNA, is that on my mother's side, the mitochondria DNA back through Cora is actually from Sudan, from the Nubian side of the Sudan. So, that's, we, we only know that through the DNA study but we don't know just historically how that plays up.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Now, we'll talk about that later I guess too about DNA and studies--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and how they fit into--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --history. So, now, did your mother describe the situation she was raised in, what life was like with Mrs. Day and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, she loved Mrs. Day. She was, my mother was bent toward people, relationships.  She was very good at the, the work that they had to do on the farm. She listened, loved to listen to the stories of the old mystics who would tell stories out of African American history and culture, particularly stories about mysterious beings, High John the Conqueror and all of those stories. My mother knew those things quite well. She was born in a sense on the edge of the sweltering pines and oaks that existed near the swamplands of south Georgia. And that's a very, if you've never been to that part of the country, you, you quite don't understand if I say that it was, it could be foreboding at night, particularly with the Spanish moss on the trees, but it was also a place that reminded, I'm sure, many Africans that it was similar to, to the continent of Africa.
Story_ID: 637139
Speaker 1: You were telling me I think off camera that, that Valdosta [Georgia] is near the Okefenokee Swamp, is it the same for--
Speaker 2: It is--
Speaker 1: --Naylor [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Naylor, Naylor is a little north of Valdosta and a little east of Valdosta but the Okefenokee Swamp you could get to them about thirty miles from Valdosta just going toward the, toward the east. And this was, yes, lots of cypress trees growing in the water, sort of, you know, give the impression of a, of a, you know, a pregnant tree because they have these huge trunks at the bottom and they, they grow up, you know. And this was the, this was the, this was the area that we grew up in. It was a area filled with what we would call haints back in those days, I'm sure the young people don't know what that means but, but--
Speaker 1: Tell, tell us what a haint is.
Speaker 2: --what a haint is. A haint, haint is something like a ghost but not quite like a ghost. The, the haint is something probably that only black people saw. And you can get these symbols and these experiences sometimes when you're in those natural setting when the light is leaving through there and the sun is going down in the evening, you could see them. And sometimes you'll get the impression that they're spirits of ancestors. But people talk about them and, and they still talk about 'em if you go to the rural areas of south Georgia even now which is amazing that in 2012 you still have people who seem like they're living in another century.
Speaker 1: Now, were there, there stories about escapes through the swamps and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, there, there were. But there were, there were also stories about the fact that the swamps held the bones of many African people who had been lynched and had been murdered in and around Valdosta. And Naylor was one of those small towns around Valdosta but there were, there were others, there were many of these towns. And actually during the time that my mother [Lillie Belle Wilkens Smith] was born, 1917, actually 1919 which is a different time, my father [Arthur Smith] was born in 1919, there was the death and this lynching of Mary Turner, who had been trying to protect her husband and she was killed and her stomach was ripped opened and she was pregnant and the baby was pulled out the, the, the fetus and stomped right there and, and her body was dragged through the streets of Valdosta. We grew up with that story. And periodically I see it written in a history book and I say, wow, you know, that is something that reverberated with black people, the whole idea it seemed to me was the, the idea of, of sort of making sure that black people would understand what role they played in, in southern Georgia.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a story that Dr. Arthur Thomas [Arthur E. Thomas] who was president of Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] used to always tell in his speeches.
Speaker 2: I, I, I, I knew Dr. Arthur Thomas very well years ago and at Central State and he know, he knew that story. Raymond Winbush also tells that story in his book 'Should America Pay?' ['Should America Pay?: Slavery and the Raging Debate on Reparations']. And I think I've written about it in 'African American People: A Global History' ['The African American People: A Global History,' Molefi Kete Asante]. It's a, it was a very, very sad story but, but the people in Valdosta, the African American people knew this story very much.
Story_ID: 637140
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Lillie Belle Wilkens Smith] have a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: No, my mother only went to the fourth grade and she could barely read. In, in fact, I, I grew up reading for my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: And writing for her I should say as well.
Speaker 1: Now, did she talk about what her aspirations were in those days? Has she ever shared with you what she wanted to do or did, you know?
Speaker 2: No, my, my, I, I come from very, I come from a peasant background. I, I don't, my mother didn't have aspirations outside of being a good mother and, and raising her children. She loved children, she loved family because she had not much of one except the fact that she was, was raised by the, the, the Day family but her own blood relatives she didn't know much about them. Her sister and her brother she met when she was a adult but, so she loved her own family and she was, that was her aspiration.
Story_ID: 637141
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me go on to your father's side of the family. Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father's full name, Arthur Lee Smith [Arthur Smith] and Lee, L-E-E, and Arthur, A-R-T-H-U-R.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: April 29, 1919. And he was born in Valdosta, Georgia, as well. You now, I'm, I'm sorry. That's a very good question because that question has come up whether he was born in Dayton, Ohio, or whether he was born in Valdosta but we normally say Valdosta because--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --there's some story about his father [Moses Smith] and mother [Willie Smith] being in Dayton in that time period.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you know about the history of your father's side? How far back can you--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --trace them and--
Speaker 2: --well, my father's family is a large family. In fact, we've counted more than five hundred members of that family. It's a very big family. We can trace back to our, my great-great-grandmother on that side, on the Smith side. And this was, actually she, she goes back to right near the end of the Civil War, 1867, '68 [1868], and so it was a, it was a pretty, and then, of course, her name was Frances Chapman Henderson--Frances Henderson--I'm sorry, Frances Henderson Chapman. And her, Frances Henderson Chapman was born in Dooly County, Georgia, Dooly County. It's, it was at one time considered the most rural county in America because it didn't have many villages and towns of more than five hundred people. And it is a very rural county even now. And she was born there and she is said to have had ten children but the family at our family reunions we recognize about four of them because they were the oldest four, this was Plenty Smith, who, who was my great-grandfather, Plenty Smith. But she also had Elijah Simpson, David Turner, and Israel Horne. Those were, and those families have basically kept together, they have, along with another family that comes through marriage which is called the Spiveys, S-P-I-V-E-Y, Spivey. So, so that family gathering normally, you know, we have, when we have meetings, we, we get together with that family, those are the, the parts of Fran- the children of Frances, so it's a long.  But the Smith part, Plenty Smith had two children and my grandfather was one of those children and his name was Moses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and Moses was the father of Arthur.
Speaker 1: Okay. Moses Smith.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, okay. So, they were, were they all--okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I see, so Frances Henderson Chapman's born in Dooly County, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. They all were born in Dooly County.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 637142
Speaker 1: And then my [paternal] grandfather, Moses Smith, moved the family to Valdosta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: After he had spent a while in Dayton [Ohio], he then moved to, to Valdosta.
Speaker 2: Now, is there a story about how he ended up in Dayton?
Speaker 1: Yeah, for work. After, during the, I think it was during the second or first, first war, first international European war there was some activity, industrial activity in the North and he, he, he left and, and went to the North.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It would be a pattern that my father [Arthur Smith] would repeat later during the second war [World War II, WWII], he, he, he went up to work in Dayton for a while.
Speaker 2: Do, do you know where they worked?
Speaker 1: No, I do not, I really don't. But this is the story that they did industrial work in Dayton working in factories.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, being from Dayton I'm (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, I'm, I'm, I'm, it's unique.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I heard you say that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's interesting.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. All right. So, so, where'd they go, so did your grandfather serve in World War I [WWI] at all?
Speaker 1: No, no, he did not (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He, he worked during that--
Speaker 1: That's right, he worked. He, he was working.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 637143
Speaker 1: Your father [Arthur Smith] though was raised in Valdosta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: But he was raised in Valdosta.
Speaker 1: Valdosta.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what did he say about growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, he, he, my father was, was actually the oldest of four siblings and he was quite responsible. He, he felt that too much burden was placed on him as a young man because of the Depression. During the Great Depression my father had to quit school in the sixth grade and he had to be responsible for his family, particularly on the times when his father [Moses Smith] was in the North. So, he, he, he felt like he missed a lot. He, he was a very intelligent man, very gifted in, in a way but, but was restrained in terms of his own ambitions because of the, the lack of financial support from home.
Speaker 1: Did your father ever talk about what he really wanted to do if he'd a been able to get the, the right support?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think my father would have loved to have been an engineer. He was, he, he became quite good through correspondence courses in doing things like radio, radio repair, watchmaking. He was very skilled in, with things that required logic and his hands and the use of his hands. So, yeah, he, he would have been quite, quite good. And may very well have also been a writer, he wrote over two hundred songs that, over the course of his, his life. And, and some of them were, were sung in churches and so, so he, he was well read and, and quite interested in knowledge.
Story_ID: 637144
Speaker 1: Now, did he [Asante's father, Arthur Smith], what, what did he end up doing for, for a living?
Speaker 2: He ended up, actually he worked in two places. He, he worked actually in a peanut mill but injured his back and then he worked for the Georgia Southern railroad company [Georgia Southern and Florida Railway Company]. And then his injury actually got so bad that he could not walk. And for most of my adult life he was until his death a, a paraplegic because the operation on his spinal cord did not go well.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, he couldn't work?
Speaker 2: Right. After, after a while, yes.
Speaker 1: All right. So, okay. Now, how old were you when that happened?
Speaker 2: About fifteen.
Story_ID: 637145
Speaker 1: Let me go back, I, I didn't, I should have asked, I'm trying to remember a question I should have asked.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The, your great-great--
Speaker 2: Grandmother (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) grandmother [Asante's paternal great-great-grandmother, Frances Henderson Chapman].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the one who was born in 1868.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did she have any stories about emancipation even though she was born (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I, no--
Speaker 1: --afterwards?
Speaker 2: --we, we don't know, I never met her, I don't know that story. I only met my great-grandparents, Plenty [Plenty Smith] and Hattie Smith [Hattie Shine Smith]. But and I never remember them telling the stories about her. They passed away in, in the 1960s, 1961 and 1963, so I didn't hear them tell any stories about her.
Story_ID: 637146
Speaker 1: Is there a story of how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Not that I know. I don't know how they met quite frankly. I have a, I, I heard my father [Arthur Smith] mention often that she was a very beautiful woman and that he was quite interested in, in her. Now, my mother [Lillie Belle Wilkens Smith] I must say this that when my father met my mother she already had three children, she had three children. She, they ended up having thirteen children, so, so you get a total of sixteen, so there were sixteen of, of us. So, my, my father was, considered himself, I mean, quite a mature person because he held down jobs, he, he, he did a lot of work for his family and also he was considered, quite a, a catch so, so both of them actually came to each other at a, at a, I think, a moment when my mother was much more mature than she had been.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So, but they met in Valdosta [Georgia]. Well, they--
Speaker 2: Valdosta.
Speaker 1: --they, they got together in Valdosta (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I would guess Valdosta would be the kind of town where most people would know each other anyway (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, you would, you would know each other. It's a, I'm sure at the time they knew each other. There must not have been more than twenty thousand people in the whole town, and, and maybe half of them were black, and most of those people knew each other.
Story_ID: 637147
Speaker 1: Now, when you consider your parents' personalities and their mannerisms, their habits, their looks even, who, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think I take after my father [Arthur Smith] the most (pause). Yeah, I think I take after my father the most but I, I have my mother's [Lillie Belle Wilkens Smith] generosity of spirit with people and the whole love of people and relationships and, and activities and actions. My father was much more a loner.
Story_ID: 637148
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Probably the earliest childhood memory was probably when I was maybe three or four when, this was during the period of the, the war when my Uncle Moses [Asante's paternal uncle, Moses Smith], came home from and, and, and my Uncle Alfred [Asante's paternal uncle, Alfred Smith] came home from, from serving in the war [World War II, WWII] that they, they brought me a military uniform, you know, a little kid's, child's uniform and everybody made due of this, this uniform that they had brought me, so, yeah, I remember that, that was a family gathering. But, but I think that out of that I bonded a lot with my, my youngest uncle, Alfred, because he later took me fishing, we would go to the Withlacoochee River as well as the Okefenokee Swamp area.
Story_ID: 637149
Speaker 1: Just wanted to mention that Dr. Asante's [HistoryMaker Molefi Kete Asante] wife, Ama is observing.
Speaker 2: Ana, A-N-A, Ana [Ana Yenenga Asante].
Speaker 1: A-N-A.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Oh, A-N-A. All right, I'm sorry, is observing.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, now, there's a story about your birth that I think that you need to tell that is, that I've, I, I, I read about and you, you wanna tell us that?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That you read about? Wow, wow. When I was born in south, in Georgia and my, my mother [Lillie Belle Wilkens Smith] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, the circumstances around your, your birth, the, the veil and all that, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, yes, okay, okay. I, I, (laughter) I was saying well, what you know that I don't know right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah, when I was born, I mean, you have to recall that I think it's only within the top of the 21st century maybe, maybe the last quarter of the 20th century that the African American population in the South, particularly in the Deep South like I was, like I grew up, early on, I later moved from Valdosta [Georgia] to Tennessee [Nashville, Tennessee] but, but we were, we, we had many beliefs, many spiritual beliefs, religious beliefs. And so, when I was born according to my, my uncles and, and aunts, the, the, I was born with what they used to call a veil over your eyes. And that's basically like, I, I think a part of the afterbirth that is over the child's eyes. And then I, I came out, of course, with the blue, the blueberry birthmark and people saw that as something particular, something special and something that had some kind of omen and this was a part of the discussion not, not just around the birth but also as I was growing up that he was a child with a, with a veil over his face so this was a, a big part of, of the growing up, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay. Okay. And there's some stories about what that's supposed to signify too, right? What does, what does it mean?
Speaker 1: Well, I think the, the signification is there is, of course, some wisdom that the child had been here before, that somehow that there was some, something that was significant about this event and, and this was always sort of drilled into me as a, as a part of the inheritance that I had received from the ancestors.
Story_ID: 637150
Speaker 1: Can you describe where you grew up?
Speaker 2: Well, I, the first years from the time I was one--born to the time I was ten, so I was in Valdosta, Georgia, that's where I grew up. But, but when I was eleven years old I was sent to a boarding school [Nashville Christian Institute] in Nashville, Tennessee, which was a Christian boarding school for young men and, and women who would grow up and be leaders in the church. So, that was, so from the time I was eleven until the time I graduated from high school, I would spend the academic year in Nashville, Tennessee, I would spend the summers in Georgia working in the cotton fields and the tobacco fields, so that was basically my, my youth.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did you have, was it, was, was the house very large that you grew up in, in Valdosta?
Speaker 2: No, the houses, the house with four rooms. You, you had two bedrooms, a front room, and a backroom, a kitchen, and a bathroom. And these were called shotgun houses. The, the idea behind the shotgun house was that you could look through the front door all the way through the back door, that there was just, you know, just, you could shoot a shotgun straight through the house, that was the house I grew up in. It was sitting on eight pillars made out of brick, eight brick pillars.  And easily one could think that the house could have been moved by wind or something but it was pretty stable.
Story_ID: 637151
Speaker 1: Now, can you name your brothers and sisters for us and tell us where you fit in?
Speaker 2: You mean all sixteen?  I'll try, let me try (simultaneous).

Speaker 2: Juanita [Juanita Smith Cannon] who is the oldest; Lucille [Lucille Smith Carter] who is the second oldest; and April [April Smith Randall] who is the third oldest; after April that's, then it's me, I'm Molefi [HistoryMaker Molefi Kete Asante]; and after me is Vera [Vera Smith Ponder]; and after Vera is Esikenti [Esikenti Smith], E-S-I-K-E-N-T-I; and after Esikenti is Shirley [Shirley Smith]; and after Shirley is Paul [Paul Smith]; and after Paul is William [William Charles Smith], Oz- is Ozzie Lee [Ozzie Lee Smith]; after Ozzie, O-Z-Z-I-E, we pronounce it Ozzie, Ozzie is William Charles; after Williams Charles is Ralph [Ralph Smith]; after Ralph is Brenda [Brenda Smith]; and then after Brenda is Linda [Linda Smith Washington]; and after Linda, no, I'm sorry before, before Brenda is Carolyn [Carolyn Smith], Carolyn is before Brenda; and then after Brenda is Linda; and then after Linda is Sandra [Sandra Smith]. That should be, that should be all of 'em, no, there's, I missed one, Willie Mae [Willie Mae Smith Finnisee]. And Willie Mae you, Willie Mae, you would put Willie Mae just before Linda.
Story_ID: 637152
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.
Speaker 2: You gonna, you gonna ask me their birthdates, don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, I'm not, I'm not gone do that.
Speaker 2: --don't do that to me (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm not gone do that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This question is what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, let's take the sights. The sights of growing up in Valdosta, Georgia, were, were, were tremendously diverse. I had mentioned to you about the Spanish moss on the trees, we would play close to the cemetery and we would like to scare each other with the, with those, with that moss hanging down. This was a, a sight, we, the, the azaleas of the city, the city was called this, the Azalea City because there were so many azaleas blooming in Valdosta, it's a very beautiful, beautiful city in that sense with flowers and all kinds of plant life. But the city was also quite segregated, you could see this visibly. And one of the sights would be, when I was growing up the separation of water fountains for colored and for white. They didn't use black at that time but it was for colored and for whites, sometimes Negro. The city was a city of dirt roads, particularly in the black community most of the streets were still dirt, they had not been paved. The white taxpayers didn't decide to use their money to pave the black streets until much later. So, this, these were the sights of the, of the town, I mean, the surrounding area was the sights of cotton fields and tobacco fields. But the, the smells of the city were of peanut oil. And because the peanut, because of the peanut factory, the mill, that my father [Arthur Smith] had worked in for a while that injured his back lifting the, the bail, the, the peanut bags. But so, the smell of peanuts, you could hear, you could, you could smell that through the air over the small town but you could also smell tobacco because we were not only an area where tobacco grew but it was also a place where tobacco was marketed with, through the warehouses, where you would have the people auctioning off different crops of tobacco to the big cigarette companies. So, tobacco was in the air, peanuts were in the air, that, that was part of the, the smell of Georgia. And the sounds were the sounds of the church music, the sounds of the, the, Saturday night, Friday and Saturday night when black people played music down on Ashley Street and on Patterson Streets, these were the neighborhoods for black people to gather on the weekends, when all the country people would come to town with their different colors and calico and their various what we would call today probably mismatched clothing with purples and pinks and blacks. And it was a beautiful, beautiful time. And so, this was part of the scene of the music and the, and not so much drumming but certainly the jazz music and the blues. These were my, my father even sang blues in our house almost every day, so blues was a particular deep part of our culture.
Story_ID: 637153
Speaker 1: Now, I didn't ask about your father's [Arthur Smith] musicianship but he mu- did he play the piano or, or the guitar or--
Speaker 2: No, no, he, he did not play any instrument that I know of but he sang and he was a wonderful singer. And, and later on my, my sister, Vera [Vera Smith Ponder], sang, she was a, a wonderful singer but, but my father sang and he was a creator of music and creator of songs, yeah, that, that was his tradition.
Speaker 1: Now, now, do you have a favorite song that your father wrote?
Speaker 2: Good question. No, I don't. I cannot recall. I cannot recall. I think I've written about this in my memoir ['As I Run Toward Africa: A Memoir,' Molefi Kete Asante] some songs that he sang but I, I, I, I know he, he loved to say things like, "Woke up this morning as cold as it could be, woke up this morning as cold as it could be, and there was nothing that I had as far as I could see," something like that. I mean, my father loved to make those blues lines and he would just create 'em, many of them.
Story_ID: 637154
Speaker 1: So you had a big household growing up, a lot of, you know, filled with--
Speaker 2: Well, well, with, with two bedrooms, we, all of us were not there fortunately at the same time. I mean, sixteen people, sixteen (laughter) children and two adults couldn't be there at the same time so there, there was probably no more than nine at one time--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: --in the house, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the older ones had, had moved (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the older ones had moved.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean, basically, basically my three older sisters [Juanita Smith Cannon, Lucille Smith Carter and April Smith Randall] had moved out and then the rest of us were there.
Speaker 1: Yeah (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then, of course, then some of us, I, I left and, and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and my sister [Vera Smith Ponder] left and my brother, Esikenti [Esikenti Smith], left and then so it was, almost always regulated to be around nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause people are tempted to think everybody, sixteen were there but--
Speaker 2: No, no right.
Speaker 1: --the process of though, the older ones leaving and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and new ones being born, I guess (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right. That's right. That's right.
Speaker 1: All right. Okay. So, no more than about nine.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That means, so, so you had to, so the girls had one room, or, or how did, how did the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the, the girls, well, well, the, that's a very good question. People ask that question. Sometimes when they're young the boys and the girls sleep in the same bed so that that happened. But we also slept across the bed so rather than, you know, so, so the bed could sleep more people if you had five or six people laying across the bed.
Speaker 1: If, they're, they're little especially (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, little people, yeah, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And my mother [Lillie Belle Wilkens Smith] and father [Arthur Smith] slept in the front room.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With another bed for children.
Story_ID: 637155
Speaker 1: Now what did you like to do when you were growing up?  What were you interested in and what was your personality like?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my personality was, has always probably been reflective and interested in ideas and that's what I liked. I liked reading. I had, I was particularly influenced by my, my Aunt Georgia [Georgia Smith Johnson (ph.)] who was my father's youngest sibling, she gave me my first book and I was in the eighth grade [at Nashville Christian Institute, Nashville, Tennessee]. And she gave it to me because she knew that I was always interested in reading, learning something, reflective. I was, in the church I was very much interested in reading the Bible, reading stories of the people who lived in the Bible period and so forth. So, it, this was part of my childhood. I was deeply influenced by whatever was considered intellectual. My father [Arthur Smith], of course, because he ordered books and materials through correspondence always challenged me with the study of French, the study of German, he had all these books around him, so this was, this was something that I was excited by.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, was there a library that, that (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He had a bookshelf. No, he didn't have a library of such but he had a bookshelf with about four, four shelves and he had books in them, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, was there was a public library in town?
Speaker 2: Yeah, of course, but the public library in Valdosta [Georgia] during the time I was growing up would, would be off limits to black people anyway and we, we couldn't go to the public library, it was for whites only.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you, did your father subscribe to magazines and things?
Speaker 2: One, one year they, they subscribed to Ebony but not to any, not to any academic or intellectual journals or anything like that but to Ebony because that had come through the church.
Speaker 1: Okay. And newspapers, did you get--
Speaker 2: No, no, no newspapers, no newspapers just the, my father read The Valdosta Times [The Valdosta Daily Times] but that was, it was just a local paper and it was mainly stories about white people, basically.
Speaker 1: So, so you never got the, the Courier or the--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --Defender [Chicago Defender]?
Speaker 2: Well, well, we did, we heard about them, we heard about them and sometimes people would bring the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] and the Chicago Defender, these were the papers that really sort of somehow found their way in the southern black communities, but we didn't, no, we didn't subscribe to them.
Story_ID: 637156
Speaker 1: Now, what about school?  Now, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: I started school in Valdosta, Georgia, at Magnolia Elementary School [Magnolia Street Elementary School].
Speaker 1: And this is, this will be read, this video will be seen by people, you know, hundreds of years from now--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --or hopefully so, so that's why I'm asking obvious questions. You may think why, why would I ask if the school was segregated (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, I, no, no I--
Speaker 1: That's, (laughter) that's why.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But it was segregated, right? It's--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was definitely segregated. Magnolia was a black school and we had black teachers, a black principal.
Speaker 1: Okay. And was this a state supported school?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a state or city municipal school.
Speaker 1: Okay. And about what size was, was it? How, how many students?
Speaker 2: Probably about four hundred students in the school.
Speaker 1: And, and did you have like, I mean, how many classrooms and, and can you describe the (unclear).
Speaker 2: The, the school, the school was actually two stories and probably about four or probably about five or six classrooms on the, on the first level and maybe about six on the second level if my memory is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, it was more sophisticated than a school where you'd have all the classes in the same room (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, no, no, we didn't have that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We, we went from grade to, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Different grades had different classrooms.
Speaker 1: All right. And now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: I loved school. Yeah, I was, was a, I was a, I was a A student, I was a good student, I, I enjoyed school. And I would often rather be at school than to be anywhere else, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: As a, as a elementary school student, not really, I didn't, I didn't have a favorite so I liked all of them, I really did.  I did like all my subjects.
Speaker 1: Now, what about teachers, did you have, was there a special teacher?
Speaker 2: There were a couple of special teachers, Mrs. Jones [ph.] and Mrs. Gamble [ph.]. Mrs. Jones was my first grade teacher, Mrs. Gamble was my third grade teacher. I liked them both. Mrs. Gamble was considered a little harder.  Mrs. Jones was always comparing me to my sister, April [April Smith Randall], the, the sibling I was next to. And, and it was like a challenge for me because my sister had been a good student, and so I, I followed in that tradition.
Story_ID: 637157
Speaker 1: To what extent, I guess, did popular culture affect you? Did, did you all have a radio and--
Speaker 2: Yes, but I--
Speaker 1: --or a TV?
Speaker 2: --yes, we did. We, we, we didn't, no, we didn't have TV because the first person to have television in the black community in Valdosta [Georgia] that would probably come in the, in the later '50s [1950s]. But we had radio and we had a phonograph machine but the, the real popular culture for us would be when things would come to town like events. That, the, the, the, the black baseball league, the circus, the, the fairs, the dance contests. But the music that we listened to mainly at home was either blues or gospel, not gospel so much as spirituals probably.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, so, the, you all were on the circuit for, for the Negro Leagues?
Speaker 2: The Negro Leagues.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --what, what would, was, was there a certain team that would always come through or, or just when (unclear).
Speaker 2: I, I didn't remember whether it was a certain team or not but I knew that this was always a great activity, the selling of hotdogs and hamburgers and the people gathering and, and our local team, of course, being very excited so it was, it was quite a time. It was a very exciting time.
Speaker 1: And now, were you interested in sports?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was interested in sports but as a elementary school student I don't think I, the only thing I did was, I, I, I would love skating, I did skating but we didn't have any organized teams but I played baseball, I played football, all those things as kids as, but, but not in any organized way until later (background noise).
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So, so, did Magnolia [Magnolia Street Elementary School, Valdosta, Georgia] go all the way through the eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, yeah, to the eighth grade.
Story_ID: 637158
Speaker 1: So, I, I take it there was a (background noise)--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Can we let this pass?
Speaker 1: --that there was a high school there in Valdosta [Georgia] for, for the black students?
Speaker 2: Yes. It was called Dasher High School.
Speaker 1: Now, was Dasher a member of the black community who had done something?
Speaker 2: Dasher, that's a very good question. Dasher High School was named after a white man, I think named Roy Dasher [ph.]. That school would later I think be phased out, there was a, there was a middle school that would be named later for a very famous family called the Lomax family because Lomax [James L. Lomax] had been a principal of Dasher at one time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a black man, Lomax?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, you had, yeah, the, the famous writer Louis came from Valdosta and it was his father [sic. paternal uncle] who had been the principal.
Speaker 1: Okay. Was his name, what, what was his name? Do you know his first (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The father, I don't remember. I didn't--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I only went to Dasher for like a semester.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't go, I went to, well, after the fifth grade, I went to school at the Nashville Christian Institute [Nashville, Tennessee] in the sixth grade so, so, I left Valdosta. So, I didn't, I didn't follow Dasher High very much. The time I had to go, the time I went to Dasher for like a semester was only because I didn't have the tuition to go back to Nashville Christian Institute.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And once that tuition was made available I went back to Nashville.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you were, you were at, at Magnolia [Magnolia Street Elementary School, Valdosta, Georgia] until what, 1953? I guess, is that it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so, must have been about that time, yeah--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) fifty-three [1953], '54 [1954], is probably when I went to Nashville [Tennessee].
Story_ID: 637159
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, how did this, this arrangement come, come into being? I mean, who first told you all about the school and how, how was that hooked up?
Speaker 2: Well, the, it's very interesting because I was a member of a church called the Church of Christ. The Church of Christ had at that time a man who probably within that church is still considered their most heroic African American, his name was Marshall Keeble, K-E-E-B-L-E. And Keeble was a, a phenomenal speaker, a gifted storyteller, a tremendous debater. And Keeble had started maybe nearly three hundred churches throughout the South. He, he was considered the, the major founder of the black Churches of Christ. So, he would come every year to different communities and he came one year to Valdosta [Georgia]. And he had started a school in Nashville [Tennessee] that was called the Nashville Christian Institute, he was the president. And he would recruit students to come to his school and the churches would normally pay the tuition for the students. But since I was considered a, a good student I would, I'd go home on Sundays and I would repeat to my parents, repeat to my parents the whole question of what the preacher would have spoken about, if the preacher had spoken about a particular topic in church I would give that talk to my mother [Lillie Belle Wilkens Smith] and my father [Arthur Smith] and they would listen and they would be so impressed that boy, he could recite everything. So, this ability to memorize was very early a gift that I had. And so, Keeble would bring young men with him who would be also preachers and they would demonstrate what would happen to your child if your child went to the Nashville Christian Institute, you could be like Floyd Rose, you could be like Otis Boat- [Otis Boatwright], David Boatwright, for example. Because these were young men who were bright and sharp and they, they knew the Bible and they dressed properly and they were respected young men. So, my parents heard about this through the church, the church told 'em, "Well, you know, your son, Arthur [HistoryMaker Molefi Kete Asante], is," you know, "he's, he memorizes these bible verses, he memorizes these sermons, he's really a person, you really ought a get him out of Valdosta, he needs to go to Nashville," so that's how I got to go. My, my, my preacher at my church and his wife drove me the five hundred miles from Valdosta to Nashville to enroll me in that school and that was how I got to Nashville Christian Institute.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So, Marshall Keeble then, was, was that his base of operation?
Speaker 2: His base of operation was Nashville and he was, he, he traveled all over America, actually.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do, do you know if Reverend Stanley Keeble [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Stanley Keeble] is related to Marshall Keeble?
Speaker 2: I do not know but boy there's, there's not too many, that's a very rare name.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a famous--
Speaker 2: Maybe.
Speaker 1: --choir director.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: He lives in Chicago [Illinois] now.
Speaker 2: I see. Is he spelled also K-E-E-B-L-E? Wow.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: 'Cause sometimes you see the B-L-E-R but Keeble this, I'm sure they must be from the same family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would imagine.
Speaker 1: 'Cause we interviewed him for the project about five years ago.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, right.
Speaker 1: Stanley Keeble.
Speaker 2: Stanley Keeble.
Speaker 1: And he's into gospel music.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, that's, okay. So, Nashville Christian Institute. Now, here you are away from home for the first time--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I guess, you know (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And, and you're eleven years old?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And just in time to make room for somebody else at home.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But so, so what was it like, being, being away and--
Speaker 2: Homesick, homesick, lonely, it was tough. It was, it was a growing up period. Fortunately, in Nashville there were members of the Church of Christ who would take in young men like on the weekend, you could go to someone. And there was a lady by the name of, her name was Mary Lee--Mrs. Lee, and Mrs. Lee, Mamie Lee [ph.], Mamie, M-A-M-I-E, Mamie Lee became sort of like a surrogate mother for me and for several other young men at the school. Mostly, the school had mostly men. There were some girls at the school but very few girls compared to the number of boys. And Mamie Lee would cook dinner for us on Sunday, on Saturday we would clean up her yard and her place but she was, you know, that kind of person. She and her husband were like church people who said, you know, these boys are away from home, they could always come and eat with us.
Story_ID: 637160
Speaker 1: You were telling me off camera that, that you would often accompany Reverend Keeble to churches where you all would make presentations?
Speaker 2: Yes, one of the things that Marshall Keeble did in order to raise money to support the Nashville Christian Institute [Nashville, Tennessee] was that he would take periodic trips throughout the nation to speak at large white churches. And to demonstrate what he could do with black children, he would bring examples particularly of young black students who would speak on the church circuit. And I was one of these young men for about three years and we would, we would go from city to city and we would give our talks and, and we would raise money for the church, for the school, and we would go back, he'd go back and he would have money to pay his teachers. I mean, basically this was, this was the idea. I mean, he found bright, young people, people who were, some of 'em were quite gifted as, as orators, some of 'em were quite gifted as people who were able to memorize long passages of scripture, and I was one of those people. I memorized whole chapters and so on he said, okay, you know. People would be impressed by this. Other people would say, you know, that somebody was called to preach or called to do this but for me, I just saw it as something as an intellectual exercise and that's what it was.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you didn't have a mystical moment?
Speaker 2: No, no, not at all, not at all. I had to study those things and learn, (laughter) learn, memorize that stuff so, so, I could go on and, you know. And then, of course, you knew the, the, the moments when people would really be taken by it when you, you would get some particularly interesting passage like the Parthians and the Medes and the Elamites and the dwellers of Mesopotamia and so forth, and you knew the audience would really just they'd love that, you see. So, as a young person, you, you, you learn those, those buttons.
Story_ID: 637161
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of facility did Reverend Keeble [Marshall Keeble] have?
Speaker 2: Facility, what do you mean (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, for the school.
Speaker 2: Oh, the school was a regular school, it was located on 24th Street [sic. 24th Avenue] off of Herman [Street] in north, in Nashville [Tennessee]. And it was close to Jefferson Junior High School [ph.]. And it had a dormitory and it also had, you know, administration building, there were, one, two, three buildings, I think, that made up the school when I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So, this is mostly males, male students (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mostly male students and, and, and a faculty that was, had about two white faculty members on the, on the faculty, the rest were black. The school was sort of taken under the wings of a David Lipscomb College [Lipscomb University, Nashville, Tennessee], sort of took it under its wings as, you know, the, sort of their black cousins or junior school.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, David Lipscomb College?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So it was associated with David Lipscomb?
Speaker 2: Yes, the, same, same church denomination, and Lipscomb College students and some of their faculty would from time to time come over to the N- to the NCI [Nashville Christian Institute, Nashville, Tennessee].
Story_ID: 637162
Speaker 1: So Reverend Keeble [Marshall Keeble] then was a, a black preacher in a, in a white, in, in a--
Speaker 2: The white denomination.
Speaker 1: --white denomination, basically?
Speaker 2: That's right, white denomination.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right. It was not a, it was not the Church Of God in Christ which is perhaps predominantly black, this was the Church of Christ which, you know, they didn't believe in no, no pianos, no music in the church, don't call the preacher reverend, call the preacher brother, that kind of thing, very strict interpretation of the, of the Bible.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, the difference, the Church Of God in Christ (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is more, more expressive with the, it's instrumental music and that kind of thing and the testimonies. Church of Christ is much more reserved than that.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and perhaps more, more conservative too maybe in one sense, politically.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, it was more of a quiet--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --evangel- would, would, would you call it an evangelistic kind, type of a church or (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but a little quieter, not quite as quiet as the Methodist but close in terms of the general personality of the church.
Speaker 1: So it was, there was no singing at all in church or--
Speaker 2: There was singing but it was all a cappella.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But no music, no piano, no organs, no, nothing like that.
Speaker 1: And certainly not drums and (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, never, that's very sinful--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the thinking of many of the Church of Christ people.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, this is the kind of church where they didn't, they don't allow you to dance?
Speaker 2: No, no, no dancing, no. A dancing foot and a praying knee have never been seen on the same leg. That's one of their, one of their statements (laughter), so.
Speaker 1: So, as a young man what were you thinking about these rules and these--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I wasn't thinking very much about 'em.  I mean, that, you know, I mean, how religion is. I mean, you, you, you're brought up in a church and you're in it. I mean, there was not anything unnatural for me with it. I mean, it was like wow, this is, this is, this is what we had. I didn't know anything else quite frankly.
Story_ID: 637163
Speaker 1: Your parents [Lillie Belle Wilkens Smith and Arthur Smith] were a part of this denomination in, in--
Speaker 2: Yes, absolute- in Valdosta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: In Valdosta, okay.  So, but this is a black church, so the Church of Christ was a segregated--
Speaker 2: Segregated, yes. It was segregated. The Church of Christ, Church of Christ came out of the Civil War with the Disciples of Christ becoming more liberal and northern and the Churches of Christ supporting the Confederacy and becoming more conservative. And, and they eventually had a black segment.  And that black segment was basically dominated by Keeble for a long time and there may have been a couple of other preachers who also dominated it in different geographical areas but for the most part in the U.S. the name Marshall Keeble is identified as the black person who essentially founded the Church of Christ among black people.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: There, there are names like Bowser [George Philip Bowser] and Hogan [Richard Nathaniel Hogan], these are also important names of preachers who were significant. Bowser earlier than Keeble, but never had the reputation or the stature that Keeble had.
Story_ID: 637164
Speaker 1: Now, did you, did you feel when you were there that you were getting a, a, a good education?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I did. I felt I was getting a good education. It was, it was, I was a good student. I mean, I basically mastered my subjects and was well thought of by my teachers. I had some teachers that were quite influential on me at, at that school.
Speaker 1: Who, who were they? Who were they? (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, one was Earl Tharpe [sic. Frank Norris Tharpe], T-H-A-R-P-E, Tharpe. Tharpe was a history teacher and he taught me history. He had written a book with Merl Eppse [Merl R. Eppse] who had been a professor at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee]. And Tharpe was quite challenging, perhaps the most challenging of the teachers that I had in high school in the sense that he was irreligious in many respects and he challenged us to think about things in ways that I am sure were against whatever the rules they had at Nashville Christian Institute [Nashville, Tennessee]. Mrs. Watkins [ph.] was my eighth grade teacher who felt like I had done so well for her class that she gave me a month to just do nothing but come to class and read, read dictionary words. So, so she thought that I, I, I surpassed all the other students and so you need to just study the dictionary now. And (laughter) then--
Speaker 1: Let, let, let me go back to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Professor Tharpe for a minute.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, this is the Earl Thorpe [Earl E. Thorpe]--
Speaker 2: No, Frank--
Speaker 1: Earl--
Speaker 2: --F.E. Tharpe, Frank Tharpe, F., F.E. [sic.]--
Speaker 1: Oh, Frank.
Speaker 2: Yeah, not--
Speaker 1: Frank Tharpe?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Frank Tharpe.
Speaker 1: Not, not Earl Thorpe? Okay. Frank Tharpe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Frank Tharpe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Frank Tharpe, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, he's a history, was, was he related to Earl Thorpe?
Speaker 2: He may, he, I, I think he was because we often, I, I think we may have even asked him, I think he was. And he was, but what, what was important about him was that he studied at Tennessee State and he had gotten a master's degree, he never did the Ph.D. but he took his whole class over to see his old professor who was Merl Eppse. And Merl Eppse and I became quite close until his death actually in the 1970s or late '60s [1960s], when, 'cause he moved to California after he retired from Tennessee State but he was one of the early black historians, I mean after, like Benjamin Quarles [Benjamin A. Quarles], Woodson [Carter G. Woodson], and Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois]. Merl Eppse who was a teacher of Frank Tharpe, Merl Eppse had written a book on African American history as well ['The Negro, Too, in American History']. And that was the book that we used even in high school and it came because of the relationship between Tharpe and, and, and Eppse.
Speaker 1: Now, you know, Earl Thorpe--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who I thought you were, you were talking about, is, wrote a book on the history of the black historians ['Black Historians: A Critique,' Earl E. Thorpe].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I know, I know that book.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I know that book. That is, that's true. And he may, I'm pretty sure there must be some relationship to, to our Tharpe because our Tharpe, the, the family was not very big but he, he often referred to historians in his family and he was himself a historian. I mean, a very, very provocative teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: This, this is a good clue for somebody that watches your story (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it is, of course, sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Okay. And Merl Eppse of Tennessee State?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right. And, you know, so both (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so then, so, so Mrs. Watkins my eighth grade teacher and then Mrs. Edwards [ph.] my ninth grade teacher had me to tutor students who had come from fighting in the Vietnam War. So, so part of that as I was getting ready to finish school, some of the people, actually it wasn't quite the Vietnam, I think it must have been the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], this is before the, just before the Vietnam War really got started, but the people on the G.I. Bill who came to the Nashville Christian Institute, I was, I was a student who was chosen to tutor those men.  And, and that, of course, was a, a, a wonderful statement on the part of Mrs. Edwards about what she thought of my capabilities, and I was quite, quite proud of that.
Story_ID: 637165
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you something else about the, the era and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --are you, you were there I guess kind of during the heart of the Civil Rights Movement--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --in the South. And--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --Nashville [Tennessee] was really a, so did, did you ever, did you know what was going on over in--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] and Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Absolutely. I was in the, I was in the demonstrations led by Diane Nash. And, in fact, I, I, I marched on the, I think it was called the White Castle hamburger joint. And we also marched on the movie theaters downtown with Diane Nash. This is, I was in high school, I was eleventh grade or, or maybe a senior at the time but I was quite active. That was my awakening was the national demonstrations. One of my close friends who was at NCI [Nashville Christian Institute, Nashville, Tennessee] and then later went to community, junior college with me, was William Barbee and he was beaten badly during that period of demonstrations. He even went on the bus rides and was, was severely injured, beaten over the head in either, in Memphis [Tennessee] or Alabama, one of those states. So, it was a period of my conscious- consciousness, I mean, I see it as my awakening, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: Yeah. I'm a child of the '60s [1960s] in that regard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Some of the Freedom Rides that developed out of that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Freedom Rides.
Story_ID: 637166
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell people who Diane Nash was (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Diane Nash was a student leader at, at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] and she became the symbol of the black student movement and the movement for civil rights in, in Nashville [Tennessee]. She was basically, I mean, for those of us who were in high school, she was almost like a, a real diva of the Civil Rights Movement in Nashville. But Nashville had a lot of other people, I mean, I think, Bevel was there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) James Bevel [HistoryMaker Reverend James Bevel], yeah.
Speaker 2: Lawson was there, Lawson.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: There was the, the attorney, Looby [Z. Alexander Looby]. There, there were--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So there was a big, there was a lot of activity in Nashville. And, of course--
Speaker 1: The Reverend James Lawson (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Reverend James Lawson, that's right. He was in between Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee] and Peabody [George Peabody College for Teachers, Nashville, Tennessee] I think, and that whole scene. So, there, there was a lot of activity. So, our students were affected and I was deeply affected in 1962, '63 [1963], '64 [1964], yeah, we was very active.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So, you finished high school there in Nashville Christian (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I finished high school in 19, I'm talking about six--I'm sorry, let me back up, sorry.  No, I finished high school in '60 [1960], so this was the late '50s [1950s] when this was happening with Diane Nash and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --everybody, that's right, it was late '59 [1959], '59 [1959], '60 [1960], it was back--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --then.
Speaker 1: This is just before they started the Freedom Rides?
Speaker 2: That's right. That's right. Yeah, that's right because my high school graduation was in June of 1960. And the, the other, something else that happened that was critical at that moment too was that I met the multimillionaire at that time, (background noise) Billie Sol Estes because Billie Sol Estes rescued Nashville Christian Institute [Nashville, Tennessee] financially by deciding to support tuition of forty-two children, forty-two young people.  So--
Speaker 1: Now, now, now, when was this, this is what, what year is this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen--1958, '57 [1957]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --something like that.
Story_ID: 637167
Speaker 1: Billie Sol Estes (background noise). Now, he, he became like infamous at some point in America.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Absolutely. But I still talk to him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I talked to him, I just talked to him a couple of weeks ago, yeah.
Speaker 1: He was, he got caught, caught up in some kind of scandal (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, he did.
Speaker 1: --during the--
Speaker 2: I know the whole story.
Speaker 1: --Johnson administration.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I know the whole story. I was--
Speaker 1: Okay. He was a supporter of Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, the millionaire, Billie Sol Estes supported--
Speaker 2: Billie Sol, Billie Sol Estes came to the Nashville Christian Institute [Nashville, Tennessee] because he was visiting Frank Clement [Frank G. Clement] who was the young governor of Tennessee at the time. He must have been in his thirties, the youngest governor they had ever had in Tennessee. And, and, and at that time, Billie Sol Estes and Clement were good friends, so they came over to our school to see what we had been doing. And Billie Sol Estes was also a member of the Church of Christ. So, Keeble [Marshall Keeble] had asked me to get up and speak so I spoke and after I spoke, Billie Sol Estes asked Keeble, "Who is this young man?" He said, "Well, he comes from a very poor family, they have all those children down there in Valdosta, Georgia. His parents [Lillie Belle Wilkens Smith and Arthur Smith] can't pay the tuition. It's--," you know, it was a very sad story, I mean, it was very, it was one of these stories that always, I used to get embarrassed by these stories but, you know, how, you know, they don't have shoes to wear (laughter). But so, Billie Sol, this is the, I told you the Booker T. Washington working on the white folks who were basically there, you know, to observe these bright black kids. So, Billie Sol Estes gets up and he says, "Well, today I'm making a promise to you. I'll pay his tuition, and I'll pay for forty-one other young people who are in this school whose parents can't pay their tuition." So, that's how I finished the, the last three, three or four years was that Estes paid the tuition for me. So, and then when I, when I left, he had just been indicted, he got indicted around '60 [1960], '61 [1961] basically for claiming collateral for loans that he did not have, he didn't possess anhydrous ammonia tanks that supposedly he had but somebody, some enterprising journalist counted the tanks and said there are not enough tanks to cover a $50 million loan, so, you know, the banks started coming, descending on him and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: Okay. And I think he was a supporter of Lyndon Johnson (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He supported Lyndon Johnson, Lyndon Johnson put him on the, he was on the, on the cotton board. But the problem, other problem was that when Marshall Keeble went to Pecos, Texas, Billie Sol Estes had a wing, had a special wing of his house built for Marshall Keeble because he admired the man so much. But the white people in Pecos said it was illegal for blacks to live in a house overnight with white people, this was a law in Texas, it was a law in Georgia too, you're a northerner you may not know anything about this, sir, but, we, we, we knew about this in the South. So, it was illegal for blacks and whites to stay in the same house overnight. So, that was the other charge against Estes that he was, he was much too liberal and so there were people who really wanted to bring him down, in addition to the fact that he had done something that was illegal.
Story_ID: 637168
Speaker 1: Now, were you watching the activities of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in Montgomery [Alabama] and that sort of thing when you were (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I, I, I was. I watched the activities. I, I did not, I was not, I never marched with Marsh- with King but later on in 1963 I went to the March on Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Well, we'll get to that then, so.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I just wanted to ask you that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was watching, I was watching everything. And, of course, you know, even in the, when I went to Nashville Christian Institute [Nashville, Tennessee] it was right around the time that Emmett Till had been killed so that had a horrendous effect on me. I mean, it was a very powerful effect, you know, that somebody could mutilate a person's body like that. So, so by the time I graduated in 1960 I am moving, in a way questioning more and more this whole Christian notion, this whole religious attitude that I had grown up with and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you see the Jet magazine picture of Emmett Till (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I, I did, that's the--powerful.
Story_ID: 637169
Speaker 1: So you say you were que- questioning the Christian, now--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was questioning, I mean, I, I was questioning this whole idea of churches and Christianity and, and whether or not a Christian nation could treat people right and so forth. So, these were, these were very philosophical times for me.
Speaker 1: Now, Nashville [Tennessee] is, unless I'm wrong and I, I think I'm--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It's probably one of the most religious towns--
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: --with so many bible schools and seminaries--
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: --and the headquarters of different black denominations--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --there and--
Speaker 2: And yet extremely racist, historically. You know, it has, has a long history, I mean, Pap Singleton [Benjamin "Pap" Singleton] in the 19th century, you remember had, one of the ways he got people to go to Kansas is because of the situation after the Civil War in Nashville was so horrendous.  So no, it, it, it has a, a infamous history, you see. A notorious history I should say. So, so, I was involved with those churches, with the, but, but all the time moving, I think, further and further away from, from that idea.
Speaker 1: Now, what was it, now, what you're describing, what you're saying is something that a lot of people may think but they never mention in these interviews.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Kind of (laughter) questioning--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of the church.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is, so, so what caused you to, to think that way and I mean, is, it's really interesting that somebody actually would say this, you know, that they actually questioned what was going on in the--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, I was, no, I, I think again, I go back to my father [Arthur Smith], my father was quite a rationalist. And, and I've always wanted to, to be the most rational person I could be. And I, I, as you had mentioned to me earlier about, you know, early on, in the church and, and my activities, I never questioned early on but, but as I began to see more and to learn more, and to have different experiences, I, I, questioned deeply.
Story_ID: 637170
Speaker 1: Now, at the same time, now, at, in high school did you, did they have like the normal, I mean, the usual high school clubs and that sort of thing at, at Nashville Christian (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At Nashville Christian Institute [Nashville, Tennessee]?  Yeah, I was, I was president of the student council, we had that, I was president of the student council.
Speaker 1: Okay. And did they have high school sports and, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played basketball at Nashville Christian Institute, sure did.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what, what were your grades like when you got ready to graduate?
Speaker 2: I had excellent grades. I was a straight A student. I was the salutatorian of the, of the high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I, I, I, I, I should have been probably the valedictorian but I am also, I also started very early with my questioning of, I, I have questioned authority quite a lot. And I got into trouble by completing my exam in, in geometry, trigonometry, I completed it before the time allotted and, and, and gave my paper in and walked out of the class and the, the teacher said, "Come back and just sit here," and I said, "I refuse to sit there." And so, the principal said, "Okay, I'm giving you an F for this, this grade," so it moved me down from valedictorian to salutatorian (unclear).
Speaker 1: Is there--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) is there more to that story than, than just that simple, I mean, did you have, had you had a problem with--
Speaker 2: No, with the teacher?
Speaker 1: --the teacher?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I was just, I was just the first one to finish the exam and I finished the exam, I think he felt like the exam was, he wanted people to think it was a harder exam than it was and he just, you know, I mean, it was a hour allotted for it, I finished it in twenty minutes and I turned my paper in and was walking out and he said, "Come back." I refused to come back, he went to the principal, the principal said, you know, "If you didn't, don't go back--," I mean, you know, "I'm gonna have to give you an F for the, for that class even though," you know, "you--whatever you made," so that's what they did.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: That was about, I mean, that was maybe one of, that was my second sort of encounter with that kind of thing. The other was my questioning of, of, of, of, of Keeble [Marshall Keeble] and other people about the, the Bible, you know, and trying to understand the, the meaning of these things and so on. And, and then, of course, this comes up as a part of a pattern that would become a part of my, my history.
Story_ID: 637171
Speaker 1: Is there any influence that you had that, that--something you read or something you saw on the movies or some conversation you had with somebody that that really like triggered a questioning of the Bible?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I think that comes not in my, it, it comes later in my college years [at Southwestern Christian College, Terrell, Texas] rather than in my high school years [at Nashville Christian Institute, Nashville, Tennessee]. It's in my college years that I basically read myself out of the whole Christian experience--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so forth, yeah.
Speaker 1: But in high school you just felt like gut level it just had to be, it was, (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, absolutely, that something had to be wrong here. I mean, there's a, there's a great contradiction I mean in terms of what people say and what they do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you, okay. Is that basically in reference to the--
Speaker 2: To the racist, racist society basically.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, racism in the society. I mean, we're, you know, people say we're a Christian nation and we do this and that but the Christians are the ones who lynched the black people. They're the ones who segregated the society and so forth. Then people say well, you know, they're not practicing Christianity like it should be. Well then they say that about all kinds of ideas. I mean, the only way you can know them is by what they do.
Story_ID: 637172
Speaker 1: So, when you're on the verge of graduation did you have counseling about where you should go next?
Speaker 2: No, no, where, where I should go next had to do with what money I had.  And the, the, the money I had fortunately was three hundred dollars a semester for a school called Southwestern Christian College. This school was related to the Nashville Christian Institute [Nashville, Tennessee]. It's located in Terrell, Texas. And it, it was only three hundred dollars a semester. And I was also fortunate because one of the members of the church in Nashville [Tennessee] gave me a donation of three hundred dollars out of an insurance that she had, a payout that she received when her, when her husband passed. So, I had three hundred dollars and then I only had to get three hundred dollars more for the second semester, I could do my first year. And that included, if my memory is correct both my housing, my food, and as well as the academics.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, so was it one of the, okay, we need to pause here (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Southwestern Christian, yeah, Southwestern Christian had about two hundred students; it was small, two year school.
Story_ID: 637173
Speaker 1: You're about to enter Southwestern Christian College--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in Terrell, Texas?
Speaker 2: Terrell, Texas, that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. All right. So well, this is a, a Church of Christ college too, right?
Speaker 2: It's a church, it's a, it was Church of Christ, that was, that was the pattern. And it was, it had been started by one of the other preachers influenced by the gentleman by the name of G.P. Bowser, and Bowser, B-O-W-S-E-R [George Philip Bowser]. Bowser had created a higher educational institution so that once you left Keeble's school you went to Bowser's school, basically is what it was. And at this school, I also did pretty well until I was, I was suspended. I was actually put out of the school--
Speaker 1: Well, what happened?
Speaker 2: --the second year.
Speaker 1: Well, first, let's go to the first, first year. First (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the first year was fine, the first year was fine. I, I did very well, I was a student leader. I was voted most likely to succeed. I was quite, quite active in, in the school. And, and, and also, and did pretty well academically even in the second year but the second year two weeks before the graduation the president of the, and let me just back up and give you one other bit of information which people should know for the record, is that at Nashville Christian Institute [Nashville, Tennessee] there was a, a black principal his name was Otis Boatwright most of the time I was there. And then there was Marshall Keeble the president but Marshall Keeble eventually retired but he was still the founder of the school so he had an office in that school but the president was a white man at Nashville Christian Institute for the last year or two when I was in high school. At Southwestern Christian College it was a black school [HBCU] but it also had a white president. And the president of Southwestern got up to give a speech in which he was talking to the student body and the faculty and one of the African American men decided that he had to go to the bathroom so he raised his hand while the man was speaking and as the president of the college was speaking he didn't notice the man and ignored the man in the audience but the man kept raising his hand. So, eventually the white president stops his speech and he says, "That's what's wrong with you people, you can't hold yourselves, you wanna go to the bathroom, you shouldn't go to the bathroom, you should wait and just listen to what I have to say. And I'm not gonna give you permission to go." Well, I jump up and I say, "You have no right to do this. He can go to the bathroom if he wants to." I mean, and if he has to go to the bathroom he should go. It was a bizarre situation, I mean, the man should have just gone out but he wanted to get permission to go. So, I said, "He can go to the bathroom if he wants to and he should go and you have no right to talk to our people like that." So, at that moment the president says, "Well, you, I'm gonna ask the dean of the college to dismiss you from school." So, I got up and he told the dean, a man named Sams, says, Dean Roosevelt Sams said, "You know, I want you to dismiss him from school." So, I go down to the dean's office and the dean says to me, "Mr. Smith [HistoryMaker Molefi Kete Asante], you should never question the president. You cannot do that. You, it's not your business to question the president." I said, "But he was disrespecting black people, he was disrespecting, you know, the young man in the audience," he was just, so put me out of school. Said I have to sign this letter. Well, one thing I knew about the Church of Christ was that the board of directors of the school were black preachers who, who, who had great faith in me. They thought that I was the, gonna be the new preacher for the Church of Christ so boy, "Let's, you know, we, we gonna protect, we have to protect Asante." So, I called them all up and I told them what had happened. I said, you know, I've, I've been put out of, out of Southwestern, and, you know, graduation is in two weeks. Well, they got on the phone and when they got through with the president I was back in school the next week. I was back in school and graduated from Southwestern Christian with my A.A. degree.
Story_ID: 637174
Speaker 1: So, then I went to ano- I went, I went to another Church of Christ school, Oklahoma Christian [Oklahoma Christian College; Oklahoma Christian University] in 1963.
Speaker 2: Now, where is this one in--
Speaker 1: Oklahoma City [Oklahoma].
Speaker 2: Okay. In OK City.
Speaker 1: That's, that was my four year school, Oklahoma City. I was the first black student to enter Oklahoma Christian College in 1963, and in 1964 I was the first one to, to graduate. There was, there was a, a black student who entered with me in basket- who was a basketball player, his name was William Muncy but he did not finish. So, that was, and that was uneventful basically those two years. I mean, there were, there were, they, they were just finishing college. And, and, of course, it's finishing college in a racist environment but, but, but I finished and this was--
Speaker 2: So, so you, you were the first black student there?
Speaker 1: First black student, Oklahoma--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Christian College.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: And the, and, and well, I should say Muncy and I went in the same but I was the only one, the first one to graduate and there were only two, he and I, that was it. So, yeah, that was it.
Speaker 2: Now, what was your major?
Speaker 1: My major was communications, speech.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Speech communication.
Speaker 2: And the, now, and your, your goal was now, now, I know at one time you thought you were, you were gonna be a, a great minister (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --for the church?
Speaker 1: Absolutely. And, and I think that probably this, that, by the time I'm a senior in college that goal is waning. I wanna be a writer. And I published my first book which is called the rhetoric, no, no which is called 'The Break of Dawn' [Arthur L. Smith], it's a book of poetry that was published by a company that was actually what you would call today a vanity press, you know.
Speaker 2: So, 'Break of Dawn' and that's--
Speaker 1: 'Break of Dawn.' It was published by Dorrance [Dorrance Publishing Company, Inc.], D-O-R-R-A-N-C-E. It was a Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] company actually, Dorrance. They were the people I think who owned Campbell's Soup [Campbell Soup Company] but they, they eventually, they had a, they were publishing poets. And my book 'Break of Dawn' was a book of poetry that it came out in the Dorrance series.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now, this is, you, you graduated from Oklahoma Christian College--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --in 19 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In 1964.
Speaker 2: Okay. That's what I thought.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: And then I went to Pepperdine [George Pepperdine College; Pepperdine University, Malibu, California], which is another Church of Christ school but it's much more liberal than any of the other two, other three, yeah.
Story_ID: 637175
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964] was really important in the Civil Rights Movement and the political--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --climate of the country because of the summer of '64 [1964] and the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --convention [1964 Democratic National Convention, Atlantic City, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: And the death of, of the president earlier.
Speaker 1: Oh, six--the fall of '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right. So, it was all, a lot of stuff was going on. In fact, that's why my, my book, 'The Break of Dawn' [Arthur L. Smith] really was a book expressing all of that. It was a, a poetic discussion of the, of the struggle, the civil rights struggle. I mean, and it was, it was, it was received by the so called liberals of the college [Oklahoma Christian College; Oklahoma Christian University, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] okay and other people sort of thought I was a militant as they would say back in those days.
Speaker 1: What was your reaction to the assassination of JFK [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy]?
Speaker 2: My, my reaction was really one of tremendous sadness. And it was, and the reason for it was because Billie Sol Estes had been deeply entrenched in the Democratic Party and when I was, the, the two years earlier before the death of President Kennedy, I, I had been going to the trials, to the court, for Billie Sol Estes, I was one of the people who was with his family and, you know, I knew his wife, Patsy [Patsy Howe Estes], and their kids and I was quite active in that. And so there was, there had been some glimmer of hope that perhaps, you know, Kennedy would, would come to Texas even and, and, and, and do something and there would be a whole different reaction to Billie Sol Estes and his situation. But so, so, so there was a disappointment there in that, in the death of, of Kennedy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, had you begun to listen to Malcolm X in these days?
Speaker 2: No, no, I don't think so. I think I began to listen to Malcolm when I went, came to, I think I came to him late, like I, I was a King man, I was a Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] person at that time. And I, I, I came to, to Malcolm probably later in '64 [1964] when I went to California.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, so 'Break of Dawn' is published in '64 [1964] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.

Speaker 1: I just, there must be a story from Oklahoma Christian College [Oklahoma Christian University, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] of you being the first black, if somebody would tell me that Molefi Asante [HistoryMaker Molefi Kete Asante] was the first black in Oklahoma Christian College and he went through and nothing happened (laughter) I would think  that--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, yeah, things happened but, but, let's put it this way, the, the, the things that were, the things that happened were a part of that whole culture. I mean, first of all, you have a, you have a black student at Oklahoma Christian who is, who is bright, who is intelligent, the first thing that I recognize is that the, these students know things 'cause this is the first time I'm in an environment that's predominantly white. The, the students know things that I don't know. They've read J.D. Salinger, I had never heard of J.D. Salinger, you know, 'Catcher in the Rye' ['The Catcher in the Rye'], I didn't know nothing about that but I would hear all these discussions. And yet I was supposed to be very, very bright and intelligent. So, I had to study harder but beyond that there was also this criticism of my accent because I had the southern accent, southern black accent. I dropped the Gs which I still do on the end of jargons. And I, I said running and walking instead of walking and, and, and jumping and so and so. It, it, it those, I did have discussions with professors about that. There was a, there was a, a case where I was talking to a, a white student, white female student and the president or vice president let me know that black, nature is that black birds deal with black birds, blue birds talk to blue birds and so and so. That was a part of the South, the Oklahoma Christian experience, so I gravitated towards Langston University [Langston, Oklahoma] which was not far from us, I mean, maybe eighteen miles or so [sic.]. Langston was close to us, I had a car. I would go to Langston. Central State [Central State College; University of Central Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] was three miles away from my campus. So, there were black students at Langston, black students at Central State and, and Oklahoma [University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma] and that in, in a sense gave me a social outlet which I didn't have at Oklahoma Christian.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that, that explains (unclear)
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Yeah, it was a, it was, yeah, it was, it was tough, yeah, it was tough. And, and, in fact, to, to show you how tough it been I graduated in '64 [1964] and it is now 2012, I have never been back, I've never been on the campus, I've never been to Oklahoma City since then, it was that tough in Oklahoma for me. So, that gives you a, sort of a sense of it.

Speaker 1: Now, I have a note here that you met a Nigerian student there, was this was where you met him?
Speaker 2: I met the Nigerian student at, at Southwestern Christian College [Terrell, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Essien Essien.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Essien Essien was the first continental African I ever met and he was a man who challenged most of the ideas that I held about Africans. I mean, you know, I wanted to know did Africans have cars? Do they have telephones? Do they have stoves in their house? Because all the stuff I had heard about Africans they didn't have any of this. And, of course, he debunked everything. He, you know, and he gave me a whole new vision about, about Africa and about African people.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So, he, all right. So, that, that was at Southwestern before Oklahoma (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that was at Southwestern, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and in fact, I, as I left Oklahoma Christian [Oklahoma Christian College; Oklahoma Christian University, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], I went to Los Angeles [California] he was there, he was a, he, he became a lab technician and then eventually a medical doctor. And, and he, he had gravitated to Los Angeles and I--basically I had a girlfriend in California so I went there and I met up with him again so, so he was a big influence.
Story_ID: 637178
Speaker 1: So, you graduated in '64 [1964] and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and now, how did you hook up the UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], I mean, how, how was that?
Speaker 2: Well, first I went to Pepperdine [George Pepperdine College; Pepperdine University, Malibu, California].
Speaker 1: Oh right, went to Pepperdine (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to Pepperdine for the master's degree. I went to Pepperdine because my girlfriend was at that time, she had graduated from Pepperdine and I decided that I would go to Pepperdine and do a master's. And I got a scholarship, a, a academic scholarship to Pepperdine but it didn't pay all my bills because Pepperdine was considered an expensive school so, I, I worked as a dishwasher, you know, just trying to make ends meet. And then I also for a time being decided that, you know, I really needed to do something other than just wash dishes. So, I, I, I, I preached for a small church in Barstow, California. On the weekends I would drive a hundred and twenty miles or so in the desert, preach at this black church in Barstow in the desert and go back. But they would, they would basically give me enough money to, to pay my tuition and, and basically help me live. So, that was, that was the, sort of the beginning of the end of my whole church experience but it, it was leading up to it. So, I was there for a year. I, I did a master's degree, it took me a year to do it. And I went full time through summer school and everything, finished the master's thesis, finished that school and entered UCLA in January of '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Now, what, what was your thesis for your master's?
Speaker 2: My thesis was on Marshall Keeble. It was on the persuasive eloquence of Marshall Keeble.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Was this the first time anyone had written about him?
Speaker 2: First dissertation on Marshall Keeble.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, he had--
Speaker 2: The first.
Speaker 1: --he, he was retired at this time? Was--
Speaker 2: Yes, he was retired.
Speaker 1: --was he still alive?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was retired by this time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 637179
Speaker 1: So now UC--is, is there any, well, are there any professors or any incidents at Pepperdine [George Pepperdine College; Pepperdine University, Malibu, California] that that changed your, your consciousness at all or, or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, at Pepperdine I had only one professor of note and that was Fred Casmir [Fred L. Casmir], who was, who had been a Nazi actually. Fred Casmir had been one of Hitler's Youth [Hitler Youth] and he had gotten a scholarship in the late '40s [1940s] to study at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] and he studied in communication and he taught propaganda and persuasion at, at Pepperdine. So, so, and, and he was, he, he was a intellectual, he was a man who was quite interested in ideas, and he taught me a lot about persuasion. So, I was, I would think that in terms of my communication work and I did, I've done I think seventeen books in the field of communication, in, in terms of my communication work, one of the sparkplugs for that was, was, was Frederick Casmir.

Speaker 1: So, UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] now in 1968?
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966].
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966], okay.  All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I finished in '68 [1968] but--
Speaker 1: Oh, finished in '68 [1968], all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, but, but what happened at UCLA was I, I had wanted to go to USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] but I couldn't go to USC because my scores, my, my scores were not high enough.  My, my, my, my scores were skewed. I was considered near genius on the, on the, on the literary and literature and language arts and all of that side but on the math I was considered near imbecile. So, it was like wait a minute, USC said, we, we don't, we, we can't, you can't get in here. But I'd also applied to UCLA but what they were interested in was your portfolio. Well, at Oklahoma Christian [Oklahoma Christian College; Oklahoma Christian University, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] I'd also been the president of the Young Democrats, I'd also marched with Diane Nash in Nashville [Tennessee], I had traveled to Canada, I had written a book of poetry ['The Break of Dawn,' Arthur L. Smith], there were many things that UCLA saw and then I had a straight A average in terms of my grade point average so UCLA admitted me to the communication department. So, that's why I went to UCLA. And I'm happy I did, I mean, I, I, you know, but I was, but since USC was close to where I was living I thought that it would be a nice progression to go from Pepperdine [George Pepperdine College; Pepperdine University, Malibu, California] to USC.
Story_ID: 637181
Speaker 1: Now, UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] in 1966 sounds like just, I'm searching my mind, I, I think it was a pretty exciting place then for a black (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The best, the best place for, I don't know of a better university for black people at that time in terms of what we felt was possible. Now, you, you had, we had a, a strong tradition at UCLA of, because we had at least particular the, the male leaders like Ralph Bunche, and Rafer Johnson, Arthur Ashe, and Jackie Robinson, all those people had been through there. And there was a, there was a, a buzz always at UCLA that African Americans if they wanted to and they often wanted to, could run for political office as students, and, and be elected and that was always what happened when I was there. We had a black president of the student body, this was just the students were quite organized. We were organized around the voter registration movement in, in Mississippi. And I was elected president of the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] chapter at UCLA. This is after a, after a takeover. One of the things that I got involved in was the, the movement and getting involved in the movement at UCLA may have been considered safe but it was also quite active. I mean, it was where we marched in to SNCC's office at UCLA or the meeting and the black students took over the meeting and said okay, we're gonna elect our own president and I was elected the president and ran the organization for, until I graduated from UCLA. But at the same time we had another organization called Harambee and that organization was agitating for black studies. So, I was engaged in, in all of those organizations. There was a lady who was in charge of a, a program for high school students coming to UCLA named Vivian Gordon [Vivian Verdell Gordon], she became a professor later and she's passed away now. Dr. Vivian Gordon who had a great influence on me at UCLA because she would always bring me back to my studies because I was being distracted by too many incidents. I mean, if, you know, Eldridge Cleaver came to town, then I was listening to Eldridge Cleaver rather than going to class. I mean, so this was true with, with artists, with, with militant speakers, with all kinds of people, I was having a wonderful education outside of the (laughter) classroom until Vivian just pulled my coattails and said, you know, look, you know, we really want, we need you to, you finish, to get out of here and so forth so that's when I went, I decided to, you know, concentrate on my studies. So, she was important but--
Story_ID: 637182
Speaker 1: But this is a time that, of course, I am, I, I, I, I learn about Malcolm [Malcolm X]. Of course, Malcolm, I had learned about Malcolm in Pepperdine [George Pepperdine College; Pepperdine University, Malibu, California] but I learned after his death 'cause he died in '65 [1965], he died in '65 [1965]. In '66 [1966] when I come and let, let me back up 'cause there's another story here. In six--I, I went to, when I went to California to go to Pepperdine I ended up in the midst of the riot of, of the, the, the rebellion, I should call it, the rebellion in Watts [Los Angeles, California]. I lived in, on 53rd [Street] between Vermont [Avenue] and Hoover [Street].  And in the midst of living there, right in that heart, that's up a ways from a 103rd Street where you would say the center of Watts was at that time, but it was still the South Central region [Los Angeles, California], so I was deeply engaged in, you know, what was going on in that whole, whole period and the, the shootings and the deaths and the tanks in the streets and so forth. And this in line with and keeping with the fact that Malcolm had died earlier, Malcolm's death, the, the, the Watts uprising, all sort of came together to, to push my consciousness to the point that by the time in, in '66 [1966] when I'm, January of '66 [1966] when I'm entering UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], I am really on edge about the possibility of revolution in America. In fact, I believed that we were really on the verge of a revolution (laughter) this was, this was the youth- youthful thinking but we were on the, there were a lot of us who believed that. And, and I, so, so, Malcolm had had an impact but that impact was, was one that was not significant until now and that's after his death. So, it was after his death that I think it becomes more. And I, I had met him briefly in Washington [D.C.] at the Florida Grill [Florida Avenue Grill] which is a little restaurant not far from Howard University [Washington, D.C.], actually with Billie Sol Estes because Billie Sol Estes had gone to meet him and he wanted me to, to, to be there in Washington as well. But, but, but, but that was brief. And now in '66 [1966] I'm a student at UCLA, I'm engaged with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC], I'm, I'm engaged with the Harambee, and I am also a member of something else which I haven't written about much but because I was a student leader the chancellor of the university, all student leaders if you were like on the board of governors or you're the president on the board of governors, other, you can, you become a part of what they call the Order of the Golden Bruin. So, I was, I was in the Order of the Golden Bruin. The Order of the Golden Bruin was supposedly this invisible cabinet of chancellor, first, Murphy [Franklin David Murphy] but then eventually Charles Young [Charles E. Young] became the chancellor. In fact, I just saw him a couple of years ago. But, but, the, the, the, the key to all of this I think for me was that I was moving further and further toward finding and discovering my own voice. And so, by the time I graduate in '68 [1968] from UCLA it had been a fast move through the Ph.D. program, I, I, I graduate and I get a job at, I get a job at Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana] in communication.
Story_ID: 637183
Speaker 1: While you're there though, now several things, now, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is assassinated while you're there, right? Is that, is that true?
Speaker 2: Yep, that's right, Dr. King is assassinated in sixty--
Speaker 1: Eight [1968], yeah, April 4th of '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: No, he, that's when, that's before I left UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I left in July or August.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Yeah, but he's, yeah, that's the other thing, you're right. That's the other thing at UCLA because when he is assassinated, at UCLA we had many, many discussions about what the future of the country would be. And I met with a number of black students who, some of them, I, I, may still be in prison but who were engaged in trying to figure out how, how we need to move as black people and how we need to protect ourselves, and some people took over college administrations at Cal State Northridge [California State University, Northridge, Northridge, California] and other places. (Background noise) UCLA was, was very agreeable to the idea of creating institutes for American culture. And, and a part of that was to create the Center for African American Studies [Afro American Studies Center; Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies, Los Angeles, California].
Story_ID: 637184
Speaker 1: All right. Now, what was the, you were on campus when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated in April of '68 [1968], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now what was the, what happened that day? Do you remember what you were doing and (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, when I heard about it I was walking from the parking lot actually toward Campbell Hall, and Campbell Hall was later to be the place where the Center for African American Studies [Afro American Studies Center; Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies] was established and it was also the place that where there was a shootout happening in, in January of 1969. But, I, I went ahead and worked a lot with the people trying to open up the university. The university responded by finally agreeing that there should be a center for African American studies, a center for Native American studies, center for Chicano studies, and a center for Asian American studies. And we, I left UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] in the, in the summer, late summer of, of that, of that year, of '68 [1968] to go to Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana] to teach. And when I was at, while I was at Purdue the university, UCLA, had a big program to bring black faculty to UCLA and they brought forty-one or forty-two professors back to UCLA, many of us had been people who had got our Ph.D.'s at UCLA. The argument was if they're good enough to go to Purdue or Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] or Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and we grad- we, we created them why do we give our students away, we don't have any black faculty, let's bring them back. So, I was one of the ones that they decided to bring back to UCLA. So, I go back to UCLA in July of 1969, this is after the shootout in January. So, I, I basically became a, a compromise candidate between the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] and the US Organization [The Organization Us] for, for directing the institute because, the center, because part of the Center for African American Studies it was called African, Afro American Studies Center, I, I changed the name when I was there, but it, it was discussion about the direction and the mission of that center that caused the shootout in the first place. So I, I was sort of able to bring those two sides together.
Story_ID: 637185
Speaker 1: I would just go back a second 'cause I didn't ask you what--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --about your dissertation.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the--
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: --yeah, the, the Rhetic- the, the 'Rhetoric of Black Revolution' [Arthur L. Smith], right?
Speaker 2: Well, the 'Rhetoric of Black Revolution' was the book that I wrote at the same time I was writing my dissertation. My dissertation was called the agitational rhetoric of Samuel Adams during the American Revolution ['Samuel Adams' Agitational Rhetoric of Revolution,' Arthur L. Smith]. So, what I did was to analyze all the newspaper articles that he had written in The Boston Gazette [The Boston Gazette and Country Journal] to show what were the revolutionary elements that occurred in those writings and, and it, and, and, and the basic conclusion is that black people have far more grievances than, than the Americans had when they went to revolutionary war against the British. But, but and so that's, so as I was writing that I was also writing the book the 'Rhetoric of Black Revolution' which became my first real book.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. And this is the one you said that the, that the Ghanaians had removed from (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, they had, they, they, they had. I went in asking for it, do you have it, they have it but it, but, and they had bound it I guess in hardcover because on the paperback version you, it had that--my picture but the guy said I thought it was an Englishman.
Story_ID: 637186
Speaker 1: Now, this is, you know, looking at the chapters somebody evinced the chapters for us here and I'm looking at 'em. They, they, they sound uncharacteristic, unlike, I mean, yeah, uncharacteristically Molefi Asante [HistoryMaker Molefi Kete Asante].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In terms of how they are phrased.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It sounds as if someone's writing about us from the outside.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Like what, what, like give me an example like.
Speaker 1: Well, "Samples of Revolutionary Rhetoric" ["Samples of Revolutionary Rhetoric: Slavery and the Irish"], "Origins of Revolutionary Themes"--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --"Nature of the, the Black Audience" ["Nature of the Black Audience"], you know, that type of--
Speaker 2: Right. I was writing for a white audience, yes. I was writing for a white audience, mainly, you're right. That was a, that was a, the whole process of my own development. I'm, I'm the first to admit that I, I had a very good white boy's education through those, that was the whole process of education in communication at the time. It would only be later that I would emerge and develop the Afrocentric paradigm which would be in the 19--the late '70s [1970s] and, and, and, I mean, that's almost ten or eleven years later than this book ['Rhetoric of Black Revolution,' Arthur L. Smith].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I just wanna point that out.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a good point, that's a good point.
Speaker 1: Seeing, you know--
Speaker 2: You're right, you're very right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in terms of what you're known for it's not, it's not the same.
Speaker 2: Yes, you're very right.
Story_ID: 637187
Speaker 1: Back at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --now, how did you, did you, did you sit down with the Panthers [Black Panther Party] and the US Organization [The Organization Us] and try to mediate these things 'cause I know people were going to jail and all kinds of, you know, around this--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) incident but, but was it, did you have, were you able to do--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, I, I think that's part of why, I mean, to be honest with you, there was at UCLA a man by the name of Charles Z. Wilson, C.Z. Wilson, who was a black man who you, you may have already interviewed but if not he should have been. He's a, he's a major player in, in education, higher education in many ways. Charles Z. Wilson was the head of the department of economics at SUNY Binghamton [State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, New York], this was back in the '60s [1960s]. I mean, this was very rare for a black man, he had come out of Mississippi, gone to school in Switzerland, and UCLA hired him as a administration apprentice and he becomes the vice chancellor, academic, the, the assistant vice chancellor or associate vice chancellor. And then he becomes famous for bringing in these forty-two black faculty members, creating this program that, that gives you [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis, myself, James Pitts, Berky Nelson [H. Viscount "Berky" Nelson], many other people who have gone on to be very, very well known in their fields. So, C.Z. is Charles Young's [Charles E. Young] sort of man in charge of all things where you're gonna need negotiation, mediation, because that's what he's skilled at. So, my degree in communication assisted me in getting the position as the first permanent director of the Center for African American Studies at UCLA [Afro American Studies Center; Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies, Los Angeles, California] because they felt like that somehow you got a degree in communications that gives you skills which it doesn't necessarily give you skills but that, you know, you know, you know things, that's true but there's some people who got degrees in communication who are not necessarily good communicators. But at any rate, they bring me back and they say we're gonna give you a position in the communication department which I took a position in the communication department but we, communication department but we want you to direct the, the Center for African American Studies. I then have a meeting, actually, it was not a meeting that I provoked, it was a meeting that they, that the student organizations provoked. They came to my office from different sides and we had many discussions, many debates, many issues surrounded the institute because the university had given us a $150,000 a year, we thought that was a lot of money but they gave everybody, the Native Americans, Chicanos, Asian Americans, all us, a $150,000 a year. They paid our, our salaries and our staff but you got a $150,000 you can do a lot of things with, you can, you can sponsor research, you could travel and so forth. And so, what our institute had been doing before I became the permanent director, it had been supporting people in Algeria, we, we had a whole group of people that we were basically underwriting and not only were we supporting them but we were also having long distance phone calls between Algiers [Algeria] and Los Angeles [California], it was a big thing. So, we had to figure out how to keep people on the payroll but within the legal structure of the university, so that was one of my big tasks. And then the other one was how to, how to praise people who were doing positive things and how to be strict on people who were basically doing negative things. So, we were able to, to, to bridge a lot of gaps. And it was great fortune for me not to have been in Los Angeles on January 19, 1969, because had I been there I would have been on one side or the other side. As it was, I came in and, and, and subsequently I became friends with [HistoryMaker] Maulana Karenga and with Bobby Seale so I am, and, and I'm still to this day friends to both of them. So, that's the, the, the history of that institute (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 637188
Speaker 1: I heard Maulana speak about this, and I've never talked to Bobby Seale--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but, but he, I think he indicates in his book that, that they never really had a big problem themselves as, as such (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you, you're perfectly right, I don't think so. And, in fact, yeah, I, I think the, the COINTELPRO operation [Counterintelligence Program] did a lot of damage to both of those groups. But in, in the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Journal of Black Studies that I edit, we had a big celebration here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. The SAGE publication company [SAGE Publishing] is the publisher of the Journal of Black Studies, so SAGE has a, had a twenty-five year celebration and the two people who came, two people who came to speak was Bobby Seale and [HistoryMaker] Maulana Karenga. So, and it was very interesting to see them interact at that gathering and there didn't seem to be any real problem to me between the two of them, they're both very generous and very, very brilliant people, so I was very pleased to see that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That they came together at the celebration of, of our journal (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 637189
Speaker 1: Do you have a sense, can you give us a sense of how real COINTELPRO [Counterintelligence Program], I mean, how it affe- we, we know it was real now--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but how it, 'cause people used to hint around in those days saying--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --well, you know, we're being spied on, or somebody's (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I used to think, I mean, I'm pretty sure I had some spies in my classes at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] but, but, but how real it was in terms of the impact on the organizations?
Speaker 1: Yeah, how did people really feel but did they really, did you have a sense that it was really going on or was it still just a rumor or, or when it, when it, when it actually (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I think it created a lot of paranoia. I think it was really going on. And I think that one of the things that people sometimes point to when they talk about Maulana [HistoryMaker Maulana Karenga], is the whole issue around the, the so called torture of the, these, these women. And I think that that had a lot to do with an attempt on the part of a young people's organization to be able to ascertain whether or not people were, were with the legal authorities or were they truly with the organization and it was almost like an initiation. And I think that that is, is turned, in the, in the, was, was at that time turned in the press and all the thing about torture but it was a way that black people trying to figure out how do we tell who is with us and who is not with us really, and the best way to do is rather see how much you're willing to take in support of your, the cause of your people. And so, I think it was real in the sense that it had a big impact in terms of how people felt. On the side of the, the Panthers [Black Panther Party], I think the Panthers, really believed that particularly after the shooting that the US Organization [The Organization Us] was out to get them because that's what the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] had said and the FBI put this information everywhere. I mean, everybody had this information telling one group that, you know, we're gonna get you and another group we're gonna get you, and so people are fighting among themselves.
Speaker 1: Okay. I just wanted to--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --have a sense of that.
Story_ID: 637190
Speaker 1: Now, did you start the journal when you, you, you started the journal (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Journal of Black Studies was actually co-founded, I would put it that way. Robert Singleton who had been a graduate student at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] in the economics department had been the interim director while he was a student of the Center for African American Studies [Afro American Studies Center; Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies] before I was hired to run it because they wanted a faculty member to run it and he was a graduate student so they brought me back to run it. And, and for me also I had my first, the book 'Rhetoric of Black Revolution' [Arthur L. Smith] was coming out and people said okay this guy should run this program. But what Singleton did, which was a great achievement, was that he, he asked me, he said that, "Molefi [HistoryMaker Molefi Kete Asante], since you write, why don't we edit a journal? And you'll be the editor and I'll be the chair of the board," and, and we agreed. We, we created this idea and we decided well, now what do we do with it? We go to the social science publisher that's just getting started, we didn't know they were just getting started but we, well, we knew they were just getting started but we didn't how big they would become and that was SAGE Publications [SAGE Publishing], they had like three journals. And we went over to SAGE, talked to them, they were in Beverly Hills [California], they agreed, they said to me, we, we don't mind you being the editor and that's, that's it. And then after that that was the story so I've edited for more than forty years.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, when did it start? What was the year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969], okay.
Story_ID: 637191
Speaker 1: What were some of the other highlights of being, you know, at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]? You, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I--
Speaker 1: --were there until, until when?
Speaker 2: Until 1973. I left in '73 [1973] to go to Buffalo [New York] to run the Department of Communication at Buffalo [State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York]. The, the highlights we created the, a, a master's program at UCLA in African American studies. And we created a library at UCLA, a African American library, which still exists today. We were, we were, I mean, we had some failures. I mean, we did not, we were not able to create a department, which is much more powerful than a center [Afro American Studies Center; Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies, Los Angeles, California], because it can hire faculty and it can, it has its own space and budgets and so on, and it doesn't have to rely on other departments for its master's program, you can do it through the department. And so, those, those were the, our, our failures. But it was a good, it was a good time. I mean, I, I, I think it was a very useful and, and very positive time.
Speaker 1: Did the programs start meeting together early on, 'cause these are some of the first black studies programs and cultural centers and because I, I know one, you know, recently, I know Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure, sure.
Speaker 1: --was going through changes. The African studies department--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --was fighting for its original position--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --where they reported directly to the president--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: --rather than to a department head.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they see the department reporting is weakening their program--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in a lot of ways. So, there are so many different models of how it was done (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, well, the thing is that the Cornell program is actually a hybrid. In the university you either have what they call centers, research centers, or you have departments. And departments normally report to a, a, a dean and the dean reports to the president's office. In a model of a center or institute, the institute reports directly to the president's office. Now, the situation at Cornell is that they had a, a institute, a research institute with, with a department with courses, with their own courses and their own faculty and staff, so they were sort of like a department but not like a department because they reported directly to the president. All the other departments are saying this is unfair, you're a department and if you're a department you should be reporting to the dean not directly to the president's office that's part of the problem. At UCLA  they would never allow us to have that that's why I say it was a failure because we reported directly to the chancellor's office, the president's office but, but, but we never could have a, a slew of courses and a, and a, and a group of faculty members attached directly to our center because that would then change the nature of the organization. So, I, I'm not sure why universities do this but that's the issue at Cornell. And at UCLA they kept the centers and the institutes separate from the departments and I think Cornell wants to do that now but they, they agreed to early on in the late '60s [1960s] and early '70s [1970s], they agreed to this model where they would have a research center, but they will also make that research center a department.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: There are so many different models of it and how it--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and what students were able to get on one campus--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --or another--
Story_ID: 637192
Speaker 1: Do you think there's a ideal model for how this should be done on a university campus?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do. Yeah, sure. I mean, I, you know, I, you know, as, you know, I, later on, I just want to get it in the chronology, I created the first Ph.D. program in African American studies anywhere in the world and it was created here at Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], but the idea behind it was that you should have a, a, a terminal degree but there's no reason why we should not have a school of African studies. And a school of African studies that would have a, a diaspora aspect or continental aspect or, you know. And you could even do a, a Caribbean studies, North American, you don't have to say diaspora you just say Caribbean, South American, North American, and continental studies and then you can look at it across all kinds of interests, music, art, literature, science, and so forth. You could have a school, a real school but it is not conceivable in a, in a white institution in America, that will never happen. It could only happen in an African institution that was Afrocentric but it does not, it, it is not even conceivable in the American situation even though I tried, I tried to conceive it because and the way I tried to approach it was that most departments of African American studies were limited to four and five or six faculty members and my idea was why shouldn't there be fifty faculty members in an African American studies department? What, what, what limits, what makes this limitation? The limitation is made by white deans. They say we're not gonna give you anymore lines. You've got five, that's all you need. And so, so you cannot expand and create the kind of intellectual environment that you need. You really need your own college. You need your own institute to do that you see.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I just thought I'd ask that, maybe--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I should have waited until (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, that's fine, that's good.
Story_ID: 637193
Speaker 1: Now what caused you to leave UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] to go to SUNY Buffalo [State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York]?
Speaker 2: It was really a economic situation really. I just thought that, I mean, anybody was offering me ten thousand dollars more than I was paid at UCLA that, that's a good job. And the SUNY System [State University of New York System] was at that time really flourishing and the UC system [University of California] was dying, I thought because Reagan [Ronald Wilson Reagan] became governor and the system was really under a lot of pressure, they cut out a lot of things, they, they fired people, they closed down maintenance departments, and UCLA was not becoming what it was and so I said, you know, what, the best time is to get out of here and go to where people are doing something. And the State University of New York seemed to be the place and Buffalo was their most distinguished university. So, I said if I go to New York State and, and go to the most distinguished university in the New York system I, I, I'm, I'll be doing okay. So, I went there as the, the head of the communication department [Department of Communication] but I also took with me the Journal of Black Studies and I eventually ended up chairing both departments, the black studies department and the communication department for about a couple of years.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, you were a part of or helped form, I don't know which or maybe both, some other, another institution; right? 'Cause I know, you, weren't you a part of the Ujima African market and the, the organization around that in, in Buffalo [New York] too?
Speaker 2: The, the, the, you know, I was involved with that but I was involved in Buffalo with almost every black organization you could think of including the Center for Positive Thought which was a organization that taught classes, it was also a dance institute, it had a museum. I started a museum of African and African American antiquities. It, it was, yeah, so I was involved in almost every black group in Buffalo; I was quite active in that city.
Story_ID: 637194
Speaker 1: How did you like being in Buffalo [New York]?
Speaker 2: You know, I, when I reflect on Buffalo, Buffalo was quite peaceful. You know, Buffalo is a kind of city where somebody who's, who's reflective and you wanna write, I, I wrote a lot in Buffalo and because the snow, you know, you, you stay inside, the storms are raging, you know, the wind's blowing, the snow, fifty miles an hour, and you can't see anything, you stay inside by a fire and you write and you, so, so I enjoyed it, in the summertime you enjoy the beauty of the summer. So, it was, it was not bad to me to be honest with you, I mean it was a, it was, it was too cold later, it just got too cold and to, too gloomy but, but the city, I, I think Buffalo is a, a wonderful city. I, I don't have much against Buffalo.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, this is, you, you arrived there in 1976?
Speaker 2: Seventy-three [1973].
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. I got this (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I arrived in Buffalo.
Speaker 1: Okay. I got, 19- (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I, I left Buffalo in, to come here [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in '84 [1984].
Story_ID: 637195
Speaker 1: It says here for a while you were a visiting professor at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, twice I've been a visiting professor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --at Howard. And I have been visiting professor at Florida State [Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida]. And, and then, of course, I spent a year in Zimbabwe at the Institute of Mass Communication [Zimbabwe Institute of Mass Communication, Harare, Zimbabwe].
Speaker 1: Now, when, what, what year was that?
Speaker 2: That was in 1980 to '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Now, this is important.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Let's see. So, okay, so within the span of the time in Buffalo [New York] that's like nine, nine, nine years I think (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eleven, was it nine years?
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973] to '84 [1984]--
Speaker 2: Oh, eleven years.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it's eleven years.
Speaker 2: Eleven years.
Speaker 1: My math is backwards (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, eleven, that's all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Eleven years in Buffalo.
Story_ID: 637196
Speaker 1: Well, who, who was on the faculty there with you in, in Buffalo and who were some of the people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, in Buffalo [New York], Buffalo had, let's say it had some good people, it had some people who had passed through. Kofi Lomotey who became president of a university had been at Buffalo [State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York]. We had Chinweizu who wrote the book 'The West and the Rest of Us' ['The West and the Rest of Us: White Predators, Black Slavers and the African Elite'], had been there. [HistoryMaker] Ishmael Reed had been through there. It was there were, there were a number of outstanding people and who had been in and out of Buffalo, so.
Speaker 1: So, you said, I, I missed somebody. Ishmael Reed?
Speaker 2: Ishmael Reed.
Speaker 1: Kofi Lomotey.
Speaker 2: Kofi Lomotey, Mwalimu Shujaa [Mwalimu J. Shujaa].
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Chinweizu, C-H-I-N-W-E-I-Z-U.
Speaker 1: Now, some of these you may have to stop and just kind of chew on some of these people 'cause they are, these are, Ishmael Reed is a, you know, he's really a, I think most people would know who he is.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  But it, but, but, but Kofi Lomotey was, is, is, is actually now been president of two black schools, Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and Fort Valley State University [Fort Valley, Georgia] and also three actually, no, well, no, at Medgar Evers [Medgar Evers College, Brooklyn, New York] he was I think provost. And then Mwalimu Shujaa is a professor who's been well known in education, write books on education and schooling. And Chinweizu is the major Nigerian provocative author of books like 'The West and the Rest of Us' and books on Arabs and African conflicts and so forth. They were--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then there were, there were many, several other people I--
Speaker 1: I know--
Speaker 2: --if I reflect on it there were many other people in Buffalo.
Speaker 1: Well, Lomotey and Shujaa are both very active in the--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --the black independent school movement.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, that's right.  They were, they were in CB [National Council for Black Studies], that's right.
Speaker 1: And Kofi was the president for years and I think--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Shujaa was president.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: At some point.
Speaker 2: There you go.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, they're almost like running an alternate, you know--
Speaker 2: They, they--
Speaker 1: --an alternate, an alternative to the mainstream--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --even while they're working in it.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's their, that's their style.
Speaker 1: Okay. And Chinweizu was from Nigeria?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. But it was a long time in the U.S., um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, this is a, this is a powerful group of people here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's, it's a very, I mean, and I've missed some, I didn't even think of reflecting on who, who, who we had. We had Abdias do Nascimento. Nascimento was my, became a mentor of mine in Buffalo [New York] because I met him when I first got there in '73 [1973], and, and he just passed away a year ago. But he came to my sixty-fifth, celebration of my sixty-fifth birthday he came to it, to, to, to that celebration and he was like ninety-three years old or something. So, he's, he, he was a really big influence on me. And, of course, I had to be in Rio [Rio de Janeiro, Brazil] when they, you know, did the libation for him in his memorial. But he, he, he, so he was in Buffalo too and he, of course, was the puppeteer of all of us by bringing over, 'cause he had a huge house, like three stories, and he would bring everybody to his house for parties and, and discussion and debate and dance and, yeah, so.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) most celebrated writer of black Brazil (unclear) in a lot of ways (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, he is, he was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He was a really great man, yeah.
Story_ID: 637197
Speaker 1: Well, I guess, it's time to talk about the year in Zimbabwe now. This is 1981 and--
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty [1980] to '81 [1981], right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --had they, had the conflict been resolved by this point?
Speaker 2: The, the, actually it was '81 [1981] to '82 [1982], I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 2: The, the conflict is resolved, Lancaster House [Lancaster House Agreement] had already happened and Mugabe [Robert Mugabe] is in charge, they got rid of the guys who were like the in between guys. In, in fact, the reason that I knew about Zimbabwe was because in Buffalo [New York] I had been actively involved in working for the liberation of Zimbabwe for the ZANU [Zimbabwe African National Union] people. So, that was one of my, and ZAPU [Zimbabwe African People's Union] actually, I worked for both of them. And one of my graduate students who got a Ph.D. with me was a woman named Naomi Nhiwatiwa. And Naomi Nhiwatiwa was, was always moving between America and Mozambique, always between America and Mozambique. And finally when the war was over and the, and the government was formed they put her in the cabinet. And so, she said, you know, you gotta bring my, my professor to Zimbabwe, that's one of the reasons and so I was able to go to Zimbabwe and, and to work in the communication field. Actually, I was a trainer, I was the trainer in Zimbabwe of the first set of journalists to be trained after the independence because the white people left the newspapers, they left the television stations, the radio, and we had to train people, young people, to fill in those posts. And that and I was in charge of that diploma.
Speaker 1: Now, did, how did, were you impressed by what you saw or did, were you hopeful that things would, I know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To be honest with you, I, I thought that it would be possible for me to just live in Zimbabwe. I mean, I loved the country, it was beautiful, it was very, very dramatic in many ways, physically, one of the most beautiful places I had ever seen. And so, and, and, and the, this, the, the town of Harare [Zimbabwe] was pretty well developed at that time and it was quite modern. My, my wife and I lived in a pretty nice settlement. And I also felt like this was perhaps the vanguard of a African revolution that could happen throughout the continent if it's managed correctly. And so, I was quite happy initially. I was very, very pleased with what was going on in Zimbabwe.
Story_ID: 637198
Speaker 1: I don't know if this is backward, but Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], were you, you were at Howard in, was that in '80 [1980]? Yeah, that's in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I was in How-
Speaker 1: --that, that was before you went to (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, before, I went I was there and then when I came back I was there for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I came back after '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: So, so what was going at, at Howard? You, you worked for the School of Communications [John H. Johnson School of Communications; Cathy Hughes School of Communications]?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked for the School of Communication. In fact, I, that school has a very, I have a very close relationship with the school because one of my first Ph.D. students, if not my first, my first Ph.D. student is a woman named Melbourne Cummings [Melbourne Stenson Cummings]. And Mel, Melbourne Cummings was a professor and is still a professor at the School of Communication at Howard. And but beyond that while I was the head of the Department of Communication at SUNY Buffalo [State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York], the vice president of Howard came to recruit me to be the dean of Howard School of Communication and this was when [HistoryMaker] James Cheek was the president. And but the problem was that Cheek had fired about five deans and I had just come, I had just got to Buffalo with my job and my tenure and everything and for me to pick up from Buffalo and go to Howard when I know this man is (snaps fingers), you know, is firing deans left and right, and the dean that he had fired that I was replacing was a man by the name of Tony Brown who was a journalist himself. And Tony was a friend of mine from having interviewed me when I was head of the Center for African American Studies at UCLA [Afro American Studies Center; Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies, Los Angeles, California], I was one of the first people that he, he interviewed about black studies.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: So, so, so he was happy that, well, he's leaving but Molefi, but Asante [HistoryMaker Molefi Kete Asante] is coming that, that he thought that was a, a good thing but and, and Cheek thought it was a good thing, his vice president thought it was a good thing but I didn't think it was a good thing because I didn't have any security at all if I'd a gone into that post at that time. And so, what Howard decided to do was they, they got another dean but they decided to bring me in from time to time as a distinguished scholar.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that's what I did.
Speaker 1: So, well, Tony Brown for those who don't know (unclear), Tony Brown is the host of 'Black Journal' ['American Black Journal'] on PBS [Public Broadcasting Service].
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: And then the Tony Brown show ['Tony Brown's Journal'] which was a, the pioneering black talk show on public television.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The Tony Brown show, yes.
Speaker 1: So that's, that's, you know--
Speaker 2: A bit of history.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, so Howard University, did, did, did you have anything to do with the founding of WHUT [WHUT-TV, Washington, D.C.] or--
Speaker 2: No, I did not.
Speaker 1: Okay. And the programming there was great. I mean--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in those days (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hm. It was.
Speaker 1: Just a--
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Howard University radio and television. So, okay. In 1982, you become a Fulbright-Hays fellow and now what--
Speaker 2: In Zimbabwe, right.
Speaker 1: That's in Zimbabwe.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So, you're supported by the Fulbright.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so you were, you were married that year too?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay. And all right. You wanna talk about that any or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I mean, you know, yeah, I, I got married in Zimbabwe and, and that marriage lasted for a, a while until I got married again [to Ana Yenenga Asante].
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 637199
Speaker 1: In '83 [1983] you're still at SUNY Buffalo [State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York], and so, but you leave though in '84 [1984] for, for Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Tell us about the transition from Temple to, I mean, from Buffalo to Temple.
Speaker 2: Well, well, the transition was quite simple and easy, I mean, after all one of the reasons I wanted to make the transition was because as I said earlier because of the weather. I wanted milder weather and it was like, a per annual, maybe ten or fifteen degrees warmer in, in, in, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] than in Buffalo [New York]. And also it gave, it made, it put me closer to a lot of people that I needed to be in touch with. And so, and it also it put me back into the field of African American studies because I came to Temple to run the African American Studies department [Department of African American Studies; Department of Africology and African American Studies] so that was, that was, so it was all good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had been, you know, I mean, there was no, there was no financial advantage to being in, in Philadelphia because I, I basically came to Philadelphia for the same salary. It was other intangibles that made it important.
Speaker 1: Okay. It's interesting that the Temple University had a department of African American studies?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And this was, now, it, we were discussing the different forms and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that this could take--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the institute of research, institute--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and culture center, all these different things but they actually had a department of African American Studies.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, did that make it more attractive?
Speaker 2: More attractive, more powerful. We had eventually thirteen, we had, we started with three faculty, we, we, we went up to thirteen. And we were, we were known for being an Afrocentric department. We created an international buzz about the field. And we, we, we became extremely well, well known for the work we did.
Story_ID: 637200
Speaker 1: This department had been started be- was started before you arrived, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it did. It was.
Speaker 1: And can, can you just kind of briefly summarize how they were able--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --to do this?
Speaker 2: Yeah. The department was started in 1971 and it was called the Afro-Asian Institute. So, it started as an institute offering courses. It was called Afro-Asian because one of the people they had teaching was from Vietnam. So eventually a couple of years later they created a department that they called the Department of Pan-African Studies, so it was called Department of Pan-African Studies. By the time that I got to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], it, the name had been changed to the Department of African American Studies [Department of Africology and African American Studies]. And so, the Department of Pan-African Studies had suffered greatly under, under a previous dean who basically took everybody who was in the department and put 'em in different, in that, in Pan-African studies and put them in different departments. It's a pattern that's often repeated in universities when black people don't control their own institutions. I mean, for example, the, person like [HistoryMaker] Sonia Sanchez who was in Pan-African studies, they took her out, put her in the English department. There was a gentleman named Will Rojay [ph.] who is in, teaches, from, he's from Trinidad, they took him out of the department, put him in French. So, they, they were destroying, systematically destroying the Department of African American Studies. And, of course, we, we feel like in 2012 that this is sort of deja vu because the same thing is happening at Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: So, let me get this, from what I understand then, though they had a, a department in name, they were creating a program out of what used to be a department by assigning the professors to other departments?
Speaker 2: Well, well, that's a very good, you're very generous. No, the, a, a, a program operates actually with a director, you just have a director and then you have people from different departments teaching these courses but the people who were teaching in, in English and French and political science who had come out of the department essentially became members of their own departments. Now, if they wanted to, they could say I'll take a extra load and teach a course for the African American studies program but that did not happen. When I came here there were three faculty members and one of those faculty members was from South Africa, Molaya [ph.], the other faculty member was from Vietnam, and the other faculty member was from Kenya, these were the three faculty members that I met when I came to Temple. And then the year I came the person from Vietnam decided that he would retire so he retired to Washington [D.C.] where he was living and commuting to Philadelphia. The, the, the South African was commuting from Wilmington [Delaware]. And the Kenyan was commuting from New Jersey from Willingboro. There was nobody living in Philadelphia in charge of the department. So, so, so that department had been really squeezed. Now, it, it is conceivable that some of those people could, could have become, you know, part of, attached to the department. And from time to time we've had courses from Sonia Sanchez. I think, in the history that I've been there she's maybe taught one or two courses but for the most part, she teaches in the English department, that's her department, yeah.
Speaker 1: So it wasn't even set up like, like a program--
Speaker 2: No, it was not.
Speaker 1: --the way it, okay.
Speaker 2: It was still set up as a department and part of bringing me here was to try to create as the president said at the time, Peter Liacouras, we wanna create the best department of African American studies in the nation, that's why we bring you here. And, of course, there was a great rivalry between Temple and Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for a long time over who would define the, the African American studies. And, and we normally tend to think that we basically ran Professor Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] out into the world of making films, that he, he decided the scholarship was not, (laughter) not going to be the thing. So, but it's all, all in jest, I mean, in fun. I mean, we had, had good fun between Skip Gates and myself. But, but that was the, the, the whole idea that Temple said we're gonna go for the Ph.D., we were the first Ph.D. program in the nation, it was ten years later before you get the second one and that one was at the University of Massachusetts [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts] and I read that proposal for them. And then a few years later I read the proposal for Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], Berkeley created one. But they were both, they were both of those programs, the Massachusetts and Berkeley I think have really surpassed Temple at this stage in 2012 in terms of just it's, the, the substance of what they're doing.  We have declined.

Speaker 1: What did you, what were the components that you pulled together to create this historic department [Department of African American Studies; Department of Africology and African American Studies] where, where, which offered the first Ph.D. in African American studies?
Speaker 2: Well, the resource, that, that there, there was a convergence of things. I mean, I, I don't, I, I think that certainly I had the idea when I came in to Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] that I wanted to do something that was unique in the field but it would not have happened without a lot of different pieces falling into place. One was that we had, we had Pat Swygert who was an African American administrator, Pat, [HistoryMaker] H. Patrick Swygert who became president at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], president at SUNY Albany [State University of New York at Albany, Albany, New York], was the executive vice president at Temple when I came in. And he was a major player in making sure that the faculty would support this program. Now, there was trouble, of course, because the faculty in the colleges, and particularly in liberal arts, felt like they were basically being pressured by the administration to create this Ph.D. program. But at the same time we had on the board of trustees at Temple, Bill Cosby, and we also had a man who was a, a great supporter of, at, of Temple, Nichols [Henry Nichols], Reverend Nichols. And Reverend Nichols was the key player in the education committee on the board of trustees, he was a black man. So, so, with all those forces and with me, we were able to create. I, I wrote the program, drafted the program, put it together and submitted it to the university and was immediately told by a number of people in the university that it would never happen. In fact, the chair of the sociology department she said it would be over my dead body that we will have a Ph.D. in African American studies, what is that? And then, so there was, it was a struggle, of course. At that time, I'm only, I'm here only with two other faculty members and myself. And it does look kind of strange, how are you gonna create a Ph.D. program, you only got three, three people and potentially a fourth one? So how do you do this? And what I had done was to do my research. I had gone to catalogs, at that time you still had catalogs, looked in catalogs of universities and discovered that there were several departments in universities that only had two or three faculty but they give Ph.D.'s and most of these were like classics. You go to Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut] and get a degree in classics or a Ph.D. and they only have three faculty members. So, we were not really that small. We were a, a pretty good size but we needed resources and that's where I went to the university, to the board of trustees and made appeal for resources and they told the administrators to give us resources and this was after the bitter battle of getting it through my college because history was against us, sociology was against us, political science was against us, but fortunately we got enough votes to get it to the next level and then the administration supported it and it was supported by the board of trustees. I will one day write that story but I guess I'm writing it now. But that's, it was, 'cause, 'cause people think that it was easy, it was not easy, it's never easy, never easy when you're creating something new and you are African in this country and you're trying to create a new program in a environment where people have this whole notion of white dominance, no, it's not easy, so, it was a struggle. And it was one that I, as I said I've rarely talked about but it was, it took, it took two years to, for us to do this because after all I came here in '84 [1984], the program did not open, did not get approved until '87 [1987]. And we did not open our doors, I mean, until '88 [1988] to have the first students.
Story_ID: 637202
Speaker 1: What did the, what did the program consist of in terms of coursework and, and requirements (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had two, we had two, we had two, we had two divisions [in the Department of African American Studies; Department of Africology and African American Studies], you can go into cultural aesthetics as a concentration or you can go into social behavioral work and those were the two concentrations. And a person had to take sixty or sixty-six credit hours of courses [at Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. And then after you took those hours of coursework you then had to pass comprehensive examinations, and then you had to write a, a doctoral dissertation. Now, the course, the courses were unique that we created. For example, we created courses on the Nile Valley Civilizations. That was a course, it never existed in anybody else's university. We created a seminar on Malcolm X where we studied all of his speeches and works. We had a seminar on Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]. We, we had work and a seminar ultimately on Toni Morrison. We did courses on Caribbean culture. We did theoretical work on Afrocentricity and renaissance or, we did discussions of comparative discussions of political actions by black people. And religion, we did religion as well, we did church, rather we did the black church was one of our courses. So, black psychology, the psychology of blackness, many of those courses we did that were truly Afrocentric courses. African civilizations, and no, you can go into the universities and never have a course on African civilizations. So, so we study classical Africa and we studied also African American communities and the urban communities particularly in terms of popular culture.
Speaker 1: Okay. And the goal is to produce a person who can, can do (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, the goal is to produce a person who is well organized, well educated, and somebody who has a degree of consciousness that will allow them to create and be self-determining. And, and we have now we have produced from 1990 which was the first one, there are over, there are just about two hundred students who have got their Ph.D.'s and I, I've, I've directed about a 120 of them. So, it's a, it's a lot of, we have students everywhere, we have students in China, we have, we have a Japanese student, we have students in all over Africa, we have students in Germany, students in Holland [the Netherlands], so we have students who have come through this program.
Story_ID: 637203
Speaker 1: You mentioned Afrocentricity, and now what is that concept and when did you come up with that? And I know that's been like a brand of--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --yours for a while--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Afrocentricity actually the, I wrote the first book called 'Afrocentricity' [Molefi Kete Asante] in 1979, it was published in 1980. And then I wrote four additional books, three, three, additional books on Afrocentricity, 'The Afrocentric Idea' [Molefi Kete Asante], 'Kemet, Afrocentricity, and Knowledge' [Molefi Kete Asante], and then the book that just came out recently 'An Afrocentric Manifesto' ['An Afrocentric Manifesto: Toward an African Renaissance,' Molefi Kete Asante], so there's a quartet of books on Afrocentricity. And the main thesis behind Afrocentricity is that African people, people of African descent, after five hundred years of being in a world of Europe have been marginalized so that we no longer see the world from our own center, from ourselves, we see the world often from the center of Europe. So, if, for example, you're talking about the history of the United States of America, if you talk about the manifest destiny, you're talking about a European vision of how they would go from the Atlantic to the Pacific. But if you're an African American you have to really deeply ask yourself, what is the meaning of this for you? And as an Afrocentrist, I say, it looks like conquest of the native peoples, that's what the manifest destiny looks like to me. So, what Afrocentricity does is to try to develop a method of what we call location. And we say if we can discover where you are located, we can also discover what you will produce because your location tells us whether you are centered or whether you are dislocated and that becomes the critical idea, the idea of agency, we say that African people must be given a sense of agency. If we look at the, the Independence Hall in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and you look at the discussion going on among the white founding fathers, our question is, well, these white founding fathers are talking but what about the, what, what's going on with the people who were their cooks, the people who were their buggy drivers and so forth, they must be having conversation as well. And so, can we interrogate the possibility of they, that they were talking. And can we also imagine what their conversation would have been like when they saw Mr. Jefferson [President Thomas Jefferson] inside that window. So, so that's the, what the Afrocentrist is trying to get at, is the heart of the Africans quest for humanity and quest for liberation. And the way you get at that is by looking at things from the point of view of the African person, not as a peripheral to Europe, not as marginalized, not as a victim even but as someone who is an actor and someone who creates out of his or her own ideas. This is why, for example I, I look at Martin Delany and I always say that they called Martin Delany the father of black nationalism but black nationalism is the wrong title. I mean, in fact they give him this title black nationalism as a way to minimize his philosophical ideas and concepts. I mean, we, we don't call the, the Jewish writer, for example, Viktor Frankl who created logotherapy after the second war [World War II, WWII], a major war in which the Holocaust happened, we don't call him a Jewish nationalist, we just say his philosophy is logotherapy. But so, so that's why in my writings about Martin Delany, I've called him a transformatist ['Martin Delany: The First Transformatist,' Molefi Kete Asante]. His idea was basically how do we transform people who have just come out of this terrible experience in this country? How do we give them a sense of agency, a sense of self-determination? How do we give them a sense of self-definition that they can do what they wanna do, they can be their own people? And what white writers term that is that's a black nationalist as opposed to some kind of white nationalists. And so, I, I recently I've started writing that no, no, let's call this philosophy what it was, he was a transformatist, and his idea was about how do you transform African people from what we used to be under slavery and under the abuse and everything into real full grown human beings doing what we're capable of doing in our own interests. And so that's why I say I'm a, I'm a Delany-ite. I mean, my, my ideas are strictly in line with that. So, that's, that's my, I guess, it's a small answer to that.
Story_ID: 637204
Speaker 1: What were you reading or talking to in those days? Now, I know that some of the, I mean, Malcolm X when he--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --gave his, one of his, the little book that says 'Malcolm X on Afro-American History' [Malcolm X].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: He says that one of the first things we need to do is think for ourselves.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) for ourselves.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was doing, I was--I was reading Malcolm, I was reading Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], I mean, I was reading Malcolm but I was also reading [HistoryMaker] Maulana Karenga and listening to Maulana Karenga who I think his, his analysis of the cultural crisis is fundamentally the best that I've heard. I was reading also Frantz Fanon because when I, when, you know, back in the day, we used to carry Frantz Fanon around with us as the main text of thinking about how you approach the world and 'The Wretched of the Earth' [Frantz Fanon] was, was one of my, one of my main books. But I was also reading the European thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre. And definitely I was into, into all of the work where people were trying to question or debate what was absurd and what was not. And, and so, so I was reading a, a lot of stuff. I mean, this is the stuff that I guess at the time we called it existentialist because that's, that's what Sartre's work was basically about. But I was also reading Gramsci [Antonio Gramsci] and I wanted very much to understand how the colonized, you know, gained their liberation from the colonizers and so forth.
Story_ID: 637205
Speaker 1: Off camera we were talking about Chinweizu--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with his book 'The West and the Rest of Us' ['The West and the Rest of Us: White Predators, Black Slavers and the African Elite'] and how he was saying that Africans see themselves in, in, I guess, in the intro [introduction], through the eyes of Europeans.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, Chinweizu is a brilliant writer. And, in fact, he's perhaps one of Nigeria's most provocative thinkers. And his whole notion that the, the African person has basically been destroyed mentally so that we have taken on European attitudes, European ideas, is something that I think could not have happened to him as it did unless he had been in America. They, I think being in America helped to verify for him, to confirm for him that African people had essentially been taken off of their own terms, and they were operating on somebody's else's terms.
Story_ID: 637206
Speaker 1: So when you were creating the department [Department of African American Studies; Department of Africology and African American Studies] were you actually thinking about how can I (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Create a new consciousness?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I--when I, when I created the Ph.D. program in African American studies at Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I was thinking how do you create a program that will re-center African people, that will relocate them, and how will you create a program that if white people or Asians took the program they would learn how to teach and research about African people from African people's standpoint, not from European standpoint. And I, I'm here to say that the students that we have had from Japan and from China they have learned that. In fact, one of them said to me, Yuan Ji [sic. Ji Yuan], he said, "When I came to study with you from China, the People's Republic [People's Republic of China], we have over a billion people and we had no authority on African American people and African Americans represent a, a sizable segment of the American population and I wanted to come and study and I'm so happy that I came to study with you because I learned about African Americans from inside the African American's point of view." That is very important. They could have gone to any, he could have gone to any other university and learned about how Europe thinks of us or how white people see black people as on the margins of white society, as, as problems and so forth but I don't taught that way, I don't teach that way, I don't write that way, and I didn't teach Yuan Ji that way. So, I think it's extremely important that we learn to ask ourselves how, how do we think about this? Not how do Europe think about this, well, what are the methods that our people use? What are the theories that our people use? So, I teach them, I give them, I turn them over to theories that come out of the African world. They, they read other theories, other than the ones they read when they were undergraduates, you see.
Story_ID: 637207
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-seven [1987] and through, I think it was in, in the early '90s [1990s] that you really have an attack on African centered thought, Afrocentrics (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you do.
Speaker 1: --all that. And to quote Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. [Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.], he stated that what Asante [HistoryMaker Molefi Kete Asante] has been saying essentially is that, "Africa is the source of all good and Europe is the source of all evil." That's what--
Speaker 2: Well, well, Schlesinger and I had the debate and actually it was a debate with three of us, me, Schlesinger, and Cornel West. And the, the thing is that Schlesinger's idea of America is that America is, was a white, his idea, his idea was that America was a white nation and that if black people wanted to progress here you had to become white. That basically as he told me over dinner, he said, "Molefi, you're so bright, you're so intelligent, if you just, you know, wear a suit and a tie and do, be, be a nice person, see this as a white society, you can go very far." I said, "Mr. Schlesinger, my people love me. I have no desire to do that. I have no inclination to do that. My only inclination is to, is to live a life that I become an ancestor to my people. That is my only mission. So, in fact, that's my ethical value, you see." So, he didn't know what to do with that so he says to me, and he, he writes in this book ['The Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Society,' Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.], that I think that Europe is the source of all evil. I never said that. I've never said anything like that. And that Africa is the source of all good. I never said anything like that. In fact, the only thing I've said is that if you look at historical fact, Africa has given to the world medicine, given to the world astronomy, given to the world geometry, mathematics, given to the world philosophy, is, given to the world, I mean, not only but solemn processions, religion, the names of the gods, et cetera, et cetera. So, it doesn't mean that Europe hasn't given anything, I wouldn't say that. It doesn't mean that what Europe has given is bad but Europe has done some bad things to African people. That is a fact. So, but I never said it like he said it. I mean, I would never make a statement like that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So, in the thick of all, all this, I know there was the controversy about Martin Bernal's book--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Black Athena' ['Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization'] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Black Athena.' And there was an issue, an edition of Newsweek--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that actually featured African centered thought on the cover or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --or Afrocentricity--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --that they called it exactly what your, your name for such thinking is.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) On the cover.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And tried to, and, and tried to lampoon it, so.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: So, what was your reaction to all this and--
Speaker 2: Well, my--
Speaker 1: --how did it affect your department [Department of African American Studies; Department of Africology and African American Studies, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: My reaction, sir, was to write more books and on, just to keep the offensive. That there was not, I, I wrote one book that was a defensive book which probably should not have been written but it was necessary and people recite it a lot, it's called, 'The Painful Demise of Eurocentrism' ['The Painful Demise of Eurocentrism: An Afrocentric Response to Critics,' Molefi Kete Asante]. And that book is, is quoted all over Africa because people look at all the arguments I put out against the arguments that are made against Afrocentricity. But I have, my response is that it's to be expected. I mean, I, I'm, I understand this situation. I mean, the people who are holding on to this notion of superiority that does not exist and I'm saying it does not exist. I mean, Martin Bernal, I, I, I know Martin Bernal, my, my wife, Ana [Ana Yenenga Asante] and I were at a conference with him in Barcelona [Spain]. And he's, he believes, well, he's retired now but essentially then the same line of argument that we have made, that basically what Europe has tried to do is to take over all the territory and to push everybody into the margins and that's not acceptable. And it's not acceptable and from a scholarly point of view, and certainly not acceptable from what is historically correct point of view.
Story_ID: 637208
Speaker 1: You were saying earlier that the program at Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] is not, not what it used to be, so--
Speaker 2: No, no, right. It is not what it used to be in the sense that the department now is reduced to about five faculty members, and not only that but you've had a series of deans and administrators in the department and out of the department whose intent has been to remove as much as they can of the Afrocentric idea.
Speaker 1: Okay. Can you just kind of recount for us the, the, the growth of it in its, its height and then the, you know, the, I guess, the reduction of it (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think the height of it may have been from '88 [1988] to around '96 [1996]. And I, and I always put that in my, during my career as, as the head of it because I had a clear mission of what I wanted to do. In '96 [1996] I decided that I would not run again for reelection and to the department and so I didn't run again for reelection and, and, and the university hired a, a person from, actually from, from Chicago [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], hired a person from Chicago to come in and run the department and with the express idea that she would come in and not support the Afrocentric idea and agenda. Temple had been getting a lot of heat from people for the fact that you had a Ph.D. program that was controlled by black people and that it was Afrocentric and that, you know, it was creating a situation where the reputation of Temple was really known for two things, Molefi Asante [HistoryMaker Molefi Kete Asante] and Afrocentricity, and John Chaney and basketball. So, the, how do you reduce this weight so that the psychology department or the history department will come up and African American studies [Department of Africology and African American Studies] would go down is to create a situation where they say only eight people can be admitted to African American studies in a year. I mean, not thirty-five like we were admitting or twenty, only eight people. Not get, don't give them more resources to deal with the large numbers of people who wanna come to this program, further, let's minimize it so the idea of minimizing our program became a very big problem. And so, my idea was how you, how do you maintain quality, how do you create a quality program? And so, the idea was to get good people, hire good people, and, and, and, and, and move them in a certain way and so on. So, that, that became a problem.
Story_ID: 637209
Speaker 1: Now, why did you decide not to run again in '96 [1996] just (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I decided not to run again in '96 [1996] because after all I had run, I had been in--the chair normally it lasts for like five years, I had been in the chair from 1984 to 1996. And, and, and then, of course, the university, I felt, had not supported us as they should have. And then I had also, some, some people, sometimes try, would, would think in their mind that there must be a, a specific reason but the president of the university wrote me a very nice letter after I decided that I would step down and not run again, and that letter is a historic letter. Peter Liacouras writing a very beautiful letter about all the work that I had done, that he may have disagreed with me on some ideas of Afrocentricity but fundamentally the ideas that I laid down had created for the university a legacy of, of greatness in terms of what we were doing. So, that was, that was the key idea behind it was that I had put in this work and so now, you know, you've put in all this work, let's, you know, see where, what we can do. And so, my, my sort of regret in a sense is that perhaps I wasn't quite aware that the university was still attempting to undermine and destroy us and if I had been a little more conscious, I probably said, you know, what? I think, I'll run again but I'm happy I didn't and that's the way it was.
Speaker 1: Now, who did you, did you have an idea that someone else was going to be installed other than the person from Chicago [Illinois] that they brought?
Speaker 2: No, that was, that was the person that they chose, they chose, they chose that person from Chicago State [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] to come to run the program and no, I had no idea that there would be somebody else. There were a couple of people that I had, I would have preferred, Geneva Smitherman, for example, is a person I would have preferred to be the head of the department [Department of African American Studies; Department of Africology and African American Studies], she had come and she was rejected because she was too Afrocentric. So, they were trying to find someone who would be the anti-Molefi Asante [HistoryMaker Molefi Kete Asante]. I mean this is, this has been a pattern at Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] for many years so that's, that's the idea, I mean, can we find somebody, we don't want anybody who will even use the word Afrocentric, you see.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, there, there were, now this period of time I know there's a lot, there was a lot written about it, and letters going back and forth (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --in black journals and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --scholarly publications--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the newspaper--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and everything else.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 637210
Speaker 1: So, at, at bottom I guess what, what is the, the state of the program now and, and, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the state of the program, I mean, I think the state of the program is that we have a, there, there's a European woman who is one of the leading candidates I guess that they're gonna hire for the chair, Heather Thompson [Heather Ann Thompson]. And so, I think if that happens then that we will continue to have the decline of the program. I mean, black students will probably and African students will probably think that there is no uniqueness to it, if there's no uniqueness, if it's the same that they offer in the history department why do you need African American studies [Department of Africology and African American Studies]? I mean, I, I, I don't know whether that's the case but that may possibly be the case. But they, I understand Kariamu Welsh is also one of the applicants for the position. But I don't know what they will do. I mean, given the fact that again as I always say, you know, I work at Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] but I don't, I have no control of it. And, and, and the intellectuals and people who are conscious of African history and culture and ideas, we are limited, not just in our own institutions, HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], I mean, we're black people who are provocative in their thinking and who raise these questions also have problems but we also have problems as we know in majority white institutions.
Speaker 1: Okay. But you continue to teach, right, and you're not a--
Speaker 2: Yes, I mean, I'm a full professor, I'm the senior professor in my department. I, I teach pe- you know, and I keep my office hours and, and I volunteer in the community in the, in the, in the Molefi Asante Institute [Molefi Kete Asante Institute for Afrocentric Studies, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 637211
Speaker 1: Now, what, what is the Molefi Asante Institute [Molefi Kete Asante Institute for Afrocentric Studies, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: The Molefi Kete Asante Institute is a think tank. That is, it is an organization that is set up for the purpose of helping to influence public policy on issues that relate to people of African descent and that means that we have about forty or fifty people who are identified, who've accepted to be identified with the Molefi Kete Asante Institute as, as fellows or senior fellows, including people like Jean-Bertrand Aristide for example, who is one of our senior fellows. And these people, the, the idea is that if we want to write on a particular issue about Africa or Africa America, or Africans in South America, we ask a couple of people to write ideas about these issues and then we vet them through our organization and then we disseminate that information to opinion leaders and opinion makers. That's basically what we are set up to do. And this is the first such think tank that we know of that's controlled fundamentally by black people, that there are a couple smaller ones, but, but this is the, the first one that takes in so many scholars.
Story_ID: 637212
Speaker 1: Who have been some of your students over the years that you're the proudest of?
Speaker 2: Well, boy, man, you, you will get me into a lot of trouble by answering that, that question. I'm proud of all of my students, really I'm proud of all of them. And there are some students who have done some incredible things. I mean, the person who was the first person to get a Ph.D. from the African American Studies anywhere in the world is a man from Nigeria by the name of Adeniyi Coker. And Professor Coker is the Lee distinguished professor [E. Desmond Lee Endowed Professor] at the University of Missouri in St. Louis [University of Missouri-St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri]. He has a, he is an endowed chair, he was my first Ph.D. student in African American studies. He is, I think, he's major. I, I have also some more recent students like Dr. Michael Tillotson at the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]. University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Michael Tillotson, whose book the 'Invisible Jim Crow' ['Invisible Jim Crow: Contemporary Ideological Threats to the Internal Security of African Americans'] came out almost unfortunately the same year as Michelle Alexander's book ['The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness'], and his book is about the mental Jim Crow, I mean, what happens to black people, mentally. And hers, of course, is about incarceration rates and prison rates and so on. And then we have a Japanese student, a former student, Dr. Suzuko Morikawa who teaches in Chicago [Illinois] at Chicago State [Chicago State University] in the department of history. So, we have, we have many, many students. And, and I, I could mention Dr. Rubaka, Raylin Rubaka [ph.] at the University of Colorado. And Dr. Adisa Alkebulan who is at San Diego State University [San Diego, California]. These are just a few, I mean, they're, they're everywhere. James Conyers who teaches at the University of, of, of, Houston [University of Houston, Houston, Texas] has published twenty-nine books. He's mainly, mainly edited twenty-nine books but he's, he's written several. So, we have, we have some, and Dr. Crystal Temple [ph.] who I claim as my student, I just happened to be an advisor or mentor to her, is also one of the outstanding graduates of our program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Dr., Dr. Zizwe Poe [Daryl Zizwe Poe], P-O-E. Zizwe is Z-I-Z-W-E. Zizwe Poe has written the major work on Kwame Nkrumah, and he teaches at Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] in the department of history.

Speaker 1: So I'm trying to think now, so we gotta, so what, what, what are your future plans? Do you, do you have plans for a publication or, or a project that's, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I'm, you know, I mean, I've written, as I said, as, you know, I've written seventy-four books which is the highest number of any African American scholar but I have five books already that I'm, that I'm writing now so, so I'm, I'm, my, my plan is to continue to, to, to write on various issues of the African world. I am also, of course, very engaged in setting up internationally an organization called Afrocentricity International. And that organization is the first global African organization about consciousness since Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association [UNIA]. We, we just had a major conference in 2012 this year in Paris [France] two weeks ago which more than two hundred African people from all over Europe, from Iceland, from Switzerland, from Germany, Denmark, came to Paris under the, under my leadership and the leadership of Dr. Ama Mazama, to create an organization that will be, have many chapters in Europe. And then we're doing the same in the Caribbean, the same in South America. Then we will continue, we got the chapters here but we will continue to grow because the idea is that we need a organic relationship of with people who basically believe that consciousness is necessary and, and possible. And, and we, we wanna do it a different way than it's been done before.

Speaker 1: What are, this is a generic question we always ask, but what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that, here's my, here's my hope. My hope is that we radically change our attitude toward the education of our youth, that's my hope. It is totally impossible for us to get out of the conditions that we are in, the ones that seem to be deleterious to us without a radical change in education. We must teach our children to not just love themselves but to begin to reflect on what it means to see the world from their own point of view and that means you ask fundamental questions every time something is, if it's about philosophy then you need to, if somebody asks you about philosophy the question is not to go to Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle but to ask yourself are there any African philosophers? If you never ask that question you will never get an answer but if you ask it, you will get an answer and the answer will help you with anything you're doing. So, whenever I ask a question I always try to interrogate my own history first because there's nothing more correct for us than our own historical experiences. That's one of my hopes. Now, my concern is this, my concern is that self-hatred is the most prominent aspect of white supremacy and black inferiority. That black people have got to get over this, this issue. And I think that part of it is that as, as I started off, it's ingrained by the church. I think the church teaches us this. I mean we love a white man, Jesus, more than we love ourselves. It's crazy, it is, does not make any sense, it does not. I mean, we, we, we have never even examined it to ask how did this come to be that we believe in this. We don't understand that if you show somebody your religion you're showing them either your conqueror or you're showing them your ancestor, that's all you can do. If you're not showing them your ancestor, you're showing them somebody else's ancestor and that is, that's a big problem. Almost every event in the black community that I attend whether it's for politics, whether it's for awarding somebody, ceremony turns into church.  And that's church almost a knee jerk reaction. It's a, it's fundamentally a difficult problem.
Speaker 1: So does it help by turning Jesus black or believing that he's black?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. I don't think so. I think that these are stopgap measures and methods, you see. It's like making Santa Claus black as we used to do back in the '70s [1970s] in California we would call him, St. Soul [ph.], you know, St. Soul is, is Santa Claus but no, I, I think what we have to do is reject. You see, it is hard for us to reject. We don't have an ideology that we will die for. This is, this is the black population, we, we don't have one. We, we, we have, we have other people's ideologies that we die for but we don't die for our own ancestors. And the fact of the matter is that until we are able to have a commitment to our own history we won't even be self-determining because we won't believe in it. People come to our institute [Molefi Kete Asante Institute for Afrocentric Studies, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and they say how did you do this? We said we saved and we sacrificed. So, so but, how are you making money? We said, look, we saved, we sacrificed because we believe this is important. It's only when you believe something is important that you are willing to sacrifice for it which is difficult for us to do. I, I, I find this every, every day, I have great examples of this. If we could overcome that, we will be on our way. We will be a people that will absolutely be, be free. And, but we don't have that freedom yet, so that's one of my concerns, so, I fight that every day.
Story_ID: 637215
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2: I cannot think of anything that I, I think in terms of, I mean, if I could change it, I mean, probably, probably when you start talking about changing it's, it's difficult to talk like this but, you know, I, I have two children, a daughter [Eka Asante] and a son [M.K. Asante], and my son periodically reminds me that, "Dad you were not home as often as you should have been when I was growing up." And, and I think I would have changed that if I could have but, but fortunately we all grow up, so now that he is a father and he's not as home, home as much as he should be, I always call him up and say, "Hey, hey, when you gone see the son," you know. And he understands that the nature of the work that he does and the nature of the work that I do sometimes takes you away, so you have to give quality time. So, I think that, that I gave him a lot of time and a lot of energy but I, but there are things that he remembers that I don't remember and so I think that maybe somehow I would, 'cause I loved being a father and I still love being a father to my daughter and to my son but I don't, and there are no regrets really, I mean, basically they- they're okay.
Story_ID: 637216
Speaker 1: What do you think is the future of Afrocentricity?
Speaker 2: Oh, Afrocentricity is, (laughter) Afrocentricity is the right now, the most vibrant, intellectual idea in the African world. I've just been invited on June 18th and 19th to Johannesburg [South Africa] to give a paper at the Thabo Mbeki Institute [Thabo Mbeki African Leadership Institute] on the, because Thabo Mbeki gave this great speech on African renaissance when he was president of South Africa which was based on my theory. So, basically now they are saying, you know, we want a reassessment of, of where Mbeki has been and is going and so on, even though he's, he's not in office. And here's what I'm saying, everywhere I go in the continent of Africa and, and certainly in some parts of Europe where you have black people, you, you, you have Afrocentricity being discussed, talked about every day. I get letters and calls every day from Europe, from South America, from Colombia.  There's a group in Buenaventura in Colombia, the Pacific side not far from Choco [Colombia] and Cali [Colombia] where they have formed an Afrocentricity International group. It's a growing philosophy and my book 'Afrocentricity' [Molefi Kete Asante] is translated into French and it is translated into Spanish. So, we, we, we have to get it translated into Portuguese. But, but the black people are reading it and understanding everywhere.
Story_ID: 637217
Speaker 1: We always ask this question too, when, when you look back now at everything you've done to this point, even though you're still doing things, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think there are two things that I consider to be my legacy. One is the founding of the idea, the theoretical idea of Afrocentricity, not the found- not the creation of the word, sometimes people confuse that, the word Afrocentricity existed before me but the substance to Afrocentricity in terms of its theory, its practice, these are the works that I have created. And I've not only created those works but I have laid out in almost every other work that I've done, ways to do it. In other words, if for example I say that Afrocentricity is about agency then I have to demonstrate that. So, in my history books I write histories that talk about African people as African people see the world, not as African people as objects but as subjects acting out the world. The history of Africa that I wrote ['The History of Africa; The Quest for Eternal Harmony,' Molefi Kete Asante] is how African people see history, not how Europeans see Africans in history. So, everything I do is to build this movement and to build this idea, so that's one thing. And the other one I think is the creation of the Ph.D. program [within the Department of African American Studies; Department of Africology and African American Studies] because what it demonstrated was that without a, a program or a platform or without guides from, you know, a European department, it's not like I created the first history department in a black college because there were other history departments in other colleges but to create a African American studies Ph.D. program is an important legacy because it says that we can do this, not only can we do it, we can create it, we can maintain it. And even though you will have people who will come and it will change in nature. I, I always say that the fact that it was created at Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] doesn't mean that Temple will always have it or that it will always be number one. I said it may move to Pittsburgh [University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], it may move to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], it may move to Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], it may move to Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana], Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], Massachusetts [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts], other places where now they have African American studies Ph.D.'s, they may become the centers but the original one was started by Asante [HistoryMaker Molefi Kete Asante] in 1988 in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Just for the record, is, is, you said the term Afrocentricity has--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it existed before me. You know, who--
Speaker 1: --before the concepts and ideas (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. In fact, Kwame Nkrumah in a speech in 1961 I think mentioned the word Afrocentric, that what, what we were needing was a whole Afrocentric approach to Africa. And so, the, the, so I took this word and I tried to imbue this word with certain ideas and intellectual components and assumptions and, and create a theoretical position. It's just like, I mean, there's no, I always tell people it's not a, a rare thing. The word existentialism existed before Jean-Paul Sartre. Sartre didn't create the word existentialism but if we talk about existentialism as a philosophy we have to say Jean-Paul Sartre because he is the most famous theoretical person and philosophical person on it, you see.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --as a professor of communications, I, I know just about my readings of things that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you write--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you, you coin things, you do coin (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --say like--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: --the hundred most important African Americans in history ['100 Greatest African Americans: A Biographical Encyclopedia,' Molefi Kete Asante], I mean--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --it's, I think Ebony does something like that--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --with contemporary people but you did it as, as a historical exercise (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You, you, you understand that's precisely, that what I call the creative notion of self-determination. That I'm not gonna let them say that, I'm gonna say this is who it, who we are, this is, we are the, this is our list of 100 greatest African Americans because I'm scared of what other people will come up with. So, so, yes, it is taking, taking the initiative to create ourselves, to name ourselves, define ourselves, and that's where, where I'm going.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your children, you, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I have, I have two children, two natural children. I have one adopted, one son who is a stepson.

Asante who is the one that people know, he's, he's, more, more well known because of his filmmaking and his writing. He, he, writing on hip hop and also he has a new novel, a new, actually autobiographical work called 'Buck' ['Buck: A Memoir,' M.K. Asante].

Speaker 1: Is there anything I have not asked you about before I have to ask my last question here?
Speaker 2: I think you've asked me everything, I could think of (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different. Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I would like to be remembered as a person who gave his all to try to establish a path for African people out of the dismal condition we find ourselves, psychologically, materially, philosophically, economically, and socially, and culturally in after the, the five hundred years of, of Europe. So, that's the path. This is, that that I am trying to discover that. And I would like to be remembered on the basis of my works in the sense that may my works always speak for me--that whatever other people say, it's the works that really count.
