Jessie Wilkerson: So it&#8217;s August 5, 2010 and this is Jessie Wilkerson, and I&#8217;m here with Beth Bingman in Whitesburg Kentucky.  Beth Bingman: Okay thank you.   [Interruption]  JW: Well do you want to talk and eat, or do you want to just eat and then--.  BB: No we can talk if you don&#8217;t mind having me eating while we talk.  JW: I don&#8217;t mind. I don&#8217;t mind at all.  BB: So--.  JW: Maybe say your name and what your current job is so I can hear--.  BB: Okay Beth Bingman and my job is the managing director of Appalshop in Whitesburg, Kentucky where we are.  JW: Pretty good here. So I have been, with all my interviews, starting with people&#8217;s childhood experiences. So where people grew up, where they come from.  BB: Oh okay.  JW: So if you want to tell me a little bit about that.  BB: Well I grew up in Knoxville, Tennessee until I was eight. Then we moved to Wise Virginia, and I lived in Virginia, West Virginia and Eastern Kentucky since then, except for a couple, for three years in eastern Virginia.  [Interruption].  JW: And what about your family? What did your parents do?  BB: My dad worked, he did various things, but his last job in Knoxville he was a fieldgrab for the United Mountain Workers Welfare and Retirement Fund. And when he moved up here he worked--he worked either as a hospital administrator or with Appalachian Regional Hospital Association. Yeah I think that was it, so he--and I&#8217;d say the [laughs] he could tell you, he could tell, he could tell stories for a long time. So I moved a lot. I went to a lot of schools. I went to elementary school in Knoxville, Wise, Norton, Williamson, West Virginia, and then I went to high school in Williamson (2:37) Kentucky. So a fair amount of moving. I went to Clinch Valley College in Wise which was a two year school then, and then I went to Mary Washington which was the women's college in Virginia. The University of Virginia was a men&#8217;s school at that point in 1966.   JW: What about your mother?  BB: My parents--she&#8217;s from, she grew up in Florida, but she came to Knoxville, Tennessee and went to Maryville College and my dad went to Maryville, so he&#8217;d come down from Pennsylvania. I have three younger sisters so that&#8217;s pretty much what she did. She worked during the war but not afterwards much.   JW: So was it expected that you would go to college, is that something that--?  BB: Yeah yeah. I mean yeah it was, they, yeah. I don&#8217;t think it was never, I never thought about it. Yeah. Actually I did, and one of my sisters, we both ended up not finishing our senior year. We just went on to college. We were able to finish up enough credits to get in a year early.  I was in college in Clinch Valley for the two summers I was in the Appalachian Volunteers. The third summers I went I was actually a, I was a--I guess the second summer the AV&#8217;s where also VISTA [workers[, and I was a Vista, a summer Vista at a Jobcorp camp out in Oklahoma for a summer.  JW: What motivated you to get involved in the AVs?   BB: Probably I think my parents were pretty active. They were involved in the Unitarian Fellowship in Knoxville. They were involved in doing--integrating day camps in Knoxville in the early [19]50s.   [Interruption]  They were, so they were--I mean my mother was one of those people who did not want to stop. She just died this year, but if she saw somebody that needed a coat, she&#8217;d give them a coat. If somebody needed a ride, she&#8217;d give them a ride. She was just generally active and concerned. Our Girl Scout troop which she was a part of, you know we&#8217;d raise money, and it was more to provide--doing service kind of projects as opposed to camping and that kind of stuff.   [Referring to the students walking by.] These are probably Youth Groups that have come down to work on housing and stuff. Yep there&#8217;s a lot of that people coming. Groups of young people who come to the mountains for a week and do something.   JW: I think I know a group from Chapel Hill who was just planning to come here.  BB: Yeah could be.  I think it&#8217;s good for High School kids. College kids I don&#8217;t&#8212;it&#8217;s probably more high school kids who do it.  JW: Yeah. So you said your parents were helping integrate day camps?  BB: Yeah day camps.  JW: Was that, how was it to have parents doing something like that? What were the politics like? Did you notice?  BB: No, I was like six years old. Later I think I did. Probably as I became aware of the Civil Rights Movement then I look back and then I think &#8220;wow that was not typical of Knoxville in the 1950s.&#8221; There is a group called the Fellowship House which I have not, somebody should do some work on it because it was an integrated--not--it was not part of a church, and it was not a place, it was called the Fellowship House, but they, I think they sponsored those day camps and probably other kinds of interracial activities in Knoxville.  JW: So you went to the day camps?  BB: Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Mother was a part of them. Mother helped at them. But we went to them; my sister and I; a couple, two or three summers. I can&#8217;t remember how long.  JW: What did you do at the day camps?  BB: Sing, crafts, we went camping one night. We&#8217;d have one night where the older kids, I was an older kid at six, got to go camping. You know nothing, the only thing that was--looking back on it the one song I remember from those years was a song that was a real anti-war song I realize now.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to march in the Infantry, shoot in the Calvary, shoot the artillery; I just want to be friendly.&#8221; The song stuck. I can still sing it, but I don&#8217;t think there was any awareness that it was particularly--you know at the time it was just probably sort of a way that you hung out with a lot more black kids than you were usually with. Because I went--certainly the schools weren&#8217;t integrated. But I&#8217;m not sure that I was--. It didn&#8217;t seem like any big deal.  It may not have been. The camps were probably, one time it was in the city park and one time it was in, it could&#8217;ve been a park. At least one time it was in as what I now know as the African American community, you know East Knoxville, but at the time I didn&#8217;t pay attention to it particularly.  JW: I&#8217;ve never heard about that though. Isn&#8217;t that funny? I&#8217;ve done a lot of interviews and grew up in the area and I don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ve never--people always talked about how the Civil Rights Movement happened later in Knoxville. It wasn&#8217;t until the sixties. And this is true that the schools besides Clinton--.  BB: Yeah.  JW: But in people&#8217;s memories it seems like it happened more slowly there, but I think I would say otherwise, that it was earlier.  BB: Well the Unitarian Church that they were a part of was an integrated church. The congregation was integrated. It was mostly white, but it wasn&#8217;t all white. But again it was sort of--as a kid I didn&#8217;t experience it as anything. Probably by the time that I was eight or nine I knew that this was not typical. Certainly when I moved up to Virginia and moved away from that and then I thought &#8220;oh!&#8221; That was about the time the Prince Edward stuff, the Prince Edward County stuff was happening in Virginia, and Virginia was in a big uproar about desegregation.   JW: Did your parents continue that sort of Civil Rights activity when you moved?  BB: Yeah some. I don&#8217;t  remember anything in Wise, but I remember them being in a--we didn&#8217;t go--I mean deliberately didn&#8217;t go because I don&#8217;t think they thought it was safe, but there was some kind of march in Williamson in West Virginia. I really don&#8217;t remember much more about it than that, but that there was one--. The schools in Williamson were integrated. They were West Virginia Schools, although there were still, there was an African American high school, but then there were also the public, you know, the main school was also an integrated school. I&#8217;m not sure what the march was about. And they were involved in the environmental movement. My mother more than dad, but my mother was so involved in that in the [19]60s I guess it was, and then the War on Poverty Stuff--the Committee to Action Agency.  JW: So your parents were doing work with those?  BB:  They were connected to people who were. I don&#8217;t know if they were--not real active, but yeah.   JW: So it sounds like that sort of political activism was just a part of your world.  BB: Yeah it really was. It was. It wasn&#8217;t like a--now feminism would be a whole another, I mean, my father was very traditional about work, &#8220;you get married, you should quit work. You can be a nurse, but why would you want to be a doctor?&#8221; And my mom probably wasn&#8217;t, but she didn&#8217;t really talk about it. I mean she didn&#8217;t really speak out on it. I just assumed I would grow up and get married, and be somebody&#8217;s wife, an interesting wife. I think I had, there was a character in I guess it&#8217;s a Fari&#241;a book, Been Down So Long it Looks Like Up to Me, it&#8217;s like a professors wife. I remember thinking that&#8217;d be so cool; to be on this campus, and all this stuff, but you know I never thought about being a professor.   JW: So when did that start to change?  BB: Well probably when I didn&#8217;t get married when I got out of college, you know immediately. I was teaching, teaching school, sort of like in a holding pattern. The only reason I was teaching is because I had a Virginia State Teachers Scholarship, so I had to get a cert--I had to be certified. I had to go through that course work. My major was history, so I had to teach secondary history, which since I can&#8217;t coach football was not going to happen [Laughs]. I mean I didn&#8217;t want to particularly, but so I taught fourth grade in Culpeper because at that time I was dating a guy who was at UVA. During that year was when Mannington happened, when the mine blew up in West Virginia, and I think something about that--. Plus, I&#8217;d been involved in some antiwar stuff at Mary Washington which is kind of interesting because Mary Washington has an intimate relationship with Quantico, the marine training. It&#8217;s just down the street, or down the road not the street. Anyway, there was, that was--I did some stuff there, and at Culpeper I really, I just realized that I didn&#8217;t want to be there. I wanted to be back in the mountains, and so then I moved back and went back to Clinch Valley and got certified to teach elementary or Pre-K and elementary, and then got involved with, stayed involved with anti-war stuff, there was some anti-war, and that was when the Earth Day started and Helen [Lewis] was at Clinch Valley.   There was a lot of stuff happening around, well, all those issues: the war, the environment, not women, but the other stuff. And we had this--I guess I came back in the fall of [19]69, and then started teaching at our little three room school in January. There were a group of people who were--there were various things happening in Wise County. This was in Wise County, Virginia. There were people, who were the Glenmary sisters, Helen must have told you about that. So those people were all around and had been around for a while, but they were becoming more politicized, more active, and eventually left the church. They didn&#8217;t leave the church but they stopped being nuns. They were still, that hadn&#8217;t happened yet, but they had a house. They had a place where people gathered. The PARC, Peoples Appalachian Research Collective, do you know them at all? They were in West Virginia. They were in Morgantown. They had some kind of, excuse me, connections with the Institute for Policy Studies in New York, I mean in Washington. Maxine [Kenny] actually, that&#8217;s sort of how I think one of her connections to this area too was through IPS, but they were for some reason one of their staff, or one of their people was down here, a couple of them, but they were sort of collecting it with Appalachian Youth now that I look back on it. At the time I did not consider myself an Appalachian&#8212;you know a body to be organized, but I think that was happening.   So a guy named Jack White was a vet--a Vietnam Vet from Wise County who was involved&#8212;and several other people. We organized this music fair. It was a festival in 1970, it was sort of, it was a deliberate effort to bring people together across musical genres but also across political genres you know. But that happened for three years. It was also about the time that the federal special-ed law was passed, and southwest Virginia didn&#8217;t have anyone certified to teach learning disabled kids so they did a--Virginia Commonwealth University put a field based Master&#8217;s Program that was basically free, and so I got into that and got a masters. I was--oh I moved to Knoxville for a year. I forgot about that [laughs].  When Rich [Kirby] and I got together, I&#8217;d actually gotten, I&#8217;d already planned to do this. I was teaching, I taught for one year in a three year school, and I had some issues with the proselytizing in the school system. There was a group from New Jersey, some missionaries, and the kids would all, not the first and the second graders, but the third through the six which was as high as it went, went in and these people told them this story about--I guess it was the frog, and the frog didn&#8217;t go in the pond, and it had been getting warned to go in the pond because winter was coming, but it didn&#8217;t, and then the pond froze over, and the frog died because he hadn&#8217;t listen, and honey you could go out here this evening and get hit by a coal truck, and if you have not accepted Jesus as your Savior you will go to hell; if you don&#8217;t heed the warnings, and so I told the kids that they didn&#8217;t have to go anymore; that I didn&#8217;t believe that.  JW: And what was this?  BB: This was in school. This was school. Yeah these missionaries came into the public school. They were welcomed into the school to do this proselytizing, and I--I don&#8217;t think I protested--I mean maybe I did. I don&#8217;t remember, but I told the kids in my class that they didn&#8217;t have to go if they didn&#8217;t want to, and that I don&#8217;t believe that God was like that. Well then it got out that I was a Buddhist. I guess somebody complained. So I was not going to go back to that school anymore, so I mean they, they didn&#8217;t renew my contract. Although that&#8217;s really--so anyhow, I went to Knoxville and taught in an alternative school for a year (19:50), and that was when the&#8212;the Ackworth community in Knoxville and Laurel theater and all that--you know about that?  JW: Yeah.  BB: That&#8217;s when all that was started, and Rich was all involved with that. Marge Gregg who used to be Sister Ruth with--now there is a whole other batch of people to talk to--that bunch. Monica Apple, the people who were--and Marge actually lives in Elder Hostel or Eldersprit in Abingdon where Monica is. And she&#8217;s an artist. She&#8217;s from Chicago, but she&#8217;s been down here a long time--so all that was happening around Ackworth. The music stuff and the--and there was sort of the ongoing environmental and the strip mining stuff was building up and building up. Then we moved back up there a year later.
And I--what did I do? I don&#8217; know what I did. Floated around probably for a while, I can&#8217;t remember, and then went to Berea, and worked for the Council of the [Southern] Mountains for maybe a year. During that time the Council moved from Berea to Clintwood, Virginia. Do you know the Council?  JW: I know the Council yeah.
BB: Yeah.
JW: But what was your, what kind of work were you doing with them?
BB: I was bookkeeping and that was a disaster. Their bookkeeper left and I was helping do the newsletter and the magazine Mountain Life Work, and this and that. I didn&#8217;t, I ended up quitting that because there were--it was a difficult work situation.
JW: Can we go back a little bit and talk about your work with Appalachian Volunteers?
BB: Sure. Oh yeah.
JW: Just because as you know I mentioned earlier this story--certain parts of that story have been told, but it&#8217;s come up with a couple of people that he gender relations were interesting in the AVs.
BB: Do you know there&#8217;s going to be an AV reunion at the Appalachian Studies Conference in March in Richmond?
JW: No. I should have known that.
BB: Oh yeah. There&#8217;s going to be, there will be a women&#8217;s panel whether it&#8217;ll be only women can get to come to is up for grabs right now.
JW: Is that what you&#8217;re hoping?
BB: I&#8217;d be interested. Yeah. I think it&#8217;d be useful for a bunch of women to meet informally in a way.   JW: Yeah.  BB: There also might me some more formal. Yes, I sort of came out of the Portsmouth Appalachian Conference. There were some formal AVs there. Yeah there were, there were some gender issues that a bunch of people haven't really talked about, haven&#8217;t really figured out. But I was, I mean I don&#8217;t think that involved me too much. It was like the fieldmen with the big guys, and they were so cool and they were all back in their twenties you know. They were a lot of what they called eventually Vistadollies We were AVs at that point, so we weren&#8217;t Vistadollies, but that was the word.
JW Vistadolly?
BB: They&#8217;d say, oh yeah, she was a Vistadolly.
JW: I&#8217;ve never heard that.
BB: I know people who still actually would say--they&#8217;d say oh yeah--she was a Vistadolly. I mean [laughs] some people haven&#8217;t moved as far as you&#8217;d hope they might have in forty years, but I was an AV in the first summer. I was in Rockcastle County which is really rural--I was in a really rural part of Rockcastle County which is south of Berea. I stayed with an old farming couple out on the farm. There was a one room school there. There were four of us. There were three women and a guy. We just organized activities for kids in the schools, and tried to push the schools to get paid and you know--but it was mostly summer--we mostly organized summer youth activities, kids activities. At least that&#8217;s what I remember. I mean we did a play, and crafts.
The second summer I was in Wise County in Coburn, or at Plains Nest which is just outside of Coburn doing more or less the same thing. There was a one room school in that town, and we had some, we worked with kids, but there was more--the second summer we were doing--I think there were about one hundred and fifty AVs the first summer and about five hundred and fifty the second summer, and it&#8217;d be kind of an AV--. I mean this is all the stuff that is in Kiffmeyer&#8217;s book, but it&#8217;d become an A-V-O program.
I had thought about staying, and staying on as a Vista spending a year and doing something [to] organize. There was more organizing around or talking at least the O-E-O programs and how&#8217;d it affect them, so I decided not to, and I went to Mary Washington that fall. So I wasn&#8217;t real involved in--. I mean some of the AVs, some of the AV projects could be pretty militant, but not where I was.
JW: So what point did you, or did you start to think more about feminism and get more involved in any sort of women&#8217;s organizing or activities?
BB: Well, that&#8217;s interesting. I don&#8217;t know. I was trying to think about that. I think probably around the time we worked on the High Knob Festival. I&#8217;d sort of had--it was probably just me being more empowered in my sense about how to deal with men and that I was in, maybe I was like  tired of fooling with them. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;d decided that I was going to not, you know, be involved with men. After I finished, after Rich and I broke up, I wasn&#8217;t going to be in [a relationship], but then we never broke up so here we are [laughs].   JW: Oh you were planning for when you broke up [laughs]?  BB: Yeah. Yeah. I think six months or whatever you know, but we didn&#8217;t which probably meant that I approached that whole relationship in a different kind of way than I would have anything else. It was so funny, when we got married I was planning like &#8220;well once this is over I&#8217;m going to do something else.&#8221; But I remember reading Sisterhood is Powerful and The Feminine Mystique. And I still, I don&#8217;t know if I bought into all of it, but I don&#8217;t think I would have considered myself a feminist. Clearly I thought &#8220;oh yeah some of this is right,&#8221; so around then--I was never part of, I don&#8217;t think I was ever part of a, like a consciousness raising group or anything. I wasn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t remember it, so I must have been to one meeting or something. I don&#8217;t think I ever was, but I was friends with Fran and Brenda and I&#8217;m trying to remember, some of it&#8217;s a little unclear. I was connected through Rich with the Mountain People&#8217;s Rights where Maxine was which was a group of either attorneys or other people who are doing sort of legal activism in eastern Kentucky, but it was all men. The lawyers were all men, yeah.  JW: And at the, what was the festival called, the Kneeknob?  BB: We called it the High Knob music festival. It was High Knob folk rock mountain people old time--I don&#8217;t know. It had a long string.  JW: Was it successful at bringing different groups of people together?  BB: It was sort of. I don&#8217;t know to what end. I think we all had fun over the weekend, but you know, I don&#8217;t remember the second and third year as well as the first year. But the first year we had blues, we had old time music, we had mountain bluegrass, a little bit of rock. There was all kinds, a mix of music.  JW: And what year was the first year?  BB: 1970; fall of 70. And there were two more. I found a letter I&#8217;d written about that to Sue Ella Kobak--is that another name, have you met Sue Ella?   JW: Yeah.  BB: I&#8217;d written, she and John her husband at the time had moved back to Boston about then, and I had written her about that, or them about it. I should go back and look at it, and I mean I started transcribing. And I got distracted, so I haven&#8217;t finished it. But it&#8217;s sort of interesting about the--I&#8217;ve written--I&#8217;ve read reports of the same time that have been written by other people who were involved with it by guys, and it&#8217;s not how I remember it. The collectivity that I remember doesn&#8217;t come through in the published reports that I&#8217;ve read about.   JW: Oh. So what is the contrast that you see between the published reports and what--your view of it?  BB: I would say there was a lot more first person singular in the published reports, and I would have, if I had written it, it wouldn&#8217;t have been that way. &#8220;Back then I did so and so, and then I contacted so and so; I did so and so, and that didn&#8217;t happened so I was able to do this that and the other.&#8221; I was thinking that it would be important that it, etcetera.  JW: When really the mission of the festival was to be--I mean it sounds like it really is of that era of late 60s early 70s collective--.  BB: Yeah. And there were a lot of people involved--excuse me--a lot of people involved. But anyways, It&#8217;s not the kind of thing I want to take on publicly so--.  JW: [Laughs] So how do you see your, how would you describe your relationship to Appalachia over the years? And what is your position that you&#8217;ve been involved in, definitely Appalachian regional stuff, how is--?  BB: Well I guess that, I mean I really feel like I&#8217;m from here, so I feel and recognize that pretty clearly when I left that in fact this is who I was, wanted to be, was from. I guess I&#8217;ve always been, I mean I always had coming out of--my dad was in the union, but there was certainly this kind of sense about how the region was being exploited in a lot of ways, and being around Helen and taking her seminar in college, and then when I came back some of that kind of stuck with me.  I also think the whole thing about being from the South is a whole--. There&#8217;s a huge prejudice against the South in the rest of the country. I think an ignorance. It&#8217;s probably about the rural, the rural anywhere, but it&#8217;s also the South. You know, you hear it in how people react to your accent.   JW: Do you think that&#8217;s changed at all over the years?  BB: Some, but not a lot. I mean not as much as you&#8217;d think it would have. What do you think?  JW: As someone who moved, I mean I don&#8217;t think I realized it until I lived in New York, and then it very much--I mean I was confronted by the stereotypes, and it was really silly stereotypes.  BB: Mm hmm. Yeah.  JW: And then it was during the Bush/Kerry elections that I was in grad school, and I remember a class, and it was only six of us, five or six of us in this reading seminar. Somehow we were talking about the election, and I had said that I wasn&#8217;t sure who--that maybe my dad&#8217;s family--my dad was probably voting for Bush; that I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if he was but for very complicated reasons. Like I wasn&#8217;t just writing him off for that, even if I was supporting a Democrat, and I remember my professor wanted to get him on the phone and had this whole laundry list of arguments that I needed to make to my father. I felt so embarrassed and regretted bringing it up, and there was this whole misunderstanding of--. The reasons why someone ends up at a certain political position aren&#8217;t as easy as maybe they thought, like it wasn&#8217;t about me making some illogical arguments that my professor [laughs] in college throws out.  BB: Right.  JW: And I did have reasonable conversations with my dad about that, and I think in the end I don&#8217;t really know what he did. I&#8217;m not even totally sure he voted, but you know--. He&#8217;s a very intelligent person, and anyways it was just like this moment of &#8220;oh my gosh she is just seeing my family and like anyone I know from Tennessee as completely a caricature of the red state,&#8221; you know all those maps with like red state/blue state. I hate those things.  BB: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm hmm.  JW: So yeah. I don&#8217;t know how much--I mean it&#8217;s probably different, but I don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s gotten better.  BB: Yeah it&#8217;s different. As long as you keep hearing, as long as the word redneck is used the way it&#8217;s used you know, okay, something has not changed.   JW: So how would you define feminism? I guess more in a personal sense. How do you see it working in your own life history?  BB: Well I guess the, I mean the sort of--the most salient thing was just, would be an opposition to all the assumptions of what you can and can&#8217;t do; who you are and who you aren&#8217;t based on your gender. For a while I suppose, there was a while I would have said, well it&#8217;s about patriarchy and sort of all the -isms that you can say; this is a result of racism, it&#8217;s a result of patriarchy or it&#8217;s a result of--I think it&#8217;s all more complicated than that, but there clearly. I mean look at the whole stuff both fundamentalist religion, really any fundamentalist religion, but particularly with Islam right now. I mean it&#8217;s kind of like totally defining people by gender, and I think that&#8217;s where feminism is the opposite. I would, the other thing--. I probably ahve differences with my daughter&#8217;s generation about the role of sort of overt female characteristics. Thinking about the high heels and it&#8217;s like &#8220;oh god please why are you doing that? Prancing around?&#8221;  JW: The Lady Gaga generation.  BB: Yeah. But, but a lot of those people are still very clear about who they are and what they want to do. They don&#8217;t feel limited by--that doesn&#8217;t, they don&#8217;t--their definition of who they are sort of includes this prancing around, but it&#8217;s not like having to. I think? I mean I think there is a lot that is having to especially with high school kids sort of objectifying themselves.  JW: Is that difficult to see? I kind of wonder when you think about generations of women who identify as feminists. But they have a different idea about sexuality, or their performance of sexuality?  BB: Yeah. Yeah. It&#8217;s probably performance. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s you know a little, but you just have to say, well I mean as soon as you know people as who they are, you can say &#8220;pull your skirt down, pull your shirt up, cover up your buyt [laughs],&#8221; But they don&#8217;t--&#8220;Mother&#8221;! I mean my nieces, they are even worse, not worse but you know they just--I mean it&#8217;s different, and maybe it&#8217;s just like being much freer; not worrying about it.[Pause] I&#8217;ve seen some killer shoes.  JW: [Laughs].  BB: &#8220;Don&#8217;t wear those too much!&#8221;  JW: Well  s someone who has spent many years working in Appalachia, do you see--and you were here in kind of the crux of these years that we are looking at, the 70s and 80s, do you think the women&#8217;s movement is something that had salience in kind of the communities, people, you were involved with?  BB: Yeah. I think not in the way you, I mean I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d find many people who&#8217;d call themselves feminists&#8212;ever, certainly in the 70s and 80s. I mean the changes of what people think they can do with their lives is just dramatic, in what--in the way you were in the [19]60s and what my nieces think they can do, and what I thought I could do. It&#8217;s totally different.   You know they don&#8217;t, and it&#8217;s true here I think, probably less here because people in general--. What boys and girls think they can do is more limited because, because it is. You know--that&#8217;s one of the good things about our AMI program--you know the youth program. It&#8217;s really trying to get kids to think what can you do; what do you want to do; why do you do;  So sort of open up those vistas for people.   But--and there&#8217;s certainly, there&#8217;s still a lot of, I think young women are probably just a lot more--. I think there&#8217;s a difference. I don&#8217;t know. What was the question? Say it again&#8212;the change?  JW: Oh that it--well or, the change is one part, but then how you think that women--or how the women&#8217;s movement had salience in the [19]70s and &#8217;80s. I mean you said people were less likely to identify as feminists. I wonder why was there that resistance to that. I mean what is the--because there were still women willing to organize and organize together as women, but not call themselves feminists.   BB: Yeah. Yeah. It was more like women--you know we&#8217;d do women&#8217;s classes, women&#8217;s--yeah. I think, well because feminism is a fairly abstract and somewhat academic kind of definition of things. Once you start--women&#8217;s rights is one thing, but feminism--I don&#8217;t, I can remember--. I went back to UT in graduate school in [19]89 and somebody once said &#8220;as a feminist,&#8221; and I thought, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m a feminist.&#8221; So it&#8217;s just like it wasn&#8217;t as relevant maybe as a defining--but I would say women&#8217;s movement would be a different thing. So it was like if you said do you support the women&#8217;s movement, I mean I would have said yes. A lot of people would have said, well, oh women&#8217;s rights. People would have been more likely to say yes.   JW: Yeah, Gaye Evans was saying something similar yesterday that people would say, &#8220;I support women's lib or I support women&#8217;s rights, but I&#8217;m not a feminist.&#8221;  BB: Yeah. So I think the definition of what feminism is then and now, people just aren&#8217;t clear about it.   JW: So from, oh I was going to ask you--.  BB: And I do--I should probably get back in there.  JW: So this will be my last question and then we can wrap up. But you said you took a class with Helen Louis, and I&#8217;m just, I&#8217;m curious what that was like. She&#8217;s a pretty, seems like she would have been a pretty influential [teacher]. I mean she was influential for so many people, but I wonder what it was like at that time having her as a teacher.  BB: Well I&#8217;d known Helen since I was ten. See I lived in--. She was in Wise when we moved to Wise. She and her husband had just moved to Wise.  [Interruption]  So I&#8217;d been around her, knew her and you know, so it was a little different, but I think some of the readings, the stuff that she did in the Appalachian seminar, and the way she did her seminar which was a lot of people coming in and talking and a lot of opportunities was good. I guess that was in Robin when I was at the same town that I was doing--that I was coming back, so it was sort of when I thought &#8220;well I&#8217;m back here now.&#8221; I had her in a sociology class when I was in first year college in Clinch Valley, and I don&#8217;t remember much about that, but the Appalachian Studies stuff--although she was also, she had been in touch with the AVs, and the AVs came, that&#8217;s probably how they came to Clinch Valley. And some various people coming in and out of Wise, and that was partly because of Helen I&#8217;m sure.  JW: Well is there anything you want to close up with or add?  BB: I&#8217;m trying to think about the [19]80s. Well actually the, the &#8217;80s was when there was--. I was organizing in a way that we did--. There were three of us. Three women who were about the same age, and we all had young kids. There was a doctor&#8217;s wife from Dungannon, and a woman whose husband was working with legal services and moved from Georgia, and me, and we went to see--it was, it was the election of Reagan. I mean we really became peace activists, and we started the Appalachian Peace Education center in Abingdon, and so Margaret Fierrabing. That&#8217;s somebody you should talk to.  JW: I&#8217;ve never heard that name.  BB: Well Margaret, she&#8217;s from Baton Rouge. She grew up in the South. She came to southwest Virginia as a doctor&#8217;s wife, and she was a health educator. I&#8217;m not sure where, I can&#8217;t remember where she went to school. But anyhow, for a while she was mayor of Bristol for a while, but she was also really involved with the Appalachia Peace Center.  JW: Fri-  BB: F-e-I, it&#8217;s either F-i-e, or F-, I think it&#8217;s F-e-i-r-a-b-e-n-d. You prounounce it Firerobin, but its FeiraBEND.  JW: Feir-  BB: I think it&#8217;s Fer-F-e-i-r-a-Fire, Fire, wait a minute let me right it down. I can hardly write. F-i-e-r--F-i--Fi-er--yeah it&#8217;s without the &#8220;r&#8221; there. B-e-n-d. Fireabend. I think that&#8217;s right. But she was the mayor of Bristol, Tennessee. She lives in Bristol, Tennessee now. But anyhow we sort of--it was the election of Regan, and sort of the nuclear stuff that he was revving up, and then that whole Civil Rights--I mean that whole Central America issues, so we were--I was pretty active more in the Central America than the other stuff.  JW: And the center was Appalachian Peace Education Center?  BB: And it&#8217;s still there. It&#8217;s not a--. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s an office anymore, but there&#8217;s still a group of people who meet and are active. Another person who was involved and that was her name is--Joan Boone. She lives in Abingdon, and she&#8217;s retired from--she was the librarian. She worked at the library. She grew up in Pocahontas which is a coal camp up on the West Virginia border near Wilcox. I imagine her dad was probably a miner. I don&#8217;t really know, and they were certainly around the school in the [19]70s and the &#8217;80s, the &#8217;80s anyway.   JW: Okay, well thank you.  BB: Yeah. I mean there&#8217;s&#8212;yeah, you could--so there are lots of chapters there. It feels like we just sort of named some chapters.
