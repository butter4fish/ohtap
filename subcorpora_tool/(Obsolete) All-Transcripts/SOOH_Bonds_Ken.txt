 Little Thunder. Today is Thursday, October  9, 2014, and I   m interviewing Ken Bonds in Oklahoma City for the  Oklahoma Native Artists Project sponsored by Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at OSU. We   re at Ken   s office with the firm Wells  Nelson. Mr. Bonds, I understand you   ve had an outstanding business  career, managing investment accounts. Your wife, Gerry, tells me that  you are her announcer for her KOSU radio show because of your  wonderful broadcasting voice, but I   m especially interested in your  support for Native art in the state, and particularly your involvement  with the Red Earth Indian Arts Festival. Thank you for taking the time  to speak with me.  Bonds Delighted to be with you, Julie.  Little Thunder Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  Bonds I was born in Kirkland, Texas, out in West Texas near Childress. This  was in the Depression, of course, and things were tough. My dad was a  farmer, and we lived there about three or four years and moved to  Colorado where he had a job in the prison at Canon City. A few years  there, and then in the mid-   30s we moved to Folsom, southeast  Oklahoma, where I really grew up. Later on, moved to Ardmore,  Oklahoma. That   s where I finished high school and got in the banking  business at the First National of Ardmore.  Little Thunder What kind of presence did art have in your home, growing up?  Bonds Very little because my parents were very poor. Back in those years,  survival was the main impetus for the family life. My mother was part  Cherokee. We   re not sure how much, but had to be nearly three-eighths  to a half Cherokee. Art forms were very important to all that family, the  Hill family. For example, my mother and some of her sisters would do  5  quilting in the fall and winter. They would put quilt tops in art forms  (I   m sure that you   ve seen many of them) that were just absolutely  beautiful. They all seemed to have talent for color and combinations of  colors that were just beautiful, so in that primitive form, it   s been with  me ever since I was born.  Little Thunder How about Native cultures a little bit? Were you around     Bonds Oh, yes. Where I grew up   especially down in southeast Oklahoma, as  you very well know, is Indian country. It   s kind of strange because my  family, we don   t know for sure what our blood level is. When my mom  was getting old and in her early nineties (this was after Red Earth was  started) she was awfully interested in that and my role in it. I asked her,     Mom, why didn   t you all sign up for the Dawes Commission and go  through that process?    She said,    Well, Ken, when I was a girl in  southeast Oklahoma, you didn   t go around bragging about being Indian  back then. We were a proud family, and we didn   t like to sign up for  those government things that told us what to do, so we just never did it,  never thought it was important. We knew who we were, and we just  didn   t sign up.    Since then, it   s been very difficult to trace our history  that far back. Anyway, like I say, the Indian art forms and the use of  colors and so forth in a primitive sense have always been important to  me.  Little Thunder Now, were you interested at all in drawing or painting when you were  growing up?  Bonds I couldn   t draw a birdhouse that a bird would want to live in. I have no  talent for that whatsoever. I like to doodle, but drawing and painting   .  When I try to paint around the house, I get more on me than I do on the  wall, so I   ve never tried to get into that at all. I let others do that, but I  sure do enjoy looking at the good art, especially Western and Native  American art.  Little Thunder So what were your art experiences, maybe in school, even in terms of  just being able to see different kinds of art?  Bonds Well, direct experiences and participating and trying to learn, I never  really got into that, but early on I began to appreciate what I   ve always  called realistic art. I like art that really shows me something I can  recognize. I recognize the talent involved in abstract forms of art, but  it   s never really appealed to me that much. The type of art that your  husband does, for example, is what I like. Art that tells   you can look  at it, and you know what the story is. That   s the kind that I appreciate,  particularly.  6  Little Thunder Did you know by the time you got to high school that you wanted to get  into business, and particularly the banking business?  Bonds Well, you know, it   s interesting you would ask that because the way I  describe it is when I graduated high school my parents were poor, and  we didn   t have much. When I graduated high school in Ardmore,  Oklahoma, I had two choices: work or starve. My choice was an easy  one because of friendly teachers that I had who thought I might have  some kind of promise. I was introduced to one of the local bankers in  Ardmore. They had a job offering for a kid like me. I started the  morning after I got out of high school, and I   ve been doing it ever since.  I was blessed with being given a curious mind. I like to know how  things work, and the opportunity to start out in a bank like that, a small  bank where I have the opportunity to learn everything that goes on, I  was curious about how it worked, and how it fit together, and what  everybody did, and how that all related. I got a graduate degree in  finance, just being able to work in that bank. Then I came to Oklahoma  City in 1951 and joined a large bank, had the same kind of  opportunities, and, again, the rest is history. I   ve had a very interesting  career in banking and investments, and have no regrets of any kind.  Little Thunder How did you meet your wife, Gerry?  Bonds Well, it   s interesting. She grew up in Yonkers, New York, an Italian  Irish family. She got into broadcasting sort of on a dare. Back when she  was growing up there, women were supposed to be school teachers,  secretaries, or that kind of work, so she became a schoolteacher, has a  master   s degree in English. Watching Barbara Walters do her magic  back in those years, she and some friends, she said,    You know, I can  do that.    She went to radio broadcast school, then into television, and of  course, the rest is history.  What she loves to do most is teach. Anyway, she came to Oklahoma  City to Channel 5, the local ABC outlet, and we got acquainted because  of my role in banking and her role in television, just doing civic things.  A number of years after our marriages that we were in at the time  ended, she and I got together. That was twenty-five years ago, and  we   ve had a great run from then. She   s the best thing that ever  happened to me, and we just get along great. She now has her own radio  show, and as you mentioned, I have the pleasure of being her very high-priced  announcer, as you can imagine. (Laughter)  Little Thunder When you   re starting a career, especially after a move, for example,  your move to Oklahoma City, sometimes it   s all-consuming at first. I  7  was wondering how soon it was before you got involved in the civic life  of Oklahoma City?  Bonds That is interesting because as I grew in the banking business and my  job, I got more important jobs as the years went by. A part of that job,  which I was happy about, was that you began to feel a responsibility to  be involved in the community. We taught in banking that we make a  decent living in this community and it   s our job to put something back.  We were not dictated what we should get into, but find something of  interest to us. It wasn   t long until I was on a whole bunch of, not a  whole bunch but a number of boards of nonprofits in Oklahoma City.  Of course, a major responsibility was to be involved in the Chamber of  Commerce, which is a direct link to the way Red Earth got formed,  which we   ll probably talk about later. It was as a part of that  responsibility and my own urge to be involved and to make good things  happen because I got to learn from some business leaders in this town  that I got to know well and became very good friends with.  I looked up to them. I was taught by their example what you do in a  town like this to make things work, make things happier for the citizens,  make a better quality life other than just make money for the bank and  serve bank customer interest. I guess at one time I was on the board of  eight or ten not-for-profits and the Chamber of Commerce. One year I  lost my mind totally I guess, and I was chairman of the United Way  campaign and chairman of the Allied Arts campaign in the same year.  (Laughter) That was a hard   that   s how I got all this gray hair. That  and raising four daughters is the cause of all that. Anyway, it was  through those activities, working in the community that I saw the  importance of, particularly, arts in the schools and in our community at  large. That   s when that interest really began to develop. Then we   ll get  into how Red Earth got started a little later.  Little Thunder Were you starting to collect Native art during this time that you   re  serving on some of these boards?  Bonds Not really, although I began to meet and learn about the lives of some  of our own Oklahoma Indian artists and began to slowly develop an  interest in what they were doing, and the talent that they had, and the  uniqueness of their art forms. It was a gradual learning process. I met  and got to know Bert Seabourn, for example, and Jeanne Rorex  Bridges, for example, and Troy Anderson, and the Tigers, and Merlin  Little Thunder in later years. It was a gradual process, but I really began  to really get to be interested as Red Earth came about and I really got to  know Indian artists. I thought, ooh I want   .  8  Little Thunder To really see.  Bonds Yeah, I need one of those. Yes, I   d like to have one.  Little Thunder Let   s talk about how you and   I understand that you and Justice   Yvonne  Kauger have been dubbed sort of the father and mother of  Red Earth.  Bonds Yeah.  Little Thunder How did you two meet each other?  Bonds We met in a similar way to what Gerry and I did. We worked together  on   we were on the Lyric Theatre board together for several years way  back there, and we developed a friendship. I   ve always wanted to be  around people who were a lot smarter than I was and who knew a lot  more than I did. I have to say that wasn   t very difficult. I could learn  from a lot of people. We just developed a friendship, and we sort of fell  into the habit of having lunch together three or four times a year and  solving world problems and just having a fun friendship together. It was  during one of those in, like, the mid-   80s,    84 or    5, something like that,  when we were talking at lunch that day.    Isn   t it a shame that some of  our great Native American artists who live right here,    known to her  and to me because she had a number, and does, friendships with our  great Native American artists   .  We got to talking about what a shame it is that those great artists have  to go to Santa Fe and to all over the country to show and to sell their  work when there ought to be a great outlet for it right here in Oklahoma  and Oklahoma City. That was the germinating idea behind the Red  Earth Festival. Now, there   s another key ingredient that caused it to  happen that relates to cowboys and Indians. Again, I already mentioned  that I was active in the Chamber of Commerce at the time. Oklahoma  City had just lost the National Finals Rodeo because we couldn   t  compete with Las Vegas, who offered a million dollars for the event.  We couldn   t match that, so we were all crying our tears about what a  shame it is we lost the cowboys to Las Vegas. That mood was here.  Out of that luncheon came an idea in my head that (I was on the board  of the Chamber) I should go to a board meeting and say,    We   ve lost  the cowboys. Why don   t we create and Indian event here in Oklahoma  City that might even be better than that by showing Indian art in an  appropriate format and a great event, and at the same time show Indian  culture in the form of dance and any other form that we could develop?  Not a powwow, now, but an event that really spotlighted Native  9  American culture in all of its beautiful forms, that would appeal to the  public that we could sell tickets to.    That sort of thing. Well, I presented  that idea to the Chamber board meeting one time and I got everybody,     Oh, no, that   s not going to work. I don   t think you can get those Indian  tribes to work together,    and something or other.  I said,    Well, let   s try it. Let   s try it.       Okay,    they said. I went around  to all my friends in business at the Chamber, and I said,    My bank will  give five thousand for the first one. I want you to do that much, too.     You know, the old game we play about how to raise money, you shame  them into doing it if for no other reason. We raised in the business  community  50,000 that first year. We got the Chamber to give us some  office help and in effect contribute in that fashion. Leroy Bridges and  Kelly Haney and some of our friends in politics got some state help,  and, again, the rest is history. We struggled. There were some of us,  Allie Reynolds and a whole bunch of people who helped us get it  started, Doug Cummings and Leroy Bridges and many others, we were  down there counting one-dollar bills at twelve o   clock at night. We  were selling t-shirts and prints and doing everything we could.  We had a lot of fun, but that event   . You know, my dream was that we  would get it started; it would be so great that we   d sell more than  enough tickets to pay all the costs and we wouldn   t have to go around  asking for money in the community. Well, that dream has never come  true yet. (Laughter) Some people think we make all the money in the  world, which we never have, but the event as you know is one of the  best in the country, has a life of its own. You can imagine how proud I  am to be Justice Kauger   s partner in the formation of that. She, of  course, was a key to making it happen because of the idea to start with,  as well as Justice Kauger, as you may know, is very hard to say no to.  She used her influence in many ways to help us to get started and help  the event to become what it is now.  A long answer to your question, but as you can tell, there are a number  of kind of weird events that had to come together to make the idea  germinate and then develop into what it has become, to be able to create  a venue where our great artists could show their work, could sell it. One  of the more interesting things to me is very quickly we began to get  media attention from France, from Japan, (the Japanese love Indians  and cowboys, as you know) and Europe. After about the second or third  year, we began to get back four-color articles from French magazines,  from German magazines, British magazines, about what a great event  this is. It   s a photographer   s dream for sure.  10  Little Thunder Right. So this whole process of preparing the groundwork didn   t take  much more than a year? Red Earth started in    79 right? Was that the  first year?  Bonds No, let   s see. We   re twenty   the next one will be twenty-nine years  old, so that would   ve been in the   80s, yeah, yeah, the   80s. Again, it  was a struggle from year one because, first of all   .  Little Thunder But within that year you had the festival.  Bonds Oh, yes.  Little Thunder Okay, that   s what I wanted to   .  Bonds Yeah, the first year, we got it off the ground, and I don   t know how.  Some of us look back and say it must   ve been divine intervention  because there   s no other way you can really explain that it happened.  Little Thunder Yeah, and I think there was a sense from the vendors that first year, it  was very exciting, but you didn   t exactly feel like every merchant was  behind it. That was a kind of palpable feeling down here, downtown, so  it   s amazing that you were able to   .  Bonds Oh, yes, we kind of worried or concerned for years that the whole  business of Indians, Indian history, Indian culture is so taken for granted  still in the state of Oklahoma. I mean, so what? That   s how we got  started here  So, okay, Indian art, okay, fine, yeah. It was in a way a  mystery to us that we were getting less attention from our own  community than we were from surrounding areas, surrounding states,  and surrounding countries. That was a surprise to us early on. I  remember some of my old golf cronies at the Oklahoma City Country  Club, after the first, second, third, and fourth year, I   d say,    Have you  guys been to Red Earth yet?    They   d say,    What? Red what?     These are guys who were interested in the community, as I was. It took  years for it to earn its spot in the community. Sure, artists said when  they would sell a picture, it would be somebody from Dallas or Houston  or somewhere, not somebody from Oklahoma City, or Norman, or  Edmond. We all wondered about that, but then again, it had to come out  of what I say: we   ve always taken Indians and Indian culture for  granted here. So how does it become new and something really to go  see, to go buy a ticket and see?  Little Thunder Right. I don   t know if from Gerry   s position   did she do a little  interviewing to sort of publicize the event, or was there anything she     11  Bonds Gerry became   for a northeastern girl who didn   t even know where  Oklahoma was until they brought her out here for a television job, she  quickly fell in love with Oklahomans, with Indians because she knew if  she was going to get together with me there would be some Indian  influences here and there. She fell in love with this country, with its  people, and especially with Native American art and history and  culture. She, in her professional life, has been one of our greatest fans  of the event and what we are trying to do. I remember when she did her  weekly television interview show at OETA and when she was still with  Channel 5, every year she would interview   . The first year she did this  at OETA, Justice Kauger and yours truly were interviewees on that  program. She   s had a program about Red Earth on television and radio  every year since. If we   ve got a better fan, I don   t know who it would  be.  Little Thunder That   s great. So you   ve sort of given us an insight into all the hard work  even after the event was over.  Bonds It was a labor of love, by the way. It was a labor of love.  Little Thunder Do you remember any special moments or highlights when everything  started, because of course there were was the opening and the parade?  I don   t know if you have any funny stories you might want to share  about that.  Bonds Well, some of the funny stories from an insider   s viewpoint would be     and I failed to mention Phil Lujan. Phil is with the University of  Oklahoma, as you know, and their Native American History program  down there. He was also one of our very first worker bees. I remember  some of the funny things about the event. We wanted to keep it pure  you know. You can   t bring Japanese, Mexican, Chinese stuff into this  event. It just so happened that Allie, and Phil, and Doug Cummings,  and I became sort of, let   s say, the police of the material that we would  allow to come.  Little Thunder You were kind of jurying things in?  Bonds Yeah, we juried the artists to start with, but then some of the jewelers  and those who came to sell jewelry and other art forms from New  Mexico and other places. Once in a while, maybe a little certainly non-  Native American material would show up in their booths. We would go  around and explain to them very quickly the advantage to them of  getting that back in the trunk of their car. (Laughter) We had some  interesting events there. Again, looking back on the early history, those  late-night, counting-money events, counting t-shirts, just doing all the  grunt stuff that an event like that takes, we   ve got an army of volunteers  12  now that do all that. It   s much more organized. We weren   t that  organized in the early years, but we had a lot of fun.  Somehow we all sensed that we were a part of something really very  valuable and that we had an opportunity here to do what we really set  out to do in the first place. Our main goal was to help our Oklahoma  Native American artists to show their ware and to be recognized for the  talent that they collectively had, that awareness that,    Hey, you know  this   .    We could make the Chamber of Commerce proud of what  we   re doing as opposed to doubting that we could pull it off. Early on,  that became an awareness that we had that this is valuable, this is worth  doing here. I think that drove us all.    Let   s keep doing it. Let   s keep  using up our friendships around town to raise money.    (Laughs)  I remember one of my great friends was Jim Harlow, who was CEO of  Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company at the time. He, like me, was  active on the Chamber board. We worked with and against each other at  every fundraising effort in the city, so we knew each other well. I   d go  over to his office to see him about his annual contribution, willing  contribution, to Red Earth. He would say to his secretary,    Okay, let  Bonds in here. He   s got his Red Dirt project that he wants me to give  some money to.    All that went on in the background during all those  years. It was fun, but it was hard work, too. Some of those guys dreaded  coming to see me, but it was in the same spirit that they dreaded me  coming to see them when it was United Way time and all that. But it  became my Red Dirt project. (Laughter)  Little Thunder So how long did it take before there was a decision to have a board and  eventually an office?  Bonds Well, actually, I guess we put together pretty good governance early on  because that first year was just kind of a hodge-podge of people coming  together and trying to get it done, the chamber help, volunteer help, and  so forth. After we made it the first year   and we had some funding  coming in that we were accountable for. All of us involved from the  business community, we knew what we had to do to provide the kind of  governance that we needed. Again, we wanted it to have a solid base to  operate around (and I   m not putting them down) as opposed to a  powwow environment to where everybody just kind of comes together  and they sing and dance and do things.  We put together a board that we thought had appropriate Indian  representation, but also people from the business community who knew  how to raise money, who knew how to organize an event, who knew  how to budget, who knew how to make sure that we took in at least  what we paid out. Otherwise, we   d be in trouble in a hurry. After that  13  first year, we put together the kind of governance that really is still in  effect. We wound up with kind of a merger of Red Earth, because they  were natural partners, and the (I   ve forgotten the exact name of it)  Native American institute that was then located out at the  Kirkpatrick   Science Museum where the office stayed for many years. The goals of  Red Earth and then this Native American organization were so common  that we were a natural merger. We put those boards together, and in  effect, that   s the organization that exists to this day, became Red Earth  in its official form.  Little Thunder How about deciding on a venue?  Bonds Ah, yes. We have experimented some with that. We started first at what  is now the Cox Convention Center, and that worked for several years.  We got our place in line, as far as timing of the event, the first weekend  in June. Around the country you have to work into a schedule of Native  American events. Once you get into that schedule you have to stick with  it or you   ll be in conflict with drum groups, dancers, artists, etcetera.  After we earned that spot, then we began to have difficulty with the  Convention Center of conflicting events they might want to have there,  and we got some pressure.    Could you change your event to another  time so we could allow this event to come to Oklahoma City?    We said,     Can   t do that because we are now in the schedule and we   ve got to  stay there.    That caused us to move to the fairgrounds for a couple  years. That worked but not as well. Came back to downtown, and then  the primary reason was the prices got too high.  After the Chickasaws bought Remington Park, (it wasn   t me) somebody  else got the idea that perhaps a move out there might work. That was  tried last year. Worked in some ways okay; in some ways not okay. It  wasn   t too good for dancers because it was outside. June can be hot, and  so that didn   t work too well. We   re now back downtown with a much  better deal at the Convention Center. It is not pressured so much  anymore about conflicting events and timing because of the other  facilities that are now here. Pricing is now better there than it was, so  for all those reasons, I think we   re probably back to the best venue of  all, that fits all of the reasons for having the event better than any other  place. I think we   re probably there to stay, hopefully. Fingers crossed.  Our history would tell us that probably is the best place for us to stick  with.  Little Thunder We   re going to segue a little bit into some of your own Native art  collecting here pretty quickly, but I did want to ask, too, about a couple  of things: how the festival, not just in terms of venues, but how it  changed from the    80s to the    90s, maybe some general statements, and  then from the    90s to the 2000s.  14  Bonds We have never wavered from our original purpose, and that   s primarily  to spotlight Native American art. As far as changes, I guess the more  significant change that the board and the leadership have developed  over the years has been an urge to move the nature of the art exhibited  and sold to original works, as opposed to   . Let me back up a little bit.  Indian artists over the years through technology have learned to convert  their work into other forms that are more available and affordable to the  general public, in the form of tiles and prints of all kinds, and tiles on  box gadgets and things so that they can sell their art to people who can   t  afford an original. There were some strains involved in that process.  I   ve always been on the side of   my view has always been, I don   t  know a lot of really rich Native American artists, and so my urge is to  do everything we can to help them improve their financial status as they  develop their art form. An old banker, bottom-line guy like me, that   s  the attitude I would take, within reason, now.  We don   t want them selling junk, but within reason let   s let them  display their art in any fashion they can that   s classy but yet let them  distribute their art to more and more people who will fall in love with  what they do. As I say, there have been some stresses along that line,  and I suppose I   d have to say the nature of the art allowed has tended to  go more toward what I call the art museum forms, that is, originals and  quasi-original artwork. Again, there are arguments on both sides as to  how you do that, but I   d say that   s been the primary change. We   ve lost  some artists who don   t come because they can   t sell the full array of  what they produce, and others, I guess, who are glad about it, who are  more popular and can sell their work. That   s probably developing, and  over time will probably come more, I hope, back to the middle of the  road. Like I say, until all of our artists are really rich, I   d like to see  them prosper in any way they can that   s within reason.  Little Thunder How about when the 1990 Indian Arts and Crafts Act was passed? Do  you remember some of those discussions?  Bonds Oh, yeah, and what   s Native American and what isn   t. Yeah, and that  too, as most things do, there are arguments on both sides. See, if I were  a great Native American artist, which I am not, but if I were, like Bert  Seabourn, like Jeanne Rorex Bridges, like Troy Anderson, and others  that I can   t think of at the moment, they can   t say that their original art  is Native American because they cannot prove with a card arising from  the Dawes Commission that they are in fact what they say. They know  who they are. Everybody else knows who they are. If I were a great  artist, I couldn   t say   I   ve got to go around the horn to describe who I  am and the nature of what I produce.  15  I think that law, I guess, is primarily, back to your question, is like a lot  of other things. It had a good idea. We don   t want Japanese with no  Native American blood to say they   re selling Native American art, but  on the other hand it   s a real problem for these known Native American  artists who can   t properly describe their work. That to me is a good idea  kind of gone bad. I suppose over time it   s kind of sorting itself out. At  least I hope it is. I wish we could change it, frankly, to allow some other  kind of compromise that would be fair to everyone. I know I am part  Cherokee, but I can   t prove it, and that   s the fix that some of the others  are in, as well.  Little Thunder What about the decision to have permanent staff and a permanent  office?  Bonds It   s because the idea got such solid feet under it. The Native American  museum that we, in effect, merged with began to collect items that were  valuable so that we had the beginnings of a museum for full-time  display, along with the energy of the annual event called Red Earth.  Staffing became important. Then we developed attraction as a Native  American museum as more and more tourists come to Oklahoma and to  Oklahoma City. What do they want to see when they come to  Oklahoma? They want to see cowboys, and they want to see Indians  and Indian art and so forth. We were at the science museum for many  years, but as Oklahoma City downtown has been reborn, it became  smart (I wish I had developed the idea, myself) to bring our visibility  downtown.  We   re now over here in the Plaza next to the Skirvin, next to the Chase  Bank, and with great visibility. Of course, that   s been a wonderful thing  for Red Earth and the Red Earth Museum. That will just get better, and  especially get better since they have actually redone that building over  there and made it much more attractive, and much more attractive to  visitors to come in and see Red Earth. That   s one of our better moves.  We are there to stay. We   ll be a factor from now on in what we present  to visitors to Oklahoma and Oklahoma City, for sure. I think we   re the  best, but we   re certainly one of the more attractive ones, for sure.  Little Thunder And does part of the funding for that come from the festival, then?  Bonds Yes, the funding sources for the museum, they charge small amounts  for admittance on occasion and they have some forms of ongoing  revenue. The museum and the event still require subsidies from the  community and from the state of Oklahoma. The state can certainly  afford to support it because of all the tourist traffic that comes to  Oklahoma just because of it, or certainly as one of the reasons to come  here. So funding for the museum and the event comes from all kinds of  16  sources but primarily subsidized funding by the community, state arts  council, and then, of course, the ticket sales from the event and artist  booth fees, etcetera, etcetera. Not nearly enough. We   d like to have ten  million dollars in endowment funds to help us, but it   s the kind of thing,  the museum and the event, probably never should get to be self-supporting  because it is so deserving of public support because of all  that it represents. I   m not embarrassed anymore to ask people to give it  money to make it happen. I never was embarrassed, but I   m sure not  anymore. (Laughter)  Little Thunder You   ve explained that while you quickly saw the value of promoting  Native art and got people onboard, you weren   t doing quite so much  collecting, yourself, but it then began a little bit when     Bonds Oh, yeah.  Little Thunder    the festival started.  Bonds Oh, yeah.  Little Thunder So did you and Gerry   we   ll talk a little bit about what you like and  what you   ve collected. Did you and Gerry both look at the same time?  Did you have different tastes? How did that work out?  Bonds That   s a good question because we do have, as you might expect,  somewhat different tastes, but we both like   . Well, I hate to use names  because I   ll leave out some of the favorites. We   ve already talked about  Jeanne Rorex Bridges, who is not only one of our favorite artists but she  and J. R. are close personal friends, as well. For many years when they  came to Red Earth, they stayed at our house, and we were delighted to  have them. Gerry has always been attracted, as I have, to Jeanne   s form  of showing strong, positive, Cherokee women. Many people don   t  realize this, but I suppose of all the tribes, women in Cherokee history  were important, not that they weren   t in other tribes, but they kind of  ran the tipi in Cherokee history.  Jeanne, in her unique way has shown Cherokee women for what they  were, strong, powerful, talented, and we like that. Of course, I fall in  love with her barns. I just love her barn scenes. We have, I don   t know,  five or six originals of some of her women things but also her barns. I  have one in my office that you probably saw. Then as kind of an  interesting contrast, we love Ben Harjo   s things. You saw the great Ben  Harjo   . Ben, like my mom and her sisters putting quilt tops together,  Ben has an absolutely fascinating talent of combining colors in ways  that few can, not the descriptive realist kind of art that I   m most  attracted to but in a very attractive sort of way.  17  Now, your own husband  Merlin Little Thunder , for example, does  some work that I   m just fascinated by. You look at one of his scenes,  and you know what the story is. It   ll grab you when you see it. Troy  Anderson and the work that he does is a favorite. We were talking about  Native American artists being allowed to sell reproductions of their  work in all kinds of forms. For example, on the front of my car, I have a  license plate of one of Troy   s beautiful Indian women. It   s a license  plate on the front of my car. I don   t feel I   m degrading Troy   s brilliant  artwork by having that there. I like for people to ask me,    That   s really  pretty. Who did that?    (Laughter)  That   s an aside from the kind of stuff that I like to put in my house.  Kelly Haney, some of his work, Cheryl Davis, we have some of each of  them. I regret starting to go into names so much because I   ll  automatically leave out a whole bunch. I like them all, frankly. I like the  Tigers. Dana Tiger does beautiful work. One of my daughters is just  crazy about her art form. Again, I think that   s why our event is so  popular, because you line up our Native American artists in about five  or six rows and show their work, you   ve got to get people walking up  and down saying,    Wow, isn   t that something? That   s great     Sure I   ve  got a few favorites, but they   re all my favorites. I like them all. I like  what they do.  Little Thunder It sounds like two-dimensional is sort of the art form that grabs you, the  paintings...  Bonds Oh, yeah.  Little Thunder    a little bit more than the sculptures.  Bonds Yeah. I think sculptures   I   m glad you asked that because I never  really thought of it in those terms. I   ve got two or three sculptures, but I  suppose in fairness I have to say I like pictures in my house and in my  office that I never tire of looking at. I like pictures that when I walk in  on Monday morning and see my Jeanne Bridges barn there   . Every  once in a while, I   ll sit there and look at it, and I   ll find something new  about it that I hadn   t seen before. That   s what I guess I   d have to  confess appeals to me most about Native American art as opposed to  sculptures and other forms because I get that kind of satisfaction just by  daily enjoyment of looking at them. Sculptures, to me more than  anything   like that cowboy behind you there with a rope, I love  looking at that, but it doesn   t have the same effect on me as paintings  do. I   m glad you asked that  I   d never thought of that before.  18  Little Thunder I was going to ask if your daughters are Native Art collectors, or  possibly grandchildren? What do they think about your Native art?  Bonds My daughters particularly   my oldest daughter, who   s a nurse, lives in  Phoenix. She has in her house every Red Earth poster since year one.  They   re on her walls. She also is a great friend of Jeanne   s. I know I   ve  overused Jeanne   s name in this interview because she   s special for other  reasons. But, yeah, my oldest daughter is particularly proud of the  whole history of Red Earth and of my involvement in it. All four of  them are, but especially Linda. She will fight anybody over her dad   s  role in Red Earth for all these years. She   s very proud.  Little Thunder You mentioned how your involvement with the festival got you into  collecting Native art. Can you think of someone else who might   ve not  been so crazy about the idea, who ended up just really becoming a big  Native art fan because of the festival?  Bonds Well, yes, and I could say a bunch of people. Again, I don   t want to  start naming names because I   ll leave out a bunch, but that has been one  of the more fascinating results here of people who have become aware,  going past that taking for granted Indians and Indian history. There  have been a lot of    aha   s.    Hey  These people are good, and they are  good for our town. They   re good for our state. It   s good for our image  for people to know in a much more graphic way that these people are  from Oklahoma, they learned their art here, and they are reason for us to  be proud of them.    Lots of    aha   s.  I can think of one who happens to be a close friend and one of my  doctors. He and his wife, as far as I know, before had no particular  interest in Indian art, have become avid volunteers for the event. Now,  here   s a busy doctor. I   ve seen him at the Red Earth event; he and his  wife, both, selling t-shirts and prints. They are examples of people who  have had a major turnaround in their attitude toward the value of Indian  art. That, too, is a very good question I   m glad you asked. I hadn   t  thought particularly of that result right here in our town.  Little Thunder What do you see as the future for the Red Earth Festival?  Bonds I see it getting bigger and better for several reasons. Like any event like  that, it grows in quality every year. The awareness of its value grows  every year, probably slower than I would like to have seen but  nevertheless there. But it will also benefit from the absolute rebirth of  this city and the state of Oklahoma, but particularly Oklahoma City  where I-35 and I-40 cross. Tourism, the awareness of the quality of life  here, we   re getting articles in the Wall Street Journal now about how  19  young people in the East and all over the country are saying,    Hey,  Oklahoma City is a great place to live      You know, that   s not going to stop. That   s going to get better, and it   s  going to grow. Red Earth has to be a beneficiary of that growing  attitude that this is a great place, there   s a lot to offer here. One of the  things this area has to offer that nobody in the world can and that is its  abundance of talented Native American artists who have art forms that  you will find nowhere else in the world. Do I sound like the Chamber of  Commerce with that? (Laughter) Red Earth has to be a beneficiary of  the rebirth of this area.  Little Thunder Right. Well, is there anything else you   d like to discuss before we   I  think we   re going to take a look at a couple of the Tigers since they   re  in here and that they are yours.  Bonds I would only like to summarize my own experience with Red Earth as  the pride that I have, particularly in my partner Justice Kauger for the  contribution that she made to get it started throughout the twenty-eight  years that the event itself has been underway, the pride in seeing the  event listed in the National Geographic, for example, and publications  everywhere, seeing business people come through here. A major Coca-  Cola executive came through here and spent a couple of years, and he  became a Red Earth fan while he was here. Not only the whole area (his  company looks to this area as a great growth area) but the quality of life  thing is very important to them, and he particularly notes that Red Earth  is an example of the uniqueness of this area.  From my vantage point now, I   m now an elder, which means I   m an old  guy in the hierarchy of Red Earth, which means nobody pays attention  to what you think anymore. Being in that category, I can look back with  nothing but pride in having a small role in getting it started. I guess the  only regret I would have is that we didn   t do it a lot sooner than we did  because it deserved to have life. It just took kind of an accidental  conversation between two people at lunch to get the idea to germinate  and to take off. Again, the only regret I have is we didn   t start it twenty  years sooner.  Little Thunder How big is your volunteer force now? That might be a good way to  summarize the growth.  Bonds I don   t know an exact number, Julie. I would have to put it in hundreds  for sure. There are people who have done it for years and still want to  sign up to help in any way they can because they sense the excitement.  How could you not get excited when you see all the dancers come into  the arena, for example? How could you not get excited walking up and  20  down the aisles of the art section and not say,    Wow  This is wonderful  stuff     That pride and that awareness of the value of this art is what  brings people back and say,    Hey, we want to do that again.     I don   t know that we   ve ever had to fire any volunteers. (Laughter) We  seem to attract enough of them. It   s kind of an army they get over there  that love to do this. The volunteer board members that give a lot of time  and effort and money and influence to making it successful, you don   t  see them so much. They   re not out there selling t-shirts, maybe, but  they   re sure making a large contribution to making it successful,  lawyers, teachers, doctors, everybody who get involved in board  membership or volunteering in any way. That also tells me that we  started something that has value.  Little Thunder Right. Okay, Ken, we   re looking at some of the artwork from your  office. Do you want to tell us about these pieces?  Bonds Again, the barn is representative of one side of Jeanne Bridges    work, in  addition to her wonderful work of Cherokee women. I love her barn  scenes because I   m an old country kid, grew up on a farm, and that sort  of scene is comforting to me. I just like it. As I said earlier, I never get  tired of looking at a scene like that. Every day when I look at it three or  four times, at least, I just get very much pleasure out of putting myself  there with jeans and boots on, and maybe going in there and saddling  the horse, and go riding around the meadow there for an hour or so to  get my thoughts together. (Laughter)  Little Thunder A real pretty sky on that one.  Bonds Then I think the contrast of this Ben Harjo piece is an example of, I  wouldn   t say my favorite art form because my favorite art form is like  the barn. This is a favorite of mine because I think Ben not only is a  great friend and a wonderful guy, but I think he is one of the most  talented artists in the country that I   ve ever seen who puts colors  together in absolutely fascinating ways and depicts scenes in his unique  format that are very pleasing and very appealing. I just think Ben is one  of the best, and I love having one of his pieces in my office that I can  look at every day.  Little Thunder Well, thank you very much for your time today, Ken.  21  Bonds Oh, you   re very welcome. I hope it   s turned out to be kind of what you  were after. I know I   m not as good as Kauger, but hopefully I   m funnier  than she is. (Laughter) I tell her,    Let me do the funny stuff, and you do  the politics.    She   s a great lady.  -------  -------
