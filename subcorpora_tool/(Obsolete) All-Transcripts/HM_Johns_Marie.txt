Story_ID: 191504
Speaker 1: We're going into talking about your family background and tell me a little about your mom, and what was her name, where was she born, where'd she grow up and what do you know about her background and her growing up?
Speaker 2: My mother was--my mother's name is Frieda Delight Casey Collins.  I guess I should first explain the Delight, that's an unusual name but it is a family because she was named after one of her aunts who was named Delight Casey so my mother is Frieda Delight Casey Collins.  She was born in Marion, Indiana a small town in northeastern Indiana.  She was the second oldest child of Corda and Zenobia Ward Casey.  She grew up in a small Midwestern town and was very much shaped by that.  A woman of very strong values, very strong work ethic all which she imparted to her three daughters.  As the oldest girl she had a lot of responsibility in the family, and is something of a--at least growing up was something of you know, the typical oldest sister role, she played that in the family for her younger siblings as well as for extended members of the family, cousins and so on.  She has always been career minded even as a young woman.  The times and family circumstances did not allow her to get a college education.  It was a time when there was more of a focus on the males of the family having that opportunity, and so my uncle who is deceased was able to become a dentist but in order for that to happen from a family of my grandparents' means, it meant that everyone else in the family had to sacrifice for that to happen and so I think one thing that my mother has always longed for was the opportunity to further her education, and since she was not able to do that she really, really imprinted on her daughters the importance of doing so and so it's a blessing that each of her girls has an advanced degree.  In fact my youngest sister is working on a Ph.D. in the final stages of her doctorate [degree] from the University of Illinois so I think each of us in our own way carried that part of mother's desire with us as we moved through our careers.
Speaker 1: As you were growing up did she share any stories with you of her early childhood?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, she would talk all the time about growing up and trips to the country.  My grandparents had some farmland on the outskirts of Marion.  She would talk fondly about growing up and the family reunions that they would have when she was a youngster and that's a tradition that continues even to this day.  We all make a trip back to Marion, Indiana for the family reunion the first Sunday in August, so that was a tradition certainly that was--that was one that was very dear to her and that we heard many stories about.  She also talked about the times and the limits for women of that time.  She was very conscious about that even at that stage of the game, even before women's liberation per say was something that was a widely understood concept, but mother talked about feeling the pressures and the limits on her life as a woman and as a black woman, and that was something that's also a thread through the stories that she would share.  How her brothers, for example, had more latitude in terms of what they could do and where they could go and as opposed to her and she didn't like that.  I mean she expressed frustration about that as part of her growing up experience, but it was a big family, a very loving family, five siblings, a family where food and fellowship were very important aspects of their lives and again that's something that we share even today, that food is a big part of our family celebrations and our way of expressing love to one another.
Story_ID: 191505
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your father, his name (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father was a big city fellow.  His name Richard Delon Collins, and he is--he was born in Indianapolis, Indiana.  He is the--also the second eldest of five so my mother [Freida Casey Collins] and father share the same birth order and they had the same number of siblings, each had four siblings.  My father came from a family of all boys.  My grandparents, Justus and Marjorie Collins were--my grandfather was an entrepreneur so he was quite, quite a pioneer if you could consider, you know, Indianapolis, Indiana in the '40s [1940] and '50s [1950], it was not a particularly friendly place for a black man trying to build a business, but my grandfather was a businessman, he had a landscaping company that he grew to a sizeable level.  My father worked for a time in the business, but actually none of his sons really had a desire to carry on the business which I now regret.  I think it's unfortunate that no one had the spark to do that because had they done so it could now be quite a significant enterprise, but that just wasn't meant to be so each of my uncles went in a different direction.  As far as my father was concerned, he went into law enforcement and was a police officer in Indianapolis, was--he in his own way was in a pioneering role because he was on the police force just as it was being integrated and when he retired, he retired as a lieutenant which was, as I think back on it, as I've gotten older and think back on his career, I know that had to have been very difficult being a police officer in the Midwest at a time when there weren't that many African Americans in that line of work.
Story_ID: 191506
Speaker 1: So you did grow up with your siblings and your parents [Freida Casey Collins and Richard Collins]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the small town in Indiana?
Speaker 2: Well, I--my parents, my mother left Marion, Indiana and moved to Indianapolis [Indiana] after she had finished secretarial school to take a job and that's where she met my father.  She was about twenty-two when they met and married and so my home has been Indianapolis, Indiana.
Speaker 1: And tell us a little about your early memories of growing up there?
Speaker 2: Indianapolis was still very segregated during my early years.  One memory that's vivid for me is the fact that there was an amusement park in Indianapolis, Riverside Amusement Park, and of course as every child would want to, I would want to go to the amusement park but it was off limits to black children except for one day a year when it was opened up for the black children in town to come and my father being the race man that he is, said that if his children could not go to the amusement park every day, then there was no way he would allow us to go on the one day.  So I always remember that.  At the time as a youngster, I remembered being angry because I really wanted to do that, to go to the amusement park but as I got older and more aware of the offensiveness of that practice, understood what segregation and racism were all about then I completely reversed my view of my father's actions and I was very proud of the fact that he said that we wouldn't go that one year because he was absolutely right.  Indianapolis was a place where there were--it was clear there were white people and there were black people.  There was not any other diversity during the time of my growing up whereas now you find a number of different ethnic groups living there, but at that time, it was really white folks and black folks and the white folks were in charge.  So I was living--neighborhoods--the way people moved about, what they did, it was in a very segregated manner.
Speaker 1: So we're talking the early '50s [1950] here.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: That means also that schools were segregated.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Virtually.
Speaker 2: When we lived in the city and I attended public schools in the--part of the Indianapolis public school system, they were virtually segregated.  It was predominately African American.  When I was entering the fifth grade, we moved to a suburban area and I was then attending the suburban school system.  That was a different story.  At that time I was one of the few African American children in the school system and that was my experience from fifth grade through the end of high school where it was predominately white.
Speaker 1: Do you suppose that was one of the reasons for your moving, the family moving?
Speaker 2: Yes that was one of the reasons for my parents deciding to move, because the area that we lived in was becoming increasingly--I wouldn't say dangerous, but there were things that were beginning to happen in the neighborhood that were uncomfortable for my parents and that's when they saved and really sacrificed in order to move the family to a better circumstance, and to provide what they thought was a better education for me and my sisters [Linda Collins and Carole Collins].
Story_ID: 191507
Speaker 1: I suppose at that time then that the other--your other little friends at your school in Indianapolis [Indiana] weren't able to go to the amusement park [Riverside Amusement Park] either?
Speaker 2: No, not unless the day.
Speaker 1: How did their families feel?  I mean was your family odd person out in that situation or?
Speaker 2: Yes as I recall we were more of the odd person out because many of the other children went on the--that one day.
Speaker 1: That one designated day (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: On the designated day, yes, but my parents [Freida Casey Collins and Richard Collins] worked very hard to provide an enriched experience for me and my sisters [Linda Collins and Carole Collins] even though I know now that it was, given their economic means, they really sacrificed in order to do so; but things like taking trips, going to--the big thing was going to Cincinnati [Ohio] or to Chicago [Illinois] to the zoo, that was always a big, big trip.  Chicago to me growing up, that was my image of the big metropolis, and I still love Chicago, but I have fond memories as a youngster going to Chicago to visit the museums, going to visit the zoo, the [Adler] Planetarium [Chicago, Illinois], all the wonderful things you know along Lake Shore [Drive] and other parts of Chicago that we could do as a family.  The same with Cincinnati, we would take the trips there to go to the zoo and so on.  So even though I had somewhat of a twinge of anger over the amusement park situation, it didn't take me long to put that in some perspective and there were always other things to do so that wasn't such a huge feeling of loss, but you know as a child not being able to ride a roller coaster is a big deal, but as I said I put it in context and I feel very proud that my father and my mother took that stance.
Story_ID: 191508
Speaker 1: How far back can we trace--can you trace your ancestors and who were they?  Where did they originate, or do you have any of that information?
Speaker 2: My father's [Richard Collins] family came from Tennessee, and migrated to Indiana from there, and as far as my mother's [Freida Casey Collins] family they go back a couple of generations in Indiana, so prior to that I believe they came from parts of North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories, or legends or songs or anything within your family that you can recall for us?
Speaker 2: Not at this time.
Speaker 1: Do you think about those things?
Speaker 2: Think about the origins of my family?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I do, I regret that I don't know more and that is something that I have thought about, trying to determine what role I might be able to play in learning more and understanding more about the origins of the family and that is also one of the, I think one of the most cruel things about the legacy of so many of our families in this country is that that was taken from us, that clear path to being able to understand and to chart back our history, but I know that it's possible to uncover more of that information and so as I'm contemplating next steps in my life, that is one of the things I've thought about is how I could perhaps be helpful in that regard.
Story_ID: 191509
Speaker 1: It just occurs to me that one of the things that would really have an impact would be the Brown v. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] decision that came up during your early childhood.  Can you talk for a little bit about how that impacted in your area in Indiana in terms of segregation and desegregation of the schools or was there any impact felt right away?
Speaker 2: There was no impact that I felt particularly.  As I mentioned the public schools were pretty much segregated because of the housing patterns and so on.  Now, I do recall growing up many stories from my father [Richard Collins] in particular about his experience in Indianapolis public schools because he was born and raised in Indianapolis [Indiana] as well and during the time he was coming along the schools were definitely segregated and he attended Crispus Attucks High School [Indianapolis, Indiana] which is a high school of some notoriety in--certainly it's of significant notoriety in the State of Indiana and beyond because of a winning sports legacy that Crispus Attucks had particularly in the area of basketball, and that was the high school for African Americans for many, many years.  Oscar Robertson, for example, was one of the more noted alumni who was part of one of the award-winning basketball teams and the school was also featured, I don't know if you are familiar with the movie 'Hoosiers' but that was the high school that was featured in that film.  So, while I'm well aware of the history of the segregation in Indianapolis public schools at that--prior to my time there, it was still a segregated system but not so much by law but in essence.
Speaker 1: De facto.
Speaker 2: It was de facto segregation exactly because of the segregated neighborhoods in the city at that time.
Story_ID: 191510
Speaker 1: And what were your first memories now as you moved into an integrated school situation [in Indianapolis, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: I remember feeling as though I were in a different environment. I mean that was--that I was cognizant of that, and the other thing that was an interesting element of that move was that I began to recognize for the first time the differences among our people and that--because we lived in an area where there were a number of African Americans of means and so then I began to experience some of the social segregation that can come about because of people of differing economic circumstances so there was--
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that a little?
Speaker 2: --the racial segregation white and black and then there was the social segregation within the black community.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that a little bit?  How did it impact you and your family?
Speaker 2: Well I guess I can speak more for my own experience.  I remember being stung by it quite frankly because again this was a new phenomenon for me to come in contact with people who looked like me, yet felt apart, again because of background, parents' occupation, economic circumstances, and so there were organizations, different organizations, social organizations that people belonged to and participated in, and that I was excluded from, not because I wasn't--I didn't do well in school or I wasn't a good girl, but because of the work that my parents [Freida Casey Collins and Richard Collins] did.  It wasn't the same kind of--they were not the lawyers and doctors and of that ilk.  And so we do that and unfortunately I think we still do it today, this notion of I call it social segregation.  I can't think of a better word for it, but my husband [Wendell Johns] and I had a similar experience because he--his father was a postman and he grew up in a family where the father was a postman, his mother was in the home and so we joke about how the fact that neither he nor I were Jack and Jill [of America] eligible, yet somehow we were able to produce a Jack and Jill eligible child.  We wondering how the DNA works like that, but that was something that happened.  I was confronted with that in particularly in late elementary, junior high--junior high experience and I think that's something that has stayed with me, seeing how we can you know as black people sometimes get caught up too often in the trivia as opposed to looking at the substance.
Speaker 1: Is there any way that you think of right now that we might try to overcome that phenomenon that you're describing so eloquently by the way?
Speaker 2: Well I think we have to cause I think that to some degree that microcosm of what I was experiencing as a sixth grader in Indianapolis, Indiana when you write it larger is what's happening to us as a people now.   We've become too disenfranchised from one another, and we need to start to think of each other more as community, as a community as opposed to those of us who have been blessed to have a certain level of education and experience and using that to separate us as opposed to bringing those skills and talents and resources back to the parts of our family, our community who need them.
Speaker 1: And that seems to me to be something that has rather shaped your thought and activity throughout your life, yes.
Speaker 2: Indeed it has.
Story_ID: 191511
Speaker 1: Well you've talked a lot about your earliest memories of growing up.  Tell us your siblings' names and in birth order--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --including yourself.
Speaker 2: I am the oldest, I am the archetypical big sister.  My next sister is Linda Collins-Caruthers, she is four years younger than I am and then we have our youngest sister who is fourteen years younger than I am, Carole Collins Ayonlaja.
Speaker 1: And what--?
Speaker 2: Who by the way is the mother of my beloved nephew, Carlson.
Story_ID: 191512
Speaker 1: What street did you live on [in Indianapolis, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Growing up?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: The first street that I recall, actually I was very young so I don't have memories of being on the street, but it was on, in a neighborhood on the south side of Indianapolis [Indiana], an area called Barrington Heights.  I don't remember the street.  The first street that I have memory--of which I have memory is Harding Street in Indianapolis which is the last place we lived before we moved to--moved further out in the city to 64th Street.  It's amazing that I can remember these things.
Speaker 1: And at what age were you when you moved out into the suburbs?
Speaker 2: I was entering fifth grade, so what is that?
Speaker 1: About ten?
Speaker 2: Ten or eleven?
Speaker 1: Can you describe you block?
Speaker 2: It was a typical suburban, kind of that fringe-suburban area to a central city that was once considered the country for people who lived more center city.  It was populated by houses that were bungalow style.  We had a house that was white, brick and frame, had a detached garage, fairly long driveway, and I remember a very large yard which was new because before we lived in a house that had a relatively small yard.  So we had lots of--a lot of yard that I became responsible for.  My father [Richard Collins] didn't have any sons but he didn't let that stop him from giving us chores that one would normally associate with boys' responsibilities so I certainly was responsible for cutting grass, for doing things outside and actually remember it being a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: What elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I attended Grandview Elementary [School] in Indianapolis.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that particularly influenced you at that point?
Speaker 2: I remember getting a, it was a rigorous experience.  I remember working hard, but no teacher in particular stood out for me until I got to junior high.
Story_ID: 190290
Speaker 1: You were telling us about your junior high school experience and teachers that may--teachers, a few that might have had an influence on your later growing up?
Speaker 2: There's one teacher in particular to this day I remember and his name was Mr. Vansickle [ph.] and he was a wiry little man, probably wasn't taller than 5'5" or 6" and as thin as a rail, but he taught the sciences and so in seventh grade he taught geology and in ninth grade he taught biology to ninth graders, but the thing that was so distinguishing about my time with him because I took him both as a seventh grader and as a ninth grader is that there was an opportunity if one did well in his class to be selected for an honors trip.  The Versailles, in Indiana we said Versailles, I'd later learn that the actual pronunciation is Versailles, but that's another story, but we had a camping trip to a campsite, the Versailles campsite, and it was quite a big deal to be selected to go, and so I was selected in seventh grade and it was--for me I didn't really, I wasn't involved in scouting, I was a Brownie [Girl Scouts of the USA] for a short time, I didn't continue with that. This was the first time my trip with Mr. Vansickle to be away from home with a feeling of some modicum of being untethered from parents and we spent I think it was three, four days three nights in this camp experience.
Speaker 1: [HM] Ms. [Marie] Johns was this in France?
Speaker 2: No, no it was in Indiana, state park in Indiana, but to me I could have been in France, I felt so liberated.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And it was really the first time that I experienced that feeling of going someplace totally different, doing something totally different and stretching myself in ways that I hadn't really felt before.  For the geology trip we went fossil hunting, we spent the entire day looking for fossils and mining in the creek for you know all the different fossils and minerals that one would look for as part of a geology experience.  In the evenings we had opportunities to socialize, wrote skits and performed them.  It was just a glorious time and I was the only African American child chosen for that seventh grade, yet at no time did I feel awkward, or did that really have a bearing because the experience was just so enriching and so, again I'll use the word liberating.  For me it really sparked something and then following that I was again chosen in ninth grade to go on a biology trip and we did lots of dissection and catching all kinds of little crawly things and again it was just a wonderful experience to be there and it was significant to be able to go both times cause that didn't happen that often. So I do remember Mr. Vansickle and think of him fondly.
Speaker 1: You were well rewarded for your good studies then and you were a good student I assume?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 190291
Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church?
Speaker 2: Yes, we attended--my grandfather, my paternal grandfather, Justus Collins and my grandmother [Marjorie Collins] were very active in the African Methodist Episcopal church [A.M.E.], St. Paul A.M.E. [Church, later, St. Paul Temple A.M.E. Church] in Indianapolis [Indiana] and in fact my grandfather was instrumental in the erection of the church building so that was the church that we attended in the beginning.  Then quite frankly there were periods of time where we didn't attend regularly and we also attended another church, Riverside Methodist [Church, Indianapolis, Indiana], before we moved.  Following our move we were again not as consistent in church.  So while church, the whole notion of spirituality and awareness of God in my life was a factor.  As far as regular consistent churchgoing, that was not a factor growing up.  Later on it certainly did become a factor for the family.
Story_ID: 190292
Speaker 1: Tell us what the sights and sounds and smells are that remind you of growing up [in Indianapolis, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: The sight of my father [Richard Collins] in his uniform, his police uniform which I thought was one of the more striking things that I had seen.  The sight of--the sights as I walked the streets of my neighborhood because I did a lot of walking and a lot of bike riding as a young girl, which I loved to do.  I'd love to get on my bike and just go and remembering just the wide streets and the somewhat rural characteristic of the neighborhood that we lived in.  I remember spending times in, there was a large park that was not far from where we lived where I would really enjoy walking the trails there and being outside and enjoying the vistas of the park.  The sounds would be sounds of music, I loved as a teenager popular music and dancing so that the Motown sound track is certainly one of the sounds that I would reflect upon.  The sound of my mother's [Freida Casey Collins] voice because she's a great teacher, she was always advising us and correcting us and sharing with us her desires and her views for what we needed to do and how we needed to behave.  My sisters [Linda Collins and Carole Collins], there's another part of the sound track, certainly my middle sister because since we were not that far apart in age, she was always on the scene and often somewhere close by.  As far as the smells again, I would get back to the food.  My mother is an excellent cook and that was a big part of the aromas that I would acquaint with my younger years.
Speaker 1: Did you have a lot of girlfriends there in the neighborhood or were most of your friends at school?
Speaker 2: I had girlfriends who were not far so not directly in the neighborhood, didn't have any girlfriends who lived next door for example, but had friends who were not--were a bike ride away and so that was part of the reason why I rode my bike so much was to visit my friends or we would--they would come back, we would ride from their house to mine, et cetera, and so they are a part of the soundtrack as well.
Story_ID: 190293
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to North Central High School in Indianapolis [Indiana].
Speaker 1: Oh, now you're back in Indianapolis?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's where I've been the whole time.
Speaker 1: But there was a portion there that you described as being out--you were attending school out in the suburbs?
Speaker 2: Right but this is all still part of Indianapolis, just--I was just trying to distinguish the center city area from a suburban area, but it's still all Indianapolis.
Speaker 1: The high school is located in the center city?
Speaker 2: No, it's still, once we moved we were there.
Speaker 1: Okay and so this, now you're out in the suburban area attending--which high school?
Speaker 2: North Central High School.
Speaker 1: And can you describe your experiences there and your teachers and who influenced you and so on?
Speaker 2: High school was basically a continuation of some of the experiences that I described in junior high, in that very few African American students, we really were beginning to integrate the school, very rigorous course load.  I took a lot of advanced classes so throughout my high school experience there weren't that many African Americans in the school period and very few in the classes that I was part of cause we were all just scattered about, so there just weren't that many of us in the school period.  Socially--let me stick with academics for a minute.  The school was highly regarded so I worked very hard.  I was a good student, I wasn't--I didn't distinguish myself in the way of being you know a valedictorian or something of that nature, but I did well, and it took a lot of work to maintain a good grade point average.
Speaker 1: What motivated you?
Speaker 2: Well, my parents [Freida Casey Collins and Richard Collins] definitely expected me to go to college and so I knew that in order to do that I had to perform at a certain level.  So that motivated me and the notion of being one of only a few black students in the school, I wanted to show clearly what I could do and that I was competitive and could perform as well as anyone else.  There were social aspects of high school.  Many people look at high school as a fond period socially, I do not because it was difficult from that standpoint in that there weren't that many African American students, therefore there weren't that many fellows to date, and again when you accounted for there weren't that many black students to begin with and then with the self-segregation that black students tended to engage in, it just meant there weren't a whole lot of opportunities.
Story_ID: 190294
Speaker 1: And so how did you spend your time--much of your time aside from your studies, extracurricular [at North Central High School, Indianapolis, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Well I had girlfriends, I'm a reader, I love movies.  There was always something to do, music.  I never felt bored but I do recall, there were points of time along the way where I felt as though I was excluded from other things that were going on, you know with people with their organizations and so on because I mean, if you consider back that time was what the late '60s [1960s].  The white students had a whole panoply of social organizations and activities that they were not interested in inviting black students to participate in and then you had the black folks who were of a certain ilk who had their activities and so there was a lot of things that had I focused on it I could have felt excluded from but instead what I tried to do was just gear my energies toward entertaining myself which is something that I really do well.  I was quite a seamstress in those days so I did a lot of sewing, my mother [Freida Casey Collins] is a beautiful seamstress and so I was always able to find something to do and I remember feeling as though I had quite an enriched experience, but in all honesty there were points of time where I felt as though, wow everybody else is off involved in this or that and it's not including me.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in sports?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't involved in sports, I was a little bit ahead of the curve for what is it Title VII?
Speaker 1: Title IX.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry Title IX, the push for girls in sports.  There were very few outlets for girls in sports at that time.
Story_ID: 190295
Speaker 1: Were you at that time [at North Central High School, Indianapolis, Indiana] developing a thought about what your future might look like?
Speaker 2: I was, my thinking was more toward education and I thought I really wanted to be a teacher.  Part of that too was at that time my exposure to what kinds of opportunities were even out there was quite frankly very limited.  I knew there were lawyers, there were doctors, there were school teachers, but as far as the huge array of things to do, I had as I think back a very, very limited view of that.  I mean to grow up to be a telecommunications executive, I mean that was something I didn't even realize that there was such a thing quite frankly.
Speaker 1: And when did that come to you?
Speaker 2: Oh it was much, much later.
Speaker 1: But you did at that point know that you wanted to go to college?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And then, then what happened?
Speaker 2: Well after high school [North Central High School, Indianapolis, Indiana] I went to college.  I went to Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] and probably within a week of going to college, maybe two weeks, met the man I would eventually marry.  We were at--Wendell Johns, who was from Gary, Indiana.  I was a freshman and he was a junior and by the time I was a sophomore and he was a senior we were married.  So we were quite scandalous.  We got married, not long after had our child, Richard [Johns] and then we started on our path from that point.  We just celebrated our thirty-third anniversary and--a couple of weeks ago so it's been quite a journey for the two of us.  First order of business was finishing school.  Wendell finished first, he's a CPA [certified public accountant] by training and actually he and another gentleman integrated the Indianapolis [Indiana] office of--then Coopers & Lybrand which has now been merged with another accounting firm [PricewaterhouseCoopers], but they were the first African Americans hired at that firm back in the mid-'70s [1970s], which was a very--it was a tough experience cause that's a tough industry anyway and then to be the first blacks hired in the Indianapolis office, it was difficult, but it was a happy day when he passed the CPA exam and by that time I had gone back to school and finished my bachelors and my master's degree at Indiana University and then Wendell returned to do his M.B.A. at [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana].  So for several years we were working, raising Richard, going to school, you know saving up to take the classes, and so on so it was a tough time but it was a great time in that every step of the way we really felt you know once you passed another class you were another step closer to finishing the--making another step closer toward the goal line.  It was a time when we really felt like we were making great strides towards where we were headed.  You know sometimes you feel like you're marking time, but for us we were clearly seeing where we were going and so I felt really energized, felt like that was one of the most focused times of my life because we knew where we were headed and we had to get there as quickly as we could.
Story_ID: 190296
Speaker 1: And where were you headed?
Speaker 2: Well we [Johns and her husband, Wendell Johns] were headed to finishing school [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], that was the first priority and then a lot of thought about career and where we wanted to see ourselves and as I said Wendell was in the accounting firm [Coopers & Lybrand, Indianapolis, Indiana, later, PricewaterhouseCoopers] and at that same time I was working at a not-for-profit organization, a community development organization in Indianapolis [Indiana] trying to help with neighborhood development in a part of the city that had been distressed for quite some time, so I was doing grants writing and trying to develop programs, part of the old Community Action Agency network.  Wendell went to--he left public accounting, went to a--worked for a real estate developer Oxford Development and during that time I had begun, I had finished my master's [degree] and was working at the Indiana Legislature [Indiana General Assembly] which for a Legislative Services Agency which is analogous to the Congressional Budget Office.  It was the non-partisan staff to the legislature, and I got a call one day from a friend of mine who worked at Indiana Bell [subsidiary, AT&T, Inc.] who said she had just learned about a position that had become available and she said it sounds similar to what I think you do in your current job, and I wanted to know if you are interested in interviewing, and I told her that I was because I actually had integrated the Legislative Services Agency, I was the first African American hired there in something other than a clerical position.  It was a great work experience, but it was a very flat organization, there really weren't many places that I could chart a course to go, and so the notion of applying for Indiana Bell was intriguing so I did that and I was hired for the job and this was just before divestiture, and I was hired to work on what we call service cost studies to determine what the cost of service is for the various products the company offered and it was right before divestiture.  Things were going along well and we were continuing to try to grow in our careers, raise our child [Richard Johns] you know, save up for a better house, all the things that people do at that stage, and Wendell called one day, and said, "Well I have something to tell you.  We're moving to Bethesda, Maryland," and I was flabbergasted, quite frankly didn't quite know where Bethesda, Maryland was.  I had to find that out first, realized it was right outside of Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 190297
Speaker 1: Before we move to Bethesda [Maryland], I wanted to go back and pick up on some of the things that you've said thus far.  Going to IU [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] and being a married student there, what was that like?  Was that--was that, did that isolate you?  Did that, I mean what did that feel like and what did your parents [Freida Casey Collins and Richard Collins] think about your getting married at such a young age and starting your family and all that sort of thing, how did that work with your very close family?
Speaker 2: Well my family, my parents they weren't thrilled about it, that's for sure, but it didn't take them long to get beyond that.  I think they were more just shocked and just not expecting that that's the choice that I would have made.  So that was the parental reaction, but as far as being married and going to school and working and all that, didn't--I never felt isolated, just felt busy as hell.  Maybe I was too busy to feel isolated, but Wendell [Johns] and I were just so focused on what we were doing that there really wasn't any time to be particularly engaged in anything else and we had friends that we, that certainly were part of our lives and many of them continue to be, so it wasn't as though we were on an island, but we were very, very focused on getting done those things that we had set out to do, primarily finish our education, that was the first order of business, and so everything just had to line up behind that.
Speaker 1: What did his parents think?
Speaker 2: I think they were surprised as well but no particular reaction from them.
Speaker 1: And they had known you so?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Both families had known--?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't know each other.  We didn't know each other for a long time, no not at all.  I met them right about the time we were getting married.
Story_ID: 190298
Speaker 1: Was there segregation at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how did, how did you--?
Speaker 2: De facto, de facto segregation where, you know organizations kind of lined up along racial lines in terms of Greek organizations or social organizations, et cetera.  As far as classes and accommodations, they were integrated but there was a lot of self-segregation among the black students just because of seeking the comfort of being around people that you felt more comfortable with.
Speaker 1: Were there political movements going on at that time, it seems like there would have been?
Speaker 2: Yes, there were some, there were some protests about--
Speaker 1: Can you describe that?
Speaker 2: There were some protests about the war [Vietnam War]; there were other protests about the racial tension that was evident at the school at that time.  Indiana University is located in southern Indiana, and southern Indiana has a--
Speaker 1: What town?
Speaker 2: --an unfortunate history.  Bloomington [Indiana] which is not far from a town called Martinsville [Indiana], which has an unfortunate history of a lot of--of [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] activity.  So I do remember there was one incident of a Klan march not that far from the university, not long after I came so that element was there.  Once Wendell [Johns] and I married, however, we moved to Indianapolis [Indiana] and finished our education there, and so that put us, we were not on you know a college campus, we were at the Indiana University campus in Indianapolis which had more of a--it had more of a student population that reflected people like us, people who were married, going to school or people who were returning students and this whole notion of protest and so on was not an element of the school situation in Indianapolis.
Speaker 1: But did it have an effect on you, or is this part of your conversation or your movement or any of that, your involvements with other associations or anything?
Speaker 2: Not in particular, yet it was part of the whole, it's part of what my being born and raised in Indiana has imprinted on me and that is being very aware of racial issues and the fact that they are still very much with us and that is an element of my upbringing, certainly.  So my Indiana University experience was just another episode in that continuum.
Story_ID: 190299
Speaker 1: And at what point did you leave school [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] and leave the campus and you're moving now to Bethesda, Maryland and what year was that?
Speaker 2: In 19--excuse me, 1984.
Speaker 1: I see.  Are there any experiences that you'd like to share with us that took place before your move?  What factors went into your decision or was it just something that your husband [Wendell Johns] announced that was gonna happen?
Speaker 2: Well, it was not an easy decision.  He explained that his job was moving to this area.  He felt it was a good opportunity for the family to experience something different.  On its face that sounded like a good idea, yet I was quite torn.  I felt that I was doing well in my position at Indiana Bell [subsidiary, AT&T, Inc.].  Everything familiar to me was in Indianapolis [Indiana], my parents [Freida Casey Collins and Richard Collins], many friends, let's see by that time my sisters [Linda Collins and Carole Collins], well my younger sister was still at home, my middle sister was in college at the time, so it was a very difficult thing to contemplate and then when I came for a visit the first time to begin looking at houses and saw the price of housing in the Washington [D.C.] metropolitan area, I was convinced that we were gonna be living in a hovel, that there was no way we could even afford the move, so it was not easy, but the family made the move and it was a very tough transition.
Story_ID: 190397
Speaker 1: --We're going back from your experience in Bethesda [Maryland] or arriving in Bethesda to the point at which you went to college [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] as a young person with a strong family background, good solid values, excellent student and two weeks or two months after you were at school and away on your own you met the man of your dreams [husband, Wendell Johns].  So how did things evolve from that time until you finished college, I mean you continued with your school work, you're still a very good student and your goal was in graduating, but then you got sidetracked, so how did you actually decide to make this very decisive move over to marriage?
Speaker 2: You know I don't think things so much evolved as they erupted, it just happened and I know for someone of my age and experience to not be able to explain something more scientifically and more thoughtfully than that is probably a puzzle, but that's just the way it is.  It just--I think it was just meant to be, it really--that's--that's it in terms of our coming together, Wendell's and my coming together.
Speaker 1: Did that defer your dreams or did you--did you do this, take this action with the notion that your dreams were going to continue and you were going to actually realize completing college?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely!  There was never any question about that because he and I both shared that and we just felt that we could do it, whatever it was to be better as a union than doing it separately, and well some may have thought, may have known at eighteen or fifteen you know, when I grow up I am going to be X.  That really wasn't my experience.  You asked me earlier what I wanted to do and I said I wanted to be a teacher, but quite honestly I did not know what I wanted to do.  I knew attributes about what I wanted to do, that is I wanted, I wanted the ability to express myself, I wanted to feel some measure of freedom.  I've always had this desire to feel freedom and I'm not even sure how I define that.  I define it in different ways at different points along the way, but I had felt as though I was--growing up--had a very loving family, but a strict family so that was a chafe--that chaffed a bit.  I felt chaffing from societal bounds because of my, because of being black, because of being a woman.  I felt a chaffing because of economic circumstances because of that of my family.  So I just wanted to not be chaffing anymore.  I just wanted to be able to do what I wanted to do, when I wanted to do it and for the reasons that I felt were important.
Speaker 1: And marriage, stepping into marriage sort of gave you that feeling.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Because your husband was not judgmental or restrictive, or was being married going to restrict you from realizing your full potential or your dream?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  I never felt that it would restrict me, I just knew that whatever was in store would happen and that marriage was just part of it, marriage and motherhood were part of the picture.
Speaker 1: So that's very interesting in some respects because a lot of people during that time would feel that marriage might be restrictive.
Speaker 2: It was a very anti-marriage time that's for sure.
Speaker 1: In certain communities women then would be once--once married would be expected to be at home or raise children, but your reaction was quite the opposite it seems.
Speaker 2: I never expected to be a homemaker, that was--I always knew that I would work and but also would be very focused on raising a child as well, that was just what I had in my mind and my heart to do, and interestingly enough as I think back on my life--you know when you get to be fifty something you do that, I can see that this was God's plan really for me because had I not married then I may not have gotten married, because I may have gotten so focused on career and work and gotten on that path that I would not have, cause I'm a pretty, once I get on a path and I get a focus I'm on it, and so I can see that had I gotten on--gotten really engaged in career and my education and so on and so forth that that very well could have just been my focus and I would have missed that--that element of my life.
Story_ID: 190398
Speaker 1: And please share with us what your major was in college [at Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] that sent you on that path so to speak, or allowed you to be skilled and prepared for what did, was offered later career wise?
Speaker 2: My first major was education, but then I changed, actually in my second year to public administration because my initial career goal was to be a public servant.  I wanted to be a city manager, city administrator; you know run a major department of government.  That was where my career--that was my career goal, because the whole notion of government, its processes--processes, just how the public sector worked, works was always fascinating to me.
Speaker 1: But how did you change from teacher education to--?
Speaker 2: Oh I don't know.  I can't really pinpoint when that occurred, but I think I've always just had a keen interest in things of a political/public sector nature which I retain to this day.
Speaker 1: But [HM] Ms. [Marie] Johns that brings us back to something you mentioned much earlier and that was exposure, so at some point you must have had exposure to that avenue that took you there?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you describe that?
Speaker 2: Possibly what it was, I remember--I've always been something of a news junkie so just reading the newspaper, reading about politicians always was of interest to me.  Someone who's very dear to me, Julia Carson, who is as you know now a congresswoman from Indiana, I would--I watched her and remember reading about her and when I was working for the legislature [Indiana General Assembly] I worked for her as a member, she was a member of the state legislature at the time and she was very kind to me, knowing there were so few African Americans who worked in that environment.  She was always very kind and something of a mentor in that role.
Story_ID: 190399
Speaker 1: When I left there [Legislative Services Agency, Indiana General Assembly] and went to Indiana Bell [subsidiary, AT&T, Inc.] and started my career in telecommunications, well this was after graduate school, I had already gotten a master's [degree] in public administration, kind of had gotten away from the whole public sector involvement except for the fact that in--once I started working for Indiana Bell after I did more of a financial analysis position, I moved into an area, the regulatory area of the company which is the area of telecommunications which is a nexus actually between public policy and the company's business interests because the company at that time and still is even though less so was very highly regulated.  The actions of the company were controlled by a regulatory body, a public service commission on a local level and then the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] for interstate services, and actually that's why I--I think why I was viewed as a good candidate for the position that I was hired to do, in that most people in the company at that time had a background either in business or engineering.  I had a background in public administration, but what that allowed me to do was to understand better what the regulators were thinking so that we could then conform what we were trying to get done from the company's side of things to--could formulate a way that could pass muster from the regulatory side to allow us to be successful. I think it was helpful that I had some understanding of public sector workings and regulatory processes--that was an important element to bring to the company to, and to help me advance.
Speaker 2: And also at this point you also had quite a background in financial analysis.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So see you're forming yourself, you're defining yourself in quite a scope.
Speaker 1: Well that was my intent, I'm not sure that I recognized it at the time but I did strongly feel that the company needed people with different perspectives and different skill sets than strictly business or the engineering backgrounds that tended to be so prevalent--
Story_ID: 190400
Speaker 1: And did you have other mentors along the way that you looking back now could identify?
Speaker 2: Oh there were a number of people who were mentors.  I've not had any formal mentor relationships, but I've had, oh just so many people who have proven important.
Speaker 1: And tell us how you define that relationship, it's not always that it is a formal relationship.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Can you kinda talk about that for a minute?
Speaker 2: I think that there's certainly value in formal mentor relationships, but I think that here lately in particular that's become such a buzzword, the whole notion of mentoring relationships that--when I talk to younger people, I tell them, share with them my experience and that is that people often were mentoring me and they didn't even realize it.  I would just observe them, observe their behaviors, observe their manner of deportment, observe their, the way--even the way they dressed, people who were above the food chain for me in the company [Indiana Bell, subsidiary, AT&T, Inc.], just to learn from them to see what were they doing, these were men and women, black and white, but particularly the black folks who were the senior managers, I paid a lot of attention to them to see what it is they did, how they maneuvered to see what I could learn and I was always picking up lessons all over the place and it's not just people above the food chain.  It's also people with whom you work, your peers and people who--who are people who are part of your team.  Also lessons abound, I mean lessons are all over the place and that's, I always try to be aware and just on the lookout for a tip that I could pick up for how to make myself better. I really do consider myself a perpetual student and always trying to refine a sharp edge or sharpen one that needs to be sharpened.
Story_ID: 190401
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, along the way would you say that it was a smooth road, or would you say that things were rough and rocky, or I mean you have survived well and can you describe your experience in the private sector--overall?
Speaker 2: Overall it has been, it's been both.  It's been smooth, but it's also been very challenging.  The smooth part has been that I've always had this tremendous anchor of my husband [Wendell Johns] and my son [Richard Johns].  For some men, it's not, some men can't handle a wife who has a very public position, and one that is very demanding in terms of hours and so on, and while I don't want to describe it's nirvana, I mean certainly we--Wendell and I have had to work through various things at different stages of our marriage, but by and large, he has been extremely supportive and comfortable with that which is a blessing, because to be able to have a nest, a rest stop or a place where you can come and restore, then that's very, very--I mean that's fundamental to allow one to go out and then do whatever they have to do in the workplace, because that can often be a challenging place, but to have to be challenged on all fronts, that's when you just can't quite get--you can't stay whole under those circumstances, so I've been blessed with a good foundation with a marriage, I've been blessed with our son who's--you know he's been a typical child in that he has caused his parents some heartburn from time-to-time but all-in-all, he's been an absolute joy to our lives.  That has been my foundation, of course that wrapped in our spiritual foundation, but as far as the workplace is concerned, I worked for a good company.  I've had, I've been fortunate to have a good experience.  I've worked very hard, I've worked very, very hard and it has not always been easy in terms of being accepted as a black person, accepted as a woman in particular roles and under particular circumstances--
Speaker 1: That's what I'd like to hear more about.
Speaker 2: More details about that?  Think of an example; there have been, let me think.  One example, this was after moving to the Washington [D.C.] area and so I was, I had left Indiana Bell [subsidiary, AT&T, Inc.], I was now part of Bell Atlantic [later, Verizon Communications, Inc.] and I had received one promotion and I was being considered for the next promotion which was really the toughest promotion to move from a manager position to a director position, that was a big step because that's where the pyramid really started to get narrow, and I was being considered along with another, along with a peer of mine who was a white guy.  Our vice president had urged all the "high potential" managers to go through an experience called an assessment experience where you had to go and it was, I believe a two-day experience, very intense.  They put you through any number of exercises, you know a disgruntled employee or a crisis, or you know all kinds of simulated workplace experiences that someone at that level would possibly confront.  So the colleague and I both went through assessment, thank the Lord I did very well as I heard you know in the air as these, you know as news travels about these sorts of things, he didn't do well and so the next time we had a meeting where we were all assembled, the vice president of the team talked about the assessment process and how well after all it really wasn't a very good predictor of how someone would be able to perform at the next level.  So in other words at one point it was the threshold that one had to clear in order to be considered.  The colored girl does well, the white boy doesn't do so hot, then all of a sudden, oh well it's really pretty meaningless.  Now, perhaps I'm being too sensitive but I think there was a racial element to that conclusion that he drew, so that's just an example of how at different points along the way it was not easy, didn't really have anybody looking out for me to do, you know to make the path a little smoother, but thank God there were enough people who were looking out and I couldn't be denied because I did work hard, I performed well and God created a way.
Story_ID: 190402
Speaker 1: How did you react [to workplace discrimination] or how did things happen for you with your colleague after that, and did you receive the promotion that you were seeking at that point [at Bell Atlantic, later, Verizon Communications, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: I did eventually, yes.  How things happened with me and the colleague, there was really nothing that happened, I mean it was just--it was just one of those realities of how things were.
Speaker 1: But you did receive the promotion at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes, and a few more to boot (laughter).
Speaker 1: The--and what was happening in your world, I mean how did--how did--your reaction was probably one of shock and surprise and disappointment, dismay, but how did you, what face did you put on that when you reappeared?  How did you handle it?
Speaker 2: The game face, I mean that's the face we're all familiar with, that we have to trot out.
Speaker 1: And then you just pressed on as if--
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: As if--
Speaker 2: Which is what we all must do because, and for me that's where spirituality comes in and that is the world is going to define us a certain way, they're going to put limits on us, they're going to, you know as black people, even in 2004 we still very much have a struggle and so that's why we have to understand that there are greater forces at play and so we have to continue to keep our eyes on the prize, continue to work hard, continue to be focused and we can persevere, we can break through barriers, and sometimes even those who hold the cards don't understand why things are happening as they are but it's because it's--it really--we are not really in control when it's all said and done but we do have a duty as a people to be prepared and to be faithful to excellence to doing everything that we can to demonstrate who we are.
Story_ID: 190403
Speaker 1: Tell us what the glass ceiling means to you?
Speaker 2: What does that mean?  Oh, it's just another definition for limits and boundaries.  I mean that's something, you know, that's an artifact from the women's movement which was more of a--it's just another way to say a limit.  For us, before we could even get to a glass ceiling we had to get through a locked door so, I mean and again sometimes for us even being in a position to see a glass ceiling is a blessing cause we were so--as a people we were so denied that forget about the ceiling, we're not even up on the first floor yet, can't even see the ceiling.
Story_ID: 190404
Speaker 1: Can you describe for us, I know this is probably difficult in talking about yourself but can you describe for us what you think got the door open for you, and others that will follow like you, what particularly?
Speaker 2: When I got to Bell Atlantic [later, Verizon Communications, Inc.] and I saw--I began to hone in on a potential path for myself because you know as I said earlier I was really not one who had ABC, chapter and verse path laid out for myself.  I was just being open to what opportunities may come.  So after a certain point in time things began to come into some focus and I began to think about a particular path, and so what I decided and even before the path fully came into focus what I decided was that I was just going to distinguish myself, in that I was going to be known, my brand was going to be that she is one of the hardest working and most competent people in this company as big as it was because I had come in from Indiana Bell [later, AT&T, Inc.], and you know that east, you know there is a bit of East Coast snobbery toward the Midwest, and so here I was coming in to a company where many people had worked together for years, I was coming in not out of college but as a kind of mid-career person, didn't know anybody, didn't have the East Coast, any kind of a network, so I know I was being looked at under a microscope, and so one can either be cowed by that and decide there is no hope or one can be energized by that and determined, and make themselves determined to just show them what you've got, and so that's, that was what I decided to do and I worked very hard--
Speaker 1: What kinds of little--?
Speaker 2: Did some good projects that got some good visibility, I took on jobs that were very difficult, that one job in particular a job related to our tariffs and I'm going through all the arcana about it but it was a job that no one really wanted to do.  I worked with difficult people, people who other people weren't able to work with effectively, I figured out ways to do that so it was just a matter of distinguishing myself through doing those things that were really important to do but were not glamorous, and were not things that everybody else was clamoring to do, but for myself I saw that as a way to distinguish myself and to, contrary to what other people thought I figured if I did the tough jobs that no one else wanted and did them very well, that that would bring attention because in a corporation, in a school, in any kind of environment one needs to bring attention to oneself in order to get opportunity to move and that was my way of doing it.
Speaker 1: In a very positive way.
Speaker 2: Yeah exactly.
Speaker 1: So you--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Had to be positive.
Speaker 1: You identified areas that needed attention and you stepped in to provide solutions.
Speaker 2: That's what I--that was my thought.
Speaker 1: And that was what opened doors--
Story_ID: 190405
Speaker 1: Now how did you recognize--how did others seem to recognize what you were doing and suddenly there's a little light in that door, can you describe that how--what was happening at that point?
Speaker 2: Well one first indication that I had that people were noticing was I had been at Bell Atlantic [later, Verizon Communications, Inc.] for two years and I was asked to put my hat in the ring for a special opportunity.  At that time the company had an annual experience where they gave a person the opportunity to go on loan to the federal government for a year, and it was a highly competitive process but they--you would work in the federal government for a year and then come back to the company, and I was asked to put my hat in the ring for that and thank God I got that opportunity in 1987.  I was part of a group--I worked at the [U.S.] General Services Administration for the GSA administrator for a year.  I did things that are totally unrelated to telecom [telecommunications] cause you couldn't work on things related to your business so I wrote regulations for when government employees relocate, how relocation should be handled.  I did a study of some properties in the federal government that were under GSA's jurisdiction and how those properties could be managed more effectively, very special projects of that nature, just whatever they gave me to do and had a wonderful experience, and again similar to Mr. Vansickle [ph.] taking me to camp back in seventh grade, this was another one of those points in my life because there was an international experience as part of this exchange.  I went to Moscow [Soviet Union, later, Russia], I went to Warsaw, Poland, went to Finland, places I had never been, never dreamed I would go and that was another one of those seminal experiences in my life that told me wow, you're standing here in Red Square in Moscow, you have some things in store, just stay on the course.  There are other things that you're going to see and do because who would have ever thought you would be here at this moment in time?
Story_ID: 190309
Speaker 1: [HM] Ms. [Marie] Johns, can you recall for us please any persons, people along the way that in your work world or particularly in your family that have been important for you as a model?
Speaker 2: I've been asked that question a time or two in the past and there are lots of people, but the people I always start with are my grandmothers, because Zenobia Casey and Marjorie Collins both were what was euphemistically called in the day, in that time domestic workers and they cleaned other women's houses, white women's homes and that was the work that was for them to do, and yet they both were very in their own way very elegant, beautiful women who had circumstances been different could have done many other things.
Speaker 1: This was in the early '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: This was in the '40s [1940s] and through the early '50s [1950s], and countless times, more times than I can--I could even begin to enumerate when I've been faced with a challenge, and I've had a few in the workplace and it seems like it's really hard and I don't know how I'm gonna get from where I am to where I need to go, I call upon them, because if they could do what they did and suffer the demeaning circumstances that confronted so many of our people at that time, if they could do that and come through it and still raise families and still prepare and create a loving environment for their children and for their grandchildren, and I as one of the grandchildren so fondly remember in both accounts, then surely I can muster up what I need to have to get where I need to go with my particular problem.  I am blessed to work in pleasant circumstances, I am blessed to have on nice clothes, you know a piece of jewelry, and I just have this issue I need to get--to confront and I know that I have the stuff within me to get through it and without fail every time it has worked, and so those are the two people that I always recognize first, and of course my mother [Freida Casey Collins] who, a very strong woman who has done so many things, has so many talents and who really raised three very strong, three strong girls.  Both of my sisters are educators interestingly enough, my middle sister is in the Chicago Public Schools [CPS, Chicago, Illinois] and my youngest sister is a principal in Cincinnati Public Schools [Cincinnati, Ohio], so--and I really attribute my mother with this primarily.  My father [Richard Collins] gave us some things but my mother gave us this, and that is the work ethic, the strength to persevere, the--and just the sense of being well-rounded because we all in addition to our careers being important, have a strong sense of giving back social consciousness, which I have to give my father some credit for that as well.  So all those women I admire, my grandmothers, my mother and my sisters.

Speaker 1: I also admire the women in the [telecommunications] industry that I have, particularly in what was C&P Telephone [Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company, later, Verizon Communications, Inc.], Bell Atlantic [later, Verizon Communications, Inc.], Verizon Washington [D.C.], the women in that company, because so many of the women I have worked with are strong black women who are working as operators, who are working in our business offices who are working daily with customers, and they really make that company go and they work so hard, they are committed to what they do.  They are committed to customer service, and I draw great strength from that because they are--they are just giving it their all consistently and that's just such a testament I think to, just to the power of employees and a strong team and so on, and that's been very meaningful for me to have worked as the head of that team and to feel their support.  They have just--they've been so giving and so supportive of me in my role and that's meant so much.
Story_ID: 190311
Speaker 1: I've had friends who've been so important to me.  I'm not a person with a lot of friends, I certainly believe more in quality than quantity when it comes to close relationships and I've been blessed to have some very, very strong sister friends in my life who have, who've always been there and helped me through every circumstance, and then of course my husband [Wendell Johns].  He has been a rock and a stalwart supporter and I'm--we both respected each other's careers and over the course of a thirty-plus year marriage of course you have lots of seasons and there've been seasons when his work, when he was in public accounting, certainly he worked tremendously long hours and so that was my time to support him.  Then, then you know, the coin flipped and I was in a role where I was required to be on point for much of the time and he supported me so, that has been something that personally we have been grateful for but as we've gotten older, I think--certainly I, I shouldn't speak for him, but certainly I recognize that we are modeling for others, something that's very important because of the fact that now we struggle for marriages to work anymore and we struggle for people to learn how to accommodate each other and to love each other through those seasons, and so now that I'm older I am grateful to be a role model of that sort as well.  The professional is very important, but the personal is very, very important as well because that's the foundation.  It's very hard to achieve in my view personal--professional success if you don't have that solid home foundation, and so I'm grateful to be an old married woman and to model what that can be.
Story_ID: 190312
Speaker 1: For those going into the executive levels in the corporate world as you have been an exemplary HistoryMaker, what suggestions do you have?  What suggestions do you have for other young women that are going into fill--try to fill your shoes in that world?
Speaker 2: It's important to be true to yourself because certain circumstances, certain environments will work to try to mold you or make you an automaton and make you of a cookie-cutter, but our strength is who we are and what we bring.  Organizations need a different perspective.  They need a different look.  They need a different sensibility sometimes.  Now certainly have to be mindful of context and to respect it to some degree but it should never cause us to coopt who we are fundamentally.  So I think that's very important.  The other thing that I think is very important is the notion of keeping first things first.  If people do have a family, speaking of women in particular, if you have a family, if you have children, we don't get a second chance to do that right, so we need to make sure that that is a first priority when children are of the age when they need us.  That's certainly what I did, I couldn't have worked, I didn't have the wherewithal for a nanny and live-in help and all that so I was the one.  I was the one who was keeping home and heart together, again particularly during the time when Wendell [Johns] was in public accounting, and as a result there were things professionally that I wasn't able to engage myself in, but those things came in time, and so not to be repetitive, but it really is a matter of keeping priorities straight, because as I've also said to particularly young women when I've spoken to them and young men as well, that whatever personal success that I have would be very hollow indeed if I had a child who was struggling and who was in need because of a lack of what happened in home, in the home.  So we have to keep our priorities straight because there will always be lots of competing demands, and then--if I can narrow it down to three--finally just make excellence the hallmark and to work, work hard to give it all you've got and to distinguish yourself by the work that you do.  Networking is great, it's important.  Relationships are very good and they are important, but they, in my view, are complimentary to excellence.  You can know a whole lot of folks and have a tremendous network but if you don't stand for anything in terms of what you can actually produce, then that's still not gonna get you very far, because at some point the jig will be up, you're gonna have to produce and when that moment comes and if you fall short then an opportunity has been missed so, know the business that you're in and distinguish yourself by your willingness to go the extra mile.

Speaker 1: It is well known that you have reached out and promoted many initiatives that are being implemented in the community.  Could you talk about some of those for just a minute and explain and describe what you have tried to do through your position as CEO [chief executive officer] and president of Verizon [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: My view is that when we are as a people blessed to be in roles that are non-traditional for us, that we have a duty to do everything we can with that position, and that certainly was the view that I brought to--when I was named president of Verizon Washington, and part of that when I was vice president of external affairs, I always looked for opportunities to take the resources of the company and figure out a way to use those to benefit the community at large and the business as well, and it's amazing how many opportunities there are for doing that just if some thought is given to it.  For example, we have--well my main areas of focus are economic development and education, and on the education front we have a significant literacy issue in Washington, D.C.  It really is bordering on obscene I think that when you consider that over 30 percent of the adult population in the nation's capital can be considered functionally illiterate because of lack of reading skills or workplace literacy that can also include computer training and so on.  So at Verizon we have undertaken a number of initiatives to focus on that by providing technology learning centers throughout the city.  Every public school is wired for Internet access.  Every public library is wired for Internet access.  We've provided computer stations there.  Every park, has a park and recreation center in every neighborhood of the city, we've provided computer training and telecommunications training for young men and women who had dropped out of high school, along with academic remediation so that they could get their high school diploma or complete their GED [General Educational Development] and nearly three hundred young people have come through that program and have gone from high school dropouts with no future to people who are working in the telecommunications industry and have a very bright future for themselves and their families.  We have had any number of literacy programs and in addition to the various initiatives that we've had, I've also felt it very important that Verizon work with other community-based organizations to help them become stronger.  For example, the D.C. Chamber of Commerce, we worked closely with them and actually provided space for them for a period of time so that the chamber could refashion itself, move into beautiful new quarters in downtown Washington and really take that next step up as a leading business organization in the city.  I worked with a group of people to found the "Washington D.C. Technology Council" to make sure that technology companies who are located in the district had an organization that could serve as a voice for them and could address their needs as somewhat of a burgeoning industry, all the Internet-based companies that have been developed over the last few years.  There are other initiatives I'm not, none of which are coming to mind at the moment, but I'll just in sum say that I would have been a poor leader of--in my role had I not had a broader view, and so that's why I always try to have a view toward how can we make things better.  We're a large company here, we employ a lot of people, we pay a lot of taxes and all those things are very important.  We provide a good service, that's first and foremost.  Those are all very important, but I think that it's incumbent upon any of us who are blessed to have the opportunity to control resources.  I felt it was incumbent upon me to look beyond that to see what else can we do to help build a stronger economy, to help build stronger communities, to help provide opportunities for people who haven't had opportunity to become self-sufficient, and again that's why education and economic development in my view are so important.  Now that I've recently retired, I'm going to continue to look for ways to make progress along those two fronts.
Story_ID: 190314
Speaker 1: That gives me a segue into my next question and that is what do you still want to do that you haven't done yet?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness, I am--I'm thinking that through.  I am thinking that through.  What I do know I want to continue to do is to be of service and that's what I will do, whether that's you know tutoring a child or doing something on a larger scale but my goal in life, my purpose is to be useful and I feel that I've been so blessed with opportunity with you know the support and love that I felt throughout my life from my family and then beyond that from my extended family and you know loving circle of friends that I'm just compelled to want to continue to serve as long as I can.  People you know were joking with me when I announced my retirement and we're talking about oh, well guess you'll just be a lady of leisure now so on and so forth.  Well (laughter) that wasn't the reason that I chose to retire.  I chose to retire because I had accomplished those things that I set out to accomplish in my role.  I felt that I had made an impact in the community and I never wanted to be one of those people who had to be asked to leave as opposed to knowing what was the right time and my spirit was telling me it was the right time for me to move from that post and to think about another chapter in my life and so the notion of sitting down and I haven't had one bonbon since I've been retired so that's, that wasn't what it was about but rather to think of new ways to be useful.

Speaker 1: [HM] Ms. [Marie] Johns as a HistoryMaker could you please for the audience put your life in a historical context.  You're here at a certain point in time, and we'd like to hear your view on your life within the context of our history since 1951.  I know that's a tough question.
Speaker 2: That is a very difficult question.  Primarily I am the recipient of the benefits that were made possible by all who did the really hard work, and since 1951 that was a time when we as a people were under tremendous assault and segregation was still very real, denied opportunities were still very real and it was well before the Civil Rights Movement and [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and the civil rights legislation of the mid-'60s [1960s].  So when I think about what I've done it seems so miniscule that's why I'm so honored and actually quite--it's unbelievable that I'm even being considered a HistoryMaker when I think of people who literally put their lives on the line so that I could even have lunch anywhere I choose, let alone have a job and opportunity.  So those are the real history makers and I'm just trying to say thank you by taking advantage of the opportunities that they made available.

Story_ID: 190317
Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: I think for our people in particular it's so important because it's so empowering because when we consider, like the line from our national anthem ['Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing'], you know "the paths with tears have been watered".  When we consider the path that we've taken as a people in this country to know our history, how could we not be empowered to know that greatness is within us, that we can--if we have overcome what we have overcome, from the Middle Passage from being snatched from Mother Africa to the Middle Passage to now, we should be able to figure out what we need to do to continue our march on the upward path, and that's something that disturbs me that we're not doing all that we can do, and that's why I commend this team and your leader Julieanna [Richardson] for this tremendous initiative, because I think it will be, it will be such a lightning rod in terms of moving us where we need to go as a people because we have lots of work to do.
