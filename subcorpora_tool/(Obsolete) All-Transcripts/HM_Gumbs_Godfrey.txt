Story_ID: 21501
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as sort of a warm up, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is curry.  I like it really spicy and I like to eat it as much as I can.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: All right, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year would be Christmas when my family gets together and I'm very happy to meet them because they're spread out all over the place.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Favorite vacation destination for us is Panama in the Caribbean.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I have several of them, but it depends on the occasion, I guess, and I would say it's, "That's all it takes", for example.
Story_ID: 21502
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, separately.  Then we'll put 'em together, we'll put their stories together.  So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother, her maiden name was Mary Teresa Jansen.  So, it's M-A-R-Y, T-E-R-E_S-A, and then J-A-N-S-E-N.  And that's her name.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: August 29th, 1916.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was born in Georgetown, Guiana.
Speaker 1: Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what do you know about what they were doing?
Speaker 2: As far as I know, my mother, my mother's father, his ancestry is in Surinam.  That is in Dutch Guiana.  And I believe that his parents immigrated to Guiana at the turn of the twentieth century or maybe a little bit before.  That's as much as I know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Surinam is just above Brazil, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's, it's, we have British Guiana, French Guiana and, as well as Surinam, which is Dutch Guiana, the three Guianas sitting side-by-side on the Northeast shoulder the continent of South America.
Speaker 1: And what links all the Guianas together?  I mean since they were--
Speaker 2: Well, the, definitely not the language, but I think that they used to be owned at one time or other by either the British or the Dutch or the French, and then it was, pieces were sold off to various, various countries.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I just wondered, does Guiana mean something, the same, does it have the same meaning in all three countries or--
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's the "land of many waters", Guiana.  It's supposed to be like a, indigenous Indian name.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so is there a--so your grandfather came from Surinam, your maternal grandfather--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was George Jansen, J-A-N-S-E-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, so he was, he came to British Guiana looking for better opportunities or was there any other reason why he--
Speaker 2: I believe that he was born in Guiana, but his parents were, were born in Surinam.  So his ancestry is in that part of the world.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he came when his, his parents came over from--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So is there any reason that's given for why his parents came?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  No, it was never told to me, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so what did they do for a living in Guiana?
Speaker 2: He was a businessman, small businessman.  I'm not sure what his business was concerned with.  But that's how he earned his living.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and your mother, she grew up in Georgetown--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, did she talk about growing up and what it was like, you know, growing up on the island?
Speaker 2: Yes, she told, she told us that she was, I think the third child, third or fourth.  And there were about ten children.  And being one of the older ones, she had to take care of some of the younger ones.  So she left school at a very early age, even before she graduated from, from high school.  And this, as you will see, had a tremendous impact on the rest of, on us, that is, her kids.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what did her mother do?  She was working apparently, is that right?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, that is my mother's mother?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: No, she was a homemaker throughout her life, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But your mother had to help take care of the younger siblings?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  And for one reason or another, either because her mother was pregnant at the time or, you know, had to run errands or something like this.  So she was called upon.
Speaker 1: Okay, was she the oldest of the ten?
Speaker 2: No, she was, I think, the third or fourth kid in the family.  But I think that some of the older ones were boys, and so she had to step up at the time--
Speaker 1: All right,--
Speaker 2: --but married early or something like this.
Story_ID: 21503
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us something about Georgetown in Guiana.  What's the racial makeup of Guiana and what's the economy like and what's the story?
Speaker 2: Okay, so Georgetown is the capital of Guiana.  It is, it's very cosmopolitan.  It has, the population is made up of Indians, in a majority, that is, East Indian, in a majority, African, Americans, people of Portuguese origin as well as English origin, people of Chinese extraction as well as the native, the native Indians.  The economy is essentially based on trading.  People will bring their goods into the country, in the capital, I'm sorry, and would trade whatever they've brought in from the country area.  And also, it would be where you have the commerce being run and the main offices of the government and so on.  The government is, the local government as well as the federal government is located in Georgetown. So that's, that's how the economy is, what the economy is based on.
Speaker 1: So people come to Georgetown to trade commodities or raw materials?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  What things that they would grow, such as fruits, vegetables, natural resources that they would, that they would mine, such as gold and things of this nature.
Speaker 1: Okay, does Guiana have aluminum and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, it does, it has the raw ore, which is bauxite, and it was first discovered, I think by the Canadians, and they were mining bauxite for many years.  So, and this is turned into aluminum, as you know, but it was, it was very profitable for the country.
Speaker 1: And I think it's famous for timber too, isn't it, for certain (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That is, that is, yeah, that is true.  It has a lot of wood.  So, and that's how, at least in, for many years our homes were built out of, were wooden homes.
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned gold.  Now, is gold really a big--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  We have, we have a large amount of gold in the interior of the country.  And I heard recently they've found oil.  And this is sort of understandable because it's very close to Venezuela and also it's where oil has been discovered.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's well known that Venezuela has a lot of oil, so--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 21504
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so your mother had to drop out of school to take care of some of her brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, what's--
Speaker 2: Not my brothers, her brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: Her brothers and sisters, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, her brother and sisters.  But did she have any stories to tell about growing up, about what it was like, so when you came along you wouldn't have to, you would know something about--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, okay, she, she told us that at a very early age, she went to work.  And, of course, she didn't have the qualifications so she would end up, she ended up selling in, working in, like a corner store or working in a place where she would learn how to, in seam--learn to be a seamstress, that is, to sew clothing and so on, which she was able to make use of her expertise when she eventually got married.  So that's, but she was determined that we were not going to follow in her footsteps.  So, I think this had a very important impact on the family that she had eventually.
Speaker 1: So she regretted having to drop out of school?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't regret it.  It's, well, well, yes, she regretted it in that she wasn't, she wasn't given the chance to do so and realized that if she had the opportunity, she would have been, she would have extremely well because she was a very smart lady and managed the household very, very well and was able to solve problems within the home and give us advice, and, you know, things of this type.  So we know that she is a very, very intellectual person.
Speaker 1: In Guiana, is it easy to go to school and stay in school and go all the way through or is it, was it difficult for people to do that?
Speaker 2: Now, it is, now, it is because there are various things in place.  But at, at, when we were growing up, most of the schools, you had to pay for, that is, there was a tuition.  Even to go to a high school, you had to pay something.  You had to pay tuition fees.  And if you don't have it, then, you know, this is a good reason for you not to continue.  And so I think that it is a combination of things like this which made her not being able to continue.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so no public schools as such, you know, or very few--there's little public education.  You have to pay to go.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, that's right, yeah.
Story_ID: 21505
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, let me go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father's full name is Charles, C-H-A-R-L-E-S, Alexander, A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R, Gumbs, G-U-M-B-S.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth was April 1st, 1909.
Speaker 1: Okay, was he born in Guiana?
Speaker 2: He was born in Georgetown also.
Speaker 1: Georgetown, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You told us a little bit about his background, but he--well, what's the story of your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, so my father told us that his mother passed away when he was about seven years old.  And his grandmother adopted him and he grew up with her.  And his father, basically took off and left him and his sister to be taken care of by his, by his grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was his grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: I don't know, no, I don't know his grandmother's name.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she would have had to been born in the nineteenth century, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, for sure.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I'm thinking, oh, ghee, if he was born in 1909, then that probably put his grandmother, she couldn't have been born, well, probably around 1880 or so, I guess, you know, maybe--
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably--
Speaker 1: Or it could have been sooner than that even, even further back than that, you know.  So, yeah, so, okay.  So he was raised by his grandmother, and his grandmother had passed by the time you came along?
Speaker 2: Yes, I never, I never met them, never met her, no.  And I think she was a single, she looked after him on her own.  I'm sure how she was able to do so.  But at the age of about seventeen or eighteen, he had to leave school and go and work as a postal clerk to support himself as well as maybe to contribute to the household.  So he, too, never went on to, to higher education or whatever.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he was in school until seventeen, so that's--
Speaker 2: I think about seventeen years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's, you know, so he had like some--
Speaker 2: A little bit more education, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then to get a job as a postal clerk requires some--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, the passing of tests or something like this, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, this is the British educational system, right--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --where they model, I mean the schools are modeled on the British system.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And so, now, I've heard it said here many times that people that come out of the British system in high school can actually, you know, handle themselves fairly well--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --better than people in the United States.  I don't know if that's true.  But, you know.  Do you think so as, (laughter) just as--
Speaker 2: Well, they, they, it turns out that many of the courses that I would teach here in the first year of physics, we would have covered them in high school, in the, under the British system.  And you do, we do here, we have a four, four-year degree program while under the British system, there's a three-year, a degree program that lasted three years.  So, you know, you must have done a lot more in high school than you would have done here.  But I think things are eventually, are changing up here in the U.S. where students cover a little bit more, not necessarily in the high school itself, but by taking, taking AP courses and so on, you know, the standardized tests.  So it is changing.  It's getting much better, I think.  Yeah, the students are much more prepared nowadays than they used to be, let's say, fifteen years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your father have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Just one sister.  It was just him and his sister.
Speaker 1: And they were both raised by his--
Speaker 2: By the grandmother, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, did he have any stories about growing up, about the, you know, the difficulties they may have faced or without anyone else to support them.
Speaker 2: Well, he wouldn't say much, but he, he told me that his grandmother got him interested in reading quite a lot.  So he was an avid reader.  And he passed on some of this to us.  That is, we just had to read and do our homework and things of this type.  So this is the way that he realized that, for us to get out of the poverty-stricken level that we are at, then education was the, the way to go.
Story_ID: 21506
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I, I'm number seven of eight brothers and sisters.  There were five boys and three girls.
Speaker 1: Now, can you name everybody in order for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, so the first, the first one is Charles Ivlaw (ph.).  The second is Pauline Elaine, P-A-U-L-I-N-E, E-L-A-I-N-E, Pauline Elaine.  The third was Pamela, P-A-M-E-L-A, Angela.  The fourth was Frank, F-R-A-N-K Alexander.  The fifth was Rita, I can't remember her second name, but Rita.  The sixth was Gordon Ignatius, G-O-R-D-O-N, I-G-N-A-T-I-U-S.  And then myself was number seven.  And then Rudolph, R-U-D-O-L-P-H, Maurice, M-A-U-R-I-C-E.  Those are the eight.
Story_ID: 21507
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, is there a story about--I know Georgetown's probably a small place, but is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Well, the way I understand it is that he was doing his postal runs, and he met my mother's sister.  And he came home to see her, and when he saw my mother [Mary Teresa Jansen], herself, he decided to make a switch.  That's how the story goes.  So that I think that's how he met my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so they got married, about what year was it?
Speaker 2: Well, she was, I think about eighteen or nineteen years old, so that would put her about 1934.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So married in 1934.  Now, when you think about your parents' personalities and their gifts and their habits and their looks, their mentality, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I have the drive of my mother [Mary Teresa Jansen], for the perseverance.  She would work very, very hard.  And I think this is one of the attributes that I have from her.  From my father's  [Charles Alexander Gumbs] side, I think, you know, I'm a sort of a quiet person, into myself, and this is the way he was.  He used to be the (unclear), as I said.  And I sort of took this from him, knowing that one has to look after one's family, keep close to the family and be centered, have one's activities centered around the family, I think that it was from both of them.  And so I sort of accumulated things from each individually, as well as a couple.
Story_ID: 21508
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, I think my, one of my earliest childhood memories was, was about three years old.  And we went to take a group photograph, that is with my parents as well as with the rest of the family, rest of my brothers and sisters.  And so I've been able to, the photograph which I have at home is black and white.  And so I sort of, there was no way that I could tell the colors of the clothing that various people were wearing, but I could do so.  I told this to my older siblings, and they were essentially amazed that I was, I could remember things as far back as when I was about three years old.  And so that's one of the things that I sort of would tell them that I remember.  And it's one of my earliest recollections.
Story_ID: 21509
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, can you describe where you grew up?  Was it, was there a name for the part of town you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Okay, so I was born in Georgetown, and we moved to various places within Georgetown for one reason or another.  Eventually, my mother and father bought a home in a place which is called, right on the river, on the Demerara River.  It's called Meadowbank.  And that's where I spent a few years of my life.  It was very, very pleasant.  And it was like a close-knit community.  And I really thought that a lot of my early inclinations of scholarly activity are actually born in, at about the time we were living there.
Speaker 1: And how old were you when the family moved there?
Speaker 2: I was about eight years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we always ask this question in the same way all the time.  And this is the question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay, so one of the sounds definitely were the car horns on the streets or the, the ships going by on the river and the music that would be, that was popular in the Caribbean, and that is Calypso.  So, and the steel, of course, they used steel pans to hammer out the, the tunes.  So those are things I could never forget.  So the sights, the sounds all combined in what I just described. Yeah.
Story_ID: 21510
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, can you tell us the first school you attended?
Speaker 2: The first school I attended was, I believe it was called St. Thomas, St. Thomas Moore Roman Catholic School, St. Thomas Moore Roman Catholic School.  And I was there for a few years, maybe three years or four years.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how old were you when you started school?
Speaker 2: I started school when I was about five years old.  And I, you know, I would progress through the school, but--from one grade to the next, and, but I was always essentially at home because I was more, I was very, I was always very ill for a lot of the time.  And so my mother used to tell me to, she would get the work which was being covered in class.  And then she would bring it home to me to, to do it, and, but they, but I would always have to go to school to take the tests.  And the teachers were always curious whether or not I would pass the test.  And, but I did.  I did so well in one of the, in one of the test, that the rule was that the first three, the first, top three students, that is, number one, two and three of the students would skip a class.  And, and they, I was, I think I was number two.  And the number one was chosen to skip the, I think it was the third grade, and the number three.  But not the number two who was, that was me.  And so, my mother was enraged when this was told to her, that they kept me, they didn't allow me to skip a class because I was not in school enough, all right.  And said, this was never outlined, and so eventually, gave in to her.  So that's one of the earliest recollections I have.  I saw my mother in full force, trying to take care of her kids.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21511
Speaker 1: Okay, now, why were you so sick when you were growing up?  I mean, what was wrong?  Can you tell us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I believe that it was, I have Asthma.  And I think also my diet was not that good to begin with.  So I was, I was in some way, vitamin deficient.  But Asthma used to, you know, choke me up quite a bit.  So this went on until I was about seven years or so, and so my mother was trying different remedies and things of this type.  I don't know what worked, but at age seven, it just vanished.
Speaker 1: So were you suffering from some form of anemia or something or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was always skinny, and the doctors, whenever she would take me for my Asthma, would give me some vitamins, iron or an iron supplement or some other type of vitamin because they thought that, you know, maybe I was, I didn't have the resistance to the, to the colds and the flu's and stuff like this.
Story_ID: 21512
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were at St. Thomas Moore Catholic School until you were about eight?
Speaker 2: Until I was about eight, yeah?
Speaker 1: Is that when the family moved to--
Speaker 2: To Meadowbank.
Speaker 1: Meadowbank, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so then where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: And then I went to school in Wrungfield (ph.) Anglican School for, I think up until I was about twelve years old.
Story_ID: 21513
Speaker 1: It seems curious.  It's a Dutch name, but it's an Anglican school.
Speaker 2: That's correct, yeah, yeah.  So we have in Guiana, there are various cities and towns that have Dutch names.  And this is one of the, this is one of the, this is a piece of evidence that the Dutch were there (laughter) at some point, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you, so you--were you interested in any particular subject in school, I mean at this point in school, in grade school?
Speaker 2: I was very much interested in the languages, that is, French, Latin.  And also I liked history and, and English, English literature.  And the sciences were not taught at the school, at any of the schools that I went up to that point.  After the age of about twelve, I then went to a school that offered the humanities only.  And I took the exam, and this was an exam.  This was run by the British.  It's called a, the General Certificate of Education which was graded by the University of London.  So up to that point, I had taken no science, none, no science whatsoever.  And with the grades that I had, I was given a chance to enter a school.  It's called the Queen's College of Guiana where the sciences were offered.  And so I put forward, you made an, I applied and they accepted me.  And the debate at that time was whether I should start the sciences, that is, biology, one of the sciences, biology, physics, chemistry, math, you know, or just continue with the humanities.  And so I did a little calculation in my head, mainly that, if I did the sciences, then the long-term benefits would be much better for me.  That is, I can get into being an engineer or, or something of this type or if I were--or even teaching.  Or if I were in the humanities, and it was more restrictive.  And so I bet and took the, the science option.  That's how I got started in the sciences.
Speaker 1: All right, now this is, seems kind of risky because you had no preparation.
Speaker 2: I had no preparation, no, no.
Speaker 1: But did you have confidence in your mathematical abilities?
Speaker 2: None whatsoever, nothing at all.  And so I think just after I went into the class, this was in--there was a test.  And the test was on the material that was, of course, taught in the, in class.  But many of the students had done this, had covered this material, so I was way down, way down (laughter) in, in the score.  And so this was like a mid-term test.  And I told myself, well, okay, I have half a semester to, to improve.  Otherwise, I'll just switch back to the humanities.  And it turned out that in that, in the final, the end of term class, exams, I should say, I was, I don't know, number two or so in most of the classes that I was taking.
Speaker 1: Now, how was this accomplished?  Did you have a mentor or a tutor?
Speaker 2: Nothing at all.  As I said, it was just hard work.  My mother [Mary Gumbs], falling in the footsteps of my mother, and I was, I was reading like crazy, that is, doing a lot of sums and solving problems of my own and, you know, staying late, late at school, into the, you know, when most of the students were on the soccer field.  And this is the way I did it.  But, no, no, extra classes, no.
Speaker 1: Now, did, were there any special teachers that helped you along?
Speaker 2: No, but some teachers immediately took an interest in me because they realized what my background was.  And it was known to them that I had no science background because of the fact that, you know, I didn't do well in the first, first exam.  And I had older brothers who were, who were there, so they recognized the name.  And they, one teacher by the name of Mr. Yhap, Y-H-A-P, took a very keen interest in me.  He was an, he was my math teacher, and the challenge was after one year, I had to take this external exam which was graded by the University of London.  And so I passed, there were about four, four subjects, and I passed them all and got good grades in them.  And then I was ready to move on to the last two years of that high school which would prepare me for a general scholarship.  And, but I, there were only about two scholarships in maybe, no, I should say maybe four, a handful of scholarships, four scholarships, which were funded by the Guiana government.  Oh, this was in their entire, for the entire student population, taking these exams, as I said, graded by the University of London.  And so I told myself that I better be, you know, in the top, in the top, the top two or three.  Otherwise, you know, there's no chance of getting--
Speaker 1: Now, these are scholarships to go where?
Speaker 2: Anywhere, anywhere, as long as you're accepted by the University.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And so--
Speaker 1: So you can go to any school you wanted to if you passed, if you passed these exam and--
Speaker 2: If you passed the exams and if you were accepted by the university admissions committee.
Speaker 1: Now, is there, are there any universities in Guiana?
Speaker 2: Not at the time.  There were, there were, it was now started.  It's called the University of Guiana.  And they were now starting a program of studies of a new syllabus.  This was one of the, on the takings of the Prime Minister of Guiana at the time, Dr. Cheddi Jagan.  So it was, it was not within my best interest to go to the University of Guiana at that time.  So I was, I, I told my, my teacher, Mr. Yhap, that I would be very much interested in going to England to study because, you know, because of the British influence.  And he asked me which ones?  And I told him either the University of London or Cambridge University.  And so my first choice was Cambridge and not only Cambridge, but Trinity College where Isaac Newton was an undergraduate.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had already identified Isaac Newton as a hero?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, because I did calculus, and his name was popping up in, in the, you know, in the mechanics that I was doing at, in preparation for this exam.
Story_ID: 21514
Speaker 1: So, I take it you spent a lot of time in your youth studying--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you do anything, I mean did you have any other activities that you were engaged in?
Speaker 2: Not much because of the fact that I was not very strong.  That's one, and two my eyesight was very, was very poor.  And so, playing with, playing with glasses on was not a safe thing to do.  And so I would, I would essentially look on at my fellow, at my classmates playing soccer or playing, you know, other types of sport.  But I would not participate, no.
Speaker 1: Now, did you like music?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved, I loved music, yeah.  Music was one of the things that I really loved.  And at that time, it was the local music, that is, the ones which were, you know, what's called Calypso.  So I really liked to listen to, to--I was intrigued by the steel, the steel drums, you know, how they were able to design the sounds, the various notes to make, you know, even classical music.  I, I didn't know too much about classical music.  I, I did music appreciation at this school that I attended called Queen's College of Guiana.  So they would, they introduced me to Bach, Mozart, you know, the standard composers.  And so when I went to England, I wanted to know more, and so I bought LP's and listened to them in my, in my dorm room.  And that's how I developed a deep love for classical music and jazz as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, who were your role models in growing up?
Speaker 2: Growing up, I would say undoubtedly my mother.  She was my role model, and the reason, of course, is because of what she did for me as a child.  And the teacher that really admired was this, Mr. Yhap.  He was a very, very bright person, and he sort of--the way that he would solve a problem, that is, he would get it outlined first, identify what's to be done.  And his general approach is what got me thinking the way that I do right now, at the present time.  So the two of them, I would say were my, were my two role models, but for different reasons, yeah.
Story_ID: 21515
Speaker 1: Okay, now, living in a place like Guiana, do you, I mean did you have a lot of--I mean did the community have a newspaper for the black community and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --or they did it even--
Speaker 2: At the time, there was, you know, we were all together, so there was no identification of, you know, one part of the population have been targeted by a newspaper or anything like this.  So there was a local newspaper called 'The Guiana Graphic'.  And so I used to, my mother would, would tell, would buy the newspaper from whatever little means she had so that we can read the newspaper.  I always would be waiting for the newspaper boy to deliver the newspaper 'cause I was interested in the comics, you know.  And so I would, I got started reading the comics, and my eyes would move to various other parts of the, of the newspapers, looking at the politics or, or, you know, whatever events would be taking place at the time, yes.
Speaker 1: And when you were growing up, I know that Guiana was making strides towards independence, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, I know Forbes Burnham was one of the early leaders.  Was your family involved in any of that as, actively or passively, you know?
Speaker 2: Maybe passively, passively, but not actively at all.  And it was, it was a very volatile time, volatile in the sense that there were, there were riots in the country, and looting and, because one party was jostling for position over the other, that is, between Cheddie Jagan and Forbes Burnham who we just mentioned, okay.  So it, it was, it was a terrible experience in that there was a general strike, so, which meant that the schools were closed for forty (unclear) days, for several months.  And so groceries were hard to come by, and I realized that this is not, this was not the place for me to live in.  And so, that was one of the reasons I decided that getting an education outside, that is going to a university outside Guiana was good for me.  But then there were some drawbacks as well, that is, the change in culture, leaving your family behind and so on.  It was, and the change, the change in climate was just traumatic.
Speaker 1: Now, what was, how old were you when the riots were going on?
Speaker 2: I would about fifteen years old, sixteen years old.
Story_ID: 21516
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were at Queen's College, I mean the--
Speaker 2: I was at Queen's College, yeah, at the time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you have a, you applied to Cambridge and University of London, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And, now, were you involved in high school activities, I mean in the, at Queen's College like, I mean did you do anything other than study (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: 'Cause you had to do a lot of serious study, that what I--
Speaker 2: I did a lot of serious studies, and I, you know, the time was, if there was a limited period of time, you know, because I only had a couple of years to get to writing this exam, so, maybe three years.  And so I decided that it was nothing else.  It was, I did almost nothing else.  I should not lie.  I did almost nothing else but study, and, and my mother, my parents [Charles and Mary Gumbs] were very supportive of it.  And they realized what challenge I had before me.  I explained to them, explained to them, and they knew also because my other brothers had tried it and they did not accomplish it, that is, to get a scholarship that would take them out.  They got other scholarships, but I, I wanted that scholarship because I wanted to do pure math, pure or applied math and, or physics.  You can get maybe, you could have gotten a scholarship to do engineering or so, but not, not that, no.  And so, this was, this was my only chance.  And there was an age limit also.  And so I had just one shot.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you say your siblings--were you the, you were the first in your family to go to college, I think you said?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: But this Queen's College is not a college--
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: It's like a high school, but it's called, it's given this name by the British.
Speaker 1: Right, I mean, but in terms of, if you went to Cambridge [University], would you be the first one in your family to go to college?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, there were two others before me, and Frank, he went to the University of Redding in England and then Gordon, he went to the University of the West Indies.  There was another brother who went to study law in London, but he ran out of funds and had to return home and eventually settled down and became a teacher, a school master.  So, you know, we were all, my other siblings, my sister was the head nurse at the local hospital.  And then my sister was a pharmacist and so on, and so we, you know, some of us were, you know, took the path of an educational, an educational path.
Speaker 1: So your parents really emphasized education, and she supported you all in terms of your educational aspirations?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yes, there was--yes, absolutely.
Story_ID: 21517
Speaker 1: So, okay, so did you, so when you graduated from Queen's College, did you graduate with any honors?
Speaker 2: With honors?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So this is how you get the scholarship, right (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's how you got the scholarship.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so that makes sense.  That was a silly question (laughter).  But, so, did you gradate number one or two or--
Speaker 2: Number one.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And, now, what--was it just your reading, your reading about Isaac Newton and others that made you want to, you know, do pure math and physics?
Speaker 2: No, with math, you have a well-defined problem and a well-defined solution.  So there's no problem that's alternative solutions.  And this is what I liked.  That's number one.  Number two was that, you just to have to know the basic principles and then build on it.  So math and physics appealed to me.  And so going to Cambridge, I could have gone into the natural sciences, that is, doing a lab component in addition to doing the theory part.  I didn't want to do the lab part, so I concentrated on the applied math part which is, which covered the same syllabus, but without the lab part.  And so, you know, I had my eyes set on particular, a particular area and (unclear) I mean physics is made up of different, has different branches, nuclear, plasma and particle physics.  But I chose what's known as solid state physics because of the nature of the problems, that is, it involves materials and involves a little bit of chemistry but, and also math.  So the three, the three intertwined, math, physics and chemistry, and so that's why I chose this field that I'm in now.
Story_ID: 21518
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you were growing up, before I get you out of Guiana, was your family religious?  Did they go to church?  Or was it a--
Speaker 2: My mother [Mary Gumbs] was a very religious person.  My father [Charles Gumbs] was also religious, but he never went to church as much as she did.  And, but she was very active in church, church activities.  And, you know, she played a key role in, you know, in preparing for the Sunday services and so on.  And, and we used to live, in Meadowbank, we used to live just next door to a church.  So she got me to be an altar boy.  So I was an altar boy for several years.  This was a Roman Catholic church.  And so I was an altar boy as well as the priest would call upon one of the altar boys to accompany him to, for the, you know, for the last rites or, you know, to bless the, the, you know, to participate in a funeral, in a funeral ceremony.  And so I would, I would go with him.  So I, I was exposed to religion at an early age, and I still have my religious convictions, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I just wondered what kind of influence it might have had on you or the family growing up.  So, all right, so you're on the verge of graduation.  You're top in your class, and did you have to make a presentation at graduation, a speech or--
Speaker 2: No, but there was a, they presented me with, with a few prizes on graduation.  And, and there was just one person who was allowed to speak.  He was the, from the student body.  He was like the head of the student clubs and so he, he made a presentation as well as the Prime Minister was there for a small amount of time, yes.
Story_ID: 21519
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you graduated in, what year was it?  Nineteen--
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty seven [1967].
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-seven [1967], okay, and you're on your way to London.
Speaker 2: On my way to Cambridge.
Speaker 1: Right, right, oh, to Cambridge, rather, (unclear) okay.  So had you ever been overseas before?
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: Had you ever been off the island before?
Speaker 2: Never (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, so--
Speaker 2: It was a culture shock.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what shocked you the most?
Speaker 2: Well, okay, so I arrived in early October when it was already cooling down from a temperature of about in the nineties, right, on the, in Guiana.  And the temperature there was, I think maybe in the forties (laughter).  So it was a dramatic change.  That's number one.  Number two was that there I was all alone, and there was a person who was supposed to meet me.  But for some reason he didn't show up from the British Council.  And so I had to find my way, ask questions in my, in my Caribbean accent (laughter) of English, trying to understand what they were telling me, take direction to head over to Cambridge [Cambridge University].  So that, that was the, that was the main shock.  The second shock was the following namely, as I was sort of realizing that, and you mentioned that Guiana was becoming independent or had become independent which meant that they had their own currency.  The plan was that the currency, the currency that I would take or that a student winning the scholarship would take would be in British pounds [pounds sterling] at the time, say a few years earlier.  But then I had to go with these new Guianese dollars which was quickly falling in value, all right.  And so it was, it was a time, it was a money crunch time, and, that, you know, it was very hard.
Speaker 1: So the value of the money was dropping as you had it, as you brought it over?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And so I didn't even have enough in tuition to pay my tuition fees.  I had to call up the consulate to explain to them that, you know, the, it's not enough.  It just wouldn't do.  And so they, they tried to help me out as much as they can, yeah.
Speaker 1: So did they get you some more money?
Speaker 2: They got me some, a little increase, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, did the scholarship provide a place for you to live?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it essentially covered everything or that was the idea, that is, tuition and board and lodging, of course.  And so I was free, again, to work as hard as I can on my courses and not have to work, not have to do work.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a roommate in college?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I was on my own.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, staying on the campus or--
Speaker 2: On the campus, yeah, always on the campus.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, so anything else about the culture that shocked you?
Speaker 2: The food, the food was, was miserable.  You know, you miss what you are used to eating, and it, the diet was completely different.  And the meals were provided in the evenings.  There was also lunch, but, you know, you have to--I have to pay for my meals.  And so, again, I didn't have enough money to buy, you know, the, both lunch and dinner.  So I had to make do with the dinner and cook something for myself for lunch and so on, while at the same time hurrying to lectures.  So it was, it was tough.  It was hard.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were you prepared for the work at Cambridge?
Speaker 2: It, again, it was, it was--I was, I was from Guiana, coming from Guiana.  And the students coming from England, mostly from England, they were more prepared than I because their teachers knew the syllabus much more than the teachers back in Guiana.  So I had some catching up to do.  But it, it, you know, it took me a year or so, less than a year to catch up.  And so I was doing okay after that.
Speaker 1: Okay, was it exciting being there on the campus--
Speaker 2: It was very exciting, yeah, it was very exciting because I met, I began to meet people from all over the world.  And so, when the English boys were going, going back home at the end of the semester, those of us who were from overseas would get together, and we would talk, tell each other stories about our homes, about ourselves and also relate our, relate stories about our backgrounds.  So I learned quite a bit, yeah.
Story_ID: 21520
Speaker 1: Yeah, what were some of the other students like and what ethnic groups did they represent and where did they come from?
Speaker 2: Okay, so many of the students, the foreign students, came from the (unclear) formed British colonies like in, those in Africa, Singapore and some of them came from, from, a few of them came from Europe.  So I met students from South Africa, from Sierra Leone, from Singapore and, and from Greece and so on.  So they were from, you know, from various parts of the world.  Even, I met someone from, from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology].  He was doing his PhD there, and he became--he was doing engineering.  So I used to go over to his, to his home and he was married at the time.  And so he would invite me to spend the evening with him and his wife.  And so, you know, I was, would ask him lots of questions about the U.S. and about the, about his--he would always tell me that he's not going to stay in England.  He wants to go back to the states.  As a matter of fact, he came back.  He was, he was a graduate of MIT, his own graduate, and then he came back after doing his PhD in, in Cambridge, he came back and is now a professor at MIT.  His name is James Williams.  So he is one of the people that I really admired quite a bit.  There were also some, there was also a Canadian who was doing engineering.  And so he had an influence on me in that he used to tell me a lot about studying in Canada.  And so I decided that after graduating in, from Cambridge, if I were to stay in one of the, in a commonwealth, British Commonwealth country, it would be Canada.  And so that's how I ended up, I think, in applying to the University of Toronto.
Story_ID: 21521
Speaker 1: Now, who were the teachers, I guess, at Cambridge that influenced you the most?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was, it is hard to say whether they influenced me because the classes were very large.  The system in Cambridge was that, if you are doing math, then where you are living, you, I mean you're identified with a college mostly for, for lodging, for board and lodging.  So you may be at Trinity or you may be at St. Johns College.  But all the students would take the same lectures.  And so the classes were, I estimate maybe about 400 students.  So it, we were taught by some of the most famous people.  But, you know, if you were way at the back or you--there was no way that you could interact with them.  You may be able to ask them a question or so, but no conversation, and they would quickly leave.  But they were some of the, these were very, very well-known physicists and applied mathematicians.  And at that level, I mean being an undergraduate, you can't really appreciate the work which they did in research.  But you would just know that they were well known by, by word of mouth for some particular thing that they did.
Speaker 1: Who were some of them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of, one of the lecturers that came to give a lecture was Paul Dirac, and Dirac is a very--or was a very well-known physicist.  He has, he has an equation named after him called the Dirac Equation.  This is at the, these are the foundations of quantum mechanics.  And right now, I'm involved in some work which uses his equation, and it's, the material that I use is known as grapheme, which you probably will ask me about a little bit later on.  So he was one of them.  And another one was, was H. K. Moffitt.  So Moffitt is a very well-known fluid mechanics researcher.  And he did a lot of work on flows, fluid flows near corners and so on.  So, and these are two of the people who I met as teachers.  But at the same time, living in college, you would meet other famous people who were not necessarily teaching, who were not necessarily teaching you math or physics, but would be there doing research or from other disciplines also.
Speaker 1: Who are some of the ones that impressed you (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one that very much impressed me was one by the name of John Littlewood.  So John Littlewood was a colleague of Jeffrey Hardy.  And so these were two mathematicians.  And the story is that they were so very well known that people would send them manuscripts for their, you know, for their opinions.  And one of the people who sent them a manuscript was a person by the name of Ramanujan, an Indian mathematician.  And so Hardy and Littlewood, it was sent to Hardy, I should say--who I didn't meet, but he had passed away before I had arrived in Cambridge.  And so Hardy and Littlewood, just after dinner, looked at this bundle of formulas.  And so they identified some of them, but realized that some of the other results that was in the package, that were in the package were definitely--you just couldn't guess them.  They must be coming from a brilliant mind.  And so they contacted Ramanujan and got him over to Cambridge where he lived, I think, for maybe a decade or so and then got ill and returned to England, returned to India where he died.  So these are, these are the people--John Littlewood is a person I met.  And I actually had dinner with him, the very first dinner at Christmas.  I was Guiana, all alone at Christmas, and so my tutor invited me to have dinner with the other fellows of the, at Trinity College.  And so I, he sat me down next to an individual.  And I asked this person what he was doing.  He told me he was doing math.  I asked him what he was doing?  He told me he was doing analytical math.  And so I, and I don't think I asked him his name.  But at the end of the dinner, my tutor came over to me and said, how do you like, how did you like John Littlewood?  I said, who is John, who is John Littlewood?  So I didn't, you know, at the age of eighteen, I didn't quite appreciate who he really was.  But he was one of the giants of, in the field.
Story_ID: 21522
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, now, what aspect of physics did you focus on at Cambridge, and why did you choose the University of Toronto?
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, so the aspect of physics that I chose in Cambridge was solid state physics which has to do with the theory of solids, how they behave under various conditions such as temperature variations, pressure, magnetic fields, external electric fields and so on.  So I really was intrigued by that branch of physics.  And I wrote up a little report for my, for--as a project, and the professor was impressed with it.  And so he invited me over to be his, one of his graduate students.  But there was a little catch there in (unclear) that I had, I was funded for my undergraduate work but not for graduate work, which means that I had to get some funding from another source named or go ask the Guianese government to, for the funding for the graduate program.  And they agreed, but under one condition, that I would return to Guiana for, and serve the country for three years.  And so I told myself that if I returned and served for three years, then I would essentially get lost, I mean, in something or other, not necessarily focused on research.  And so I applied in a hurry to a couple of places.  I can't remember, one of them was the University of Toronto, and they accepted me.  And I, the reason I applied there was, it was a commonwealth country.  So, British Commonwealth, and so we all looked up to Canada as one of the main players in the, in the, within the Commonwealth.  The University of Toronto is the number one university in Canada, and it is highly ranked in, on the world stage.  And some of the professors who were there at the time were fairly well known.  One of them turned out to be my supervisor, Allen Griffin.  And so I did my thesis with him.
Story_ID: 21523
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you get married before you went to Canada?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I got married before I got to Canada.
Speaker 1: Tell us about how you met your wife and about getting married?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay, so, I have a cousin who would frequently stop by and see my parents or my mother, in particular.  And so one day I was at home, and this happened, I think, just after I took my final exam, and I was waiting for my results, that is, in 1967.  And she came with a young lady.  And I was, I was sitting the living room, and the young lady sat there.  Then she was introduced to my mother, and so I, being the shy person that I, that I was, I excused myself and then went to a different floor within the house.  And that was, that is how I, it turned out to be the person I got married to.  But that was in 1967, and shortly, thereafter, shortly after this incident, the results for this exam came out and I was number one.  So it was, it was big news, you know.  And so my picture appeared in the newspapers and so on.  So this young lady came by to the, to congratulate me.  And, and she invited, she, you know, she was visiting quite a bit, but never, we never took the step, any steps to date or anything like this.  But I, I left for England, and she corresponded with me.  And she said, she's interested in nursing, and she wanted, she would like to do a, to become an RN, a registered nurse.  And so she applied to one of the local hospitals in Cambridge, and went to Cambridge.  And we decided that, you know, we will get married.  And so we got married in 19--but not until after I graduated.  So she arrived in '69' [1969], and I graduated in 1971.  And I got married shortly thereafter.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, so did you both go to Toronto together?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we went to Toronto together, yes.
Speaker 1: So this is about 1972?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy two [1972], yes, yes, we went to Toronto in '72' [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did you, if you thought that England was cold, what about Toronto?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Toronto was colder, that is true.  But the thing is that when you are with, when you are indoors, the rooms are essentially heated.  In England, it was, you're, inside or outside, you are cold.  And the, I used to get along by putting money into a little machine, you know, dropping coins in order to get the gas up.  And that's how I was heating.  So I was very miserable with the, with that sort of arrangement.  And so my sister who was living in Canada at the time explained that, explained this, weather, it's much warmer indoors.  And so when you get outdoors, you know, you just bundle up and get moving quickly.
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that.  So, the campus buildings, are they, they're not centrally heated?
Speaker 2: Not at that time, not at the time.  Now, when I went, I have been going back to Cambridge almost every year, you know, thirty years or something like this, to work with colleagues and so on.  But when they put me up in one of the dorm rooms, it's very comfortable now.  So it, it changed.  You have central heating and so forth, but not when I was there, no.
Speaker 1: So you said you had a coin-operated machine--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --that, to warm the--
Speaker 2: To warm, to warm the whole room, yes.
Speaker 1: So the gas in a, was operated, it was coin-operated?
Speaker 2: It was coin operated so you have to deposit your, your quarters, your schillings.  And the gas would come up for a period of time, and then you have to put more.  But you sometimes, you know, so I used to spend a lot of time in the libraries where I would find a heater and would sit close to the heater.  So that's where I would do my work during the day.  At night, I would get home and warm myself up for a short period of time, and then, and then that's it, yeah, head to bed, yeah.
Speaker 1: Get under the covers.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  So, okay--
Speaker 2: But, but now things have changed.  They have changed, for sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21524
Speaker 1: So Toronto, so University of Toronto was, well, so that probably was not a culture shock in the senses that England was?
Speaker 2: No, because my sisters were there.  I was married at the time.  So I had some family with me, and I had a little bit more money because they had given me a scholarship from the University of Toronto.  So dollars would be, they gave me dollars, Canadian dollars.  I spent the Canadian dollars there.  So I was okay, and then my wife was working.  So it was, it was much--the living conditions were much improved.
Speaker 1: Now, when you graduated from Cambridge, did you graduate with honors from Cambridge?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I wanted to make sure we mentioned that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I didn't raise it before.  So, you're, you know, so they have someone who's really on the rise there at the University of Toronto with you there.  And I suppose they're not, you know, I mean someone who's sharp in physics is a commodity that people--
Speaker 2: You're referring to me?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, right.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, that was, it's rather curious that I, I met one of my colleagues who was my Ph--who was doing his PhD at the time, yes, that I was there in Toronto.  And he sort of recalled the following, namely that he was there, and he's very well known in his field, in physics, and this was in the physics department.  And he called about ten names, and we are all fairly well known in our fields.  So it looks as though they did, the admissions committee (laughter), did a fairly good job in making the selection for that group.  It was like one or two years, you know.  There was some overlap and so on.  Some of, some of the students, some of them went back to Hong Kong or they dropped out, but ten of us are very well known in the field, you know, with--so they didn't make too much fuss over me, no.
Speaker 1: So it was a talented incoming group--
Speaker 2: A talented, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --of very talented, okay.  All right, so, now, were there any special instructors there or people that stand out at the University of Toronto?
Speaker 2: The teachers were very good.  The courses were very good, and I still have some of the, some of my lecture notes which I use from time to time.  My professor was, Alvin Griffin was known in his field.  And also, there was another professor who I was interested in working with.  His name is Cy Vosko, V-O-S-K-O.  And he was well known.  The others were well known in their, in their, in the field that they were working in.  This (unclear) physics group that I was in, was well respected and their work was well cited.  So I felt comfortable in the group.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got your degree, your Masters degree in theoretical condensed matter physics?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Now, you just worked straight through, right, to the PhD?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: You didn't really stop?
Speaker 2: No, no stops, no.
Speaker 1: And was there any ceremony for the Masters degree or anything or did you--
Speaker 2: I never went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) There was a ceremony, but I never went to the ceremony for the Masters or the PhD, nah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I've heard quite a few of physicists that we've talked to and chemists as well who never even paused for the Masters degree.  They don't even give it any acknowledgement.  They just go straight through to, and they may have a little celebration at the PhD level, but you didn't even do that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Now, well, did you not consider it an accomplishment or was it considered insignificant because--
Speaker 2: No, no, it's, it is, you know, it's a good question, namely that, I guess I still have this, this thing that my accomplishments are behind me.  And I have something to work for, which is ahead of me.  And so if I write a paper and it's published.  You know, it's something that I, you know, I don't, I don't go back to look at it or, you know, gloat over it or anything like this because I have so many other projects to do.  So after graduating with my PhD, the thing which was, the challenge was to find work, to find something which I could do which was comfortable.  And so I thought to myself that I need to do what's called a post doctoral, some post doctoral work.  It turned out that, you know, you're writing your, your dissertation up and you're applying for, for positions.  This was like, this is something in, to be in training before you become a professor or you're out on your own, right.  So I applied to about four places, and I received all four of them.  And so, and one was in Louisiana, in Baton Rouge.  The other one was to be in Toronto, and another one was to be at the University of Waterloo in Canada and another was to be at the National Research Council in Ottawa, which I took, the last one, the research, the one at the National Research Council.  So after my dissertation, I headed out immediately to Ottawa to start working.  And the ceremony for the PhD was somewhere in between, you know, some time after I had left.  So I didn't think of returning--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to Toronto.  One was, I was living and working Ottawa, and it was behind me (laughter).  That was it.
Story_ID: 21525
Speaker 1: All right, well, tell us.  What was your dissertation title and what was it about in the simplest terms that you can describe it in?
Speaker 2: Okay, so, I was doing a couple of problems for my, for my dissertation but then decided to write just one of them.  One was on the phase transitions in, in restricted systems, in low dimensional systems in films.  And a phase transition is something as follows, namely that, if you have a piece of ice and you, you place it out in the, in the sun, then it melts.  So there is a transition from solid, the ice phase, to a liquid phase or if you boil water, there's a phase transition from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase which is steam.  And this is a very complicated problem.  I mean phase transitions occur, for example, if you, if you have a magnet, and you, you heat, you warm the magnet up, then it could lose its magnetization.  So the, the transition from being magnetized to not being magnetized, that's known as a phase transition.  And so I was considering phase transitions and the behaviors of, what plays a role?  The thing is what plays a role in causing this transition.  And so I was, I did, I did a couple of problems on this, but my thesis advisor wanted me to write something up for the dissertation, so I can defend it (laughter), to become a doctor.  And so I wrote up something on, on the second problem which is entitled, 'Surface Spin Wave Modes.'  So if you have a surface, then it's quite, the behavior of the material is quite different from if you look inside of the material itself.  So that's one.  That's the operative word, "surface".  A spin wave is a wave which involves a spin, and the spin in an intrinsic property.  For example, you know that the electron has a charge, you know.  There's a positive charge or a negative charge.  The electron has a negative charge, but also it has something which is due to an internal degree of freedom known as its spin, like a spinning top.  And this spin is what couples the electron to a magnetic field.  For example, if you do an MRI, when there's only, the only way you could get an image is because you have a material which couples to this external magnetic field.  And the material must have this internal degree of freedom known as the spin.  So I did my work on this, on this extra degree of freedom and how it behaves in, on a film.
Story_ID: 21526
Speaker 1: Okay, all right (unclear).  Okay, so you go off to Ottawa to do post-doctoral work?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so do you continue working on the same problem or do you, are you--did you go off into some other direction?
Speaker 2: No, that, this--a new direction, yes.  So, when you're working with someone, a more senior, a senior scientist, the senior scientist could either assign you a problem to work on or you find your own problem.  And you find your own problem based on the fact that it's topical, that is, it's something which is, you know, there's a real problem out there which you need to solve.  And so there were several problems we had discussed, that is, my supervisor and myself.  But he was not the type of person that, who liked to work with, with the research associate.  The research associate, the rule is that a research associate would do the work and at the end, would show him what you have done.  Okay, so I have to find a problem which I, which I think I should, I would be able to manage on my own.  And so I found problems on my own, and eventually, you know, would, from time to time, go talk to him, you know, for advice, but then show him the finished product.  So I did some work involving magnetic field effects on materials.  It was how they, how they would affect the properties of the material, how magnetic fields affect the properties of the materials under different conditions such as temperature and pressure and so on.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so this is in Ottawa.  This is at the, what is it?  The University of Ottawa?
Speaker 2: No, this is the National Research Council.
Speaker 1: National Research Council.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a government agency.
Speaker 1: The NRC?
Speaker 2: NRC, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 21527
Speaker 1: Okay, so I was saying before, in '85' [1985], I guess the Bell Labs discovered Carlodial (ph.) semi-conductor nano-crystals.  Now, you were paying attention to that, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what did that mean for you in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, it showed that nano, well, it was a new type of material.  And it meant that new types of properties were investigated, such as how the material behaved under external electric fields and magnetic fields.  And this work, nano, was, was beginning to come into focus, for me at least.  So "nano" means 10 to the negative nine, all right, 10 to the negative nine.  So nanometer would be 10 to the negative nine of a meter.  So it's very, very small, but still larger than the size of an atom.  So on the scale, the material has very, the material has very peculiar properties, and so I had started to look at some of, you know, putting together simulating the behavior of the properties through numerical calculations.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in '96' [1996], you were hired by the University of Lethbridge and that's also in Canada.
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986], right, yeah.  So you're hired as a professor of physics there?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is your first position as a professor?
Speaker 2: Yes, tenure track, yes.
Speaker 1: A tenure-track professor, okay.  So what sort of capacity did this provide for you to conduct, to further conduct your research?
Speaker 2: Okay, so it was, it was sort of a special professorship in that the government of Canada funded me at this university for, they were willing to fund me for about ten years.  The first five years would be, they would give, they would pay your salary, but at a, on a sliding scale.  The university would pay, begin to pay more and more as time went by.  And the whole idea--and it also came with a research grant, which meant that you can travel or, you know, to do your research or attend conferences or have, pay students or pay a post-doc or something like this.  And so, but the whole idea was that the government of Canada realized that there would be a number of positions becoming available through retirements.  And they would like to keep the Canadians, the Canadian physicist within Canada.  So they came up with this program.  It was a competitive program, and so I received one of these fellowships.  So I was out at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta [Canada] until about 19--from 1986 through 1990 when I was due for a sabbatical.
Speaker 1: Now, there's an important, we have a note here that there was an important paper that you wrote in '87' [1987] about the Fibonacci Sequence?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you describe that for us in simple terms.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Or I don't know if it can be described in simple terms, but--
Speaker 2: Well, it could be described in simple terms, namely, that, you know, you could consider--this, this Fibonacci, the name is Italian.  And it was named after Mr. Fibonacci, and he observed the following, namely, that if you have two rabbits, two rabbits, then the two rabbits could come together and produce a third rabbit.  So, you have one, plus one, would be two, and then the two plus the one would be three, all right?  So if you add in the sequence, one, then two and then the two plus one would be three, and the three plus two would be five.  And the five plus three would be eight, then you're making a sequence which is named after him, the Fibonacci Sequence.  So eventually, you would, you would--if you arrange.  For example, let's come to the physics part, namely, if you have the ability to grow material so that you have one type of material, another type of material with a Spacing A, and then another with a Spacing B.  And then you put together so the A and the B would make an AB.  So the spacing of the next would be AB, you form a Fibonacci Sequence.  And so Kermit Ally and myself came up with a sequence of papers where we made suggestions for what's known as quasi crystals.  So you build a crystal, not a regular crystal, but it's quasi-periodic.  It's not periodic, it's quasi-periodic.  So they call it a quasi-crystal, following this Fibonacci Sequence.  And it, there was an eruption of interests in the work.  And even now, it's still being cited twenty years later, this work, and that's basically what it is, the Fibonacci Sequence, as applied in material science.  It was a mathematical, it started out as a mathematical game, but we identified that it could be a, could be made use of in material science.
Story_ID: 21528
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in 1990 you were an Alexander Von Humboldt Fellow.  Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the end, after I was at the University of Lethbridge in Canada, I received a fellowship to study in Germany for--which was in the works before I went to Lethbridge, to study in Germany for two years.  But I didn't really want to give us the position as a faculty member and be there in Germany for two years.  So I asked the Humboldt, Von Humboldt Foundation, if I can spend my summers there.  And they agreed to this.  So I was in Julich, Germany--
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: J-U-L-I-C-H.  And I did two summers of research there, and I developed a new type of formulism for layered materials, that is when materials are, have several layers.  Then they could be coupled through the interactions, you know, the atomic interactions, the atomic forces.  And so I looked at these types of problems.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you did this during the summers of 1990 and '91' [1991]?
Speaker 2: Correct, yes.
Speaker 1: All right, now, in 1991 and 1992, you were a visiting professor at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology]?
Speaker 2: Correct, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, was this in the summer too or--
Speaker 2: No, this was, this was during the year.  And so I, I was on a sabbatical from, Leth--[Lethbridge], the university in Alberta.  And so I took the whole family with me to Cambridge, the Cambridge, Boston [Massachusetts] area.  And so I was a visiting fellow in, in the condensed matter physics group, but went over for the summer to be in Germany for the Humboldt fellowship.  So I was essentially in two places at, three places at the same time.
Speaker 1: So this had to be exciting.  You're rubbing elbows with all these other physicists.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  There were very famous people at MIT.  One of them is Patrick Lee who worked, who was a researcher at Bell Labs in, I think in the '70s [1970s].  So he was my host.  And see, he was working on a theory to explain why materials super conduct at such high temperatures.  And up to now, no one had actually came up with a theory, but he gave it a try.  And he failed or at least he failed so far.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is still something that people are working to try to--
Speaker 2: This is something that people are still working on.  It can explain why materials super conduct, such as mercury, at low temperatures, that is, let's say, four degrees, at helium temperatures, let's say it's four degrees Kelvin on the absolute scale.  Well, they cannot explain why some materials are based on the coup (unclear) rates actually super conduct at nitrogen temperatures, which is 98 degree Kelvin.  They cannot explain it.  And, well, it's still something out there which needs to be explained.  This is not my field though.  I'm not working in this field.
Speaker 1: Okay, but this was an exciting time to meet these other physicists and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --to have discussions, I mean do physicists really get excited when they're (laughter), they're around each other and have these--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they do.  The reason is because, you see, the thing about physics, as I tell my students, is that you should not think in terms of equations.  And my goal when I was a young faculty member was to be able to give a lecture without looking at my notes.  That was my goal.  And the reason for this is that, if you are able to talk about physics without referring to equations, then it becomes exciting because then you'd be able to--then you are forced to, you should be able to explain things in simple terms.  And so with, but if new experiments are performed and we have new results, then the question, you begin to discuss why it is you have these results, how to explain them.  And this makes it, this makes it interesting and very exciting to physicists, yeah.  And, you know, our lives revolve around physics.  And if we go, if you go to the bank to do an ATM, to do an ATM transaction, it's based on software.  It's also based on, on materials which you need to support the software or your iPad, your iPod, you know.  So it's very exciting, and it could also be profitable if, you know, to market it.
Story_ID: 21529
Speaker 1: Now, in 1991, from these notes I have, something exciting happened in Japan, I believe it was.  They discovered the carbon nano tube?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, what does this mean for your research?
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  So, at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], there was a professor there called Mildred Dresselhaus, D-R-E-S-S-E-L-H-A-U-S.  And she was working on carbon nano tubes, which I will explain to you in a minute.  But I just want to add something that she's one of our alumni at Hunter College.  She graduated from our physics department.  And she's the institute professor at MIT.  Now, you have carbon, you know, carbon occurs naturally.  And if you take just a sheet of carbon, carbon atoms, just a sheet of carbon atoms, and you roll the carbon atom up to form a tube, then you have a material with a radius which is a few nanometers, so you have a nano-tube made of carbon.  So it's a carbon nano tube.  And the carbon nano tube is very, very, could be very, very strong, and it could have some interesting electrical properties.  And so the flat screens that you have for your television monitor is made up of liquid crystal.  And I believe, I believe that they have made, a flat-screen monitor made of carbon nano tubes.  It's just many times brighter.  So it could be something which could come on the market at some point.  But the properties which I studied concerned electrical properties, the magnetic properties as well as the optical properties which would be the frequency of the light that it will emit when you, when you stimulate it.  So this is, this is the carbon nano tube that I worked on.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in '92' [1992], MC-41, MCM-41 and MCM-48 were discovered.  And these are nano-structured catalytic materials used in refining oil, right?  Is that a--do you remember that or is that in--
Speaker 2: Well, carbon could be used in the refinery of oil, yes.  Again, it is not directly in my field.  You know, the field is broad, and so this may be a part of the field of, where carbon technology is used, yeah.  But it, you can use it as a filter.  You can use carbon as a filter.  You have carbon filters.  So in the refinement of oil, I assume that this is what, this is how it could be put to good uses, yes.
Speaker 1: So I guess this note is in here to just underline that nano-technology was--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --starting to be used.  It's the beginning of nano-technology with practical uses.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 21530
Speaker 1: In '92' [1992], also you joined Hunter College as a distinguished professor.  And, now, how did this come about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, so I joined Hunter in '92' [1992] as a professor, a full professor, not as a distinguished professor.  I was at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] in '91' [1991], and the word got around, the City University of New York system that I was close by.  And the dean sent someone over to talk to me to encourage me to come to the City University.  I had, as you can see from the chronology that I was in Lethbridge from '86' [1986] to 1990, and I went to MIT.  That is in '91' [1991], and then this offer came in.  And so I was reluctant to move again.  But my, I have two sons who were with us on sabbatical, with my wife and myself.  And they were, they had pleaded with me not to return to Canada.  They, (laughter), they wanted to stay in the U.S.  I don't know.  They felt more at home here.  And they helped to make the, they helped to make my decision.  But, but apart from this, I felt myself that if I were at the City University, then I could be--and I think I could reach my full potential because of the interactions that I would have with colleagues that are [cough], excuse me, within the U.S.  And New York, especially, is very good for, for gaining, you know, getting to travel.  It was very, you know, the airports are close by and so on.  I could get flights to all parts, various parts of the world.  So it was appealing from that point of view.  And I thought that Hunter, itself, had a good track record for outreach and the research also that was going on in, not only the physics department, but in other departments.  So that's what caused me to take the position.  I was here from '92' [1992] until about 2005 or four [2004], I think, when I received another offer somewhere else.  And the president of the college made an offer to me that in order for me not to go, and that is to make me a distinguished professor.  So that's how I became a DP.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what comes with being a DP?
Speaker 2: Say?
Speaker 1: What comes with being a DP?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You get an extra stipend.  That's one, which means that your summer salary is covered.  But before then, I had a distinguished chair, which is called a key and a stool chair, for physics at Hunter [College].  So I have a distinguished chair at Hunter, which I can use to support students, and then I have a distinguished professorship from the City University of New York also.  So, there're two of them.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so what projects have you been working on here at Hunter College, and are you engaged in, more in research or teaching?
Speaker 2: I, I have a, I place emphasis on both.  So I have an active research program, and I have research funding from the Air Force Research labs.  And I estimate that since coming to Hunter in 1992, I published about 200 papers, and edited two books and wrote a book.  So, and they were, I also supervised several graduate students.  They are now professors in various parts of the country, and, you know, other parts of the, in other parts of the world.  So I, I have an active research program and much of it has to do with semi-conductors also, this new material called graphene which is just a mono-layer of graphite, just one layer of graphite.  And it has some very peculiar properties.  And it could also be very strong, although it's just one mono-layer.
Speaker 1: So that's, it's also very thin if it's just one layer--
Speaker 2: Very thin, just a mono layer, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what can you do with graphene?
Speaker 2: Okay, so, recently, they've abolished or they, the Shuttle program came to an end, right.  And at the present time, we are making use of the Russian, the Russian spacecraft to take up to a space station.  It is being suggested--because graphene is so strong, it is being suggested--maybe this is beyond our present capabilities, but to have a, a link made of graphene that would stretch from earth to the Space Station because it's so strong, and it's so flexible.  So this is one of the, one of the projects put forward.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, do they call this a space elevator or something?  I think I've read about it.
Speaker 2: Probably a space elevator, yeah.  So that's one.  The other thing is that because the electrons essentially give up a lot of their mass, they become very, very light.  So in order to move the electrons from one point to the next on a transistor, you need an electric field.  You can't do it otherwise.  So, if you could move the electrons with this very light mass from point to point on a transistor, at very high speeds, then you get a higher, a faster transistor.  So your iPad would be quicker.  Your computers would be much faster, and, and things of this nature.  So they have potential applications in these areas, yes.
Story_ID: 21531
Speaker 1: Okay, now, one source of, maybe it's support, that you received was the Eugene Lang Student Faculty Research Fellowship.
Speaker 2: Yes, I have, yes.
Speaker 1: That, and there are some others.  So what do you envision as the future for this, for nano-technology and for the work you're doing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that, as I explained, we are going to get a new set of foundries, creating or manu--fabricating quote, unquote "semi-conductor chips".  And I spent some time in Taiwan.  And they're really looking into the possibility of making semi-conductor chips made of graphene, right, and they would play a key role in cell phones and other types of, other types of electronic devices.  So I have hope that there is going to be a new class of materials which are much more powerful, much faster.  And telecommunications would be much more improved, with the use of this new material called graphene.
Story_ID: 21532
Speaker 1: Yeah, give us the story about graphene.
Speaker 2: Okay, so in 1947, there was a professor, a Canadian professor who I me when I was a graduate student in Quebec.  And his name is Phillip Wallace.  So he was doing numerical simulations on graphite.  And I think at the time, the computers were slow.  He didn't have a lot of capability of doing his calculations on graphite, which is a layered structure, many, many layers.  And so he decided to, you know, just do one layer, use one layer.  And he published a paper in what's known as the 'Physical Review' which is published by the American Physical Society.  So with one layer, he, there were several interesting properties which came out of the calculation.  And the question which was, which was posed was, since '47' [1947] was, is it really possible to get just a single layer of graphite, physically, that is free standing.  And it was, it was doubted whether it was possible.  And I think in about 2000, 2005, for whatever reason, the Russians took an interest in it, in making, in manufacturing it.  And one of my friends at Columbia, Phillip Kim, also was attempting, was trying to, to get the single layer, I don't know, by, by scraping it or whatever.  And the two Russian guys, Geim, G-E-I-M and Novasoloff (ph.), they were at the Moscow State University or University of Moscow--I can't remember which one.  But the immigrated to the U.K. [United Kingdom] in Manchester [England].  And they, they, you know, had some group meetings, and they were trying their best to clean up the material and so on.  So rumor has it, I'm not sure whether this is true, but rumor has it that they were cleaning the graphite to prepare, in preparation for experiments.  And they were cleaning it with scotch tape.  And I believe a technician noticed (laughter) that something was on the scotch tape and brought it to their attention.  And so they took the scotch tape, deliberately, and placed it on top of graphite and lifted it off and lifted off just one layer, which is a mono layer.  And that's what they got the Nobel Prize for, that is, the realization of graphene from graphite in the simple way.  Now, it's being produced in a much different manner, of course.  But that's the story of graphene.
Story_ID: 21533
Speaker 1: So, I was asking you before about, oh, becoming an ITP scholar, Institute of Theoretical Physics scholar?
Speaker 2: Yes, so, yes, so there is a theoretical institute at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and they have a scholars program for faculty.  And so you write a little proposal and you submit it, and then they look to see whether it's worthwhile, having you over for a few months.  And so I wrote a little proposal on what's, on a research topic, and submitted it.  It was looked at by the committee and so I spent a summer there.  But this was based on work which I was doing in Cambridge at the time, collaborating with some experimentalists.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were also, you also received in, this is the same year, the American Physical Society Edward A.--
Speaker 2: Boucher.
Speaker 1: --Boucher Award, thank 'cause I couldn't read it (laughter).  Good, good, thank you.  Yeah, now, what was that about?
Speaker 2: Okay, so Edward A. Boucher was an African American who received his PhD from Yale University.  I don't remember which year it was, but he was the first African American to get a PhD from Yale and the first African American to get a PhD, period, in the United States.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And so if you go to Yale, if you have the chance to go to Yale, go to the Edward--there is a library named after him.  And there's also an endowment to the American Physical Society who would honor minority scientists, either Hispanic or African Americans, to the Boucher, for the Boucher Award.  It turned out that after he finished his PhD at Yale, he went on to teach high school or something like this in Pennsylvania.  And eventually, I'm not sure--there's a write-up of him on the Web some place.  We should check it.  I think he ended up in Louisiana or something like this.  But his father was, was a cab driver, I think.  I'm not sure, but he, he was a very smart guy, Edward A. Boucher.  And he got his degree in physics.
Speaker 1: Now, he's celebrated on the website, 'Physicists of the African Diaspora.'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, and he's, that's run by the National, what is it called?  The National--
Speaker 2: National Society of Black and Hispanic Physicists.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So this is an important award--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in that respect.  And then shortly thereafter, you garnered a Fulbright scholars--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about that?
Speaker 2: To Israel, yes.  So I went to Israel to work with a colleague of mine at Bowreyland (ph.) University which is just outside Tel-Aviv, and I spent the fall of that year, 2005, I think, in Israel working with this colleague, who I had met at the University of Cambridge.  And he and I used to visit the semi-conductor physics group headed by Mike Pepper who is a very distinguished physicist in the field of semi-conductor physics.  And it was an interesting, it was an interesting stay in Israel, not only academically, but just to see the historic sites.
Speaker 1: And you also, I guess this is the same year too, received the American Physical Society Fellowship.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you do with that?
Speaker 2: Okay, so, no, this is American--no.  Being, when you're a member of the American Physical Society, which I'm a member of, every year they would make a selection based on the accomplishments of the top one percent, the top one percent of the entire society, and make you a fellow of this society.  So you're an honored member of the society.  So I became a fellow of the American Physical Society based on the work which I have done over the years and especially, since, especially the work that I had done in Lethbridge as well as at Hunter College.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so it's just not "a" member.  You're a fellow--
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm a fellow of the society.
Speaker 1: The status of a fellow?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in 2006, you were a United States Air Force faculty fellow, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, so did you have to relocate for a while to--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, for two--for eight weeks.  So I was an Air Force faculty fellow in 2006, 2007, 2008 and again this year, 2012.  So you would write a proposal and based on the interests of the Air Force as well as the quality of the proposal, they would sponsor you for up to eight, I think up to twelve weeks, up to three months.  And so I have spent eight weeks each year at the Air Force working on problems with that Lab.
Story_ID: 21534
Speaker 1: Okay, also in 2007, you were a visiting fellow at Trinity College--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --in Cambridge.  So how did it feel to go back in that capacity?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  It was very, it was very emotional for the following reason, namely, that, remember, as I said, I told you that, of my quote unquote "struggles", that is, to settle in as an undergraduate student.  And so I would be sitting in the hall, in the dining room with the students in one part of the room and the fellows of the college, that is, because of their  accomplishments, they become fellows of the college at what's called a "High Table".  And so the high table will be, would be--you would have Nobel Laureates or, you know, very distinguished scientists or humanists.  And so I would, you know, I would look at them with admiration.  And so in 2007, I was nominated to be a fellow of the college.  And I could have spent up to two years there as a visiting fellow.  But because of my responsibilities here in the U.S., I spent just a few months on two different visits.  And so I met and worked with the people at the Carving Dish, which is a physics laboratory.  And it was, it was very, very--very, very rewarding because we did some interesting work which we published eventually.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you tell us what it was about?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So every material, as I indicated, has what's known as electrons which are the negatively charged particles.  So, for example, if you take out a penny from your pocket and it's made up of atoms of copper and the copper atoms have electrons which are whizzing around it, yes.  So they, they--the question then is, is it possible, here you have--every material has these electrons, is it possible to isolate a single electron, a single electron, not a handful of them, but a single electron, and transport it?  And it needs some technique.  So this is known as single-electron transport.  And it has some interesting properties, interesting applications.  One of them is as follows, namely that, if you have this electron, if you're able to isolate a single electron, then you could identify how much charge it has, that is, you can measure the charge on the electron.  And this measurement of the charge on the electron was carried out by Milliken at the turn of the twentieth century at Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology].  And it, it's by trial and error until eventually you zero in on it.  And then there are other methods which were developed, which are not independent, but one depends on the other, but the question which my colleagues were trying to answer, is it possible to have this single electron and then measure the charge?  You may say well, look, it is sort of academic.  Why is it you'd want to measure the charge on the electron?  Well, everything that you, that you have that is in connection with measurement, that is the meter or the second or, or, you know, the unit of length, the unit of time, the unit of mass, if you measure the mass here in New York, you measure mass and it comes up to be one kilogram, then you want to have the same standard in every other part of the world.  So there's a standard, all right.  So there's a laboratory called the National Institute of Science--of Standards and Technology out in Colorado as well as, I think, Maryland, where you would, there's a standards laboratory.  So they have a standards laboratory in the U.S., a standards laboratory in England, a standards laboratory in Germany.  And so we were trying to come up with a standard.  So we are getting closer there, but at the same time, while you are doing, while you're doing your experiments, you may ask yourself other questions, that is, how would this, how would this electron behave under different temperature conditions or under the presence of a magnetic field and so on.  And so, these experiments were performed involving the single-electron transport.  And the results, as I said, were published.  Now, one possible application for single-electron transport has to do with quantum computing.  So for example, if you were sitting at your keyboard, and you hit the key "u", all right, and then you see it on your screen.  You see, you send a signal which consists of a string of zeroes and a string of one's, a string of zeros.  So the "u" has, is identified with a string of zeroes, a string of one's, and so any, every other letter or every other operation that you have on the keyboard.  So if you send a message, what if you send--I am sending a message to a colleague, then this message is being transported in the form of these one's and zeroes.  Okay, the question then is, suppose somebody, suppose this message gets from me to the receiver.  There is no way that you could tell whether somebody intercepted it.  So somebody could intercept it, but at the same time, it gets transported.  But if you intercept a message which is being transported by this electron, which is a quantum, a quantum particle, then you disturb the state, and you could tell whether it was intercepted.  So this is one good use of the technology for security purposes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in, so did you get a chance to sit at the high table?
Speaker 2: Of course (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  I wanted to make sure I got you at that table before--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Story_ID: 21535
Speaker 1: All right, okay, now, in 2010, researchers dealing with graphene research win the Nobel Prize.  Are these the Russians who--
Speaker 2: These are the two Russian guys, yes.
Speaker 1: These are the two Russians.  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Well, they are British now (laughter).
Speaker 1: They're British now.  What happened?  Did they--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What happened?  Did they--
Speaker 2: No, they immigrated.  They immigrated from Russia to the University of--to England.  And they're now stationed at the University of Manchester in England.  And I was asking my colleague how come they're not in Cambridge because Cambridge has, always has the distinction of having the Nobel Prize in Physics.  Whenever it's in England, it's in, usually in Cambridge somewhere.  And sitting at a high table, they have, you know, many, many Nobel Laureates in Chemistry, Biochemistry, Physics, Physiology, this sort of thing.  But they didn't show an interest or something like this in having the two guys in Cambridge that ended up in Manchester.
Speaker 1: And I have a question based on what one of our other HistoryMakers discussed.  And I don't know if I really fully understand it, but you could maybe shed some light on this.  Now, Robert Bragg was a physicist out at--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at UC-Berkley, discussed Bucky Balls and the research on Bucky Balls as having something to do with graphene.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what is that about?
Speaker 2: Okay, so you can have the, we only have a--I explained you can have a sheet of graphene, a single-layer of graphene and a single layer of graphite.  And then you can roll it up and make a tube, right, or you can just have the layer lying there, and then you have graphene.  So you have graphene.  When it's rolled up, you have a nano-tube or if you form, from the same carbon atoms that are used to make graphene or to make the nano-tube, you make it into a sphere. So the carbon atoms, forming a hexagon, you put together to form a sphere, and that's known as a Bucky Ball.  So I believe that somebody in Texas, at Rice University, Smalley, won the Nobel Prize for his work on Buck--carbon, on Bucky Balls.
Speaker 1: And what do Bucky Balls, what's the, what are the properties of Bucky Balls--
Speaker 2: Well, their strength, they're strong, so you can, you know, they have--you can use them for building very strong materials.  I think that the bonding between atoms for carbon, if you have them arranged in hexagons could make very strong materials.  So you can have them in graphene as a single layer or in Bucky Balls, depending on what you want to do with them.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now, what's the--what are you working on, you're continuing your research, I suppose, now, I mean the research that you've been doing, you're continuing to do, I suppose.  Do you ever see yourself retiring from research (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, not, not voluntary, but maybe it could happen.  You know, the body gives up at some stage and your eyesight gets worse or, you know, you have some other health issue, and you may be forced out.  But I don't plan to retire.  I think that the older I become or the longer I work in the field, the more polished I become in handling problems.  And when I started out, it was looking at how other people solved problems, and then I would try to follow in their footsteps or do better.  Now, when I do a, whenever I do a problem, it comes from the soul, that is, I would look at it from an experimental point of view or I will know the various challenges that confront this problem, yes.  And so, I think that I should, I would like to pass on some of this expertise, the way, some of my approach, through writing books or writing papers, doing research in general, mentoring students and post-doctoral research fellows, having them to find positions in academia.  I think that I would like to continue to do this for a while to come.
Story_ID: 21536
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what are some of the challenges in bringing new students along today?
Speaker 2: Money.  It's usually funding, funding.  So, it is expected that if you are in physics, and you take a graduate student, then you should help, help at least to support that student.  The only way you can support that student is if you have external funding or funding from some source.  And so you have to write a proposal, get it reviewed, get the funding to support a student.  And it is vital, I think, as you are, as you're getting older, to have students who you can mentor and with their energies be able to complete some of the projects which you have some idea, some vision how to do it, but, you know, you need man power.  So this is a challenge which, not only faces me, but as a theorist, an experimentalist, even more so because then they have to find funding for equipment or supplies and they must have multiple hands, you know, doing the research.  So it's a struggle, it's a struggle from that point of view.  But when the work is done, and the results are, and the results are out, then it's very rewarding because then, you know, you get to share your knowledge.  And you're able to contribute and, and participate in a very dynamic field.
Speaker 1: Is it more difficult to attract funding for theoretical research than for--
Speaker 2: Well, you need a lot more funding for doing experimental work because you need equipment, and you need supplies and you need students to help you out.  And theory, if you, if you are out of funding, then you could still make do for a while until you get funding.  But funding is becoming more and more difficult because there's less and less funding available.  So you have to spend a lot of time forming alliances with people who are in research labs, who know about funding or just, you just have to keep looking.  So it's, it's difficult, it's difficult now, but it was, it was also difficult when I got started many years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, is part of the difficulty educating a funding source as to what you're actually doing?
Speaker 2: Say it again.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Is part of the difficulty educating the funding sources of what--
Speaker 2: Identifying the funding sources?
Speaker 1: I mean, well, yeah, well, not just identifying, but educating them in terms of what you're actually gonna do with the money?
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter), yes.  So you have to write a proposal, telling how you would spend the money and telling them what problems you will do.  So the problems must be of interest to the referees or to the funding agency.  So you must write a good proposal which would tell them how your work would be able to contribute in the, to the field.  So in some way, you're educating them or trying to.
Speaker 1: Right, that's what I would guess that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --make some of the projects not be as easily understood in physics as they would be in some other field.
Speaker 2: Well, they are supposed to send them out to experts in the field.  So you're not really working alone in the field.  You have all the competitors or you have colleagues or so, and they--the proposal must be such that it is interesting for funding.  So you must write it in a way which they understand and appreciate, and the topic must be worthwhile funding because, you know, it's money, yeah.
Story_ID: 21537
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what do you see on the horizon that's next?  I mean what would you see coming from the research that you're doing?
Speaker 2: I think that new, the behavior of materials under different conditions.  For example, as I explained with graphene, the electrons have a very low mass, very small mass.  And so we have realized, come to realize that if you have light on graphene, it acquires a mass.  It becomes massive.  And so, this may have a disadvantage, you may think.  But it may also have, it also has some advantages.  For example, friction, as you know it, wears down your, the parts of your car, right, by constant motion.  But without friction, you can't walk.  So friction has disadvantages and advantages.  When you're doing the research that I'm involved in, you may find that some things have produced disadvantages, but you may be able to use these disadvantages to your advantage.  So it's like a constant, it's a constant, a constant pursuit that you must get yourself following.  And so, you never, you just never know what's around the corner, and I, as I explained a little while back, it's by sheer accident that these guys got the Nobel Prize in Physics.  And so it has been for many other, many other discoveries.  So you just never know.  You just keep plugging away and keep a sharp eye and work on interesting problems and you may become very excited.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are you getting good students here at Hunter College?
Speaker 2: We are getting good students at Hunter, and I, myself, I have been rather fortunate in that I had several good students who eventually went on to, to do well in their research as well as their profession.  So I think that we're doing, we have, we are--our alumni are, you know, are very well placed after they have graduated.  And we have done, done fairly well at Hunter and City University as a whole, yes.
Story_ID: 21538
Speaker 1: I know many of the people that will use this archive are concerned about the number of minority students that are going into the sciences.  What was it like for you, say in Toronto, when you were there?  I mean I know you were a minority at Cambridge.  Now, what about Toronto?
Speaker 2: Minority in, in Toronto also.  And maybe more minority in Toronto than in Cambridge because as I explained, there were students from all over the world, yes.  And many of them were coming from the British colonies.  So there were students from Singapore, I remember from Malaysia, from Sierra Leone, from South Africa, from Australia and so on, so there were--from Romania.  So there was a mix of students, foreign students.  When I went back as a fellow of Trinity, there was a graduation, and, you know, the students would walk around the college with their academic outfits and also with their parents.  And I was, I was observing them, and the majority of the students that I saw were Chinese in Cambridge.  And it was confirmed by some of my other colleagues that a lot of, a lot of students in their classes are from China.  They have the money, they have the funding to support the students and the British also want the funding, right.  So it's a great combination.  Now, in Toronto, then I was a graduate student there.  The physics department was, I think, fourteen, fourteen or fifteen floors, fourteen or fifteen floors high.  And I, the solid state physics group was on the tenth floor.  And on the tenth floor, I was the only black student throughout, even if you--when you go to the colloquial, I was the only one in the, in the auditorium as a student.  And it's, it, as I said, it didn't really matter to me because I was a new immigrant to the country, and eventually, I became, I eventually became a citizen and found work and so on.  But I, I think that things have changed over, over the period of time, but I was a real trailblazer in the field.  Now, every year, as an aside, every year, there is a meeting of the American Physical Society, which I became a fellow of.  And every year I would go.  It was held, it is held in various parts of the country.  And the majority of the, of--almost one-to-one, almost half and half of the, of the attendees would be of Asian origin or Caucasian, yes.  There are some Indians, but over the years, twenty years, going on thirty or twenty five  years, I would be almost singular.  And it's, it's very disappointing.  It's very disappointing.  I don't know.  I mean you cannot extrapolate.  This is the case in the physics departments throughout the country, you have zero.  I don't think you can extrapolate it, but the activity, the research activity is, it's something that needs to be addressed, some stimulus, something should be done to get, to get more and more minorities involved in physics, I think.
Story_ID: 21539
Speaker 1: Now, are you involved in any or are there any local efforts in New York to stimulate, you know, more interests in students in the minority community in physics?
Speaker 2: Okay, so there is an NSF-funded program called "The Access for Graduate Employment in the Professorial", abbreviated, AGEP, A-G-E-P.  And I was the, not a principal investigator, but the project director for this program.  And the program funded by NSF was to help to recruit students into our CUNY, into the City University as well its (unclear) students in NJIT as well as Brooklyn Pauley.  So I used to go with the, with the principal investigator to Alabama, to Florida, to Atlanta to help recruit students.  It turns out that many students are very re--the minority students that we were targeting, I'm referring to, many students were reluctant to leave their communities to come to New York.  They prefer to stay in Alabama or Atlanta, close to family and friends.  So this was a challenge which we had to face.  And so I turned to trying to recruit students from, from local schools, from the Manhattan Center for Science and Math or from Hunter Science High School.  So I did this, I, you know, I went, made presentations and so on; haven't done it over the past couple of years because I've been so busy.  But I hope to do so or return to, hope to resume shortly, like in the next semester.
Story_ID: 21540
Speaker 1: Okay, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My hope is that more, we need diversity, as I was explaining.  I admire Russians for the way that they would explain or try to solve problems.  I think that we would be able to do better in physics, better in the sciences if we had diversity, period.  So this is a key thing, to see different points of view.  Different people think differently, yes.  So we would be able to make a lot more progress in the fields of sciences and the sciences are such that you're confronted with a problem which is not, which you did--which was not, which you didn't have before, right, so you need to solve it, either because you have new material.  You need to understand the properties or you need to fabricate it or, you know, if you need to prepare it or something like this.  So you need different, people from backgrounds in order to deal with problems.  So I am--you know my background.  And so the way that I think, some of my students like the way that I think, you know, because of the, I guess, the way that--it comes with the background that I have.  And so I would pass on some of this to them, and, and make, to make it much easier, simpler or more exciting.  So I think that the challenge we have is to bring more diversity, but to do this is going to, it's always very difficult.
Story_ID: 21541
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would go back and change?
Speaker 2: No.  I like, I like it very much.  I saw, you know, I grew up as a poor kid, and I was exposed to poverty.  I saw how people worked hard and made it better for themselves.  Leaving one country, going to another, opened my eyes, different culture; learned to get along with people, look at people as, for what they're worth, yes.  I lived in different, in several countries, and I think that all of this made me much more polished, much more prepared for what I'm doing right now.  And so I've used my skills to deal with people.  I was chair of my department.  I mentored students, people from all, from various, with different backgrounds, different ethnicities, whatever, you know.  I would deal with them, treat them, you know, equally.  And I think that all of this comes because of my, of my background and my heritage.  So I wouldn't change anything, no.
Story_ID: 21542
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in terms of Guiana, most Americans, African Americans too, only know Guiana as a place where Jim Jones massacred 400 people back in '78' [1978].  But have you been back and what, are you involved in any efforts to identify some students in Guiana?
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  So I went back a few times, and I made contact with the University of Guiana.  And I noticed, for example, that, you know, they're not--they need help.  They need help.  And so my wife and I, she, as you know, is from there, decided that we should do something.  So I talked to the dean, and when I came back from Guiana to my department, I asked around whether there are any used textbooks that faculty would be willing to part with so that I can send them back to, at least in physics and chemistry and math, back to the University of Guiana.  So I accumulated several hundred textbooks, and they were sitting in my office.  And so I contacted the Consulate General for Guiana and asked him whether he would be willing to help me to ship these books back to the University of Guiana.  He said he has no funds for this.  So I took some of my, some--I took funding from my own, from my own pocket, and I shipped them back to Guiana.  And I plan to do so again very shortly.  I have also, I would also like to recruit some students from Guiana here, but I think my priority at this time would be to look more closely at the local, at the local schools to see whether I could recruit talented students, to identify their needs, usually it's monetary, and mentoring.  And so I would like to do both, both for my country that I, where I was born and from the country where I have adopted now, my home.
Story_ID: 21543
Speaker 1: Okay, now, once again, if you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, okay, with the mentoring that I've done for various of my colleagues, not only my students, but also my colleagues that I've mentored, I think that they have all appreciate this, that I'm not--I've been fairly good in what I've done.  But they've, what really struck them was that I would, I would spend time talking to them or giving them guidance, helping them or--some students would simply come into our program and wouldn't know how to go about becoming a major in physics or what courses to take.  Or they would be more interested in engineering.  We don't have this program here.  So I have mentored students to get into engineering programs.  So I think that my legacy would be my mentoring skills, coupled with the research which I have done.
Story_ID: 21544
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us a little bit about--now, you have children, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you were talking about your sons not wanting to leave the United States (laughter) to go back to Canada.  Tell us something about your children.
Speaker 2: About them?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, so I have three sons--
Speaker 1: Well, your family actually--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: I guess your family.
Speaker 2: My family, okay.  So my wife and I have three sons, Anthony is the eldest, Alexander is the middle one, and Andrew is the third one.  And so Anthony, both Anthony and Alex went to Columbia University.  They got their Bachelors as well as Masters from Columbia.  And Anthony, the other got his Masters in Computer Science and Alex got his Masters in Business Administration.  So Anthony works for a firm, I'm sorry, he works for American Express.  And he's an IT guy there in Arizona and Alex is in New York.  He works for a company called Metronic.  So Metronic is the company that, you know, they do surgery on, you know, the heart.  Instead of opening the heart, instead of opening the chest, he put stints.  And so he is in charge of one of the departments of Metronic for this surgery.  And Andrew, the third one is currently now finishing up his, so just finished his, his sophomore year at Carnegie Mellon.  And he's on his way back home to give his mother trouble.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything I have not asked or we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I think you did a pretty good job.  And I think, you know, I appreciate it that you caused me to reflect quite a bit.  You didn't ask me, though, how many of my siblings are alive?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, okay, well, tell us.
Speaker 2: Okay, so out of the, out of the family of 10, which happened to be the number, when I first arrived at Hunter [Hunter College] in '92' [1992], of the family of ten, that is, eight kids and my parents, there are just four remaining.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, which four?
Speaker 2: So there is just myself, my two sisters, two of my sisters and a brother.
Speaker 1: And this is a question I didn't ask too, but what did your parents think of you receiving a Ph.D.?  Were they alive when you got your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, they were, they were alive when I came to Hunter, both of them.  And, well, they understand that I have a doctorate, I'm doctor, but they mostly thought of me as a teacher, right, not as a researcher.  So they realized that I'm at a university.  I'm teaching, but I sort of never, never sat them down to tell them exactly--what research problems I'm doing, etc.  I don't think that they were really too much knowledgeable that, as a professor, you do research or you could also do research.  I think they thought that as a professor, your main or your only activity would be to teach.  So they thought, great, that I, you know, I'm a teacher.  I'm a teacher at the university, yeah.  And so they were happy for that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, is there anything else before--
Speaker 2: No, no, that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I'm sorry I didn't ask about the other one.
Story_ID: 21545
Speaker 1: But this question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a good parent, as a family man, and loyal, loyal to my wife and, and would do--and very devoted to my family.  And for Hunter College, I would them to remember me as one of, you know, as a good, as a good choice in coming after me and getting me onboard, and an enduring reminder of my presence here, I hope that they would name a scholarship after me.  And I've started steps in that direction.
