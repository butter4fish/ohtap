 Wilson  Page  Today is November 7, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I   m with  the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU Library. I   m  joined today by Dr. Melanie Page, Director of the OSU Institute for  Creativity and Innovation, professor of psychology at OSU, and Riata  Entrepreneurship Fellow. I   m interviewing Dr. Page for the Creativity  Initiative series of O-State Stories, so thank you for joining me today.  Thank you.  We   re going to be talking mostly about creativity and innovation at  OSU, but to start out, would you mind telling me a little bit about your  background, where you were born, and where you grew up?  I was born in Griffith, Indiana, which is right outside of Gary, which is  right outside of Chicago. Pretty much spent my whole childhood there  and went to college. My first two years of college were at Lindenwood   University  in St. Charles which is right outside of St. Louis. I had a full  scholarship there. It was a really, really tiny school. By the end of two  years, I was looking for something bigger, so my roommate and I  transferred to Arizona State.  One of the advantages of being at a really small school is that you really  got to know your professors. I was pre-med, and I took Intro to  Psychology and just really fell in love with the subject, the passion, the  instructor, so I changed my career path, and I decided I wanted to be a  professor. I went to him after class, and I said,    Well, how do you be a  professor? Do you go get a PhD in education?    He said,    Well, no, you  just get a PhD in whatever field you want to get a PhD in.    I thought,     Okay, that sounds like less school than medical school,    because I  didn   t want to be in school four years after undergraduate, and, of  course, ended up spending seven getting my PhD. (Laughter) Make far  less money, but hopefully I convinced myself I   m happier.  5  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  That   s really how I decided to be a college professor was that I was  really inspired by my introductory psychology professor and just the  passion that he brought to that field. I finished my degree at Arizona  State and then got my master   s there, as well, in Child Development,  which is a terminal master   s program. Then switched back over to  psychology for my PhD because my master   s program at the time did  not have a PhD program. I finished in 1998, and I applied for several  jobs. I got three out of the four post-doc offers I applied for, and this was  my only faculty offer, so I took it. My husband followed me, sight-unseen.  The one thing we were really excited about was that OSU was a  big university located in a small place. For both of us, we   re not big city  people, so that was really cool.  At the time, we had a patent depository here, and the patent library  wasn   t yet online, so you actually had to go to the patent library. My  husband is a biomedical engineer and did a lot of work in invention, so  to him, that was an important thing. Of course, you know, a year later,  everything was online, so it became less relevant. This is where I   ve  been ever since, so this is my first and only real job.  And what year did you come here?  I came here in 1998, so this is the start of my fourteenth year.  Did you have an interest in psychology at all in high school?  I did in grade school. I did my eighth grade science project on word  association, (Laughs) very scientific, so I did a little project on that.  Then in high school, I was interested in psychology. I took the  psychology class that they offered. As a pre-med major, I was also a  psych major, which is why I was in Intro and a couple of other  psychology classes. I think the other advantage of being in a small  school is after the intro class, none of our classes were multiple choice  tests. Everything was essay, was projects, was thought-based. I think  that gave me a really good base to operate from when I went to Arizona  State, which is huge. The school I came from had 2,000 total people.  About 250 of those lived on campus. I went to Arizona State which, at  the time, had about 45,000 students, so it would   ve been really easy to  get lost. It was good to go as a junior, I think.  Did you meet your husband in Arizona?  I did. I met my husband at a bar, actually, (Laughter) as embarrassing as  that was. It was after hours. We were dancing, and he came up with his  classic pick-up line. After hours, they only served water because there  6  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  was no more alcohol. He brought up a glass of water and said,    You  look very hot. You could use some water.    (Laughter) And of course, I  had just turned twenty-one, and being very na  ve I was thinking,     Really? Wow.    Three years later, I actually learned that was a line, but  I believed it for three years.  I guess it worked. (Laughter)  It worked. We danced, and then toward the end of the night, it was kind  of like,    Well, thank you for the dance.    Apparently I looked at him like,     I don   t know who you think you are, but you didn   t ask for my phone  number.    So then he asked for my phone number. We couldn   t find a  pen, and then finally I was like,    Okay, I can get the hint. You really  aren   t interested.    I gave him my phone number, and he can   t remember  anything. He actually remembered my phone number but didn   t  remember my name. (Laughs) He called. He was looking for the blonde  girl who he   d danced with. Pretty much since then, unless I   ve been at a  conference, we haven   t been apart. We   ll celebrate twenty-two years in  January.  Wow, congratulations.  Thank you.  So what did he think, besides the patent office, about moving to  Oklahoma?  He grew up in the west, all around northern California, Nevada, Arizona,  spent time in Alaska, so for him, this is actually a fairly good fit in terms  of small town, ruralness. For me, it was a little more difficult. I   m from   near  Chicago. I talk fast. This is me slow-talking. So that was a bit of  an adjustment and it helped. I had a friend in graduate school from San  Francisco who said she thought Phoenix was slow. It helped me see that  it   s relative to where you   re at. We have two young boys, and so I really  enjoy raising my children in Stillwater. I think it   s a really good  community to raise children in.  Well, you started in the Psychology Department in 1998. How long after  that did you start hearing talk of a creativity initiative?  I think it was 2008. I was part of a research group with a colleague from  engineering and English, and we were interested in this idea of critical  thinking and adaptive thinking, kind of a cross. Where does creativity fit  into that process? You can think critically, but what you   re thinking  about, does it have any use? That   s adaptive thinking. Can you actually  change your thinking, move your thinking for the situation?  7  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  They had heard a rumor that John Mowen had a taskforce going for the  creativity initiative, and John graduated from the same PhD program that  I did. He was the first graduate, so we sort of had that alumni  connection. I had interacted with him a few times throughout the years  on student committees, so I just shot him an email that said,    Hey, I have  this interest in what you   re doing. If you need another committee  member, let me know.    He shot back a polite,    No thanks, we already  have an A and S  Arts and Sciences  representative. Here   s who it is.    I  shot back,    Well, that   s a biology person. You might want to have a  social science person.     I was somewhat persistent in getting myself on the committee. Got on  the taskforce. I have a bad habit of taking on too much, so I  subsequently became on the executive committee on that taskforce and  then helped John run the first Creativity Festival. We did it during  Research Week. He ran the speakers    part, and I ran what we called the     creativity bazaar    part which was showcasing all the work of all the  groups on campus. That   s sort of how I got involved in it and kind of  stepped up when he needed help to plan this rather large event.  Do you know how his initial taskforce got started?  I believe it was an initiative of President Hargis   . President Hargis was  one of the co-founders of Creative Oklahoma, was one of the people  behind the Maps Project in Oklahoma City, so he recognizes that  creativity and innovation are really important not only intellectually but  in the business world and success. That was really one of his projects  that he wanted to see OSU known for, and welcome creative and  innovative ideas.  President Hargis asked John to lead the creativity  initiative because he  had done some academic work looking at  personality and creativity: What types of personalities tend to be more  creative and innovative in their work?  So what was the response from the campus after the first Creativity  Festival?  I think the response to the first festival was really, really good. It was  during Research Week, so that was an advantage. The  Student  Union  wasn   t yet shut down, so that was another advantage. We had a lot of  traffic through. We had booths in the atrium and the ballroom, so we had  such a huge response. You can put about twenty-five booths in the  atrium, and we had about another twenty-seven in the ballroom. We had  about five hundred people through each of those rooms. That was really  exciting. I think the people who were exhibiting were excited to share  what they do on campus.  8  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  One of the disadvantages of a big campus is that you have so much  going on that you have no idea what is going on outside of your doors.  People get too busy, and they   re so focused on their own work that they  don   t know what   s going on on campus. It was really an opportunity not  only to showcase what you   re doing but also to see if there is somebody  doing something really similar that you could pair up with.  As you know, interdisciplinary research and teaching is kind of the rage  right now. It   s really the direction that universities are going in, but if  you don   t know anybody from another discipline, you   ve never met  anybody, it   s hard to put together a team. This was a way to not only  show whatever you   re doing but what else is available out there. That  was a lot of fun. We had a creativity challenge contest, as well.  John did a great job of fundraising from all the deans on campus, so we  had quite a bit of money. We had a challenge contest for basically kind  of solving problems on the OSU campus. I think he had 180  applications. The top prize was five thousand dollars, which could  indicate why so many people applied. They had a student category and a  faculty/staff category where the top prize was twenty-five hundred. They  had three prizes after that, and they did sort of an American Idol type  contest, again during Research Week, where they had the finalists  present, and the audience got to vote. Then there was judges, and they  combined those. The    Real Pokes Pass It On    was the top student  project, and that   s still going. The top faculty/staff project, which was  the overall winner, as well, was the    Farm To You    dining project that is  still going on. Those were both really exciting projects that we were able  to support. The    Real Pokes Pass It On    project got a small grant  afterwards. If you won the contest, you were eligible for a small grant,  so we were able to help them fund their first year to show they could be  successful.  So they didn   t have to use their prize money toward the     They did not have to. There was no restrictions. What we   ve tended to  see is that the winners tend to use their prize money for their project.  Typically the people who win are very passionate about their project, so  they tend to use the money for that, but they don   t have to. It   s not  restricted.  And that contest now occurs annually?  It   s occurred annually. The second year, John stepped down due to being  chair of the provost search committee. That was a huge responsibility  and a huge amount of time. I had expressed to him an interest in  9  administration and trying out administration, so he came to me and  asked if I would be interested and willing to do this, so I took over in  November of 2009. I was still Graduate Program Director in  Psychology, so that was a bit much. Again, I take on too much. We had  the festival that year. Now, the Union was partially shut down. The  atrium was still open, but other things had started closing. We did it the  week after spring break, which was a really bad week to do anything.  (Laughter) Nobody comes to anything the week after spring break.  The contest that year, I think, was pretty successful. We had  some   prize money. We had a very small budget. We basically had to carry  over from what John had raised, so we did not have any independent  money. The level of interest was a little bit lower, I think. There wasn   t  ten thousand dollars in prize money out there. We opened it up to the  community. We wanted to know,    How would you recreate your  community?    We still got about 105 applications, and I still think that  was pretty good. I think that was the most successful part of that festival.  We again had enough people that we had people in the atrium and  ballroom, and I think the people in the atrium were quite happy. We had  a lot of traffic to the atrium. We didn   t pull people to the ballroom  because I think nothing else was going on. During Research Week, other  things were on the ballroom floor, so people saw it, they came through.  This was just a random day of the week. That was far less successful.  That was the first year that the Creativity, Innovation, Entrepreneurship  scholars helped plan the event. Those are a group of scholars   at the  time, they were ten MBA students from the School of Business.  Subsequently, the School of Entrepreneurship now sponsors eight of  those spots to go to students outside of Business, outside the MBA  program, which is really cool. It   s a good synergy. There was a lot of, I  think, a learning curve in how to work with the students, how much  freedom to give them in marketing and planning versus how much I  should be taking on. We weren   t as successful the second year, so when  the third year rolled around, I had a conversation with President Hargis  and John and Mike Morris, the head of the School of Entrepreneurship.  We talked about in the future I would have a one-course release.  After being on the job for about eight weeks, I went back to the  president and I said,    If you want this done right, you need to buy me  out completely. I can plan you an event a year on a course release, but if  you want this where I have the time to go around and talk to people on  campus, to talk to different groups, to get things going, you need to buy  me out completely, and I need a budget. This cannot be done on  carryover.    He was very supportive. They found the funds to support the  institute, to support me.  10  This is my second year bought out of everything. My job is basically to  go around, talk to people, help people, advance ideas to the right people.  I   ve really enjoyed that part of my job. I organized last year   the World  Creativity Forum was here. Oklahoma was one of twelve districts of  creativity, the only one in the US, and we hosted the World Forum. I  organized about 220 people, so 220 registrations, two buses, people  changing their mind all the time about whether they   re going or not.  (Laughs)  This last week was only a small version of that. This last week was  nothing compared to the first time. We had a big display booth. We had  two booths together, and I organized that and got all the stuff there and  got all the stuff back. It was really huge. I was really sick last year, as  well, so I don   t remember a lot of it.  People say to me,     I met you in  the forum      And I say,     I   m sorry, I don   t remember you.    (Laughter) I  was in a fog.  That was a big huge event. We had a presence there. Mike Morris and I  did a session on the entrepreneurial university. I was so ill, I pretty much  just showed up. It was standing room only. They were kicking people  out because of fire code. In fact, they didn   t let President and Mrs.  Hargis in. I was like,    Wait, wait, that   s the President. Don   t kick him  out     Kicked him out. (Laughter) That was a little embarrassing that  President and Mrs. Hargis couldn   t come into our session. My graduate  assistant was outside the room, and people were really mad that it wasn   t  in a larger room. I think there was a lot of interest in this idea of what  our university is going to look like in the twenty-first century. How do  we need to change?  Last year   s Creativity Festival was with a bigger group of students. We  decided we   d move it outside. You can   t miss something on the library  lawn. Nobody has to come to you. They   re walking, so you get them.  The students wanted to break a world record. I was brainstorming and  thinking,    How is that relevant to creativity and innovation?    Like, it   s  not just a carnival. It   s a celebration of creativity and innovation on  campus, so we came up with a theme of OSU as a local and global  problem solver, which I think went really well with our land-grant  mission. They decided to build the world   s largest Twister board. We  used that as a creative way to raise funds for disaster relief. We had all  of the groups on campus who wanted to exhibit, and you could purchase  tickets to vote for what was the best booth. We gave that money to Feed  the Children. That was really fun. We had probably four or five hundred  people on the board the first game.  We had President and Mrs. Hargis out there. I thought they would come,  stand on the board for five minutes, photo-op, and that was it. President  11  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  Hargis stayed in for thirty minutes, and Mrs. Hargis was one of the last  five. It was nearly an hour game, and she hadn   t given up, so we called it  at the last five when it went an hour. That was just really cool that  they   re so supportive of not only creativity and innovation but what the  students find important. You could clearly see the students found that  important. The eighteen of them that built that board, they spray-painted  all those dots. It was eighteen thousand square feet of dots. You had to  actually make little baby Twister boards and put those all together.  Did it break the record?  Well, we have submitted our paperwork. We don   t have the official  word yet. Our board was bigger than the current record, so whether they  say we broke the record or not, we broke the record.  Then it was another good chance for all the booths and     Then it brought in all the people and, interestingly, we had as many  people around the edges as we had playing the game. I even was going  around,    Hey, come on. Play the game.    They were like,    No, no, no, we  just want to watch.    (Laughs) It was cool. The library opened the bell  tower to the photographers that were there, so if you were media or a  photographer, you could go up and take a picture from the bell tower.  That was really cool. Then we had booths all around the edges of the  board. The board is really big. It takes up the first two lawns.  Other than that, we had a whole bunch of different booths from across  campus. The Difficult Dialogues group did a theater thing in between  the two games where they role played a difficult situation to talk about,  so that was really kind of cool. We   d like to do more of that at this  year   s festival, really showcasing a little bit more of what the OSU  family is doing in terms of getting more people to pay attention to what  the booths are about. Most people were really pleased.  We had a challenge contest again. This one was a little bit different. It  wasn   t really based in reality. It was,    What world record would you  break for the greatest social impact?    It did not have to be real. You  could make up the record. It could cost a billion dollars to break it. It  didn   t matter. You had to have some sort of multimedia to go with it,  either a video or an audio file or a photo. We narrowed those down and  posted them on a website, and then by popular voting, which they do  quite often in contests,  winners were decided.  I asked the students,     Should we have a faculty category and a student category?    They said,     No, the faculty have no chance against the students once it   s going to  go digital.    (Laughs) It ended up two students and one staff member  won, so they were right. It was really cool. We had about 110 students  12  Wilson  Page  submit entries, and just the passion of students for solving world  problems was so impressive to me.  I did a session at the Institute for Teaching and Learning Excellence the  week before the festival on teaching creatively for creativity. I suggested  the faculty to go to the webpage if they   re feeling at all burned out about  what they   re doing. Just go there and look at what our students are  passionate about. They really are passionate to change the world. It  wasn   t a huge prize where that was the only thing people were interested  in. They really wanted to get their ideas out there. That was really cool  and energizing, so I think that was really fun.  I have learned that the fastest way to get hate mail is to run a contest that  people don   t win. (Laughter) My own husband is still mad at us from  three years ago when he didn   t win, so it   s thickened my skin up a bit. I  don   t take it personally when people are unhappy with the rules or who  won or they think they should   ve won, but it was tough at first. It was  really tough at first to deal with that criticism. I really try to listen to  what people are saying.    Is there a kernel of some truth that we can  move forward for next year?     A big complaint this past year was that there were no rules or restrictions  on original work versus you could   ve pulled something off YouTube.  Some people did some original work that took them a lot of time. Other  people pulled a photo off the web or pulled a YouTube video and just  wrote a little essay that went with that. There really was a difference in  the amount of work, and we didn   t factor that into the final score. It was  really just the creative and innovative approach they were taking, how  many people it would impact. I think it was good feedback to think  about. The previous year was that faculty and students were competing  against each other.  In the first year, the quality of the student applications, I thought, in  many ways exceeded the faculty and staff, but the final contest was an  oral presentation of their ideas, which the students just couldn   t  compete. Faculty do this every day, but that wasn   t apparent until you  were sitting there. They had the idea. They just didn   t have the pizzazz.  Lecturing every day for twenty years makes it a heck of a lot easier than  this is the third time in your entire career that you   ve gotten up in front  of an audience of people. So, again, we   re learning lessons each time  and hopefully making it better.  So do you have plans for a Creativity Festival in 2012?  We do. It will be April 10. We   re still kicking around ideas, but I think  we   re going to do it around   I just finished the vision report for the  13  Wilson  Page  provost, and so I think we   re going to do it around the spires of  excellence. If those eight spires are approved by the provost council,  those will be the eight spires we   ll do it around. Then in the weeks  leading up to the event, we   ll highlight one of those spires each week  with some sort of PR event. Then at the end, the students will come up  with what I call the pull-in-gimmick event to get people to pay attention  to what   s going on, and then we   ll sort of organize the booths around the  spires. I think that   ll be really cool.  Yes, that sounds neat. Have most of the people that have won the contest  in the past, when it was more of an idea, have many of those been  implemented?  In year one, it was    Farm to Dining.    There   s another Student Union  project. The portico that   s going to be out here behind the Classroom  Building and the farmers market was one of the ideas that won. Chris  Ramsey from art wanted to do public art space downtown. That   s clearly  happening now with the museum being built. He has a small grant to try  to figure out how to get more of the community involved, sort of get a  corridor between here and OSU. He   s been working with the Stillwater  Arts Council, with the Chamber of Commerce. We have learned that city  government moves even slower than OSU, (Laughter) so he   s still  working on that. The other two student projects that won,    Real Pokes  Pass It On,    and that has been pretty successful.  We had another student team that applied for a grant. They want to work  on a central office for student academic teams, so if you   re going to  compete in the racecar or the canoe or the whatever, there would be a  central group of people that could do marketing for you, fundraising, so  you could concentrate on doing the academics of your team rather than  fundraising. The first year, they were very successful. They helped one  of the racecar teams raise like seventy-five hundred dollars and did their  marketing.  Then of course, the students begin to turn over. They   re still here.  They   ve graduated and they   re running their own business, but they   re  still trying to get other students to take that on, so that   s been semi-successful.  One of the other student projects that won two years ago was  for the Stillwater community garden. They used their prize money and  then a small grant. They put in rain barrels with the small grant, and I  was able to hook them up with a faculty member in agriculture who does  water conservation. They were able to talk together, and he was able to  advise them on different systems. That   s clearly ongoing, so I think that  was successful.  The winner of that year   s contest was the Boomer Amp Coalition, which  14  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  was a coalition made up of some OSU members, some community  members. They want to build an outdoor amphitheater at Boomer Lake.  They used their prize money to have a contest for architecture students  to design the amphitheater, so that was really cool, a way to bring in the  students.  Again, people tend to use their prize money to go back to the project, so  that was really cool to see that, that they didn   t take the money and run.  They actually put it into an actual amphitheater design. They   re still  working on that project again. They need to raise a lot of funds and get  the city to say yes. (Laughs) Those are the big projects that we funded.  Sounds exciting.  It is exciting. It is exciting to be able to help people. One of the ideas  that somebody brought, Dr. Steve Damron had brought an idea of having  an    R    on students    transcripts for if you   ve done intensive research.  Him and I worked together, developed a proposal, talked to a couple  stakeholders and then brought it to faculty council who then passed a  resolution to the administration. Now students will be eligible for an    R     on their transcript.  Again, that   s a really cool thing that we   re able to help facilitate. Just  knowing who are the players, in such a huge system, you don   t even  know who you   re supposed to talk to. One of the things that we   re trying  to get going, which is really difficult to do within the OSU website  system, so we   re doing it externally, we   re trying to have an interactive  idea portal. It   s like Starbucks where there   d be somebody to respond  back to your idea. The community could    up    or    down    your idea, and  then you would know what happened, why or why did your idea not go  forward.  That sounds really neat.  I have a student working on it right now, and so it should be near ready  to launch. That will be, I think, really exciting.  And there   s also a creativity minor?  Yes, there   s a creative studies minor. In 2009 when I took over, it was a  creativity initiative. One of the things I had set out for, goals for myself  and what I would do in this job, was    How do you make this a part of  the culture? How do you make this more than    President Hargis likes  creativity?       Because when President Hargis goes away eventually, then  the creativity initiative goes with him, or people only participate because  they think it   s only for the president. Then you don   t have real buy-in.  15  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  One of the things I thought is that faculty don   t want to spend time being  associated with an initiative, but they would with an institute. An  institute denotes permanency. We worked with the dean   s council to get  feedback on a proposal for an institute, responded to that feedback, and  then the institute was approved by then-provost Marlene Strathe. Then  we had the institute. We launched that in September of 2010.  Dr.  Robert  Sternberg was here by that time, so he was our keynote  speaker at the launch, and he gave his talk on    Creativity is a decision.     I think we had about four hundred people at the launch, which was really  cool. It was over at Wes Watkins  Center , so you actually had to walk  there. (Laughs) The Psychology Department had brought Dr. Sternberg  in in spring of 2008, and the initiative co-sponsored his visit. The Arts  and Sciences dean has some money for a social sciences seminar series.  In a crazy fit, I decided I would invite the most famous people I knew in  psychology. One of them was not speaking because he was ill at the  time, and Dr. Sternberg was the second person on the list, and the third  person has yet to get back to me. (Laughter)  Since 2008?  Since 2008. It   s a very small amount of money. I thought no way will  somebody as famous as Robert Sternberg say yes, and he said,    Sure      (Laughter) So we found a time that he could come. It was in April of  2008, and I was thinking,    Okay, here   s the world   s expert on creativity.  President Hargis likes creativity. The two of them need to meet.    I set up  a meeting with him and John Mowen and Dr. Sternberg, and apparently  they really hit it off and enjoyed talking with each other. When the  provost position opened up, we were all really excited, and we were like,     Dr. Sternberg, would you be interested?    He   s like,    Sure      Wow.  I think part of it was that when you come to this campus, that feel of    we  really genuinely care    comes across. He was here for a day and a half,  and he got that and was very impressed. Went back and told his wife  about it. I think we undersell ourselves sometimes on the importance of  that Cowboy spirit and how it really reaches out to people. It makes  really good people want to come here and make this place better, so that  was exciting to be part of that. I really enjoy trying to help people find a  voice because it   s frustrating when you   re in such a big system,  particularly if you know your area the best. You know best how to run  your unit.  John Mackey spoke at lunch at the Creativity Forum, and one of the  16  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  things I liked that he said is,    Whole Foods is very decentralized, so  corporate doesn   t have to approve your idea before you try it.    I think  the university system could learn something from that. If you want to try  something in the library for book checkout, you don   t need seven  thousand signatures to try it. You can try it. If there   s something in  physical plant where they want to change the watering timing because  that   s the way it works better, they don   t need three thousand signatures  to have it done. They can just try it.  It was really cool because he talked about if you try something and it  doesn   t work, that   s okay. You just move on. There   s not a penalty. I  think too often in a university system there   s a penalty, so people are  very scared to try something new. If you don   t allow people to fail  without consequences in terms of   obviously if you collapse the entire  university or you embezzle money, there should be consequences,  (Laughter) but you try some creative way to register students and it  doesn   t work, it   s all right. Let   s try something else. Okay, where did  that go wrong in the process? What could we have thought through  better before we instituted it? Like the second Creativity Festival when it  was after spring break. Okay. You know? There is no real penalty for  failing, but what did we learn? We learned to kick it back further out  into the spring and make it outside. You can   t draw people into multiple  inside locations. There has to be one inside location for them to go to,  and it has to be very central. They have to be used to going there.  I   ve tried a couple of events in the Browsing Room that are  nontraditional for the Browsing Room, and they just really haven   t been  successful because I think the audience is kind of freaked out. They   re  like,    I don   t know about that. That   s the library. That   s not where we  have these kind of things.    I   m excited for the Union to open back up.  (Laughs)  I went to the presentation of the photographer last year, and he was  incredible. I was really disappointed in the turnout.  To an audience of five. (Laughter)  Yes.  Again, one would think I would learn my lesson. That was at the end,  the week after spring break. Of course, you know, you   re operating  around other people   s schedules when you   re scheduling in a speaker.  When you can only get them one time, you think,    Okay, I   m going to  get that speaker,    but then you sort of fail to look at the context, so I  think I   m learning much better to look at the context.  17  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  We just had a performer, an Austin singer/songwriter, Darden Smith,  that was not well-attended. It was the Thursday before Walkaround. I  hadn   t thought about the fact that every Greek person on this campus  was pomping their little hearts out. There   s half your audience right  there, and the other student groups are busy, and everybody is busy  getting ready for Halloween and Homecoming. It was bad timing, but  that was when he was coming, so sometimes you make do with what  you have.  That   s, to me, been one of the frustrating things is just getting the  information to people. Particularly, last year we advertised the heck out  of that Creativity Festival and the contest. We were out there on the  library lawn every Friday for about two hours just talking to people,  giving stuff away. We were on headline news. We were on the social  media stuff, and I thought we did a pretty good job. Most people knew  about it, and we were interviewing one of the students for a CIE   Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship  Scholar ,and they were  like,    Oh, you guys broke a world record? I never heard of that.    I was  like,    Really?    (Laughter) First of all, you should be lying because  you   re in an interview to do this next year, but second of all, what rock  were you living under? What more could we  do?  We went over to the  rec center one night and handed out towels and talked with students.  I really liked   State Farm came last year and did random acts of  kindness the first week of school. I really liked that idea, so we tried to  model ourselves on that last year. We had T-shirts, we had M Ms, we  had towels at the Colvin, we had candy and water. Thankfully for us, it  got really hot, really quick, (Laughs) except for one day we tried to do  flash mob Twister in the snow.  Oh, my gosh. (Laughter)  It was us and the O   Colly photographer.  How many of you were there?  There was like ten of us out there. (Laughter) It was our kickoff, be out  on the lawn kind of thing. It started snowing on us. It was in January.  That was really funny.  Snow makes for a good photo-op, though.  Yes. We got snowed out on our first two marketing events last year. We  did a coffee in the library, so we gave away coffee in the library to kick  off the challenge contest and let people know what was coming and  what was going on. I think we gave away like 120 cups of coffee, so I  18  Wilson  Page  think that was pretty successful.  So has there been a big response to the minor in creativity?  I   ve had a couple students interested. One of the things we need to do is  get it on the registrar   s site. It   s not yet on the registrar   s site. I actually  have  had  two students who emailed me this week to meet with me  about it. One of the restrictions is we don   t have enough faculty who  specialize in creativity and innovation, so our list of elective classes  doesn   t fit with a lot of majors who have a lot of accreditation  requirements.  Talk to an engineering student. They just don   t have any flexibility in  their schedule to have non-engineering classes. You need to get students  young enough. It   s only an eighteen-credit-hour minor, but if they   re  already seniors, they   re just not going to have the flexibility. We   re  really going to try to get sophomores.  When I first came here, I thought,    Minor-shminor, what the heck.     Then, the last couple of years, I think it   s a very useful marketing tool  for students. You have the 126 hours or whatever a bachelor   s is, and  about thirty of those are in your major, thirty-nine. I   m like,    What are  you doing with the other hundred?    If they   re just scattered all over the  place, that doesn   t look as impressive to an employer or graduate school  as if you actually thought about    what do you want to be    at the end.  I think we   re starting to pick up a little momentum on the minor. It   s one  of only four in the country, so I think that   s pretty exciting. I think we   re  one of only three dedicated universities that have an institute or center or  program for creativity and innovation. We   re really young compared to  the other centers, which are also very well-endowed by a major donor.  That   s kind of what I   ve communicated back to the president is that I   cannot do this on my own . I   m actually very frugal and very grateful  for the money they were able to give to the institute, but I think for it to  go to the next level, there has to be a major donor behind it.  There has to be three or four more faculty that are experts in creativity  and innovation so that we have the core-type of courses that we need to  offer our students on campus so that we can really train them. I think  we   re doing a pretty good job with faculty and staff. I   ve brought in a  couple of speakers. We do something in the Institute for Teaching and  Learning Excellence. We have a program coming up on Tuesday. We  have a program in September on teaching creatively for creativity.     What are you teaching for, first of all, and then how do you do it?     I   ve run a program through HR for Creative Leadership in the Twenty-  19  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  first Century, brought a speaker in. I think it   s reaching the students  now. How do you help them corral that creativity and give them an  outlet for it? What I   m trying to do this year is co-sponsor more things  with different groups so that I   m not doing all the event planning myself.  (Laughter) I think that   s going to go much better.  Is there also a creativity dorm?  There is. There is the Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship, CIE,  dorm. It   s the third floor of Booker Hall. That is mainly freshmen, but  any group can live there. They have a class in the fall and the spring. It   s  the coolest thing. When I go back to teaching, I want to teach a class in a  dorm, even though it   s not going to be creativity. I want to teach  statistics in the dorm. (Laughter) I just think that   s the coolest thing.  Nobody has an excuse for not coming to your class  if they  can roll out  of their beds. They just have to come out their door and get to the edge  of the hallway.  So the class is taught in the dorm?  The class is taught in the dorm. I just think that is the coolest, most  innovative idea. Dr. Tom Westbrook teaches that class, and he takes  them through the theories of how do you become a more creative person,  exercises in creativity and innovation, and just really tries to move them  forward.  Part of being creative is, what Dr. Sternberg talks about, defying the  crowd. If you don   t have the skill set to defy a crowd, if you don   t have  the self-confidence to do that, you   re simply not going to move forward  on your creative ideas because most of the time when you have a  creative idea, the first response from people is,    That   s stupid. That   s  crazy. What are you thinking?    Twenty years down the road, everybody  is like,    Oh, yes. That makes sense.     It   s really tough to be the one crazy person out there where you   re doing  things that are different. You get a lot of pushback, so if you don   t have  the skill set that allows you to know that you   re on the correct path for  yourself, then you   ll be derailed. I think Daryl Hawk talked about this,  the photographer, that you have to have that self-confidence to follow  your passion, and the skill set. I could be the most passionate artist ever,  but I have no skills, so that   s not going to help me. I have to know what  skills do I need to get.  That   s one of the things that I   d really like the institute to be able to do  for students is to connect them with their passion, to let them know it   s  20  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  okay to pursue your passion. Most of the successful CEOs talk about if  you pursue your passion, the success and the money follow. I think often  times in America, we pursue the success and money and forget about  passion. It really seems the most successful people do it the opposite  way.  Well, we have, with Dr. Sternberg, some great figures in creativity, some  great academics, and Dr. Morris leading the entrepreneurship school.  Do you see us, if we get the funding, easily bringing in other big  academic names in creativity?  I think we could bring them in so easily. Diane Montgomery is another  big name in the College of Education. She   s been doing work in  creativity and innovation and gifted children for the last twenty years. I  think with Dr. Sternberg here and the School of Entrepreneurship, what  they   ve been able to accomplish in two years, it   s phenomenal.  I   ve actually talked to the person who turned down one of their jobs.  Then Sternberg came here the next year, and they   re like,    Ah  If I had  known, I would   ve come here for even less money     He   s a huge draw. I  think particularly for young eager scholars, studying creativity is a hard  home. There   s not really a home for it in psychology. There   s not really  a home for it in education if you   re not studying gifted children. I think  we have a really unique opportunity to set up the institute as an  interdisciplinary home for these type of academics who don   t really fit  into a department, and to come up with a whole new model for the way  the university is structured.  I   m an alumni of Arizona State, which has undergone massive structural  changes in the last couple of years. Of course, I read about it in the  alumni magazine, so I read the positive things about it and not the  controversy. (Laughs) Just what they   re doing, organizing around  problems, seems to me to make a lot of sense. If you   ve got seven  people in three different colleges studying the same thing, why aren   t  those people in the same space that they can interact with each other and  bring all of these different perspectives and knowledge bases together to  solve the problem? I think that   s a really exciting possibility for the truly  interdisciplinary programs on campus.  Does the Institute of Creativity and Innovation have a physical home?  In 201 Hanner, until they knock it down. (Laughter) We have talked  several times with Mitch Kilcrease in the Student Union about some  possible space in the Student Union. We   re up in the air, on the waiting  list type of entity. They need to see how everything fits back into the  Union before they can decide if we would have some space. I   m hopeful  21  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  that we   ll have some space in there. The president was supportive of  that.  We   d be in the basement where the student clubs used to be with all the  offices, but it   d be more centrally located. There   s not a lot of possibility  of people just wandering by 201 Hanner and saying,    What   s going on  in there?    (Laughter) We have a really cool office space, but there   s no  traffic. There might be traffic when they   re going to come knock it  down. Maybe they   ll do tours before we knock down this historic  building, come look at it.  So is that where your office is?  My psychology office is actually in North Murray, so I   m back and forth  across campus several times a day. I   ve been participating in the Biggest  User, so I   m now walking instead of driving. That was one of our  challenges. I guess I better actually walk. (Laughs) A lot of times, I   m  just out on campus meeting with people. I was meeting today with a  group that is interested in building a sustainable community on campus,  a living-learning community. Grow your own food, raise your own cows  type of sustainability, the type of classes and the synergy you could have  around that, selling back electricity to OG E, just really cool things that  we could be at the cutting edge of at Oklahoma State.  I think that   s one of the big things for the provost and the president.  We   re always playing catch-up. We   re never the first to do anything.  Trying to really figure out what can we be the first at and what are we  the best at. Not that other things aren   t important, but if we concentrate  resources there, that builds the other things, as well. I think that   s,  hopefully, where we   re going to be heading in the next decade.  Do you feel like people across the nation are looking at us with this  creativity institute?  Well, they   re certainly looking at us now with our football record.  (Laughter) Actually, the argument made for putting money into athletics  is that when your athletics goes up, people look at your school and they  become more interested. Now we   ve got to have the academics to back  that up. You   re not going to recruit people just upon the football, which  is fabulously exciting. Way too nail-biting for my taste, so, football  team, if you could just stop making me nervous, that would be good.  Stop causing earthquakes. (Laughter)  That   s right. Stop causing earthquakes. I think we   ll have the academics  to back that up. I had this vision committee that was put together. The  22  Wilson  chair stepped down, and I ended up chairing it. I got a couple of other  people on it. The feedback from the committee members was,    Wow, I  didn   t know we did all this.    We looked across all of campus.    What are  we really good at?     We got feedback from the community, from everybody on campus, and  we began to have this picture emerge. Most people had no idea that we  were doing any of the stuff we were doing. I think that   s a really exciting  thing, is we   re really good at some stuff. We   re not good about telling  people we   re good at it. Part of the Institute for Creativity and  Innovation is the innovation part. We want to let people know why  should they come here. I   m actually going to send an email to Kyle  Wray and Gary Shutt that says,    There   s nothing on our website that  says why you should come here.     I   ve spent quite a bit of time on our website looking for stuff. I was  looking for Student Affairs the other day. First of all, it took me awhile  to find Student Affairs because I was looking for the six pillars. We have  some cool pictures, but it doesn   t say, like,    Five things of    Wow        If I  was a senior in high school, why would I choose OSU if my family  hadn   t come here? What really cool innovative things have you done  here? I think having those kinds of things, like    We helped cure cancer,     or    We have a sensor that is now saving lives of 9/11 emergency  people,    or whatever really cool things we   re doing, just really  highlighting those, having a scrolling list of fabulousness about OSU.  We   ve tended to be very modest. That probably comes from our early  beginnings. I had a line in the vision report that was quite grandiose  about how fabulous we are. (Laughs) Somebody was like,    I get the  spirit, but you might back off a bit on that.       All right.    (Laughter)  I think this is a great university, and I think we haven   t done a good job  of selling ourselves as that. Maybe it   s scary to sell yourself as that. One  of the draws is that this is a nice small town. Whenever we get ranked as  one of the top retirement places, I   m like,    No, no, no, no, no  People  will want to move here     I don   t want to be in Edmond. I like driving to  Edmond, I like shopping in Edmond, but I like coming home. I think  there   s a risk of getting bigger. I mean, we have to move forward. I think  we have an opportunity to try different things. With this president and  provost, we have an opportunity to break out of the same old, same old  of how we   ve always done things for five hundred years because the  system hasn   t changed much since 1200. I   m really hopeful that they   ll  want to try some cool, innovative things.  It sounds like if anyone is going to, they will.  23  Page  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  If anybody is going to, it   s them, so if it doesn   t happen now, we better  just hunker down for same old, same old. (Laughs)  Will the governor   s declaration of November as a state of creativity  month have any effect?  I thought that was really cool. I was like,    Yes     I had been in an early  meeting for the Creativity Index, and I thought,    Well, that   s cool, too      You really feel like you   re making a difference. I think that the  Creativity Index and the focus on creativity in November will allow  students who are currently not served by the standardized testing and/or  could be served better   I did really well on standardized tests, but  there   s more to you than a test score. There   s other kids who don   t do  well on standardized tests, but they   re really smart. They   re really bright.  I think it will help schools who have students who don   t test well for a  variety of reasons, one of those being access to early literacy, access to  services, access to good schools who have all the textbooks for students.  We take that for granted, and there are students that don   t have that. This  will allow them to showcase what else are they doing. They can be  proud of what they   re doing. No school is out there wanting their  students to fail. We know that. When you only have one way to report  that, it looks like the school is failing when there   s other ways they  could be succeeding. The statewide focus on creativity, I think, will help  put Oklahoma on the map, particularly for people like me who aren   t  from around here. They   ll know it   s more than a song. (Laughs)  I used to run a program in the summer, and college kids from the coast  would come. They literally were surprised we had plumbing. Are you  kidding? (Laughter) We   re in America. There   s such misinformation  about what Oklahoma is. I think sometimes our politics don   t help us in  bringing a broader base of people to the state, but when you can get  people here, particularly this campus, they   re incredibly impressed. They  go back and they tell people the good stories, and then you just keep  building on that. Then more and more people, I think, will want to come  here.  And maybe the politics will change. (Laughter)  Maybe the politics will change. For me, that would be a good thing.  Is there anything else we haven   t covered that we should talk about,  about all of this?  Let   s see. I just think it   s an exciting time, and it   s a confluence of  forces. I was actually very pleased by the governor   s endorsement of  24  Wilson  Page  creativity and innovation because I think she stepped out of politics and  really did what was best for the state and has the leadership skills to  follow that up. That   s really exciting that she was able to do that and,  particularly, as the first woman governor. I   m very supportive of her in  that way, that I want her initiatives to be successful within this realm. I  was excited we sent 120 people from campus to the Creativity Forum.  Have you had much feedback from that yet?  Mainly positive. There was one session where people felt like somebody  was trying to sell them something, but other than that   (Laughter)  They   re going to have all the talks online. Kevin Carroll, the last  speaker, was so phenomenally inspirational. That   s what I would really,  really wish students could see is speakers like that. If we could bring  somebody like that to campus twice a year where   I left there wanting  to change the world. He really, really lit a fire and let you know that  anything is possible.  I think that   s what the forum is for. It gives you a skill set so you learn  some skills, but it   s also to have those speakers who are just like,    Wow   If this guy can do it, all of the things that he had to overcome       Just  that mindset of    Nothing will stop me.    That   s what I really liked when  he talked about he   s going to be in the NBA, and he   s really short, and  his friends are like,    Um, you   re short.    He   s like,    Yes, there   s short  players.    They   re like,    No, you   re really short.    (Laughter) So he  figured out another way. If you can   t be an A, be a B. I thought that was  really cool that he talked about those twists and those turns, and I think  we tend to be a very linear society. If you fall off the path, you don   t  have a skill set to find the other path around.  That   s what I would like our students to learn here is those critical  thinking skills. Writing will take you a long way and being able to come  up with ideas and put together a team to be able to help you with those  ideas. I think that   s where entrepreneurship fits in is that it   s not about  starting a business. It   s about a way of thinking. Do you recognize an  opportunity and can you put the team together? Can you put the  resources together? I think that   s the exciting thing.  I think having a whole month where we   re going to focus on creativity  will also allow us on campus to have an organized Fall. I think we   ve  got the Spring now. People know it   s coming in April. There   s a  Creativity Festival. It   ll be our fourth one. They   re sort of familiar with  that. I think it   ll be cool that the forum will be in November, and we can  organize around that. Next year, I would love to co-sponsor some big  speakers with them. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Teresa Amabile, I would  really love to bring them to campus and potentially work with the  25  Wilson  Page  Wilson  Page  Creativity Forum. They   re going to come here first, and then you guys  can have them. I think that   s how you can bring in some really big  names.  Are there any speakers set for this year for the spring?  David Cutler, who is a composer, will be here in the spring, January 27,  so that is our currently set speaker for the spring. He   ll give a campus-wide  address and then also work with students in music.  Well, I   m very excited about everything that   s happening at OSU in  creativity. I think people can really feel the energy, so I want to thank  you for your efforts in this area, and thank you for your time today.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
