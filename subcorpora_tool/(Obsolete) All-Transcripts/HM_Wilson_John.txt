Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Observing is Ginger Wilson.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is [HistoryMaker] John E. Wilson, W-I-L-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what does the E stand for?
Speaker 2: Ethelbert (laughter) that, that was a
Speaker 1: Oh that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Before you get into that, that was a famous British king. But my, my friends kid me and sometime call me Ethel (laughter).  But really my nickname is Big John.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So is there a story behind how you got the middle name Ethelbert?
Speaker 2: My [paternal] grandmother [Dora McDermott] gave it to me, I don't know where, where it came from and I always thought she didn't really like me as a grandchild (laughter).  Because in grammar school you know the kids can be unmerciful, now days it doesn't mean anything.  And at my age I don't care what you say about it to be truthful.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth is December 9, 1932, and I was born in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay and sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a certified public accountant.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: What is today's date, is July 21st, 2005.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: In the offices of The HistoryMakers organization and that is I believe 1900 South Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois on the third floor.  Which is very difficult for a guy with a cane to come up the steps (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 303855
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that they make me ask people, that only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay fine.
Speaker 1: And the first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Oh that's interesting, probably hamburgers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Oh boy that's a good one.  I would say tan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At least most of the things that I have now are tan, but blue would be somewhere in there also.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Oh I love summer and I love it when it's very hot like right now.
Speaker 1: Okay do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well to be truthful I like Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], but to be truthful, I really love Chicago [Illinois], I don't dream of traveling much.  I've been to a lot of places in my lifetime and we used to, when, when the children [Ginger Wilson and Kelly Wilson] were growing up, we used to spend a lot of time in Jamaica.  Matter of fact I planned to build a house, but at this stage of my life in my mature age here, I really love Chicago.  Most things that I'm interested in are right here in this town, I think Chicago is just a wonderful town.
Speaker 1: Okay, the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well I like and this out of the Bible, might be paraphrasing but, "I will never leave you, I will never forsake you."  I think that's from Isaiah [sic.], I can't give you the citation, but what that means to me is God is always with me in everything I do.  And at this stage of my life the little things that, that seem most common grass, pretty flowers and I can see God in everything now.  Now you know that happens too as you get older, 'cause you know you getting close to him anyway (laughter), so but truthfully in my heart, that's one my of favorite sayings.
Story_ID: 303856
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history, and I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Leroy Wilson] side.
Speaker 2: Fine.
Speaker 1: But we're gonna start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Carrie Simpson, S-I-M-P-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell Carrie?
Speaker 2: C-A-R-R-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay and what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: It was November 2nd, 1903.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the place was I think it was some place in Mississippi, but I'm not quite sure the town.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now well what do you know about your mother's side of the family, I mean how far back can you trace the ancestors on that side?  Now they're from Mississippi, right, but how far back can you go?
Speaker 2: I can't go back far at all she never spoke about them, my daughters [Ginger Wilson and Kelly Wilson] are doing some research but I don't know what has come about it at.  All I know is that she was raised by an aunt, her mother died when she was very young.  And when she was, I think, before twenty, she came to Chicago [Illinois], she didn't have much formal education I believe only to the second or third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay so she was about twenty years old you said when she came (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah when she came up here.
Speaker 1: Okay, she didn't talk about the town she came from in Mississippi or?
Speaker 2: Never talk very much about Mississippi; I know that I had a sister [Gwendolyn Wilson Rauls] that she left in Mississippi when she came up here.  My, my sister was about seven or eight years older than me as I remember it, and she never talked much about Mississippi.
Speaker 1: So they never even talk about the town they came from?
Speaker 2: No, they never did.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I don't know what the experience was that they just kind of rejected Mississippi for some reason another.
Speaker 1: Did your mother talk about growing up at all and going to school and--
Speaker 2: I never heard it, never heard it.  That part, what, what is happening right now is one of my cousins is trying to trace this on the Internet.  And what I'm finding out and I, I just found this out recently that you can get a lot of information concerning your family off of some forum on the Internet.  And what my cousin has done, she hasn't found much on my mother, but I think she's finding stuff on my father.
Story_ID: 303857
Speaker 1: So your mother [Carrie Simpson Wilson] went--had some schooling in Mississippi, but not a lot, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So what did she do when she came to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: The one job that I remember and they could've been some jobs before this, is that she was a seamstress in a laundry out in Evanston [Illinois].  And she was, had that job for over forty years, it seems like the time I was a little boy until I know long after I had graduated from college she worked at this one place.  The North Shore Overall Company [ph.], and they cleaned overalls and she sewed pants and things like that, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay did she live in Chicago proper or did she live in Evanston?
Speaker 2: No we always lived in Chicago, we lived with an aunt until I was--well what she had to do at first with me, is she left me with a family and they lived on 95th [Street] and State Street.  Which was not very well developed at that time, and then we moved with an aunt on 54th [Street] and Calumet [Avenue] for a few years.  And then by the time I was seven or eight, we got an apartment in Ida B. Wells [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois] on 39th [Street] and in those days it was called South Park [South Parkway Avenue; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].  I remember the guy that was in charge of it was Oscar Brown Sr. (laughter), very nice man.
Speaker 1: That's right the father of [HistoryMaker] Oscar Brown, Jr. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was his father, that's exactly right.  And the connection there was he was a lawyer for my [paternal] grandmother [Dora McDermott] who had several buildings on the South Side.  So I guess she needed a lawyer, I can't tell you why, but he knew my grandmother and he helped us to get in the projects.  It was very difficult in those days to get into Ida B. Wells because it was like considered a middle-class housing project.
Speaker 1: Yeah a lot of people don't understand that today, they think that when your hear projects, you, you talking about the, you know real decrepit projects that don't get public attention and that sort of thing.  But in those days when they were first built, they were, they were considered transition housing, right?
Speaker 2: We had flowers, we had gardens, we had grass, and the buildings were kept up, I think very well.  The hallways for example, each apartment was responsible for part of the stairwell in your hallways.  And they were washed every week, I mean those places as I think back now were, were just really very nice.  Matter of fact, probably nicer than some of these Section 8s that I've seen now where people don't take care of it.  I have to laugh guys would be talking about how tough it was and of course I'll say to them, well I grew up in the projects also.  And then they'll, and then they'll say, "Where was it?" and I'll describe Ida B. Wells (laughter).  They said, "That wasn't no project (laughter) man you were darn near on the North Shore." (Laughter) You know, and it's true.
Story_ID: 303858
Speaker 1: Give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Father's name was Leroy and I don't know the middle name.  Last name was Wilson; he wasn't with the family very long.
Speaker 1: Do you know his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I believe he was born Omaha, Nebraska but I really don't know.  He was only with my mother [Carrie Simpson Wilson], from my understanding for about a year, and then he was out in the street.  And then the next time I met him, I was about ten years old, eleven years old somewhere in that neighborhood and he never talked much about growing up.  I think he was the oldest son of my grandmother's [Dora McDermott], I know he loved baseball, but I didn't see very much of him until maybe ten or eleven, somewhere along in that when he came back to my mother and asked for a divorce.  He used to be a porter in a barbershop on State [Street] and Division [Street, Chicago, Illinois].  And in the mornings, he would clean up stores and shops around that neighborhood, you know like the porter.  And he got me to meet him over there, I would catch the L at six o'clock in the morning and meet him over there on Division Street, and we would clean up several stores.  And he would give me little money and I would come back and go in the school about eight thirty or nine o'clock.  And that was basically my relationship with him but as I got into high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] I couldn't catch that L early in the morning.  And you know it's kind of tiring position and the other thing was when I got into high school, I was very busy.  Because I, I got involved in basketball and you would go to school then you'd play basketball after school.  You know you either practice or during the season I was on the team, I was on the senior team.  And so my contact with him was not as close as now I wish it had been, and then when I got into college of course, I would just see him sporadically.  And he died at; at what I consider a young age now, at fifty, fifty-one years of age, so my relationship with my father was not as close as I wish it could have been.
Story_ID: 303859
Speaker 1: Did he [Wilson's father, Leroy Wilson] talk any about his ancestors or anything or where he came from?
Speaker 2: No, he knew I knew his mother [Dora McDermott]; he never talked about his father.   His brother who was here in town and was very successful.  He was the first black CPA [certified public accountant] in the, in the Illinois and second in the country.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Arthur Wilson, Arthur Jewell Wilson.
Speaker 1: So your uncle was Arthur Wilson.
Speaker 2: Jewell Wilson, right.  But--
Speaker 1: He was the first black CPA in the US?
Speaker 2: In, in Illinois.
Speaker 1: In Illinois okay.
Speaker 2: And the second in the country.
Speaker 1: Well you know the question is, did he inspire you to become an accountant?
Speaker 2: I believe so, two things inspired me.  He inspired me and I was in the someway or another (laughter) I passed things, the exams the entrance exams at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].  And I thought I had a scholarship from the Methodist church, Northwestern thought I had a scholarship from the Methodist church.  And I had done a year at Wilson Junior College [Woodrow Wilson Junior College; Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] here and I started at Northwestern as a sophomore.  And I went the whole year without paying anything, lived on campus the whole bit and found out I didn't have a scholarship.  I'm gone tell you that's a traumatic experience (laughter) but I had been working at odd jobs since I was eight years old.  And I saved about thirteen hundred dollars, my mother [Carrie Simpson Wilson] never made very much money, and in those days making thirty-five, forty dollars.  Well you could still live in the projects with that because they based your, your rent on what you were making.  So Northwestern called me, the bursar called me into the office and told me I needed about a thousand dollars.  I had nobody to go to, but I had my own money, because I had been saving, I went and gave them a thousand dollars.  And that kept me in school, and I think that was good, because I had a, a student deferment, that was in the height of the Korean War.  But from that point on, I had some type of job up at Northwestern where I was able to make at least a thousand dollars a year.  I always worked extra for my food and I was able to get through Northwestern.  Well of course we know right now in the year 2005, if you go up to, to Northwestern with a thousand dollars when you get to Howard Street they gonna call the police on you and send you back you know (laughter).  It's thirty-five, forty thousand dollars now, but I'm dating myself when I say that, and I never even though my mother couldn't afford to give me anything but she was able to give me five dollars a week.  I never felt poor, I knew what poor was because I was at a rich school and I saw a lot of kids with a lot of things.  But I never felt deprived or poor and I certainly never missed a meal.
Story_ID: 303860
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to growing up, I mean, I have a couple more questions about your parents (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh certainly.
Speaker 1: Can you--is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: I just, I all I always thought was out in the street somewhere (laughter) I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think that my grandmother was completely satisfied with my mother [Carrie Simpson Wilson], I think she wanted her boys to marry people that were educated or something you know.  My father [Leroy Wilson] did get a certificate for embalming I know that, and I think he went to college for a couple of years, but he never graduated.  My [paternal] uncle [Arthur Wilson] went to the University of Illinois in Champaign [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] and graduated with a degree in chemistry.  And how he turned that into accounting, I will never know, but after he came out of college he took the accounting exam and he passed the CPA [certified public accountant].  That was about 1921, and he tried to get a job with Internal Revenue [Internal Revenue Service, IRS] but the color barrier was up.  And even though he passed the exam in the '90s [1990s], they wouldn't hire him you know, but that's a whole different story about.  You know that was America that's all.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Dora J. McDermott, well now McDermott wasn't her, wasn't my father's or my uncle's father.  This was her second or third marriage and McDermott worked at the post office.  And when I remember my grandmother, I think McDermott was dead you know, and how she got this real estate maybe it came from him or his insurance.  I don't know, she was very smart with money.
Speaker 1: Okay so he had a building or, she--
Speaker 2: She had three buildings I go by them now, they still standing on 57th [Street] and 58th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And what she used to do is rent out the apartments by room and she would collect the rent weekly.  And she used to say if you collect the rent weekly you got thirteen months in the year (laughter) I never thought of that before, but you do.
Speaker 1: So you get more money?
Speaker 2: Yeah you get an extra four weeks, see?  And like I say she was smart with, with money, and when she died, she actually had an estate.  And I'm not sure how big it was but I think it was sixty or seventy thousand dollars plus the buildings, which was, was not bad for, for a black person at, at, she died in 1953 I believe.  And that wasn't back for somebody came through the [Great] Depression and all of those things.
Speaker 1: No, that's not bad at all, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's, that's--
Speaker 2: A lot of folks don't have it now you know that, so--
Speaker 1: Most people in those days needed to rent a room--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know and that's, that's all they could afford you know was a room in a place like you know in places that she had.  So that's I mean all those big greystones along King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] are filled with people, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Living in one room.
Speaker 2: That's exactly what she did, she'd keep one apartment for herself and rent all the rest of them out, one room at a time.  That's exactly what she did, but that was, she was a smart old lady.
Story_ID: 303861
Speaker 1: Who do you think that you take after in your family, you know, it could be your mother [Carrie Simpson Wilson] your father [Leroy Wilson], your [paternal] grandmother [Dora McDermott], your [paternal] uncle [Arthur Wilson], or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think probably a bunch of them, I mean characteristics are more than one person but probably more so my mother than anyone.  She believed in education, she pushed me and my sister [Gwendolyn Wilson Rauls], even though my sister only finished high school.  She certainly gave us the work ethic because she worked in Evanston [Illinois] all of those years, came from the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] would be on the L platform at six o'clock in the morning to go to Evanston.  And did it up, up into her seventies, the, the pension that she got from the laundry workers or whoever that union was, was very small.  And after she retired she lived on social security and that, and I think lived, she always had an apartment.  She took my car; it's funny, when in 1955 I bought a car after I came out of college [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].  And when I went into the [U.S. military] service, I still owed some notes and she start paying those notes, it was a new Plymouth matter of fact.  And she learned to drive and at that time, she was in her fifties and she kept that car for sixteen, seventeen, eighteen years, then she bought one more. But she always had a car, and I think she didn't have a lot of money, but I think she lived middle-class almost.  I mean I used to give her little things, but it certainly wasn't enough to say that I was taking care of her.  And she would, the other thing that she was, she was very independent and the other thing that she taught me is she loved her family, her children.  She'd do anything for, and I think, I would like to think, I don't know, my daughters [Ginger Wilson and Kelly Wilson] (laughter) I don't question them on that but I think that I have tried in my lifetime to take care of my daughters in, in every way that I could and my wife [Velma Brown Wilson].  And I always tell my wife that I'm making up for what my father missed, because he left my mother when I was one.  And I don't plan to leave her till I'm about 101 (laughter) you know?  We, we will have been married forty-five years in three days, so I've been blessed.
Story_ID: 303862
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest? I got all types of childhood memories that would've been early.  I don't know if I can restrict it to one.
Speaker 1: First ones are is there a first thing that you remember, remember?
Speaker 2: Well I remember okay, I remember living with this family, my mother [Carrie Simpson Wilson] couldn't afford an apartment for us, and the lady's name was Miss Potter [ph.].  Her husband was obviously Mr. Potter he had a cleaners a dry cleaners on 58th [Street] and Calumet [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  And we lived at 95th [Street] and State Street, and I go by there right now because the house has been knocked down, and right there where the lot is there's a hot dog stand.  Right there in 95th in, in, I guess that's State and, and that comes back to me.  Other things that come to me, I used to sell the Chicago Defender I wasn't but nine, ten years old.  I developed a Defender route right in my three buildings in the project.  And then I would walk down King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] to the elevator and stand there and sell Defenders, and I always think that helped me with my work ethic.  I would make money, when I was in high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] for example, I developed a stocking route, I knew the teachers, because many of them were my grammar school teachers.  And I would sell them a box of stockings maybe every two weeks, and I would make about a buck off of each  box.  And I used to have, I had a little cardboard box in my room, and sometimes I'd have twenty, thirty dollars in there more money my mama would have.  But she would make me take some of that money and put it into a savings account, and that helped me with the savings.  So I've had all types of little experiences like that, it's kind of hard for me to say which one impressed me the most.  Because all of them, it's just a combination of building one after another.
Story_ID: 303863
Speaker 1: You were held up once, as a kid (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, when--I was selling magazines when I was about eight or nine-years old and the guy followed me into the hallway and stuck me up.  And he was too big I couldn't do nothing and I bet you he didn't get more than two dollars.  But then I used to have a paper [Chicago Defender] route and, and it would, I would go down as far as 43rd [Street] and Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], and some guys one day jumped on me.  Pulled me in the hallway and tried to take my money, I don't know what got into me, but I would not give them the money.  So they, they hit me two or three times and I guess for some reason another they just said, "Hey, if this guy wants to hold on to that little money that bad, let's just leave him alone."  And that's what they did, they just walked on out in the hallway, and from then on, when they would see me delivering the papers they would said, "Oh that's the paperboy, forget about him."  Now at this stage of my life, if you gone jump on me, (laughter) for two or three dollars I'd give it all to you and wouldn't think about it.  But that day I wouldn't, and I was fortunate but all of my entrepreneur activities, I can't remember ever getting in any serious trouble doing it you know.  And I would try to delivered groceries, try all types of things.  I just saw a minister, he's retired now, he must be darn near ninety that was the minister of Metropolitan Church.  And I used to carry his stuff from 39th Street down to 41st Street.  And I mean he'd give me a quarter sometimes fifty cents, and I just saw him and I was just thinking to myself, boy oh boy here I am in my seventies and here he is probably in his nineties, you know.  But we both have made it through so far.
Story_ID: 303864
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sound, well sights would be when we come downtown and we go to museums and of course, I would travel around the city [Chicago, Illinois].  This interesting, I never even thought of this, I would travel around the city to all the various high schools when we were playing basketball.  And that's how I got to see some of the white community 'cause remember I, I lived in, in a black project and was basically confined to the black community.  My aunt moved across Cottage Grove [Avenue] to 38th [Street] and Ellis [Avenue] and she was very fair-complected and she was the first black to move over on that side of Cottage Grove.  And I would go over see her and you know sometimes the kids over there would say something.  But only once did they, they try to do something to me, but that was a fist fight.  It wasn't the danger that, that these kids run into now with weapons and stuff like that you know.  But I got to travel also because my mother [Carrie Simpson Wilson] had a boyfriend that did day work on the North Shore, and he would take me up there to work with him.  So I would get to see these fine homes in Wilmette [Illinois] and Winnetka [Illinois], Highland Park [Illinois] you know where he worked.  And I always looked at that stuff, you didn't see black people doing nothing up there except what he and I was doing working.  But, but it exposed me to the fact that there were other things in this life other than the projects.  And I can't say that, at that time I said, "Hey, I wanna get one of these big houses and all that."  But I was exposed to it, and I knew there was something else going on.  And I think that kind of broaden my concept.  Then of course when I went to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] and lived on campus and saw all these kids with cars and money and all that stuff that also said to me even though you're black the opportunities are out here.  I don't know how you gone do it, but, but there's something out here other than Ida B. Wells [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois].  So I think that kind of help broaden me and maybe made me ambitious, helped me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now were there any sounds and smells that you remember from growing up?
Speaker 2: Smells just people cooking in my building (laughing) and stuff like that; it was a, basically it would've been people cooking.  I mean I didn't, it wasn't, I didn't come from a dirty environment even in the project, so.
Speaker 1: Any (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sounds--the other sounds would've been maybe I used to in high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] I hung around with some guys and we used to like jazz.  And we'd listen to people like I mean kind of way out too like Charlie Parker and, and folks like that.  Those were the types of sounds and whatnot.  But smells, that's funny (laughter) I never even thought of that, can't think of them now to be truthful.
Story_ID: 303865
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a kid growing up, were you--what kind of a kid were you and how would other people see do you think?
Speaker 2: I think I was--because in my particular building there were three buildings [in Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois], there was a gang, and I think I was little bit frightened about that.  First thing my mother [Carrie Simpson Wilson] would've killed me if had been a gangbanger, but I didn't I'm not saying that I'm I did everything straight.  But I never had the nerve to do many crooked things, I would do some things, in those days they had those big old red streetcars going down the street.  And I would hop on the back sometimes like the kids, but that was just danger to myself, I wasn't hurting CTA [Chicago Transit Authority], I could've fallen off and got killed.  I don't think that I ever did anything illegal, you know where I could've gone to jail or something like, matter of fact I know I didn't.  And then a couple of my friends were doing illegal things and I would see them with money and stuff, and I would say, "Man, I'd sure like to get some of the money."  They wouldn't even, they wouldn't even talk to me about stuff like, guys would say to me, "Hey, don't you ever do anything like this you know.  You our boy, you growing up around here being honest, stay that way."  So I think I was, I also would study some, I never study as much as I should have, but I would do, always do my homework.  And I always liked stuff like arithmetic for some reason, and geometry and trigonometry you know through high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And I would do, I would do my work, I wish sometimes I worked a little harder, but then on the other hand whatever I did must've been okay 'cause I passed one of the hardest exams to get through, especially in those days the CPA [certified public accountant] exam you know.  But I think I was just, I was ordinary, I didn't have a lot of money, but I was honest, and, and that honesty was the influence of my mother.  It would've broken her heart if I had done something and wound up you know in real trouble.  And I, I don't know, I always respected my mother, 'cause I used to see her work so hard for us, I mean tremendously hard.
Story_ID: 303866
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well we went every Sunday, she [Wilson's mother, Carrie Simpson Wilson] made us go.
Speaker 1: Where would you go?
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [56th Street] and Indiana [Avenue], It's now called Gorham Methodist Church [Gorham United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois], and I was like most kids I would go--I had a friend named Robert Johnson [ph.].  And we would go and his, his parents had a car, I think it was a Cadillac; it was a big fine car.  And he had keys to his car and we would sneak out on Sunday while church services were going and get in this car (laughter) and drive around, and get back before church was over (laughter) I mean that was the mischievous things that we did, but we did nothing in the car just, just 'cause we could get it and do that.  Yes, I, I don't know to what extent, well I think church had a big influence.  But when I didn't get the scholarship from the church like I thought, I think I got angry a little bit about the church.
Speaker 1: Well, they promised you a scholarship?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think I strayed a little bit, I'm back now with a vengeance (laughter) but I strayed a little bit.  And when I was helping to raise them [Wilson's daughters, Ginger Wilson and Kelly Wilson] and they, their mama [Velma Brown Wilson] did the big job, I wish I had influence them a little bit more.  Not that they don't believe in Christ or anything like that but I didn't influence them as much as I think could have as a, as a daddy.  But yes, church was very influential and I think it helped me in trying to, no it, it helped me in determining what is right and wrong I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think Judeo-Christian ethics was instilled in me.

Speaker 1: Where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: Wendell Phillips Grade School [Wendell Phillips Elementary School], which doesn't exist, the building is attached to Wendell Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Sometimes I tell people that now you know younger people, and, and they have no idea about the grammar school that was there.  They haven't torn down the building, matter of fact they have improved the building, but the building is now Wendell Phillips High School also.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did you like sch- well you, you said you liked school pretty much you good you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, school was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A good student.
Speaker 2: I never for example, cut school, cut classes, it, it was also a, a pretty good interesting experience, and then of course in high school you know you had to go.  And you had to keep your grades up if you gone play basketball and I loved basketball in those days you know.
Speaker 1: Okay now, now did you have any favorite teachers in grade school at Wendell Phillips?
Speaker 2: Yeah well let me tell you.  The lady that taught math her name was Huggins [ph.].
Speaker 1: Huggins, okay.
Speaker 2: And she was stern and she would make you do that homework tables and all of those things, but you know what, underneath all of that I can see now she loved her students.  And she still is in my mind I guess because I still like doing arithmetic (laughter) you know.  There was an English teacher by the name of Miss Montgomery [ph.].  And she was very nice, and I'm trying to, in my younger grades, what I mean by that, the lower grades you know third and fourth grade.  There was a lady by the name of Williams [ph.], and you know what, that lady, I'm still a friend of her son's who is a dentist now.  And he said to me she must've died five or six years ago, she was way up in age you know.  And he says she would say to him, every time almost that he would see her, "How's John Wilson [HistoryMaker John E. Wilson]?"  She remembered me from, and I don't know why, why you know I guess those teachers remembered certain kids all their lives.  But those were the grammar school teachers, I'm trying to remember the gym teachers, I knew Mr. Saffour [ph.] but I'm not sure if they had as much influence on me.  I think I got introduced to basketball around seventh or eighth grade, but it was the high school coaches that had the most influence on me when it came to athletics.
Story_ID: 303868
Speaker 1: Did you go on to Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah I went to Phillips High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Phillips High School, that was the first black high school in the city, right, the first high school the blacks attended I think, right?
Speaker 2: That could've been, but that would've been back in the--after World War I [WWI], I believe my uncle graduated from there in, in somewhere in the teens [1910s] like, I don't know exactly.  'Cause he came out of college around 2002, I mean '22 [1922] or '23 [1923], 1922 or '23 [1923].  But if I'm not mistaken he graduated from Wendell Phillips High School.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's what they say then DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] came, came along after Phillips then.
Speaker 2: Yeah they came along in the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And they built it new.
Speaker 1: They called it the New Phillips [New Phillips High School] at first.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's right, that's exactly right.  The, I know, you know what, I'm doing the tax return right now for a gentlemen that was assistant principal in, in DuSable back there.  And he's way up in his nineties right now, and he tells me about some of the famous people that graduated.  John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] graduated from, from there.  And what is this guy that's so big in music guy out in Hollywood?  He came, he came from there.  A lot of famous people came out of there.  Of course a lot of famous people came out of Wendell Phillips too.
Speaker 1: Right, right is who was in school with you when you were at Wendell Phillips that you remember?
Speaker 2: The guys that I know, well guys like Jim Montgomery who is John, Johnnie Cochran's partner, [HistoryMaker] Jacoby Dickens who is chairman of the board of Seaway Bank [Seaway National Bank; Seaway Bank and Trust Company, Chicago, Illinois].  Oh boy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean a lot of them, I, I just thought there'd be a lot you know.
Speaker 2: There's whole bunch of guys and they slipping my mind but, but and people come up to me sometimes you know and remind me that, that they were there with me.  But there a whole lot of guys--judges, probably a bunch of these judges that you have interviewed came out of there.  A lot of people came out of there and made good.
Story_ID: 303869
Speaker 1: Now you played basketball--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and were you--now you--did--were you a starter on the team or--?
Speaker 2: Well I sat on a bench from, from I guess my freshman year.  Well I couldn't go on the senior, junior in your freshman year.  But for my sophomore and junior year I was on the bench and then in my senior year, I was captain of the senior team.
Speaker 1: Okay so you were--
Speaker 2: So yeah and I made, I actually made second string, all-city, I've been trying to find the newspaper article so my old, my, my daughter will be able to tell my children see (laughter).  And actually we won the Central Division that year, and we were the only team in the city that beat Tilden Tech [Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  John Red Kerr who, who you, you know as big was on that team, but he had just graduated.  And I always said well we beat them, we were a pretty good team but, we beat them because Kerr had graduated the game before us.  I have kidded Kerr about that telling him how lucky he was he graduated before they played us (laughter) you know just joking of course.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, so you all had pretty good season then you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah we did have a good season; we won eight in a row.
Speaker 1: Okay did they have, did the positions in those days in basketball correspond to the ones today (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah just like now center, two guards and two forwards.
Speaker 1: But what did you play?
Speaker 2: Believe it or not I played center, I was six foot, not quite four, but almost, but I only weighed 156 pounds.  So I was about as fat as a pencil, and I always wished that I had been, been bigger, I wish I had bigger feet (chucking) and I wish I had bigger hands.  'Cause see I have small hands, I never could palm a ball.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I got knocked around a lot but I was able, I don't know maybe it was heart or something but I was able to play that position.  And actually I probably was the tallest guy that we had on the team at 6'4".  We didn't have you know these giants like they have now, these young boys coming in there now at 6'11", I wish we had.
Story_ID: 303870
Speaker 1: Was math your favorite subject in high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I liked it, and I think I liked stuff like where you read it in English and stuff like that.  But I, I liked math, you know math was always I guess a little bit easy up through algebra for me.  As you went up higher, it got harder, but it was kind of, of a little bit easier.  And--I well you gonna ask me about college?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers in high school?
Speaker 2: There was a English lady by the name of Youngquest that I really liked and I like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Spell, how do you spell that Young?
Speaker 2: Y-O-U-N-G-Q-U-E-S-T, I believe, I think she was Swedish.  I can't remember the guy in woodshop, but he was nice, and, and I liked my high school basketball coach who is, his name was Ozzie Brothman.  He's dead now, but he was really a nice guy.
Speaker 1: Brothman, B-R-O-T-H-M-A-N?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did you, did you, were you a popular high school student and did you--?
Speaker 2: Yeah I was popular had--you know what, I had girlfriends and never pursued it (laughing).  And of course being on the basketball team you know, they liked you.  But I never had a, a regular girlfriend in high school, probably missed my opportunity (laughter) but I never did.  But I had a whole lot of friends you know, yeah, a whole bunch.
Speaker 1: Okay now did you run for class office or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah and I was, I don't know why I've always wound up being treasurer of the organizations that I've been in.  I don't know why but I ran for treasurer of my, my senior class and that's, and I won the position.
Speaker 1: Okay that's fitting I guess in retrospect (laughter). So, anything else, any, any other clubs or any activities?
Speaker 2: Basically it was the basketball thing, I was a fair student but I wasn't a, you know a great student.  But I was good enough to pass everything, I never flunked a course.
Speaker 1: Now when you, when you were on the verge of graduating, now what year did you graduate?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-four [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay, when you, is that the year that the DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] team took, went to the state?
Speaker 2: No that was, that was nine, oh, I, first thing I gave you, it was 1950 when I graduated from high school, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: DuSable's team that, that went to the state there was 1955 they were five years afterwards.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That was Sweet Charlie Brown [HistoryMaker Charles Brown], Paxton Lunson [sic. Paxton Lumpkin] fellow by the name of Johnson [Curly Johnson], funny I can remember that Johnson was my wife's [Velma Brown Wilson] cousin so, is married to my wife's cousin.  And I know Sweet Charlie Brown, you know I know his brothers and whatnot you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's how I know those, those names.
Story_ID: 303871
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came out in 1950?
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But when you were on the verge of graduating [from Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], did you know you were gonna go to college, what did you think you were gonna do?
Speaker 2: Okay I thought that I was going to get a basketball scholarship to a black college in the South, what was the name of the school?  In was in, in Louisiana?
Speaker 1: Oh Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], or Xavier, Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: One more.
Speaker 1: Xavier, Dillard.
Speaker 2: It was in Baton Rouge (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Southern?
Speaker 2: Southern, yeah.
Speaker 1: Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Yeah it look like I was gonna get a basketball scholarship and my sponsor was Jim Brown, the coach of DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] at that time.  He was the coach when they took the state too.  But what happened is they gave me the scholarship not in September of '54 [1954] but it would've been in starting at in December, January, the next semester.
Speaker 1: Of '51 [1951] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah of '51 [1951] I keep saying '54 [1954].  But at that time, the Methodist church [Gorham United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois] said I had a scholarship to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] if I passed the entrance exam.  And I passed the en- entrance exam and I thought I had the scholarship, at Northwestern, so my mother [Carrie Simpson Wilson] said to me between the two schools you ought to go to Northwestern, forget basketball.
Speaker 1: Okay but didn't you go to Wilson [Woodrow Wilson Junior College; Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] first before you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I was in Wilson--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at that time.
Speaker 1: Wilson Junior College?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So when the next September came, I started at Northwestern, so I didn't get the scholarship to Southern obviously.  And I didn't get the scholarship at Northwestern but I did a whole year without paying Northwestern any money.  And then they called me in there three days before the sophomore year was up and said, "You need approximately a thousand dollars if you can't pay us, then your sophomore year doesn't count.  We can't give you your grades and all of that, and also we're gone have to turn into the draft board 'cause you have a student deferment.  And that won't--they'll take that away from you, and of course," the guy says, "you know if they take that away from you in about two weeks you'd be on your way to boot camp."  Well that's where that thirteen hundred dollars that I had saved since I was about eight just popped right up.  And I went back in there in two days and gave them the thousand dollars and from then on, I had all types of jobs.  But I made enough money that I was able to get through Northwestern, and of course, it's a difference in time.  As you know Northwestern was only a thousand dollars.
Story_ID: 303872
Speaker 1: Tell me, what was the atmosphere like for you at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], I know in those days, some people have told me that are younger than you that they went to University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and couldn't stay on campus.  But you stayed on campus at Northwestern (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but it was, that's a good question you just asked because Northwestern was very racial.  The year I got there was the second year that black men could stay on campus, they had let black women stay on campus a couple years before.  But I was in the group that it was the second year that black men could stay on campus, you could only stay in independent housing.  There was some black fraternities but very weak in terms and numbers and they had no houses, so you were just stuck.  I stayed in a house that was kind of international.  They had Africans other people of other nationalities.  And, and about I think as I remember it about seven or eight black men.  But what had, but what Northwestern had done, I lived in the south end of the campus and Northwestern opened up the independent houses at the north end of the campus for black men.  So at that end of the campus there had to be six or seven black men.  I believe my first year there, there were only twenty-three blacks staying on campus.
Story_ID: 303873
Speaker 1: We were talking about life on campus at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay, when I got there, like I said, there were only twenty-three blacks on campus, and the house that I was in was kind of fun house 'cause it was International House and everybody was very friendly and, I don't remember running into racism in, in this house I lived in.  In--matter of fact the house is still standing, I don't--they have knocked down everything around that house and for some reason another they haven't knocked it down.  It's on Asbury [Avenue] and I forgot the street, the street that goes north and south, the bus runs down there.  And this house is still there, the house was built in 1890 or something like that, and they've let it stay, it's not a dormitory anymore.  But what they had in my house we had some athletes, some black athletes and three or four guys like me.  I mean, just ordinary students.
Speaker 1: Now, now you didn't play basketball or anything at Northwestern?
Speaker 2: No just intramural, I wasn't good enough for Big Ten [Big Ten Conference] so it was just intramural but that was kind of fun too.  Because what happened I got in the ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Corps], the [U.S.] Air Force ROTC and I played on Air Force ROTC basketball team.  And I really believe that helped me with my student deferment, even though I didn't go into the Air Force.
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: But the house was, was friendly and I really believed everybody got along.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: There were Africans in there, there were all types of people.  And we all tended to live together harmoniously I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's different from a lot of places in those days (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh definitely, now I'm not telling you that Northwestern itself was the most friendly place that I had been in.  It was sometimes in class I would see students that wouldn't speak to you or they, you'd be walking down the street, and they walk right pass you like you didn't exist.  But that's their prerogative, that didn't bother you, nobody ever ran up and hit you or you know any, any of that physical stuff.  And none of that ever, and of course students have their cliques too you know, they have their own fraternities.  And the Jewish guys had theirs, and, and the Protestant, white Protestant guys had theirs so, those were just things that existed.  But I don't think I ever, maybe I was too busy, too, resented that very much 'cause I was always on the move trying to do something.
Story_ID: 303874
Speaker 1: Were there any black instructors at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] when you were there?
Speaker 2: None, there might've been some, I was the first black to graduate they tell me now from the Commerce School [Northwestern University School of Commerce, Evanston, Illinois].  Now it's called Kellogg [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois], but I never saw a black instructor anywhere, and if so, they could've been some downtown [Chicago, Illinois] on the Northwestern campus.  But I'm not sure, but I never saw one up in Evanston [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay now did you, were, were you majoring in accounting?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the reason was obviously I knew I had an uncle [Arthur Wilson] that was a CPA [certified public accountant] and accounting of all the courses seem to be, come to me it was easier for me than most things.  So I just kept taking accounting courses, I can't tell you that I was the greatest student in the world, but the accounting came pretty easy.  And I just looked up one day I had a major in accounting, I hadn't started off to be a CPA though.
Speaker 1: Okay what, what were you, did you have a specific goal when you started?
Speaker 2: Just to graduate from Northwestern and since I was in the, in the Commerce School, to get some type of job with some company, that my education would lead me to, I thought.  What happened is, when I was graduating and they had job interviews everybody ignored the black people.  Actually from the Commerce School, there wasn't but one guy me, and when the, when the accountants--they had the Big Eight Firms up from there and the large regional firms and nobody would talk to you.  They would just say, "That's very fine," and brush you off you know, they wouldn't be insulting but it was insulting.  And nobody would talk to me, and then you know what, as I think back, I never knew anybody, any black guy that was working in one of these big white accounting firms, no one.  And I didn't realize I never thought about the fact that I was in the Commerce School and there were only two guys.  I was ahead of a guy of by the name of Woods, I wanted to say Woodside [ph.], but that isn't his name, he's dead now.  But you know I never thought about that, but the black student association about ten years ago honored me and gave me a big plaque and whatnot.  And they were the ones that told me they had researched and found out I was the first black to graduate from the Commerce School.  But when I came out trying to get an accounting job, it was impossible; the only job I got was with my uncle, at a very low rate (laughter).
Story_ID: 303875
Speaker 1: When did you graduate?
Speaker 2: In 1954.
Speaker 1: Okay so, so 1954, are there any stories about Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] that--
Speaker 2: Well to show you about racism in accounting, the guy that was I believe number one in our class was Japanese and they couldn't get him a job.  And it hurt him so bad he was Japanese American that he was going to Japan; I mean he actually wanted to leave the country.  But what happened is I think some of the professors got together and persuaded some company, one of the large accounting company to take him in like at the junior level.  But this guy was number one in our class and passed the CPA [certified public accountant] exam before we graduated.  And they weren't letting him in, because in those days accounting was strictly white, and frankly right now the prejudice isn't as high.  But if you look at the total number of partners in accounting firms and the total number of black partners, there still a very, very low percentage, just isn't there.
Speaker 1: Now in those days, the Japanese student this is right after World War II [WWII] basically you know about nine years after the war.  Was there still a lot of prejudice against Japanese people as a result?
Speaker 2: I mean I didn't think so but I really remember this guy catching the devil so that could've been it.  I couldn't, you know what, me as a black student I kind of felt, okay this is because I'm black, but I couldn't understand why they were treating this Japanese guy this way.  Now I never had any contact him very much during the four years you know and in my house there was some Japanese students from, from Hawaii.  And they were friendly you know, but I don't know why they treated this young, this man, this one student like this.  And you know, I always in my mind thought it was so, I always thought it was more unfair to him than it was for me.  And I guess that's because being black, I've been accustomed to, to being discriminated against, so I didn't pay it much attention.  But that's the way--oh to show you how Northwestern was, they had a survey and they asked the independent men that lived on campus how do you feel if a black got assigned as your roommate?  Now this, the guy that led this, his name is John McKnight he taught his whole career at Northwestern.  And the results of that survey was, we don't want them, 70 or 80 percent said we don't want a black as a roommate.  That was in my sophomore year, in my junior year, they did it again and only 40 percent said that they wouldn't accept a black as a roommate, so it had gone down.
Speaker 1: So was this is a survey published in the school paper or?
Speaker 2: No they, they came around and, and passed out you know I guess the questionnaire to all the independent students.
Speaker 1: I just wondered if they published the results in the paper or the school paper or--
Speaker 2: They may have, I'm not sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How, how did you find out the results?
Speaker 2: Well the guy that was, was leading this charge actually lived in my house, John McKnight.
Story_ID: 303876
Speaker 1: Now did you have any favorite instructors at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a guy by the name of Ray Mack [Raymond W. Mack], and he was in sociology and he was--gave me the impression that he was concerned.  One of the things a, you know you, you feel like in terms of these professors, you feel like you kind of by yourself.  You know like, like they didn't care for you.  There was, there was a guy in accounting and I, I'm not sure his name was Bannon [ph.] but I knew he left Northwestern and went to Loyola [Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  He was okay and then there was another guy in business economics or something like that.  That had, had come from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and these guys would kind of give you the impression that you, you were a human being.  Everybody else was kind of aloof, they just, there was a coldness and the, the guy that was the dean of men, I forgotten his name he was something.  You didn't feel like he was in your corner at all.
Speaker 1: Okay so it was more against you than for you (laughing)
Speaker 2: Yeah or that, that's the feeling you had.  Now he didn't do any overt things you know he could have I guess, but he didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, so well, was your, your graduation memorable?  Did your mother [Carrie Simpson Wilson] get a chance to see your grad- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't go.
Speaker 1: You didn't go, okay.
Speaker 2: Well actually what happened, the reason I didn't go, I wasn't boycotting or anything, I graduated in August.  Even though my diploma is for June, but I had to do one course after graduation, so I didn't go.  Matter of fact what I did is one of the guys in my house invited me to go home with him, and we went into New York.
Story_ID: 303877
Speaker 1: So when you graduated [from Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] you, did you immediately start working for your [paternal] uncle [Arthur Wilson]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and everybody knew, including me, that I was going to the [U.S. military] service 'cause that was Korea and I was, I knew and my un- well my uncle knew that too.  But everybody knew in '54 [1954] I don't know if Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] had ended the war [Korean War] yet and I, and, and what happened is I happened to be one of the younger guys in my draft board.  So other guys ahead of me, and I didn't go to the, to the service for a year, fourteen, fifteen months.  I went in November the following year.
Speaker 1: Okay November of '55 [1955] right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did, so you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--
Speaker 1: You go to the [U.S.] Air Force?
Speaker 2: No what happened is I got drafted like everybody else and instead of going into the [U.S.] Army they put me in the [U.S.] Navy.  I got drafted into the Navy, in '55 [1955] from about October to January the next year, the Navy and the [U.S.] Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] drafted people.  Just for about four or five months because those are volunteer services you know, and I, I got drafted into the Navy.
Speaker 1: How did you like the Navy and what, where did they station you?
Speaker 2: Well after Great Lakes [Naval Station Great Lakes, Lake County, Illinois] I went to Norfolk [Virginia] and I was on a destroyer and got treated like any other enlisted man.  I kept a set of books on the ship 'cause they knew I had an accounting degree, and as I look back it was fun.  Because we went overseas, went to Europe, went to Africa came in Puerto Rico, you know did the world.  So I really liked it, and everybody treated me okay, I didn't have any rank hardly, but I worked in the supply office.  So I didn't bother anybody and nobody bothered me, and, and my officer, the supply officer that I worked under was a southerner.  And I think we just had an understanding, he, he had just graduated from Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] and he told me, I never will forget.  He told me one night just he and I were talking, he said he never worked with a Negro before, and I think I lied to him and told him I'd never worked with a white person before (laughter).  But then I said, "You know I did go to Northwestern and that ain't a black college."  So we laughed about that, and he never bothered me.  I knew what I had to do, I was in charge of certain provisions, I did my job, matter of fact I got a commendation from the Navy department [U.S. Department of the Navy], and he was just pleased with that.  So he never bothered me, I had a, it was a, it was a good relationship.
Speaker 1: Okay so how long were you in the Navy?
Speaker 2: Twenty-three months.
Story_ID: 303878
Speaker 1: Were you ever any--in any big danger in the [U.S.] Navy?
Speaker 2: No, we operated once with the Shah of Iran [Mohammad Reza Shah], that's before they dethroned him or whatever they did, but we were supposed to be operating with their, their navy.  And their Navy was his yacht so it was (laughter) you know a rich man's yacht.  And the only danger, there were three destroyers and we were in the Mediterranean [Mediterranean Sea] and our sister ship one of the gun touareg you know blew up and a couple of guys got killed and injury and whatnot.  And that was because they doubled loaded the shells in the gun, but nothing like that ever happened to us.  You, you had to be careful in those days 'cause it wasn't automatic, you know you put in, put in the shell I think you put in that powder clay and if, but you had to keep your mind on what you were doing 'cause you could easily put in two of everything.
Speaker 1: Okay so it had already been loaded and somebody came around and loaded it again more?
Speaker 2: Yeah and it blew this thing up and these guys got hurt but the other ships nothing happened.  And I don't, I can't remember anything, I mean we were up in an illusion and the water so high.  You know you would think oh my God is this ship going to sink, but no, un-uh.  It was, as I look back it was really an experience that was revealing and part of it was like a vacation on a French Riviera.  And we went to Italy and actually went to Greece went, and then through the Suez Canal and three countries in Africa, and then back to the United States.
Speaker 1: Now what, what was the name of your ship?
Speaker 2: The U.S.S. Barton, B-A-R-T-O-N, DD-722.
Speaker 1: Okay and what rank did you obtain in the Navy?
Speaker 2: Third class bookkeeper, storekeeper, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now that's about as low as you can get, there's only one rank lower than that (laughter) and I never thought about going to Officer Candidate School.  Because I would've had to extend it for four years and I wasn't too happy, I mean you know with.  Not that I was going through very much but I don't think I wanted to do four years.   I might had if I had gone into the [U.S.] Air Force, but I just wanted to do what I had to do and come on out.
Speaker 1: Okay so I take it you came out in '57 [1957], I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '57 [1957].
Story_ID: 303879
Speaker 1: What did you do then, did you go back to your [paternal] uncle's [Arthur Wilson] firm or--?
Speaker 2: I went back to my uncle and I also got a job for the State of Illinois as an auditor.
Speaker 1: Okay now that was the main job I guess right, the State of--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hired by the state.
Speaker 2: Yeah and part-time with my uncle.
Speaker 1: Okay, were you the first black person hired by the State of Illinois as an auditor?
Speaker 2: Oh no, there's a bunch of folks then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they, I'm trying to remember what I did from there, I went, I went to from the auditor of public accounts, that's what that first job was.  Then I went to, to the Commerce Commission [Illinois Commerce Commission] that's what it was.  And they had black people up there working but, but I was the only black auditor.  And they would send me around Cook County [Illinois] and, and the surrounding counties to do, basically water companies you know.  They tried to send me in southern Illinois but that didn't work too well 'cause a lot of people didn't want a black auditor.  And I could remember one time they couldn't even get me a hotel in one of those little small towns you know.  But that was fine with me I'd rather stay around Chicago [Illinois] you know, and I stayed there and then I went to a private company.  That was looking for their first black and they interviewed three of us and I got the job and the company was Capital, no it was called then Bowey's, B-O-W-E-Y-S [sic.], Bowey's chocolate company [Bowery's, Inc.].  And they were owned by; the parent company's name was Capital Food Industries [Capital Food Industries, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: B-O-W-Y (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) B-O-W-E-Y, I'm sorry, I told you S.
Speaker 1: Bowey.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's a candy company?
Speaker 2: They actually processed chocolate from the beans, we get beans from Africa, and they would process the chocolate and it would go into all types of stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they, they were getting most of their beans from Ghana or, or where?
Speaker 2: I don't know which countries, but, but from, from Africa, and then, and then I just moved up in that company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to another company of theirs and I was a comptroller and then I came back and I was assistant to the, to the treasurer of the, of the parent company.  And in the process of doing this, I got my CPA [certified public accountant].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is what, what year, this is about '59 [1959]?
Speaker 2: I got my CPA in 1965.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got forty years, matter of fact I just got a certificate from the American Institute [American Institute of Certified Public Accountants], my forty year certificate, hard for me to believe it.
Story_ID: 303880
Speaker 1: We skipped over your marriage now, we, we gotta go back and--
Speaker 2: Okay I got married in 1960; matter of fact Sunday is my anniversary.
Speaker 1: Okay now where did you meet your wife [Velma Brown Wilson]?
Speaker 2: Let me see, I met her before I went into the [U.S. military] service, matter of fact, and I met her right after Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].  I moved over in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] and she was living over there, and that's how I met her, and we start dating but I went to the service.  And I told her I didn't want to get married and she took, took me at my word (laughter) because while I was in the service she got engaged to another guy (laughter) a friend of mine matter of fact.  But we got married in 1960.
Speaker 1: So I take it that one didn't work out (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, it didn't.
Speaker 1: Fortunately, it didn't work out.
Speaker 2: It didn't, he and I still friends you know.  Matter of fact we were in high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] together, we were on the same basketball team together (laughter) so I knew him long before I knew her, you know.  But she would, she was a school teacher when we got married, she graduated from Teachers College [Chicago Teachers College; Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 303881
Speaker 1: And going back to my employment, I just moved up in this company that I was working with, and I finally wound up being treasurer of the company.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were the treasurer of Bowey's chocolate [Bowery's, Inc.]?
Speaker 1: No Capital Food Industries [Capital Food Industries, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: I'm sorry Capital Food Industries, okay.
Speaker 1: They were, they were a listed company; they were on the American Stock Exchange.
Speaker 2: So when, when did you become the treasurer of Capital--
Speaker 1: Oh boy--
Speaker 2: Food Industries?
Speaker 1: Probably sometimes in the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Might been the late '60s [1960s] I really don't remember and then that was my career until either 1979 or 1980.
Speaker 2: Now how were, how was, how were you treated on the job, we know this is a period of civil rights activity (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay now when I first went with the company I-
Speaker 2: Sixties [1960s] and '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: I was the first black in the administration or as an officer, but then we hired some other black people.  But I was the highest black in the company, and I think I was treated fairly.  Sometimes people would show me that they may not care for me, but nobody ever messed with me, especially when, when I fired a lady and they saw I had the authority to fire somebody.  They backed off all of that.
Speaker 2: Now, now why did you fire this person, is there a story there?
Speaker 1: She misbehaved, and I had to go to my boss, I mean I just didn't go out there and fire, we had to discuss it.  I didn't want to fire the woman; it was my first person I ever fired, that's an interesting experience.  But she misbehaved and started a fight.
Speaker 2: And actual physical fight?
Speaker 1: A physical fight and I had to break it up and I felt sorry but I had to let her go.  And I think she even understood that you know, but her, but her temper got away with her.  And she just had to go, and all my superiors said she had to go, and it dropped on me to fire her you know, but it was friendly.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, well what happened after that now, you, you're treasurer of Capital Food Industries (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay after, after Capital got sold and my job got eliminated and I came out and, and started my practice.
Speaker 2: Okay so when was this job eliminated now?
Speaker 1: Around nineteen, the end of '79 [1979] or early '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so--
Speaker 1: I had been with them nineteen years.
Story_ID: 303882
Speaker 1: We were talking about starting your own business and--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So after nineteen years with--
Speaker 2: With Capital Food [Capital Food Industries, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], I decided I didn't want to work for anybody and I got together with a guy by the name of Thurman Gills [Thurman C. Gill], and we started an accounting firm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you call your firm?
Speaker 2: In 1980 we had an office downtown.
Speaker 1: What did you call it in 1980?
Speaker 2: Wilson and Gills [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, that makes sense.
Speaker 2: I had been doing tax work on the side, even when I was at Capital Food, for some reason another they allowed me to do income tax work.  Or you know like during the tax season, so I had met Thurman when I was at Capital Food.  And then when I came out, we start doing the accounting on a full-time basis.
Speaker 1: Okay, so where was your company located in those days?
Speaker 2: 55 East Jackson Boulevard, I'm west now I believe, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay 55 East Jackson, yeah I know exactly where that is yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So well how did things go is there any good stories about accounting (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well we build it up a little bit, but Thurman always had to travel bug, so I don't know after how many years he decided, he went to Washington then he'd go out to California.  You know he just disappear on me, so after about four or five years, we split up, and I, I got together with a, with another fellow by the name of Greg Kenner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He used to work for [HistoryMaker] Lester McKeever matter of fact.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we moved to 55 East Jackson, two blocks away.
Speaker 1: Okay, 55 West Jackson (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) West Jackson, excuse me, I was on (unclear) and we been down there now I think for twenty-five years or, twenty-five plus years.
Speaker 1: Okay now the name of the firm is?
Speaker 2: Is John E. Wilson Limited [John E. Wilson Ltd., Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And we're about a five, six person firm you know it fluctuates.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we do it everything a small accounting firm can do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We ain't got General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company, Detroit, Michigan] yet, but (laughter) you know what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: What, who are some of your clients?
Speaker 2: Who what?
Speaker 1: Who are some of your clients?
Speaker 2: Well we've done a lot of doctors and, and we do some lawyers and we do dentist and we do a lot of nonprofits.  We have a few commercial things, and we do profit sharings, and pension plans.
Story_ID: 303883
Speaker 1: What have been like the highlights of--?
Speaker 2: What would what?
Speaker 1: What have been the highlights of your business [John E. Wilson, Ltd., Chicago, Illinois] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well watching sometimes just watching some of the young kids that come through us, not necessarily stay with us.  And then looking up one day they have their CPAs [certified public accountant] sometimes they have their law degrees, sometimes they go into business or, or go to big companies.  Just watching them to watching them progress so to speak, that always makes you feel good.  The other highlight is just being able to survive for twenty-five or twenty-six years, that's, that's difficult out in this environment, 'cause it's so competitive.  It's competitive with small firms like me and now this day and age the big firms are reaching down trying to get clients that thirty years ago they wouldn't touch.  So--
Speaker 1: So they're taking like bus, business away from the smaller companies?
Speaker 2: Yes if they can, and of course they push for all of the political business.  Fortunately the political people normally have rules for minorities have to get some of it, but believe you me that the big guys will cut us out if they could.
Speaker 1: So you do get some government (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah I get a little of the county [Cook County, Illinois], I used to get a little of the city [Chicago, Illinois] by right now, I'm not.  And I got some small suburbs that we do work for, municipals I'm talking about.  It's very competitive in terms of getting work.  When I first started off as a CPA forty years ago, there probably more, more than fifteen to twenty black CPAs now everybody I know, now they are not all out here in private practice.  But everybody, I mean--like my daughter [Ginger Wilson]--got their CPAs and can do things, so it's very competitive.
Speaker 1: Okay now one thing you were telling me before we started the interview is that James Hill [HistoryMaker James Hill, Jr.] who--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We interviewed you know brings your firm into teach- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well James Hill firm [Hill, Taylor, LLC, Chicago, Illinois] is qualified by the state to teach continuing educational courses which you must take every year.  You're supposed to get forty hours a year, everybody in, in our firm gets forty hours plus every year.  Hill is, is able to teach some of those courses and what I was saying he's very nice to us.  Because sometimes he invites us over to some of the courses and allows us to take them with his people.
Speaker 1: Oh okay that's how that is.
Speaker 2: And that, and there's collaborations amongst, I do work for example for at times for [HistoryMaker] Lester McKeever, do accounting work for him.  And at times I have done work with Jim Hill and other firms out here.  Right now I do work with Deloitte for example for the county, and so it flops around a little but it has to be some type of cooperation.
Speaker 1: It's an interesting time period you know that we're living in the city, treasurer is a black woman.
Speaker 2: Yes Miss Rice [HistoryMaker Judith C. Rice], I haven't gotten anything from Miss Rice, but most of her stuff would go through the city audit.  Not her individually and I'm sure she's got all types of people like me asking her for stuff (laughing) you know.  She's a CPA too as I remember it.
Speaker 1: I think so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now how did the Harold Washington victory--?
Speaker 2: It was very helpful, before Harold there were a few black CPAs getting work, but after Harold came in, it spread out.  Matter of fact, I went to Harold personally because my wife [Velma Brown Wilson] was part of his administration, that's how I got there and told him that it should be spread out.  And he did what he could to get the big firms that had the big contracts with the city to give up about twenty-five percent of their building to the city to minorities and women.  And that's still in effect right now to a degree.
Story_ID: 303884
Speaker 1: I know your wife, Velma Wilson [Velma Brown Wilson], does a lot of volunteering and she's well known as a volunteer in the community.  Are you--do you volunteer a lot too for organizations, or are you involved in any?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I work a lot and she volunteers a lot and, and like I think Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] said to me once you make the money and she gives it away (laughter).  I don't do a lot of volunteering because you know when I get at home at seven thirty, eight o'clock at night, I'm dead you know.
Speaker 1: And so I count it as intense work I mean you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so my heart's there but there are a few things that I'll do.  I have done some work and, I try to help with, if I have the money, I try to help with the contributions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I believe you all, you should always try to give back, I really believe that, but I can't say that I, that I'm inundated with contributions, I mean with contributing with volunteering, because I needed time to work.  Remember I got a small firm [John E. Wilson, Ltd., Chicago, Illinois], so what I do is a little bit of everything, and you can come in there on Saturday I might be cleaning up you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I just believe that you're supposed to do that but I try to give back as much as I can and with the younger folks, I try to be inspiration to 'em as I can be.  You know, try to tell them, "Don't give up.  Keep on pushing."
Story_ID: 303885
Speaker 1: Just kind of speak for a moment about how important it is to keep track of your money, I guess.  A lot of people, I know not-for-profits especially I mean have a lot of trouble keeping track of the money they bring in and, you know.
Speaker 2: Well what's happening with the government cracking down with new rules and whatnot.  They're finding out they better keep track of their money or they'll lose their funding--
Speaker 1: They used to be a lot looser than it is now.
Speaker 2: A lot of loose?
Speaker 1: It used to be a lot looser, the government regulations (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah but it's tighter and, and what they will do is if you don't adhere to the rules, they will take away your exemption.  And all of a sudden you're not a nonprofit anymore, so we try to tell them that it's absolutely necessary that you have bookkeeping systems.  And systems that, that track what you're doing and you must keep up with this.  And then the other thing that the government makes them do now and it's always been on it, after a certain amount you must have an audit every year.  So to have an audit, you gotta have records, and you gotta have records that, that are auditable, see?  So it's absolutely essential, actually not only in nonprofits but businesses in general.  You better keep up with your money or you won't be there.  It's just that simple, 'cause sometimes you keep up with your money and you find out you shouldn't be there anyway you know.
Speaker 1: Now is there any such thing as an accounting philosophy, we always ask professionals about their professional philosophy but is there such thing as an accounting philosophy, do you have one?
Speaker 2: What in accounting?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: We have one, but I can't repeat it (laughter) so that ain't doing you no good with that question, I'm sorry (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes, sir (laughter).
Speaker 2: I really can't repeat it, but I know we got one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 303886
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Number one, I shouldn't number them like this but, one is that I would love to see black people--now this is commercially--take over their own communities.  I don't mean you got to run people out with sticks and stones, but as I drive through the black community, the mom and pop stores that used to be there fifty years ago that were black aren't there anymore.  I think we have people in our community that don't care about us as black people very much, and we need to have more of our own involved in the commerce that affects us.  Now as I said before, I'm not saying this in a hateful way, but if we have people that don't take care of us, if we have people that take the money out of the community and never put money back into the community to build it, then we need to do things about that.  We need to educate them and that's very easy, you don't buy from 'em.  Until they understand that they got a responsibility for the community where they're making their money.  And black folks are not involved, in my opinion, enough in businesses in their own community.  We're not going to march downtown and take over one of those stores or whatever that commerce is down there.  But we could do things in our community and, and not only do you feel, build a financial base, but you have images for our children to see.  We don't have that, not to the extent that we should, our professionals, they may want to move out.  I understand that, they wanna better life, but we can't forget where we came from.  I mean we have just so many things that negative in our community that, that we need to try to change.  Now I know that's, that can be a dangerous thing, but as I look around the big business in the black community one of them is, is selling dope and stuff.  Well you not gone get rid of it, but I think there can be some changes, and I'm hoping that would happen.  The other thing is that I hope that our kids see the advantage of being educated, that's a passport out of this poverty.  It doesn't always work, but it certainly helps if you go in there with a degree from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or wherever as opposed to saying I dropped out of school at third grade.  Because the way even the, the lower menial jobs are being disbursed right now, there other people that are taking them.  We have trouble getting our people to understand that some of these menial jobs are worthwhile, and that's the only way you gone build the next generation if you don't have anything.  Because the government is getting rid of the stuff, a lot of that giveaway that used to be there, and frankly I think that if some people had their way, it would all go.  It would all go.  I would like to see less of our young men going to prison, I mean if you look at the black woman, she's so far ahead of the black man and some of our best talent is in the penitentiary.  We gotta try to figure out some way of reversing that.  We need also to participate in the political process.  We don't vote in numbers like we should, and I think we should, because that's the great power here.  America is money and politics and maybe not in that order, but very essential the way our country is made up.  And we as black people need to be fully involved in both of those things, I would hope that we would do it in a kind just way, but we need to be involved.  So for an old man as I am now, I'd like to have hopes for my children [Ginger Wilson and Kelly Wilson] and their children and their children.  And I hope that, and I don't wanna leave this country for nothing, this is my country.  I was born here, I want you to bury me over there on 67th Street [Chicago, Illinois], but I want us to be involved in a more gentle and kinder and fair America.  I really want that, if you're talking about what I want.
Story_ID: 303887
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I'd probably get more education, I might would've gone to law school, I might have, I don't know if I'd been in a different business, but I might've been in more businesses.  But really I can't say I'm completely satisfied but I am satisfied in a sense, I think I've tried, I really do.
Story_ID: 303888
Speaker 1: When you look back over everything that you've done in life what would you consider at this moment to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Never even thought of a legacy to be truthful but I'd like for my kids [Ginger Wilson and Kelly Wilson] to think you know you try to help some people including us.  And he was just a decent human being, I don't have to be big and I'll probably won't have very much money when I die, but I would like everybody think back and say, "You know what, Big John [HistoryMaker John E. Wilson] was okay."
Story_ID: 303889
Speaker 1: Tell us once again about your family, you've got two daughters, right and--?
Speaker 2: I have two daughters and a wife, obviously; wife [Velma Brown Wilson] was a school teacher and a variety of things, Harold Washington, helped [HistoryMaker] Carol Moseley Braun.  Worked for all types of businesses for people, looks like to me volunteered for everything and anything.  Trustee at church, the whole bit.  Two daughters both pretty well-educated, one girl, the oldest Ginger [Ginger Wilson] has a master's degree, a CPA [certified public accountant], a law degree.  And has a fine job running the office for a legal personnel type company.  The youngest girl [Kelly Wilson] has a, a master's of business from Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and a master's in education from the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Right now is assistant principal here in Chicago [Illinois] fixing to move but loves to, to work with young kids.  Has had a variety of experience, worked in television with Bill Cosby, worked on another TV show.  And had a variety of cities where she's worked teaching school.  She seems to flop around a lot (laughter) I think she loves to travel, but at, at both the one thing I, I like both of my ladies, young ladies is that at that age where they can take care of themselves.  And as a parent, you want your children to be prepared to take of themselves, and then go out and do it.  And both of my girls do that, and they show respect for their parents.  Sometimes you have kids that don't, but I'm fortunate along those lines.
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Carrie Simpson Wilson] get a chance to see you become successful?
Speaker 2: My mother, yes I, I passed the CPA exam was working, yes because my mother lived till I think she was eighty-seven, and was very active until last maybe last couple of years.  And she was pleased, my sister [Gwendolyn Wilson Rauls] as I said didn't get the education that my mother wanted her to get, she fell in love with a guy and she (laughter) ran off with him you know.  But yeah I think, I think Mama was pleased with the way we turned out, we never gave her any real trouble, and then we never got in, in any real trouble you know.  So I think she was pleased.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything we haven't asked you that that you think we need to address before we ask our last question?
Speaker 2: I think you've been pretty thorough (laughter).
Story_ID: 303890
Speaker 1: What are the civic organizations you were in, in fact you were telling us how some of the challenges of collecting the Boule [Sigma Phi Phi Fraternity] dues as a treasurer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay well the groups I've been in, I'm Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], I'm in the Boule which is a professional corporation, I mean professional fraternity.  I'm in what is known as the Snakes organization [Chicago, Illinois] which is a social club that's about eighty years old.  I'm in The 40 Club [The Original 40 Club, Chicago, Illinois] which is another social organization which is, oh boy, eighty or ninety years old.  I'm a member at Trinity United Church of Christ [Chicago, Illinois]. I'm a member of the Union League Club of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], that's about enough I guess.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: It's some volunteer thing I'm hearing over my shoulder.
Speaker 1: Well these, these organizations do things.  Boule gives away about twelve, fourteen scholarships a year, they give away all the money almost that they make on interest.  You know to, to kids, the Kappa organization here in town gives away twenty, thirty thousand dollars in, in scholarships to kids.  The 40 Club gives scholarships to one or two kids, matter of fact, when I was president of The 40 Club I got that started.  So most of these organizations do some things, even the social ones.
Speaker 2: Okay yeah that's a good thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Sounds to me.
Speaker 1: Well I think they all of these men are fairly successful but they weren't born into it, so when they see some kids struggling they can remember they did too.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: Building Commission?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: The Building Commission?
Speaker 1: Oh that's just one of my jobs, but I am the assistant treasurer of the Public Building Commission of Chicago.  And I get appointed by the mayor every year and I've had this for eighteen years, I work, work for three mayors, Harold Washington, Gene Sawyer [HistoryMaker Eugene Sawyer] and Mayor Daley [Richard M. Daley].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, all right is there anything else here, now we got most of it, It think so.
Speaker 1: I really think that covers it, that's about enough for.
Speaker 2: What does Union League Club do, I never had a chance to ask anybody.
Speaker 1: It's a, it's a social club but they do a lot of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's an old--
Speaker 1: They got two, they, they have two or three units (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Camps, right?
Speaker 1: Camps for, for kids, they have all types of activities.  I was one of the first blacks, well not the first black, I don't mean it that, but I probably was within the first twenty.
Speaker 2: My last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 1: I think like I said before, just a guy that was here on earth, he tried to help, did the best he could and let's have a beer and remember Big John [HistoryMaker John E. Wilson] (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Thank you, okay.
