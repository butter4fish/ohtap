Speaker 1: This is a photo taken on the street that the Bedford-Stuyvesant development corporation [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York] had worked on during my time with them, and this is the head of the block association; that's the man there, and the woman is the owner of the brownstone that we had worked on with great success, using all local labor.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay. Do you recall their names?
Speaker 1: I'd have to--I'd have to pull it out; I--I don't.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay. And of course that's you in the middle.
Speaker 1: That's me in the middle, yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Well, this is a picture of me at age--I'm guessing around four and a half to five, and we lived in a brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York], and this was the backyard of that brownstone, and one of my siblings took the photo of me since I guess I was the youngest of all of the siblings, and I've kept the picture from its inception.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is an organization that I joined in those last days in high school [Franklin K. Lane High School, Brooklyn, New York] because the coaches had gone on strike, and so the basketball teams of the various schools were not able to conduct their normal activity, and so the local YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] put together a team comprised of players from a variety of high schools in Central Brooklyn [New York], particularly Bedford-Stuyvesant. And as you can see, I'm not the tallest one in that photo. There's a guy in the middle who became a professional basketball player. And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Simultaneous) Do you remember his name?
Speaker 1: --and--I'll think of his name in a moment--but you see the rest of our team. This is Sihugo [Sihugo Green], who went on to become an NBA [National Basketball Association] player--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): And where are you?
Speaker 1: --and I'm right here (gesture) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Simultaneous) Oh, you're right next to--
Speaker 1: Next to the tall man.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): All right.
Speaker 1: And so there was no high school basketball, but we played on the Y teams and were undefeated for a year.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a photo of when I'm at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] playing on its basketball team, and we're--I think the opponents are from the Ivy League group that we were a part of, and they happened to get a shot of me doing a dunk over the rim; in those days that was (laughter) not all that common, so it became a photo that was circulated for a long time.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): All right.
Speaker 1: And this is an award that Columbia--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: They took a photo from, from when I was a student at Columbia and was on the basketball team and was captain of that team, and this was the conferring of an, an honor of recognition of that experience.
Speaker 2: This is me at Yale with the former mayor of New York [New York], as I was getting an honorary degree from Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut], and John Lindsay, who is himself part of the Yale establishment, escorted me down the aisle for the receipt of the award.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's me giving an embrace to our then national leader. You see the back of my head, which is--and that's--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that's our president.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): In the White House [Washington, D.C.], or--
Speaker 2: No, this is on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is me with my idol, Nelson Mandela, and when he was released from prison, he came to New York and we met for the first time and then became very close friends during the balance of his time, and I still do work for the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund. We just built a hospital for them in South Africa.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Well, this is another picture of Nelson Mandela obviously after his release from prison. He is--has been elected, and I remain part of a group that periodically went to South Africa to see how we could be helpful, and you see Cy Vance [Cyrus Vance] and several others in that photo.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay. So, you're on the far right; which one's Cy Vance?
Speaker 1: This is--Cy Vance is right here (gesture). Whose son [Cyrus Vance, Jr.] is now the district attorney for New York, and we would go back and forth to South Africa just to be as helpful as possible during this extraordinary transition that took place in that country.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 1: This is later in Mandela's life; we're at--my wife and I are visiting him in South Africa and we're sitting in his office and he said, "Let's take a photo." And that's the photo that we took.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): This is a companion photo to the earlier one.
Speaker 1: Yes. There's our beloved former president of the United States, and I should perhaps say that I, I knew his mother [Ann Dunham], who I hired when I was at the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], and she worked out of our office in Indonesia, but I hadn't met the president until much later.
Speaker 2: That's an interesting story.
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: That's a wonderful story.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, I know; it's a--
Speaker 2: That's a recent Columbia award designation if you can see. I think there's another shot of it. Apparently my--some of my basketball records from the time I was at Columbia remain, so they haven't been broken.
Speaker 1: Right. Which is amazing.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): All right; back to our president.
Speaker 1: There we are. And that's my wife, Kate, who--the two of them became great friends, and Kate is the granddaughter of FDR [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], and a long history in political life, and a wonderful human being.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Does Kate share the last name, or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, she--she uses Kate Whitney--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 1: --that's her stepfather's name [John Hay Whitney].
Speaker 2: And that's the president (laughter) and me in another embrace (laughter). But I remember saying to him at one point that, "Mr. President, you and I have talked about a number of things, but I never mentioned to you that your mother and I had worked together." He said, "I know all about it; I know all about it" (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah. Here we are shaking hands and--two ex-basketball jocks talking to each other (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's my wife Kate. I guess her full name is Kate Roosevelt Whitney.
Story_ID: 640661
Speaker 1: My three older sisters with you know who [Hillary Rodham Clinton]. This is an annual program at the Roosevelt center [Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, Hyde Park, New York], and an award was being provided to--
Speaker 2: Now, what year was that?
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say--I'd have to check outside, but I'm guessing it's about ten years ago.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Can you name them left to right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's Elsie, that's Audrey [Audrey Thomas], and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Simultaneous) And what are their last names?
Speaker 2: --deceased, Elsie--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): But their last names?
Speaker 2: Elsie Jefferson [Elsie Thomas], Elsie Jefferson.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 2: Audrey--she got married again, so it was--I have to think of her last name then. And Hazel Jones [Hazel Thomas] on the end. And in order of age, oldest, next, next.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 2: And sadly, all have passed on.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a, a recent photo, maybe three years old, in South Africa. This is at the Constitutional Court [Constitutional Court of South Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa], and these are young South African lawyers who have been clerks in the court, and the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] established a program for those lawyers from South Africa who wanted to get further degrees in the U.S., and they named it in my name, and so I was there meeting with this group, who are all beyond their years as clerks and are now either in their further education, or have completed that, and are practitioners in South Africa--all folk--and it's a, it's a wonderful photo, and it just--you see--
Speaker 2: So all of them are--they came out of that program (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The program, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's won- over what period of time?
Speaker 1: Oh, that's now about--since I'd left Ford, so I don't know what that is now--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Fifteen, twenty years, I guess, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. This is a beautiful picture.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Where are you on that?
Speaker 1: This is, this is--here I am, right up top, the tall kid.
Speaker 2: Right here?
Speaker 1: Right in the middle. Yeah. This is my elementary school class [sic. J.H.S. 33, Mark Hopkins Junior High School, Brooklyn, New York], ninth grade. And in those days they had what they called a rapid advance program, so you--you skipped a grade along the way. The consequence of that is that we all end up graduating kind of midyear because we had completed our, our time, and it's kind of a--fascinating. This (gesture) is, is our teacher; this (gesture) was one of her children, who was a student (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Simultaneous) Do you remember the teacher's name?
Speaker 1: Oh, I'll have to dig it up.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I do, yeah. What this is--the family is still around, and, and here we are (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what was the eth- were--was there an ethnic makeup of the whites in the class?
Speaker 2: No--you know it, it's--looking back on it, when I put it against all of the comp- all of the difficulties we're having in integrating schools and access to good public education--
Speaker 1: Look at that.
Speaker 2: --we had that.
Speaker 1: That's what is shocking; that's why I was (unclear)--
Speaker 2: We had it, you know? And it (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) When I was putting--
Speaker 2: You know?
Speaker 1: No (laughter), because when I was looking and, and there're a lot of--their affect--their--you know, it's interesting bec- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's so diversified, too; look at it.
Speaker 1: Yeah. There're more black males though, than white females in this picture.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Speaker 2: This is a international scholar-athlete award program [International Scholar-Athlete Hall of Fame] that I got nominated for maybe ten years ago [sic. 2003], I guess it was, and this is the certificate they, they give you for that. And they, they track athletes who go on to have a--some international life that is of significance as far as they're concerned--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and that's why they call it the international hall of fame scholar-athletes.
Story_ID: 640662
Speaker 1: We're gonna slate it, so I need to have you state and spell your name--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) first, and give your date of birth.
Speaker 2: Franklin Thomas [HistoryMaker Franklin A. Thomas], 5/27/34, May 27th, 1934.
Speaker 1: But you have a middle name.
Speaker 2: Franklin Augustus Thomas [sic.].
Speaker 1: Can you spell everything?
Speaker 2: F-R-A-N-K-L-I-N, A-G-U (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A-U--is it A-U?
Speaker 2: A-U-S-T--I think--I, I have to look it up now. I don't use it very much--
Speaker 1: I-N-E?
Speaker 2: Augustus.
Speaker 1: Agus- is it Augustine?
Speaker 2: Augustus.
Speaker 1: It's Augustus!
Speaker 2: Augustine, I-N-E at the end (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I-N-E.
Speaker 2: That's the end.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's correct. Thomas, T-H-O-M-A-S.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you're not a--you're not a fan of that middle name, are you?
Speaker 2: I don't use it, you know?
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: Because it--the initials become F.A.T. (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So I didn't grow up using the middle name (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That was cute. Okay (laughter). And your--and your date of birth (laughter). I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: May 27th, 1934.
Speaker 1: Okay. And today's date? It's April twenty--what is the day? Do you know the date?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): I believe it's the 26th.
Speaker 1: Twenty-six, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Twenty-sixth, April 26th, 2017. And our location?
Speaker 1: Is my office at 320 East 34th Street.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: New York, New York.
Story_ID: 640663
Speaker 1: I wanna have you start out by--I just ask five People magazine-ish questions, just short answers, and if you don't like the questions (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --just go by. But I'd like to have--to have your favorite food.
Speaker 2: I guess chicken and rice.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I guess summer and fall.
Speaker 1: Okay. Oh, that's interest- summer and fall; that's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Probably blue.
Speaker 1: Favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: Now I'd say Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts], but before that--probably the Vineyard; I'll stick with the Vineyard (laughter).
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: What's my favorite saying? I always begin with, "How are you?"
Story_ID: 640664
Speaker 1: So, I want to start out by having you talk about--give your father's name, and what you know of his background and we'll, we'll take it there.
Speaker 2: I don't know a lot about him; he was born in Antigua--
Speaker 1: His name first.
Speaker 2: It's (pause)--
Speaker 1: James [James Thomas].
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I'm trying to think of what his--yeah, I guess it was James. He was part of the group that left Antigua to help dig the Panama Canal, so he comes to the states through that channel, and he and my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] meet--I think it's in Boston [Massachusetts] where they first meet, and then come to New York [New York]. My mother came from Barbados, and came when she was, I'm guessing, around fifteen years old, pretty young. And was a beautiful woman, I have some wonderful photos of her someplace, who did housework for people who needed help in keeping their property, and so she ended up befriending a number of people for whom she did work, and then when the war [World War II, WWII] came and the--they opened opportunities for women, she went to night school and became a lathe operator, and went to work for American Can Company, and then when the war ended, they fired all the women and she went back to doing household work and--very independent, beautiful to look at, strong. I can remember--which isn't your question, but I'm just thinking about my mother. I can remember my early days in elementary school [P.S. 44, Marcus Garvey Elementary School, Brooklyn, New York], and I was in a class and the teacher would walk up and down the aisle and I was doing something I guess I wasn't supposed to be doing, and she whacked my hand, and so when I went home I mentioned it to my mother, and she said, "Did anyone else's hand get whacked?" And I said, "Well," (laughter), "probably." "What were you doing or not doing when it happened?" She wanted to know. And I said, "Well, you know," by the time I finished with the answer, she said, "Well, if it happens again, let me know. But you're there to learn and she's there to teach, and let's just keep the relationship that way." That was her approach to, to things, and it left you--it left me, as the youngest of the children, with an awareness that there were expectations of me, that I could be protected if I needed protection, but there wasn't an automatic protection; it was first find out the facts, and that's something I think she instilled probably in all of us.
Story_ID: 640665
Speaker 1: But then I had the older sisters who said, "Well, why don't you--you, you can be a doctor, you can be a doctor; you just have to--." And I said, "I don't like blood." And they said, "Well, that's all right; you can still be a doctor." I said, "No, I can't be a doctor; you gotta at least be neutral as to blood," (laughter), "if you wanna be a doctor." But they were super high achievers academically--all three of my sisters, and--
Speaker 2: So there--are there three sisters and you? I mean--
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) what about the siblings? Can you give me your siblings' name and--
Speaker 1: Yeah. There's a--I have an older brother who died at--he was twenty-seven when he died of pneumonia.
Speaker 2: And he was the oldest.
Speaker 1: He was the oldest.
Speaker 2: And his name?
Speaker 1: And his name was Cecil [Cecil Thomas (ph.)]. And it's followed by--Audrey [Audrey Thomas] is next in line; she's also deceased now; and then Hazel [Hazel Thomas], also deceased; and Elsie [Elsie Thomas] was the youngest of them, and then there was a short gap, and Viola [Viola Thomas] is the--the actual youngest of all, and she died--Viola died very early; she was--I'm not exactly sure what the ailment was, but from a pretty early stage she had been on again, off again health wise, had become a nurse's aide in the public hospital system, and married, had a couple of children, and died pretty young. I mean she was maybe sixty-seven when she died, and she was a--my brother died first, at twenty-three, with pneumonia, and I was just a toddler at that point, and all I knew about death was that I saw my mother and siblings crying, and so that told me there was something bad about all of that. My mother and father [James Thomas] separated about that time, and I never really knew him well. I would go and visit with--along with one or two of my sisters.
Speaker 2: Your father?
Speaker 1: Yeah, because he was--had--was not living with us, and he was a, a very determined--I think very decent man, a kind of--no match for my mother who was the dynamo in the family. And I never heard them argue or, or be disdainful in my presence of each other, but they obviously separated. And then he had a stroke and took ill, and--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --my mother had him come back to our house, and he stayed there until he died.
Speaker 2: So she took care of him.
Speaker 1: She took care of him, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, what is the age difference between the oldest and--and so you weren't the youngest.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You were next to the youngest of--
Speaker 1: No, I am the youngest.
Speaker 2: You are the youngest, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --was Viola--
Speaker 1: She's the next one up the line.
Speaker 2: She's the next one up the line, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right. And then, then it goes up from there to Audrey.
Speaker 2: You know--and what is, what is interesting is that she was named after your mother who was also Viola [Viola Atherly Thomas], right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
Story_ID: 640666
Speaker 1: But a great growing up; I mean everything was--you wouldn't have been aware that we were poor, in the financial sense, because it was church on Sundays, it was storytelling, it was listening to FDR [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] on the radio when he spoke, you know; we all gathered around for that. The living room had two pictures, FDR and the queen of England. And so there was that history with Barbados and its connection to the Brits, and that's how we grew up. And then it was always about making connections with people who had--what my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] would call decent people, that, that was her comment, and what to avoid. And, you know, it was--it was tough in the streets because, as a kid, I wanted to join the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] because I had witnessed a parade with the scouts marching, and the drums and bugles playing, and all the rest of it, and so I talked to my, my mother and said I--I was just eleven or ten, just eleven, and Gardner Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor] hadn't--wasn't then the minister of the--of Concord Baptist Church [Brooklyn, New York], but he would later become the minister. But the Boy Scout troop was located there, so I--and the question was how do I get from where we live to where the Boy Scout troop is, and that's--street gangs all--you know, pretty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All over the place.
Speaker 1: All over the place. So (laughter) I said--I guess to my mother or my sister, "I have to get a bike," because it's the one way I know that I can circle around the more difficult parts of the area between where we lived and where Concord was, and so one of 'em, I think my oldest sister [Audrey Thomas], ended up getting me a bike, and I would ride to get to where I had to go. And I loved the marching bands; that's a great attraction, and Concord Boy Scout troop had a marching band, and Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] and I are in there at the same time; we're both at Concord at the Boy Scouts, and so I figure I've gotta learn to play the drum or the bugle. So, anyway, I learned to play the bugle, and end up marching with them in one of their early parades in, in Brooklyn [New York], and you know, you, you--I don't know if you've ever (laughter) tried playing a bugle. Until you really know how to play it well, by the time you finish, your lips are swollen because you're pressing against your lips all the time as you're playing the, the music and--but I loved it, and so I would practice that and practice the drums, which I thought were really exciting, and if I tell you that by--I guess I joined the Boy Scouts at eleven, twelve so by the time I'm fifteen, I'm still in the scouts, and by now I'm leading the drum and bugle corps. We have both boys and girls; the girls had a, a program at Concord as well, and the--I don't know if this is of any interest to you, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it is--it is.
Speaker 1: One of the things that happened with the marching bands on the holidays was that you really tried to outdo each other, so your group of however many you had, and then you would come in contact with another group that's also scouts playing music, or other groups playing music, and at our peak, our drum and bugle corps had just under a hundred people in it, and by--towards the end of my time there, I was giving all the signals to the group on when we changed pieces and the like, and it was--and when you came across a competitor group, the challenge was to drown out the others. I mean that's how (laughter), that was the way it worked, so there was both the joy and the beauty of it, and there was also the competition, and I think those of us who are still alive would remember it like it was yesterday, you know?
Story_ID: 640667
Speaker 1: --Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] and the rest, but it was an important time, I think, in--at least my own life, because in order to become sufficiently good at either the drums or the bugle, it took a lot of--
Speaker 2: Work.
Speaker 1: --work and practice, and you did most of that at home, and then you went to the meetings and were further enhanced and--but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now were the meeting--were the meeting--
Speaker 1: --at Concord [Concord Baptist Church, Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 2: So, were they during the week, or were they on the weekends?
Speaker 1: They were both, they were both.
Speaker 2: They were both?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, so, can you tell me--do you remember the address of where you lived?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can pull 'em up; I don't keep it, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay; that's okay. Do you know what street maybe?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was on--when I joined the Boy Scouts--I'm trying to remember was it on Halsey Street, or that's--no. The early days before--this was before I joined the Boy Scouts, we're on--I'll have to look it up again--what the street is--because I remember it because there was a--there was a shop at the corner of our street, and it was a drugstore, but it also had other things you get, and I liked to go from our house to the store, the store, and getting an ice cream cone from them. Little did I know my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] was paying for all of that and they knew it, but I just thought it was free--they would just--they'd give it to me. And (laughter) there was a point at which I become aware of this--of what I thought of as this mass of people coming down the same street that I'm gonna go down, and what it was was that the Boys High School [Boys and Girls High School, Brooklyn, New York] was letting out its students, so you had what, to me, were giants coming down the street and I'm gonna go into that in the opposite direction in order to get to my corner store for my free ice cream. Well, it wasn't free I later learned (laughter); my mother had worked that out with--with the people who owned the store and--but to me life was--my sisters were great though, and I went through a period when I, for some reason, wasn't sleeping well, and one or another of them would head up and we would go out, and the trolley car ran down the street at the end of our block, and I would ride with her on the trolley car down to the end, which was Prospect Park [Brooklyn, New York], and then come back and then I was fine. Never understood anything except that if you needed help and assistance, there was always someone there to provide it; that's how the household was, was run. We always had a--if my mother rented--we didn't own much at that time, but she would rent these--a house, and then would sublet a portion to someone who would pay part of the rent, and I remember the--being assigned to--if there's gonna be a delivery of fuel or coal or--to go upstairs and look out to see that all of the coal that had been in the chute had been delivered to the house because you were paying for all of it so you wanted to be sure all of it was there. So you, you--I grew up with all these little and not so little events that both inspire you to do your best at whatever it is you're, you're doing and to take responsibility, and that's how the household ran.
Story_ID: 640668
Speaker 1: Can you take me back to that time and tell me what sights, smells and sounds, you know, remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, anytime I hear a marching band I--my, my ears (laughter) go, go up, although they're now so sophisticated with their instruments and the like it's not quite the same way it was. But it was, it was a big deal, and you--we would be invited to perform at different events. We'd come into Manhattan [New York] and play at a theater that was just opening up in one way or another. I don't know who arranged all this stuff, but that's what we did, and it was, it was a bond, I think, among all of us who grew up with that exposure--a bond that lasted. I mean Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] remained active in the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] through all of his life. I mean he's--not that he's deceased now, but he's less functional now.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: But he became very active in the scouts and I think--I haven't talked to him recently, but if he were able, he would really underscore pretty much everything that I am sharing with you. So we would--we were friends--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and--
Speaker 1: He talked about that in his interview.
Speaker 2: Did he (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, the Boy Scouts and the, the--right--integrating the, the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], I think the pool, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: I mean he talked about that, right. So--but it's interesting. So let's go to smells and sounds--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and then I wanna come back to that, but what smells? Do you--do smell--do any smells remind you of growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think food smells--particular food smells are very satisfying to me, and I think it's partly that--you know, we had a household that gathered for the evening meal I'll call it, and it was only when my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] went to work at American Can Company as a machine operator, and she was away during the hours of--the normal meal hours--and then it would be left to be warmed up or whatever in--before you consumed it, but it was always--she was a good storyteller, too, for the family, and she would tell--depending on the time of day and who's there, she would sometimes tell stories that would, you know, send chills up your spine because she had the stories about something in Barbados or some other part of the world, and she sang out, and we, we didn't go to Concord [Concord Baptist Church, Brooklyn, New York] as our church; I went there as a scout. Our church was African American. I've forgotten what its full title was now, it's been so long.
Speaker 1: Was it a Episcopal church, or was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Episcopal, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were--so you were, 'cause I was--'cause you're Bajan, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 640669
Speaker 1: And you, you just--you lived in a, in a world that was both threatening and nurturing at this same time, and I remember my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] telling me, particularly when I started going out to the Boy Scout [Boy Scouts of America] meetings and the like, that her view was that the police were your friend; you had to think of them that way if you wanted help and assistance. If you thought of them as the enemy, then you're gonna bring forth from them behavior that is gonna be--this is, you know, her philosophy; she's--and--you know, so the precinct that was not too far from where we lived, and I think the fact that you were on your bike most of the time and not part of one of the gangs, that had both a plus and a minus to it as if you were part of a gang, you got the protection of the gang when you're in its presence; if you're not a member, you gotta find your way around the turf that they occupied, and that's when it became apparent that if you needed help and assistance, you might be able to get it from a police officer, which was not the common view at the time, but that was her view of things, and I think I internalized it, and it helped that I was pretty physically fit as a kid, and a pretty good runner, and had to run more than once to not be run down by the group--whatever group it happened to be.
Speaker 2: So, so the gangs in that time period, what--do you remember any of their names, and are they, you know, clubs? I mean what--how did they manifest their--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they, they had--they took--they had turf areas that they occupied as theirs, so the Beavers had this, another group had that, a third group had something else. There's a very interesting book that I--just reading by a guy who's devoted an enormous amount of time to looking at the history of Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York], and it's, it's out of the Harvard Press [Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and I'm just reading it as--now, and he's got in it about as thorough a look at the, the gang situation as it existed in, in Brooklyn [New York] generally, but in the Bedford-Stuyvesant at large area, and he walks you through that process and also the politics of what was happening during that period, and he brings it all the way forward to--really virtually to today, including the work that I got involved with in Bedford-Stuyvesant. I end up--I go to college, the draft comes up--you either go into the [U.S.] military then, or you can finish your college education, and then you have to go into the military. In the interim you do--you make a selection as to which branch you want, so I chose the [U.S.] Air Force, and so when I completed my time at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], I went right into the military.
Story_ID: 640670
Speaker 1: I wanna take you back, though, to the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 1: So, so you were talking about the gangs and, you know, and that being a ver- what you're talking about is that was a very prevalent existence.
Speaker 2: It was tough, it was tough.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. And--now are these black gangs, white gangs, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Predominantly black, although there were white gangs and black gangs, and Hispanic gangs, and you name it; they were kind of all over the place, and this book covers some of that pretty well. But the other thing that happened, as you get a little older and a little bigger and a little stronger, and if you're an athlete and you're--in my case basketball, you're playing basketball in the various playgrounds were the people assembled, and you gradually build up a relationship with people, some of whom may be gang members or, or not, but I'm--you're dealing with them in their basketball capacity. I think that helped a lot in terms of having someone who would recognize you and in a sense, you know, restrain what otherwise might have been the reaction to a quote stranger in their neighborhood [in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York]. So the, the combination of the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] whose music people liked to hear, and it didn't align with any one outfit or another; it was music being played by these drum and bugle corps and, and appreciated by people of whatever their backgrounds were; you liked the music, you liked seeing the marching. And, and then once they--as they integrated that into male, female--so you--we ended up with a corps of, I don't know, I'm gonna guess and say a hundred people. I mean that's a giant--and giving the signals to that whole group as you're turning to let them know that you're changing the piece that's upcoming. So there was, there was interest in all of that that, I think, belied the turf issue somewhat. People could appreciate the music, they loved the competition as the bands would cross each other and trying--each trying to drown out the other by the force of what you're playing, and so it was a rich experience. And the, the churches were helpful in that most of the Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops [Girls Scouts of the United States of America] were affiliated with one or another of the churches, so you had--I don't know how it got organized in the way it did, but you had a reasonably well organized effort, and then the PAL came into the picture, the Police Athletic League, and they, they set up their own drum and bugle corps with much fancier equipment than we had; I remember that and thinking, well, they're gonna take over all of this. But it was a--you were learning all the time, even though you weren't conscious of the fact that you're, you're learning lessons about life, lessons about human behavior, that there was no shame in running if you needed to run in order to avoid something worse, and you also--you--if you were a good athlete, you kind of got recognized for, for that, and--I won't say you were protected, but you were not victimized; I'll put it that way.
Story_ID: 640671
Speaker 1: What age are the gang--did the gangs become a reality? You know, that, that outside world comes in--what, what age are you at that point? Are you in jun- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it starts--
Speaker 1: Elementary or jun- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) pretty early; it starts--you're, you're still elementary school [P.S. 44, Marcus Garvey Elementary School, Brooklyn, New York] when you're aware of it, and--which, I think, was one reason my older brother [Cecil Thomas (ph.)] was assigned to walking me to school, you know. I had to jog to keep up with him, but--'cause he was a very fast walker and--but that was, I think, influenced by this, you know, uncertainty about the--some neighborhoods and places you had to walk through and the like.
Speaker 1: And your mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] talked about the good peo- was it good people that she said? What--decent, decent people (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Decent people, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So who were the people who were not decent?
Speaker 2: In her definition it would have been the people who get drunk on the streets and are loud, and abuse other people; those are the ones you had to watch out for. But she was a--she was a dynamo herself, you know, and when she worked for other people, which she did for a large part of her life, I mean she didn't just go to work and do what had to be done and, and leave; I mean these people became--it's hard to say they became friends, but basically that's what it became. They treated her with great respect and, and their children became known to her children, you know, so that my sisters were in touch with some of them, and it was a--it was a strange time because I can't label it as one thing alone; it was a composite of both threats and protection, indifference to education and insistence upon education.
Speaker 1: But inside the house, there's insistence on education (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay. But outside the house there was maybe indifference to edu- in some place--right.
Speaker 2: Well, it was difficult to know because my early experience with my mother putting on a, a down payment on a house and, and then I don't know enough at that point to know how the system works; I, I may have been nine or ten, or some age in that range. And what I knew was that she didn't get the house and she didn't get her deposit back and, and that was a terrible lesson. I think it's part of what ultimately made me think that I needed to know the law because it was the best way to be able to protect people from being abused, and to protect yourself, too, but principally about being able to protect others and--
Speaker 1: That, that must have been devastating at that point. Now, you father [James Thomas], was he still alive? Do you remem- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he's, he's now deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he, he deceased, I think, when you were age eleven; that's what I have.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: So, so you were a little, you know, older, but she's trying to pur- because that's a big thing to purchase a house.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 640672
Speaker 1: And (laughter) even when she rented a house, almost without exception, she would sublet a room in that house to someone else.
Speaker 2: Did you call them boarders? Did you--or how did--what did you refer--I was just--I just wondered (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, they--it's a good label. I guess, I guess boarders is the right word, yeah, because they, they had to--they had to pass her test for decency. I can remember--now, this is a little digression but I can remember in one situation, a husband and wife team on the second floor of the brownstone, and there's obviously an altercation going on between the two, and we hear it, and my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] goes up and so I go behind her and I'm maybe twelve or thirteen at that point--not, not older than that. And it turns out one of the--either the husband or the wife, has a knife, and so my mother goes--knocks on the door and opens the door, and I go to go in with her and she doesn't let me go in; she closes the door, and she gets it resolved inside. Now, I did not like being on the outside of that, but she--that was her; she was gonna deal with it, and the first thing she did was to get the knife away from the person who had the knife, and--because they not only lived in the same house but, you know, they could use the kitchen down--that was the way it was set up, and there was a bathroom on that floor and they could use the kitchen where we ate, they were welcome there; they could cook their own meals at a different time from ours. So I grew up with her example. I can't say she was fearless, but she behaved as though she was fearless and, and always seemed to come out on top.
Story_ID: 640673
Speaker 1: Did you have grandparents around?
Speaker 2: No, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So she--so where was, where was, where was that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Some were still in Barbados. An uncle, who was her brother, and, and one other, came to the states and lived not too far from us; that's the uncle, Ben [ph.], as he was called, who was an incredible guy. He was a jack of all trades, played the organ, could sing, always had a tough dog in his house, you know, and he was also a, a carpenter and a, a jack of all trades, and I would work for him on different projects that he had, and he would, from time to time, ask me to go and walk his dog which, you know, was about as challenging a assignment (laughter) as you could ask for because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What kind of dog? A Doberman [Doberman Pinscher]--like a Doberman?
Speaker 2: It wasn't that big as a Doberman, but it was fierce like a Doberman and, you know--quick to snap the, the neck at you. But I had to go, I had to do it, so I did. But he always remained a, a, a force of, of decency and hard work, and no physical task was beyond his ability to do it. When we would go--on Saturdays I would go to his house, and we would go to the movies, his--he, his wife and I would go--and sometimes my sister--one of my sisters would go. But he'd talk to the movie. "Look out! Look out!" He said, "He's coming, go!" And then you--so you'd (laughter), and this (laughter). It was, it was alive, it was active, it was right there at you, you know (laughter). Oh, god, you're pushing out a lot of memories here.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's great.
Speaker 2: You know?
Story_ID: 640674
Speaker 1: What was family life like? That's what I wanna know--in the house. You're talking about the boarders but you're--are you assigned chores? Are you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what are you like as a young boy, too?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd say I--Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] turned out to be a big part of that early life. I'm a pretty good athlete on the street, so it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Basketball, mainly?
Speaker 2: Well, it's basketball, but that's not the--the first one is a--kind of roller skating--hockey on skates that we played, and did a lot of that and a lot of bike riding. And we were playing hockey and--against another team, and one of the players, you know, put his stick out and--to trip you up on your skates, and I ruptured a finger on my hand, and so anyway, I had to go get it set, get it fixed, and while I was waiting to get my thumb addressed, I learned the next day, from some of the guys, that my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] had gone back to where the skating match was going on, wanting to know who it was (laughter). I don't think she ever found out but, you know, that, that was her; that was her personality and, you know, what can I say? It, it was an encouragement for independence on the one hand, and a respect for others who had something to offer, and disdain for people, I think, who did not step up and do what was--she felt was appropriate in their own family settings, what have you.
Speaker 1: And was there any difference spoken about people who were of Caribbean descent and people who were, you know, native African Americans? Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] talked about that in his family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that, that was--I, I--it's hard to get the right words because it was never said with meanness, but it was disdainful of people who didn't take care of themselves or take care of their family, or take care of their property, you know. It was this--and who were quick to use knives instead of either discussion or arguing, or even fist fighting. But to get knives out was always a sign of weakness to her, and people you didn't wanna spend any time with. I mean she was--oh, Earl would know all of this the same way because we were--we were in it at roughly similar ages, too, if I'm not mistaken. Big expectations that--you go to school to learn; you don't go to school for any other reason than to learn--that's why you're there, and if there's a problem, she first wanted to know the nature of the problem and, you know; if it was just something that you didn't like, for whatever reason, I mean that wasn't adequate. You're there to learn and, you know, if there's a need to intervene, she would--was more than ready to intervene, but it wasn't a quick response to your claim that something wasn't done fairly.
Story_ID: 640675
Speaker 1: And I would say--not, not to digress, but I would say that I really experienced that throughout school; I mean both in the early years at junior high school and the like. And I, I didn't really encounter, I guess, racial separation to the degree that it was happening around--I didn't experience it in that same degree, in part because the--like with the junior high school situation, they knew you wanted to learn, and they were there doing their best to facilitate that, and our graduating class, a picture of which you have here--
Speaker 2: That's at Mark Hop- Mark Hopkins Junior High (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Mark Hopkins Junior High School [J.H.S. 33, Mark Hopkins Junior High School, Brooklyn, New York], yeah. That's about as diverse a group; as you could ever imagine, and the teacher in charge is African American and her daughter is there in the front row along with us, and that--but there are probably an equal number of Caucasians as there are to people of African descent as there are to Hispanics, and we're all in this rapid advance program, and if I tell you that one of the--
Speaker 2: And that's the 19--the late nine- that's like the late 1940s that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's--one of the girls in the picture--ooh, and I can't now pinpoint exactly which one it was, tracked me down; she and her husband tracked down where I--went to the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], but by then I'd left Ford, and left a note for me at Ford, which Ford then sent to me, and describing in her note how she remembered my protecting her at junior high school. And so I called her, and when I--and she told me which one she was in the photo; I don't now remember it, but she said--I was captain of the guard category in junior high school, had a badge, had all that--was in charge of the--keeping order, I guess, and she was being abused by a couple of other people, and abused in the sense of taking her coat, or doing--I've forgotten exactly what the details were. And she had come to me and I had gotten that straightened out. She remembered that there was a guy playing ball in the hallway during break time, and he had a knife, and so people were afraid of him. And I had a badge because I was the captain of the guard, and so I go over to him to get him to behave and, and he wields the knife at me and actually gets my hand--my--this (gesture), I still have a bit of it. And, of course, when the blood comes out, then he's in a mini-panic 'cause I don't think he really intended to kill anybody; he was just dopey. And one of the teachers who was a--I've forgotten what his discipline was, but he came out and I got this bandaged and all that, and of course the poor guy--I mean I say poor guy because he didn't know what I was gonna do in response (laughter), and we ended up sorting it, bringing him in to the teacher in question, asking why he did what he did, da-da-da, and then he was apologizing and all the rest of it, and by then I had my hand bandaged. But it was a--that was the only incident I remember, and I dealt with a lot of disgruntlement and difficulty in the schoolyard at, at our junior high school. And the teachers were great, administrators were, were great, and, you know, we all left feeling that we'd had a pretty good education.
Story_ID: 640676
Speaker 1: So, tell me about your schools.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, you start out at--
Speaker 2: At 44, which is--
Speaker 1: P.S. 44 [Marcus Garvey Elementary School, Brooklyn, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, predominantly African American though not a, not a 100 percent, but probably 90 percent. And I'm there for about four years I think it is, and just as a mini-digression, Wynton Kelly went to the same school. He would play--he played the piano for assembly in (laughter), in those early days. Little did we know he was gonna become a superstar and then get sadly hooked on drugs and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but anyway, he was--even when he was playing as a, as a jazz pianist, he would come back to the church whenever he was in the city [New York, New York], and would play the organ at the church. But anyway, that's a little digression, but that was the first school. And then my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas]--we relocated, and I went to another school for the first time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You relocated to where?
Speaker 2: To a, a different house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We went to Green Avenue, I think it was. And that school was, I think, somewhat better organized, and the class they put me in was a class of students who had been together for at least two years prior to my joining them, and they--each student had his or her own--I won't even call it a notebook; it's larger than a notebook which is a whole lesson plan process, and all that had been worked out. I obviously didn't have that, coming from a, a different school, and I think initially the--and I could almost understand it--the teacher was, you know, kind of, "Why am I getting this kid who's--I haven't had a chance to work with up to now?" And, you know, "Where is he gonna go?" And students were fine, although they were a little cliquey, and I think it was more Caucasian there than people of color, but that didn't get in the way for very long, and academically I was okay, but I didn't know the systems that she had in place. Any event, we finally get to a point where I think she accepts that I'm there to learn, and then it shifts from a kind of "Woe is me. Now I've got this new person who isn't gonna understand our system," et cetera, et cetera. And we end up having a pretty good rest of that first year, and then the second year is fine; I'm, I'm okay with her systems. But by then it's a matter of selecting which junior high school you're gonna go to, and that's where I get hooked up with the school that we were talking about earlier.
Speaker 1: Mark Hopkins (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mark Hopkins Junior High [J.H.S. 33, Mark Hopkins Junior High School, Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And everything blossoms there; I mean it just--
Speaker 1: Academically.
Speaker 2: Academically and, and socially, too. I mean I, I ended up competing for a role in 'The Pirates of Penzance' [Arthur Sullivan and W.S. Gilbert], and all of that, and my voice turns out not to be as great as someone else's voice who was (laughter) competing for the same position so I, I don't get it (laughter). But I'm in the play anyway and, and then the drumming--they have a, a corps--you know, a band for the college [sic.], and so I played the drums there at that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wait a minute--at Mark Hopkins, or--
Speaker 2: Mark Hopkins Junior High, yeah.
Speaker 1: So they had a drum and bugle corps, too?
Speaker 2: Yeah--well, it wasn't drum and bugle--
Speaker 1: A band, band.
Speaker 2: --but it was a band that, that played and--in fact, the--they wrote a song for the junior high school while I was there. (Singing) "Mark Hopkins Junior High, see the colors fly to--see the hue, da-da-da, you'll be true. All hail, hail to the school we love, Mark Hopkins Junior High. See the colors fly, to your hue, bright and blue, you will be true, (humming) of the reign, I do remain, da-da-da-da-da-da, we'll give it our all." All alive, and healthy, and happy, and relaxed.
Story_ID: 640677
Speaker 1: And then it--you go to high school; which high school you gonna go to? So I end up choosing Franklin K. Lane as the high school, good basketball team there, and I figure I'm gonna play a little basketball. And then, sadly, the, the teachers go on strike one year that I'm at Franklin K. Lane High School [Brooklyn, New York], and that's when I end up playing for the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] and all the rest of it 'cause there's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh.
Speaker 1: --there's no high school basketball that year; the coaches went on strike and--
Speaker 2: So that was the Carlton YMCA [Brooklyn, New York] where you--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) you had the--Brooklyn [New York]--you had the national championships.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I guess we all come from the--Sihugo Green, and all of the guys who were at other schools because the coaches are on strike; they all end up coming--not all, but many of us end up coming together to play for the Carlton Y and, and we go--I think we lose one game that year, that's it, and we win the championship. And then people go on to do different things after that, but Sihugo Green is part of that group that--he's now deceased, and others who were part of it. So, these things--again, unplanned; just the consequence of settings and circumstance, and being in the presence of let's say a helpful adult, or helpful adults who are looking to help you be the best you can be at whatever it is you--you're choosing.
Speaker 2: Now were you thinking--I mean you were really good as a basketball player, I mean, so are you--is there anyone you're looking up to, you know, or wanting to be?
Speaker 1: Not, not so much. I had a great coach in high school and, of course, I had my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] who said, "Don't accept any athletic scholarships."
Speaker 2: The coach said that also.
Speaker 1: That's right, both of them, "Don't do it. Your grades are strong enough, and you can go and apply at any of these schools, and most of them have student assistance, loans that you can take out if you need to." But his argument--well, not argument but his position, and my mother's, was that--well, his was, "If you twist your ankle and can't play, a scholarship can disappear, but if you go on merit and academics, you can get scholarship assistance along the way." So, he was a wise guy who remained a friend for--he's now deceased--but remained a friend for a long time.
Speaker 2: Is this your coach?
Speaker 1: Coach, yeah.
Speaker 2: And what was his name?
Speaker 1: Oh, god; yeah, I'll give it to you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's okay; don't worry.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So if you can imagine our team, we had Al Vann [Albert Vann]--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --and, and it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Al Vann was on your team?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In, in, in high school?
Speaker 1: High school. We were in the same high school, and we were (laughter)--in fact, I'll just digress for a moment, but Al will tell you to this day, because he tells me almost each time I see him and we're with other people, because I skipped a grade--see, I, I graduate in January because I've skipped a grade.
Speaker 2: You skipped a grade in junior high school [J.H.S. 33, Mark Hopkins Junior High School, Brooklyn, New York] though, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right. So I'm getting out of high school a semester earlier than would have been the norm. Our basketball team is in competition for the citywide championship, and we're, we're up against Boys High School [Boys and Girls High School, Brooklyn, New York], and some of the others, whom we've beaten already, but I leave in January because I graduate. To this day, Al Vann, in particular, will say, "You cost us the citywide championship because you left school," (laughter), "too early." I said, "What the hell was I supposed to do? I mean I couldn't fake it." But any event, it's a subject that comes up and we laugh about it obviously, but they didn't win the championship that year, and he knew, and Gil Scott [Gilbert L. Scott] knew, and Chink Gaines [Richard "Chink" Gaines], and all of the guys who were on that team; it was a wonderful team. And I was the team captain, but then I was gone, and so when they were playing in the, in the finals they, they got beaten. And, of course, then they--well, not really, but they do blame me because if I'd been there, they say, they would have won. So that is, to this day, still the conversation.
Speaker 2: That's interesting that relationships go back like that, too, you know that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 640678
Speaker 1: So if you graduate early like that, what are you doing in the--you know, for college (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The interim?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in the interim period of time.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, I go to work for--I wanted--I thought I'd be an engineer; that was my vision, and--
Speaker 1: So were you good in, in--
Speaker 2: At math. I'd taken a lot of math and science and, you know, whatever was--they were offering. And so I find a job at a, a firm called Faucus and Baron [ph.], and they were designers for construction and facility building and the like, and they must have put an ad in the paper, or something that I saw, and I went and applied for the job, which I get. I'm a--I've forgotten what my title was. Not busboy, but something not directly associated with the academic side of what was going on, but it was a real learning opportunity for me, and so I would stay a little later on some days when they were working on a project because then I would have to deliver the, the drawings to the architectural firm because they were doing the design on, on the mechanical side of things, and so the thing I remember--have remembered forever--was that we're late getting something to the architect's office, and the guys are scrambling; they're doing their drawings, and then they--and they get to something that stymies them, and it happened to be something I knew, so I tell them what, what it is, and it's, it's a particular circle or design that I had happened to read someplace, I don't know where. Any event, they then know--so anyway, they're all happy they get it done, and then I take the drawings to the design group, and when I come back, the head of the firm tells me that, "When you applied for the job, you didn't tell us you were gonna be leaving in September," because I'd applied for the job in January when I graduated [from Franklin K. Lane High School, Brooklyn, New York], and I was gonna start college in September.
Speaker 1: In the fall, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, I said, "Did you think I was gonna be a, a, a busboy forever?" And he said, "No, we didn't think that, but we're sorry to lose you. So stay in touch with us, will you?" (Laughter) So they, they couldn't have been nicer. Faucus and Baron was the name of the firm.

Speaker 1: When I went to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], I got immersed in all the stuff that first year--I think it's still the same way. You're, you're in class six days a week; it's not a five day schedule, and the sixth day is a lot of the lab work that you do for the sciences in the program. So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, so what program did you get accepted into?
Speaker 1: At Columbia?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I mean I know Columbia--
Speaker 1: Everyone takes the same thing. In those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Six days?
Speaker 1: --we all took the same--
Speaker 2: Course.
Speaker 1: --courses, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. But it was a six day program?
Speaker 1: Six day program, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So let me--let--I wanna ask you where did you apply? And--I mean--and I know that you said both your mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] and your coach said no--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --athletic scholarships, but that doesn't--I mean, what was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah. I'm trying to--who, who had expressed an interest in me. I think I only applied to Columbia.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'd thought about Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] at one point, but then when I realized where it was physically, I mean that--it--
Speaker 2: That didn't appeal to you.
Speaker 1: --that didn't appeal, no. And, and Lou Rossini was the coach at Columbia. And I went up for a visit, and some of the players who were on their team were pretty well known, good basketball players, one of whom subsequently got into some political trouble. Jack Molinas was his name. But anyway, they had a--they had a pretty good club, and I thought any school that had you--everyone taking roughly the same courses in that first year, no matter what you ultimately wanna do. In those days, at least, we all took the same courses, and the lab work was on Saturdays in chemistry.
Speaker 2: So you went into a medical pro- were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, it was just--that was the--that was the--Columbia fights to this day to hold onto the core program that they had developed umpteen years ago, because I don't think many schools do that. I don't know if they still do the extra Saturday work (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Day--the Saturday work.
Speaker 1: --but they did when I was there. And it was then all-male; it wasn't--
Speaker 2: That's right. So Barnard [Barnard College, New York, New York] was--
Speaker 1: Barnard was across the--
Speaker 2: --the female and the--okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Barnard is still there--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but Columbia is now coed. And--
Speaker 2: And this is 1952 that you enter in?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it--it's great. You just--you suddenly are immersed in the academics of it all.
Speaker 2: But it was a world apart from your world, wasn't it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This was all kind of brand new in that sense, and all the more interesting in that, that way.
Speaker 2: Now, were you living on campus or were you commuting?
Speaker 1: On campus.
Speaker 2: You lived on campus?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And how many black people would have been in your class at that point?
Speaker 1: I think that--I'm guessing six, because six seemed to be the magic number of people of color at Columbia at that stage in its life. And doubly ironic in that, for the senior class the year that I was a freshman, the head of the class was African American, but there were still only (laughter) six African American.
Speaker 2: So you're saying in your freshman year, the head of the class, the senior class, was African American (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Do you know who that was?
Speaker 1: Yeah. I'll think of his name, but yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, I know that Columbia--I mean I know it from graduate schools that--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --they were one--Columbia, BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts]--those are the schools that come up--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, for blacks in graduate school.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Hm. Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a--I'll think of all of them in a minute--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but they--a couple of them went on to be engineers. One is a architect [Jeh Vincent Johnson], I think he's still alive. It's the father of--what's the African American in the prior administration who--
Speaker 2: Prior administration. You mean in the--
Speaker 1: The lawyer [Jeh Johnson].
Speaker 2: Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton]?
Speaker 1: No, in the--Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].
Speaker 2: Obama. Okay, sorry. Right, okay (laughter). Female or--
Speaker 1: Male.
Speaker 2: Male.
Speaker 1: Male, head of--
Speaker 2: You're not talking--I mean--
Speaker 1: Gimme a name.
Speaker 2: Well, there was--you mean they, they were in the cabinet?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, Eric Holder [HistoryMaker Eric H. Holder, Jr.]?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No?
Speaker 1: He was the--he was doing--he was the--
Speaker 2: Gosh, who am I--
Speaker 1: --a lawyer. This is a--homeland security was the head of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Homeland--so--oh. I don't remember who homeland security was; I should know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a--
Speaker 2: I've--I, I heard his name; I don't know who that is. Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Well, I mean I may even have it--
Speaker 2: Well, you're saying that was his, his father.
Speaker 1: His father; his father was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His father was a senior.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I wish--if I had my phone I'd look it up.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 640680
Speaker 1: So Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]--so it was not--I mean while you were six out of how many? Like hundreds, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--I've forgotten how many (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. And then were you the only one on the basketball team?
Speaker 2: The only person of color, yes.
Speaker 1: The only person of color.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. But you, you were very good. Now this is--tell--I mean basketball itself is really not so--or it's starting to integrate, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean it's--so, so all of this is happening, but the environment is hospitable; like do you--'cause that's what--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I--
Speaker 1: So you have a roommate?
Speaker 2: No, I have a single room. And the academic demands were rigorous.
Speaker 1: So this was a jump. You, you had to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I--you took all the--I'd taken all the math they gave in high school [Franklin K. Lane High School, Brooklyn, New York], but I, I mean I had this crazy life there because I'd end up getting fascinated with the academic side, so I (laughter)--everyone takes roughly the same courses the first year at Columbia--they used to anyway. And I then decide at some point that there's this one course that fascinated me because it was given by a professor who was very well known, Jacques Barzun, I think, is his name. And it's the cultural history of Europe and it's taught in French, and--for reasons that I cannot explain even to myself these days--I take the course, right? I still have the book (laughter), and so I'm learning French enough to be able to read the material and do what I have to do, but it's a little crazy to me (laughter). I mean--but I think it was an extension of what had led me to Columbia in the first instance, which is that it was academically rigorous and interesting and--so then I later end up spending a lot of time at Columbia because I--when I leave, I go into the [U.S] Air Force.
Speaker 1: You go into the Air Force what year?
Speaker 2: When I graduate from Columbia.
Story_ID: 640681
Speaker 1: Can I just ask a few more things about Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] before you go on to the [U.S.] Air Force (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because, you know, everybody had to serve, but I--my, my, my question is how is that environment? You know, because you, you know, I know you say that you had to work really hard, it was rigorous, and then you're planning on taking a--had you studied French before?
Speaker 2: No, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you get into a French class, you haven't studied, but--and then you have a starring role on the, the basketball team which you sort of didn't even talk about.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So let--let's do that. But I'm just wondering how this--what are you learning? How is this forming you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and are you feeling any pressure? You know, I mean--
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm kind of fascinated. I, I, I (laughter) remember writing a paper for a course. I may still have it. Is it--I got a, a terrible grade on it from this professor who was a--very renowned and, and it was related to early American history, and I don't think I can find the paper anymore, but a couple of my classmates from that period are still around, and--anyway, I wrote this paper and I got a terrible mark from this professor and I didn't quite know what to do, so I went to see him, and he just didn't accept my analysis of the state of race relations at that time in the country, and so--anyway--so he gave me a bad grade, which (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What? D?
Speaker 2: No, probably a C or something like that.
Speaker 1: C, oh (laughter).
Speaker 2: And (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Just trying to provide some perspective, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. So I, so I, I showed the paper to a couple of my friends--close friends; one was George Patterson who remains a friend to this day and, you know, we were kind of musing over, you know, what was it that triggered this reaction on the part of the, the Nobel laureate professor. And so, with the passage of time, we both kind of concluded that there were enough points in the paper that differed from this professor's point of view that must have been the trigger for the re- . Anyway, oh, that--it's just part of that Columbia history that is, for the most part, great, but I go back to Columbia at its request for a lot of--on and off for a long time, and I still do some work there. And I remember when the student riots occurred, and I, I go back and try and help them deal with some of those issues. And by then I've been on the board, I've done all the stuff you, you know, you can do, and I then set up a small endowment for students at the college, you know, and I say to them that I have a particular interest in students of African American descent, but this isn't the scholarship that's limited to that but that's--I'd like to make that point. So I--to this day I still get the reports on every student who gets that scholarship and, you know, they want you to come up and meet them and all that, and I--I don't--I haven't been going up to meet them but I've been staying in touch with the ones who have been recipients of it. And it's not a monumental but it--it's, you know, it's, it's helpful to students who are there.
Story_ID: 640682
Speaker 1: I'm sort of interested in your generation that came before the--you know, before the push for, you know, great scale integration of schools--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, and how that environment was, you know. And, and you see examples of people excelling in those environments, though--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, they didn't come in where, where my generation came in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, wholesale, doors sort of open, let everyone in, and I--and so I just--so, it was--so you're not--you're--I mean you talk about this one instance, but you're not feeling necessarily threatened, and yet--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --you know you're there to learn--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, and are you--you're developing friendships. Or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. I mean they tell me--I don't know if this is factually true or not, I haven't explored it, but at some point I'm told by the people at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] that I have every award they have to give, right? That's what I was told because, you know, I've gone back and forth there over the years as a recipient of one award or another and, and I--you know--what do I know?
Story_ID: 640683
Speaker 1: --That it was the life of a student--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and they're not--you're not feeling--are you experiencing, experiencing other acts of discrimination besides the one where you're talking about the paper where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And that could not even--you know, that could be--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, that could be--that could be anything.
Speaker 1: --that could happen--anything--right, right.
Speaker 2: The other--the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] had an initiative on campus that I got involved with, and it related to people who posted rooms for rent in the immediate area of the school, and they would post them on the board on--in the college, and there was a strong suspicion among many students that when a person of color applied for the room or the apartment, whatever it was--that they were getting turned down, and when a person--a Caucasian went--substantially similar age, what have you, suddenly the, the apartment existed. So, the NAACP and others decided that they would create these teams of people who would go to the apartments or rooms that were listed as available, and the first group to go would be a person of color, and if that person didn't get the room or apartment, they would then follow up with a Caucasian person seeking the same apartment with substantially similar background, except one is black and the other is white--whatever you wanna label people as. So, anyway, this was a big to do, and the college wasn't happy about it but they didn't interfere with the student initiative. And just to digress for a moment, the meeting--the first meeting of this group of students who were willing to engage in this process--is a meeting that my current wife attended because she was at Barnard [Barnard College, New York, New York] at the time. I didn't know her, and she didn't know me, and we didn't meet later until we had each gotten married and had children with other people, get divorced, and then, lo and behold, we, we meet.
Speaker 1: So she was at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] the--I mean she was at Barnard the same time you were there--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and she was at this initial meeting (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She went to this meeting but did not join in the (laughter)--in, in going around to the different--
Speaker 1: That's Kate [Kate Roosevelt Whitney]?
Speaker 2: Kate, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's--I mean we, we both laugh about this because I didn't see her, she didn't see me (laughter), but we were both at the same meeting.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: What else? I'm giving you too much stuff that's just distracting you from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no, no, this is--no, no, it's not dis- so, let me ask you was--'cause I had read that the first president of the NAACP New York chapter [NAACP New York Branch, New York, New York] was Dr. James Allen [James Egert Allen]. So, was--but you don't know who convened that meeting either, right?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know who convened it, but I think it's probably discernable that up at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --Columbia.
Speaker 1: And then--then the other question that I had--so, you're basically saying, besides this housing issue, that this is the life of a student and this group that came together for the NAACP--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was a multiracial group (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Which NAACP was multiracial--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from its inception, but I--you know. So, the, the other thing--can we just talk about--so you're saying--I mean--okay. No acts of racist--I mean you're in a single room so you don't have that to be concerned about (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: You--no acts of racism and you're doing well with your, your, your class--
Speaker 2: School. Yeah.
Speaker 1: --your school work?
Story_ID: 640684
Speaker 1: What about on the basketball team? So it's the Columbia Lions [Columbia University, New York, New York], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Now, we encountered race discrimination on the basketball team when we go to play in one of the Carolinas; I can't remember which one it was, and we go to have a meal, and this--no people of color allowed in this--whatever this place was, and we just say, "No people of color, no people." So we all leave and we go and find other accommodations but--and then we--that, that's happened once or twice in the basketball life as we go to Florida at one point, and have a similar experience of race discrimination. But I was the captain of the team, so I mean if I, if I (laughter), if I don't go, the team doesn't go. So we would always find another place that we could eat at, or do whatever, but it was crazy time.
Speaker 1: So your coach--who was your coach, 'cause you have a record of--I think that hasn't been broken of 408 rebounds.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it's still--yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It's--Lou Rossini was the coach but he's now deceased, but he was the coach when I was there, and a good man.
Speaker 1: So, he was a special person then, in many ways, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, he was first rate, and--you know we played--I remember one game we played at Syracuse [Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York], and Vinnie Cohen was playing for Syracuse and the great--the guy would become a great football player--Brown, was on the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) James--Jim Brown?
Speaker 2: Jim Brown was there, and we're pounding him. You know, he was a--he was a, a ton to deal with, and particularly under the basket, which is where I--most of my activity was under the basket down that end of the court, you know. We had--the big shooters were on the outside and I was handling the inside, and, and Jim Brown was, was there along with another guy now deceased who became a lawyer and was from--actually from Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York], and so it was a, it was a team that--we kind of stuck together as a, as a group, and Chet Forte was our All-American; he was a 5'9", and scored from anyplace on the court, and his father [Fulvio Forte, Sr.] was a medical doctor, and then he, he went professional after--I don't know if he ever graduated, but he went into the pros, and then got involved with gambling and a bunch of other--it, it didn't end well for him, so--but all these experiences are happening during this same period of time, so I'm scurrying around trying to read French so I could keep up with the course, and I'm--
Speaker 1: And your--so, were there demands in terms of practicing? Was it a lot there like in a Ivy League and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah. Same, same deal, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And the big thing was traveling because you had to travel, which was time consuming; you had to get settled in wherever you were going, and you had to play, and then you had to get yourself--get back.
Story_ID: 640685
Speaker 1: But I, I--you know, it may be that my skin is not all that thin when it comes to some of this stuff because I, I can remember my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] saying something to me as a kid when--I may have told you this--I was riding my bike with a neighborhood friend and he was Caucasian, and we went to his house one day on our bikes, and he went in and I wasn't let into the house by whoever answered the door. So when I went home I told my mother. I said, "You know, this is, this is what happened." And she said, "Oh, don't worry about that; they're prejudiced." I swear to god, I thought she meant they were crazy; that's what I thought she meant, that it was--, "It's not your problem, it's their problem."
Speaker 2: So you think you may have been a little--I don't wanna say oblivious, but--to it--were you once--because--
Speaker 1: What can I tell you? You know? People (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. Well, prejudice is crazy.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's--you know.
Speaker 1: It's, it's--that we her view; that's how I grew up, and--
Speaker 2: But was there the mindset that you had to work harder, and was there--you know, because you come out of a clearly aspirational household.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, is there that--wasn't there instilled maybe in you that you have to work harder or your--there was a lot of you being an example for the race. You didn't have that?
Speaker 1: I think it was not so much for the race, I would say, as such. I don't remember the language being that, but, but it was implicitly that, you know. And, you see, the idea--and I, I say that because I was also brought up to believe that you don't have to be afraid of the police, you know, and that wasn't the common wisdom that was floating around, but that was what I was brought up with. And as things have worked out, that seemed to have been the right approach to have.
Story_ID: 640686
Speaker 1: As I go to the (laughter)--after I finished college [Columbia University, New York, New York], I committed to go into the [U.S.] Air Force and in order to be allowed to graduate you then have to go do your service, so I went into the [U.S.] military service, or the Air Force, and learned navigation and became a navigator, and then I got assigned to the Strategic Air Command, Curtis LeMay and that whole group, and I got assigned to a wing that was a strategic reconnaissance wing, as they were called, so we were traveling all over the world and off-loading fuel to our aircraft that had to fly at much higher levels than, than we did and I, I spent time in all parts of the world. I spent times in Thule, Greenland [Thule Air Base, Greenland] for three months in the winter, and then I became a--well, whatever the title was,  a senior navigator, so any crew that didn't--was navigated did not pass the most recent test, had to have a senior navigator fly with the crew, so I did that on a number of occasions, including a group where the navigator was someone from--had been in World War II [World War II], so he was an older man and had, I'd say, a system of doing his navigation that was not wrong, but wasn't as up to date as what the rest of us had learned, and Curtis LeMay was the, the general in charge of all that. Anyway, I have to fly with this crew to oversee the work of the navigator, and we get started and we're heading over towards Europe, and he looks okay to me; everything is going pretty fine, so I go--I step away from being over his shoulder, which is where I was in the beginning. And then I get a call by the co-pilot who says that we have to report in at--in the next ten minutes or so, and the navigator's not sure where we are. So I go back to him, and by then the perspiration is just draining down his face and he's got out all these--his charts from his earlier career as a navigator and he's struggling. So, I--and the pilots don't know; they fly the airplane then--they don't know necessarily where we are. So anyway, I double back in and we figure out the last point that we were certain of, what the headings have been since then, what the speed has been since then. Where does that put us if we're right? And then what ought I to be able to see in the sky if we are at that spot? So I go up with the chute to see what I can find in the sky. I mean this is--and finally get it all sorted out and we're able to report in as we have to, and we're, we're going to another location in Europe and we land, and coming out of the air field where we are, which is a base, is a plane that's draped in shroud. You can't see the plane itself, and of course it turns out that was one of our high altitude planes that was going way up to look at the Soviet stuff, and it ultimately got shot down. So anyway, then we come back to the states, and I have to write the report on this guy and turn it over to the, the powers that be and they decide whether they're gonna let him stay in the program or not, and--but those kinds of assignments, I mean I didn't seek it; it just--they just happened, and when I finally decide I'm gonna leave the Air Force because I wanna go to law school, I have this incredible meeting with three senior officers telling me why I should stay--why--what the future looks like, what I can do, et cetera, et cetera, and that if I leave the Air Force and--to go to law school, I'm gonna spend all the money I may have saved, and--, "You graduate in three years, you know. You, you won't earn as much initially as you can earn here," you know, all the--all of the classic arguments or positions. And so, at the end of the conversation, one of them takes me aside and he says, "Everything we said to you, Frank [HistoryMaker Franklin A. Thomas], is true. You can have a great career here in the military." He said, "But it's also true that if you want the fruits of life, you have to be willing to go out on a limb for them because that's where all the fruit is." And I've never forgotten that conversation. And so I left, went to law school [Columbia Law School, New York, New York].
Story_ID: 640687
Speaker 1: You were part of, you said, the Strategic Air Command, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And I had read that that also had some involvement with nuclear strike forces. Is that correct or not?
Speaker 2: It, it could be because the general for that function was Curtis LeMay who was a high-profile, very prominent general, and it included the B-47s [Boeing B-47 Stratojet] and the B-52s [Boeing B-52 Stratofortress], which were our--[U.S.] Air Force's major aircraft. And what they did--they were all over the world, and the wing that I was in--it was only one or two wings--it's called a Strategic Command Wing. We were air refuelers; we were the people who these--the big guys up top would come down and attach to our plane, and we would offload fuel to them so that they could then return back up to do what they had to do in the sky, which often involved interactions with the Soviets and, and others. And there's this wonderful--wonderful, there's this situation where one of our planes gets shot down by the Russians, and--everything we did was radio silent. You couldn't talk to anybody about it, et cetera. So I--we're watching the show, and there's a scene at the United Nations [United Nations Headquarters, New York, New York] where Henry Cabot Lodge [Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.] is speaking on behalf of the United States, and he's telling the world that, "We know where our aircraft are every minute of the day, and we were not on Russian territory when this plane was shot down." Because what happened was the Soviets launched our guys--not my flight but the reconnaissance guys hightailing it out--get shot at just as they're leaving what was part of the Soviet Union, and the plane goes down and they, they all die, and one of the members of that team had gone to navigation school with me so I, I knew him. So it was pretty traumatic, but we're still on radio silence; we're not talking about any of this to anybody, and there's Henry Cabot Lodge at the UN telling the world how we know where our planes are, and all this, and so, you know, we're kind of looking at each other thinking, hm, hm (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But it, it was, you know. I would say it was an unplanned life--is the only thing I can say.
Speaker 1: But you were there for four years, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you were a part of ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's how you--
Speaker 2: That's how I--
Speaker 1: So you came in through the R (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's how I was able to complete college [Columbia University, New York, New York], was I joined the ROTC, which meant I had to take ROTC courses and all of that while doing my regular academic work. But that allowed me to finish college, so--and then I went into the Air Force and spent four years there.
Speaker 1: But, but you also rose to the position of captain in the Air Force, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: But no acts of discrimination that you--you can't--
Speaker 2: Yeah. I mean they're there, but I mean they--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just not--
Speaker 2: --they don't bother me.
Story_ID: 640688
Speaker 1: --Do wanna go back to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] a bit. I mean on the basketball team--I mean your record has been not broken in sixty years.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay. And that was--you were like this amazing rebounder--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, and, and so that--so, how was Columbia though in the, in the Ivy League? I mean 'cause I know you were most valuable player in 1955 and '56 [1956], but where did it fit in the overall, you know--
Speaker 2: I don't know; I think--I don't think I was too worried about all that. I mean I--it sounds terrible, but I, I, I--it never preoccupied me, you know? It--
Speaker 1: But, what did you learn though, in basketball then? Let's say that the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it's about, it's about team work is what it's about, and it's about leadership, it's about taking the blows that you have to take if you're gonna be under that basket banging around with guys who, in some cases, are a foot taller than you are, and maybe thirty pounds heavier.
Speaker 1: But you were pretty tall; you were six- you were 6'4" (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 6'4", 6'4", yeah. But I mean it's, it's a war under the basket, and--'cause you have to stay out of the zone that is prohibited, and we always played zones, so that made it a little easier for everybody. It's--I don't wanna make it sound like it was simple; it wasn't that, it was just that I didn't think there was anything I couldn't do that I put my mind to, and that may have been a false notion, but that's the notion I had.
Story_ID: 640689
Speaker 1: So at what point does your family know that maybe you're special? And at what point in your life are people saying that you're special? You know, because you had already been promoted--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, advanced--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a year, so, you know, and, and in the community people are identifying--you know, whether it's at your church or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at the school. I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think, I think it was the--I mean we can talk candidly about all of this. I think (laughter)--in my growing up days, I remember the so called brown bag. Do you remember that?
Speaker 1: The brown bag test.
Speaker 2: That's right. So, if you were dark-skinned--and I was dark-skinned, you were not as welcomed as someone of lighter skin; that always seemed crazy to me, but I--it was what it was, and--
Speaker 1: And it was real.
Speaker 2: It was real--oh, yeah. And (laughter), I think because I wasn't seeking anything from whoever it was that was in that category, I mean it's kind of their loss, not mine. I wasn't seeking anything that they could provide me. And my friends were all shades, you know--from--I mean the friends of African descent were--some were darker, some were similarly dark, some of them were light-skinned. It's--but they didn't run any faster, they didn't jump any higher, they didn't speak any better. What can I tell you? I think we all face racial discrimination. I mean I, I don't--I'm not saying that didn't happen; it's just how you respond to it that determines its impact on you.
Speaker 1: But your response, and how you learned how to response, is that your mother [Viola Atherly Thomas]?
Speaker 2: Probably, yeah. I mean she was--she was solid as a rock.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, you know, the fact that she would go (laughter)--would go out after I'm playing hockey and I end up having somebody put a stick under my skate I and go down, and then, you know, mess up my finger and--but it--and I go to the hospital to get that dealt with, and unknown to me, she's already doubled back to try and find out who did it, you know (laughter), because I think she was a warrior in her own way, and I think none of us could have come along as well as we did when--
Story_ID: 640690
Speaker 1: My first trip to D.C. was when my sister, the older sister [Audrey Thomas], was working in the War Department [U.S. Department of War], having graduated from high school, and my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] and I went down by train, and see her--see how she was doing, see what she was doing, and that was--and I think that was my earliest awareness that the racial segregation was so intense that even to go into a movie theater--you could go into the movie theater but you couldn't sit in the lower seats. This is in Washington, D.C., you know, and I'm just a kid. Well, it--but my sisters were all--whatever they took on, they were high achievers at it and, and they all lived into their mid-eighties, except for one who died earlier [Viola Thomas]--and got to ninety years old which is--and always interested in what you were doing, or what I was doing, and what I was thinking. And I have said many times that they were each--as far as I was concerned, they were smarter than I was; it's just that they came earlier and I came later when there were--and they were female and I was male, and so there were some doors that opened for me, based on timing and gender, that didn't open for them; that's how I've always thought of it. And, and we were all very close with each other; they were--they just died off. In the last three years I've lost each of them, yeah.
Speaker 2: So you're the last one left, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. And, and did they tell you you were special, though? I mean you're their little baby brother. Was there any aspect of that?
Speaker 1: Oh, I think they all did. I mean if I was upset about something as a kid--I used to like the trolley cars that we then had, and one or another of them would--
Speaker 2: Take you?
Speaker 1: --take me and we'd ride out to wherever and back, and that seemed to settle down--have me settle down. They always stayed in touch, and I stayed in touch with them and their children, who I, I know well, and stay in touch with. It's been--I've been very--I've felt very privileged.
Story_ID: 640691
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about you and the engineering firm [Faucus and Baron (ph.)], and I'm thinking about the course work that you were taking. I know you said--now, how hard did you have to work? You know, at, at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]? The fir- and, and then I wanna get to the law school [Columbia Law School, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but how hard did you have to work at Columbia undergrad; I mean to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, probably pretty hard because the courses are demanding, you know that? And a lot of reading, which is that--I think I still have the core curriculum there, which they--you know, people have been trying to force them to alter it, but I think there are enough people who appreciate what it did for them from an educational standpoint, that it remains. That's it--I've always worked, you know what I mean? I had a shoeshine kit that--until my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] found out, and said, "No," so I had to give up that.
Speaker 1: So you had that in college?
Speaker 2: No, no (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or in high school [Franklin K. Lane High School, Brooklyn, New York]?
Speaker 2: --this is as a kid. This is as a kid. I--
Speaker 1: So she had--she was--she had very big dreams for you.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, she was, she was great.
Story_ID: 640692
Speaker 1: I wanna understand--and I think it's, you know, important; like the narrative of your, your story is important, so what do you learn, or how do you grow up in the service? What--I mean how does that differ? Because--what's the different person that you come back?
Speaker 2: From [U.S.] military service?
Speaker 1: From military service.
Speaker 2: Well, I've seen more of the world, but through the military.
Speaker 1: So what places did you see? You mentioned Gre- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think pretty much the bulk of the U.S., of course, from the--Texas and on up to Topeka, Kansas and beyond, so I'm seeing a fair amount of that. And then when we're flying during practice flights, you're flying different parts of the country, South, West--a little less flights into the North. I think they chose the geography in relationship to where the military bases were because you were flying out of those bases, so it made sense. I spent a lot of time, again, in the [U.S.] Air Force in, in England; we were stationed there for a stretch. And because we were--if you think of us as a, a unit that was refueling aircraft in the air, you can see why you'd wanna have us positioned in different parts of the world because as the flights need assistance, we could provide it. So that was one piece of that picture. And I think it's, it's probably a, a part of American history about the--Curtis LeMay who was the general during that time and who, I think, earned the reputation of being not only a great warrior but a great enabler--a facilitator, and everything we did was kind of radio silent, and so there was a--and we were all told that you had to be ready to leave on a moment's notice, and to be away for--enough to deal with three days, and you wouldn't necessarily know where you were going until you got in the aircraft and you got whatever info they had for you, and so we always kept a bag packed.
Story_ID: 640693
Speaker 1: I'm just mentioning these things because they're part of the process of what influences the way you deal with problems or situations that come upon you later in life. So you're kind of on the go and, and you're all radio silent, and all the rest of it, and yet you're looking at war plans and you're looking at all these things that you supposed to be knowledgeable about here, mainly dealing with the navigation involved in all of this because you're--it isn't simply getting yourself from Point A to Point B; it's getting yourself from Point A to where those who need you will be able to find you, so--and without verbal communication. So, I think there's--I've always thought of it as a level of high responsibility and, and dangerous, but not as dangerous, in my mind, as the pilots who were actually going where they needed to go in order to get the information that they had to have, so you were more of a support function to that set of activities. Now, some of the guys that I went into the [U.S.] military with didn't take the navigation course; they--and my eyesight was 20/20 in one eye and twenty something in the other eye, and so it would have been a stretch for me to take the pilot side of this equation. Also, the way the seats were done in the, in all the aircraft in those days they really weren't made for people of my length, you know, if you were gonna be upfront. Now that all could have been accommodated for, I guess, by changing things, but it led me to choose navigation because I liked the science of it to begin with, and it didn't depend on 20/20 eyesight in each eye the same way, you know; you had to learn the stars, and that--and I somehow loved doing that. It's--again, it's something that--for which you have use for all of your life, and at the same time you're honoring your obligation to the government; it allows you to finish your college, and when I was getting ready to leave and they were giving me the, the talk about staying [in the U.S. Air Force], it's--I believe that they believed what they were telling me, that, "There's a great future here for you, you can--you know, you'll be captain in short order, and then the sky's the limit." But as I mentioned, I think I mentioned it earlier, the one guy who, who said what resonated with me, and that is, that "If you want the fruits of life, you have to be willing to go out on a limb because that's where the fruit is, and everything we're telling you is true. But, if that's what you want, then you can go ahead and pursue it."
Story_ID: 640694
Speaker 1: Now, do you decide you wanna go to Columbia Law School [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or law school before you go into the [U.S. military] service?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I pretty much knew that I wanted to do that. It was--I didn't like blood, so I wasn't gonna become a doctor, which is what my sisters and mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] all wanted (laughter) me to do, but I, I knew that wasn't for me. I respect the people who do it, but this had more juice flowing--more things that I didn't know anything about--more places I hadn't been. Why not?
Speaker 1: So, what was the Columbia Law School that you come into when you come back? So you come (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there, there were three of us who are not--I think it's three in my class, maybe four, who are not coming right out of college. There's one guy who's a police officer, there's a woman, Kay McDonald [Kathryn McDonald], who is married, has a daughter [K. Ann McDonald]; her husband [Robert J. McDonald] is a partner in a major law firm, and then there's one other person who I think had some military experience; the rest of them were people coming out of college going on to a professional school. So the three of us tended to study together, and so we did that for a while, and it, it seemed very natural to be in the company of people who had other commitments in their life. By then I was married, had a child [Keith Thomas], and so I was working and going to school (laughter), and doing all that stuff at the same time--and enjoying it.
Speaker 1: Your wife's name was Dawn Co- [Dawn Conrada].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you had met her where?
Speaker 2: At a summer camp, I think, that I worked at in the Berkshires; I think that's where I, I met her.
Speaker 1: C-R--C-O-N-R-A-D-A, right? Was the last name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So--anyway, I, I have to figure out how am I gonna deal with all this responsibility, and it all seemed to fit, you know? I worked, went to school, and studied.
Story_ID: 640695
Speaker 1: You took to the law immediately?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it was--it, it felt right for me. You know, they're different--they give you this kind of--it's not quite the core curriculum but it is a version of it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, the--especially the--right, especially the first year courses, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--so you--and they pound you with material; I mean it just--you just look at it and you think nobody can make any demands greater than this on you because you're putting in whatever it is, twelve hours or so a day trying to keep up with it. And the faculty was, was pretty good, too, as I remember, and--
Speaker 1: And how many in a class in your--at law school? Was there--
Speaker 2: I'm gonna say thirty maybe--somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Thir- so--Columbia Law [Columbia Law School, New York, New York]? No, no, no--how many sections though?
Speaker 2: God, I don't--I don't remember now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You don't know? Okay, okay. Okay, okay. So--but you--so what course did you--did you like civil procedure, or was it criminal law, or was it--
Speaker 2: Well, it was more--the course that was the most interesting, I think to me, was when we were trying, you know, these mock cases that you try--
Speaker 1: So civil procedure?
Speaker 2: Yeah. And so I got good marks in that, you know. It was a--I don't know; there was a naturalness to that. The--some of the courses you just take because you have to take them and (laughter) you just plow your way through as best you can, and--what else? I can remember going to a professor who gave me a grade that I didn't think was, was right, and he was a perfectly good professor. So I said to him, "What--what's, what's wrong with, you know, with this," whatever it was. And he said, "Well, the truth is almost everybody got it right, but some people got it right and said A, B and C; in addition to getting it right they said A, B--whatever A, B and C was. Some people just got it right." He said, "I had to differentiate" (laughter). It, it, it was a classic, but it was one adult talking to another, you see, saying, you know, "What, what did I miss here?" You know? And I hadn't missed anything except the--if the criteria was going to be not the answer but the way in which the answer is framed, and what else happens to it, then okay I, I can accept it. So I stopped worrying about, about that, and moot court was great because you had it--you had practicing lawyers who were hearing it and making their decisions and then giving you the feedback on it, so that was, that was great. And you always have one or two professors who just try and bury you under whatever, and I think, in their minds, the notion was it's really helping you see if this is something you really want, and that's how they rationalize, you know, beating you over the head with whatever (laughter) it was they were doing. But it was good--I, I enjoyed it and, you know, what can I say?
Story_ID: 640696
Speaker 1: First jobs out of law school [Columbia Law School, New York, New York] were, were interesting. Went to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York], had to wait for that job so I did a housing and home finance assignment initially, and then--
Speaker 2: But I--wait; I wanna--because you got your--you went--you gradu- wait a minute. So L.L.B. was like a J.D?
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a J.D. Okay. So you graduate 1963--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and that's when you--now, are you thinking--so the U.S. attorney general's office, at that time, that was--
Speaker 1: Robert Morgenthau [Robert M. Morgenthau].
Speaker 2: That's a plum assi- is that a plum assignment sort of, or was it easy back then?
Speaker 1: People--people were lined up to try and get into that, which is why I had to wait a year, because they didn't have an opening when I graduated, but they were interested enough to tell me to double back, which I did. So, in the interim I went to work for the Housing and Home Finance group [Housing and Home Finance Agency; U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] and did some of their work on the East Coast through communities who wanted to become eligible for financial assistance on housing and development issues, and assisting them in that process until I heard from the Southern District. And there, the cases were, you know, unrelenting; you just--it's the best learning experience (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everybody says what's--you know, if you want trial experience, that's the right--
Speaker 1: That's it.
Speaker 2: So, so I--tell me the office you came into, you know. How was it divi- were there divisions?
Speaker 1: You mean at the U.S. attorney's office?
Speaker 2: At the U.S. attorney's office.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, when I--but they called me after the nine months, or a year--whatever it was--of my waiting, and one other person was coming on at the same time I was, and he had been a, a clerk, I think it was; yeah, he'd been a clerk for a federal judge and was coming into the U.S. attorney's office. And in those days each--they're kind of cubicle like offices, but each assistant had his own office, except the two us, because they didn't have two separate offices, so we ended up in one office that was giant size right? A floor below Morgenthau's office; he was above us one floor. And they told us that as soon as one opened, they would let us know. Well, when one opened, we both said we'd rather stay where we were, and so we--he then has become a major jurist here in town [New York, New York] and--Pierre Leval [Pierre N. Leval] is his name--and we remain--
Speaker 2: Oh, so he was your--he was the one you came in with that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --shared the office. I see (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Pierre--
Story_ID: 640697
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Pierre and I are--and are--the only two assistants who share an office are Pierre Leval [Pierre N. Leval] and Franklin Thomas [HistoryMaker Franklin A. Thomas], and so we're scrambling around, doing all we have to do. You know, they give you all--they dump a lot of work on you when you get there, and low and behold, a case arrives of an alleged conspiracy to blow up the Statue of Liberty [New York, New York], the Washington Monument [Washington, D.C.], and the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. And the case comes to the U.S. attorney's office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York] and it's handed off to the senior partner, who is Steve Kaufman [Stephen E. Kaufman], and he decides he's gonna need help on that case and he chooses Pierre and me as the two who will work for him on this case. And that's the case that ends up involving Americans and Canadians who were involved in this exercise. Anyway, we get the convictions and it's not easy, but we, we go through it, and then Pierre and I get sent up to Canada to work with the Canadians because some of the participants in the conspiracy were from Canada, and the undercover agent who was the one who broke the case, he has to testify in Canada, so we go--Pierre and I go and do that work with him. And I think it's changed all of our lives--the three of us who worked on it--because we are as close friends today as you can possibly be, and Pierre becomes a major judge in the, in the circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit], and Steve is still a practitioner.
Speaker 2: Steve's last name?
Speaker 1: Steve Kaufman.
Speaker 2: Kaufman, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And, and we all worked for Bob Morgenthau [Robert M. Morgenthau], and I leave--
Speaker 2: That case--I do wanna say that that would--that case (laughter) reminded me--I don't know, of even today--I mean 'cause it's 1964; you know, there's a lot going on--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and these are three black men and a white woman [Michelle Duclos], as I remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there're three--
Speaker 2: Three Negro men, it said.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then there are--huh--the Canadians are--I think that two or--I've forgotten how many there were of the Canadians (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. But she was--the woman was Canadian--
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: --I think.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. She had been a television personality in Montreal [Canada], they said, okay--or at least (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think that's right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah. It's a lot of personalities in this picture (gesture).
Speaker 2: Right. No, it was ver- it was, it was a fascinating--
Speaker 1: (Makes noise).
Story_ID: 640698
Speaker 1: So was this like--this, this case happened--was this one of your first major cases when you got there [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York], or were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was--yeah, the--it was--I had had cases of appeals and things like that, that I had, had handled (laughter), and Morgenthau [Robert M. Morgenthau] was--I don't know, he's, he's a legend, as you probably know, and he's now ninety-six, and I had lunch with him--
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.
Speaker 2: --and Steve Kaufman [Stephen E. Kaufman] not--just a week and a half ago. His mind is as sharp as a tack; I cannot believe it. And I realized his brother [Henry Morgenthau III], who is five years older than he, just published--he's 103 [sic.]--just published a book of poetry ['A Sunday in Purgatory']--a, a brother. I mean incredible. And we were kidding the other day when we said, "Bob, your memory is still better than mine, and better than Steve's," you know (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Wow!
Speaker 2: He remembers everything. So--but if you see him, he's kind of bent over and he looks like he's about to fall apart until that brain goes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Starts going, and then you see. He, he--he's, he's, he's in good shape upstairs.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I--that's what I'm just wondering 'cause that was the first time you're working with an undercover--you know, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, you're seeing all the, the mechanisms (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I see a lot of what's going on, yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause they were on wires and there's, you know--this is the time communism; it's very--
Speaker 2: It's, it's a madhouse at that stage--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but, you know, we--Pierre [Pierre N. Leval] and I must have been to the Statue of Liberty [New York, New York] twenty times to get all the data on the Statue of Liberty because it was one of the targets of this conspiracy. And, and of course you--no matter how hard you work--you know, you go to the--all the records in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and you get a gift from the French, and how that all happened, and da-da-da-da-da. And, of course, by the time the trial comes on, they stipulate, so you don't even have to make the argument (laughter), you know. You've put in all this, this time that--the question was was it U.S. property? And you have to be able to establish that, and that involved a whole process of thought and information. But any event, it's--that's quite an office. I don't know what it's like today, but if you want legal training, there's nothing quite like it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think--I think it's a good place still for legal training.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think.
Story_ID: 640699
Speaker 1: In the--you're there--'cause when you enter [the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York], you're age thirty.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I'm just wondering--now you were there for how long? You were there for--
Speaker 2: Not all that long because what happens is that Vincent Broderick [Vincent L. Broderick] becomes police commissioner.
Speaker 1: Now, the previous police commissioner had been Murphy [Michael J. Murphy].
Speaker 2: Had been Murphy, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I had handled an appeal on a case that Broderick had tried when he was on the trial side, so I had had a chance to work with him on the appeal, and that went well; I handled that, and then he becomes police commissioner and asks me to go with him to the department [New York City Police Department] to take one of the five deputy jobs that--there, one of which is the legal deputy. And the guys in the office rightly say to me, "Frank [HistoryMaker Franklin A. Thomas], why are you gonna do that?" You know. "If Lindsay [John Lindsay] gets elected," this was like September when this happens. Says, "If Lindsay gets elected, Lindsay's gonna have his own police commissioner." He says, "Broderick's not gonna be there, so why don't you wait and see if Lindsay gets elected before you agree on it." I said, "No, no, I--Bob [Robert M. Morgenthau] asked me, I--you know, this is--I, I wouldn't wait around for that. So if Lindsay gets elected and Bob gets let go, so be it--then I'll find another job," whatever I say. Any event, Lindsay gets elected, Lindsay is interested in having a Civilian Complaint Review Board established, which the department didn't then have. I'm in favor of a Civilian Complaint Review Board, which the department didn't have, so Broderick leaves and they bring in Howard Leary [Howard R. Leary] from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], who didn't know New York [New York]. So Leary says to me, "Please, I need you to stay." And I said, "Oh, I'm more than willing to stay, and we're gonna create the Civilian Complaint Review Board, we're gonna do a number of the things that Lindsay agreed to have done." And so I stay, and it's an entirely different professional experience for me. When I worked for Broderick, I would take something to him--whatever the issue was--and we would discuss it. And if I had written something, we'd go over it--whatever it was. The first time I took something to Leary, he just took out his pen and signed it. And I have to tell you, no matter how self-confident you may have been, there is that moment when you are saying, "This thing stops with me--what?" (Laughter) So, it was a great personal experience, and I stayed there with him for--whatever--I've forgotten how long I stayed (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was two years, I think.
Speaker 2: Oh, that--
Speaker 1: Two years--thirty-one to--it was sixty- well, thirty--I have you--this is where you're deputy police commissioner, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because by--let's see, hold on. You join the Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York] maybe in '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So--
Speaker 2: Well, it's a--whatever it is--four years maybe--something like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) About three or four years--okay.
Story_ID: 640700
Speaker 1: So I want to--because--you know, being in the city environment, you know, in government, is--I don't think sometimes people--it's a--because you were in one envi- you were in--dealing with high profile--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) cases where there's a lot--you know, you're privy to information before it breaks--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you're working and doing all that--that work, and that has all that intrigue--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --where when you are in government, sometimes you're not in control of your, your--you know, your schedule--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --your agenda, because things may break and, you know, you have to--so go with that. I wanna understand really what your day to day was like, and this whole thing--this civilian review board [Civilian Complaint Review Board], as I read--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: --it was controversial, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And it was one of the things that Lindsay [John Lindsay] himself was--I mean he, he had a--he was candida- you know, he had the looks--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --but he was also--you know, he identified, you know, with the ethnic communities or was trying, and that really upset the white ethnics. I just would like you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to sort of take us back to that time and, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's--Lindsay is a--he's a mixture; he's technically Republican, but he's philosophically a Democrat, even though he's not labeled as a Democrat. But his policies and attitudes are those that you would associate with someone, I think, who has a, a Democratic orientation. He was--for me, he was great to work around because he didn't know the department very well. He brought in Leary [Howard R. Leary], who didn't know that he was not from New York [New York]; he was from Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And I was in this relatively unique position of having a mayor who was interested in learning more about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The community.
Speaker 2: --the, the larger community--right--to put it that way, and a commissioner who didn't know a lot about New York, to begin with but who was, you know, in some ways, great for me because the first time I took something to him, as I mentioned, he just took out his pen and--I mean he read it, but he just signed it; he didn't have a back and forth with any questions. So, it was a chance for, for me to--both deep in my own knowledge and understanding of things, and the people who worked for Lindsay were pretty savvy folk around New York State.
Story_ID: 640701
Speaker 1: And I then--I'm also working to get the police department [New York City Police Department], in all of its forms, to comport with what the expectations are of that department by the people of the city [New York, New York], and it's absolutely--it's fascinating work to begin with, and the hierarchy in the department was such that--again--and this is a strange thing to say, but I, I really believe that my basketball history (laughter) was a supplement to their deciding whether they were going to cooperate and assist, and all the rest of it, with this deputy commissioner, or they're gonna stonewall you and you're gonna have to fight every step of the way. So I ended up getting on pretty well, including the fact that there had been some legitimate complaints within the department about the treatment the special units was invoking on police officers themselves, you know--a whole generation of conversation about that. And what we decided was to provide a bill of rights for the police officers, vis-a-vis the department. And I did that on the basis that if we could get that established with the department, so its members feel protected, it would make it easier to get that established for the public at large in dealing with the department, you know; so this is the, the logic behind it all. And so, with the help of Lindsay's people and Herb (Unclear), and a number of other people, we, we get this Civilian Complaint Review Board idea up and running, and we get a former--a, a lawyer--African American--is the first director of that, whose name escapes me at the moment, but you--we can look it up. And it gets off to a, a pretty good start because suddenly this cadre of police officers who were protected, in a sense, from the outrageous behavior of parts of the department, were now being asked to, in effect, acknowledge the right of citizens to have a similar protection from outrageous behavior by any in the department. It didn't buy support from everybody, to be sure, but it was enough to get it off the ground and--what else? And then there were the--you know, the riots happened, there was a blackout that--you know, it was--
Speaker 2: Right. Right, right, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Everything was going on at this--roughly the same period. And I actually go up to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] when the student boycott occurs and they're all panicked up there because they don't know what to do with it--about it. And I spent a fair amount of time up there with some of the leadership folk, and talking to some of the students, too. So--anyway, it was an interesting time.
Story_ID: 640702
Speaker 1: Before the tape ended, you know, you were talking about going up to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], you know, when they had their disturbance there, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --I'm talking about in the city [New York, New York] itself, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --like Lindsay [John Lindsay] is--he's id- some people would call him idealistic--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know. You're at a police department [New York City Police Department] that's largely Irish--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you have the--he is about to attack Tammany Hall that has really ruled the Democratic Party, and, and then the black community--I wanna know who are those voices that are--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --are being heard. And you--and do people know who you are at this point? I'm talking about in the black community; do they know who you are? Like do the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think some do, I think, but--you know, it depends whether you're--if you're on the Harlem [New York, New York] side you've got one (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm talking about Percy--I'm talking about the, the--you know, the Per- I'm talking about the Percy Suttons--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Percy--Percy; oh, yeah, they know because they tried a--I tried a case against them (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --in the U.S. attorney's office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So you're not on their side?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, but then it was--it was easy.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No, no--I'm kidding, I'm kidding (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It, it was easy, yeah. It was--no, it was, it was--it was fun. I mean they--
Speaker 1: But just--if you would provide some context because that's important.
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's all happening kind of at, at--almost at the same time, you know? You also had the blackouts occurred, so you, you lost power in the city for a, a stretch. But the Columbia thing, I have to go back and see what the--confirm the dates, but I mean they've got it up there at Columbia (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But, but I want before the Columbia; I want the, the police department and the civilian review board which--those are new types of things even occurring.
Speaker 2: Yeah, for us--that's right, and it's--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, 'cause police don't wanna be supervised.
Speaker 2: I know, and it was--it was an interesting time. I'm trying to think about some specifics that--I think the big one I mentioned a moment ago was the creation of what we call the bill of rights for--
Speaker 1: For the police.
Speaker 2: Within the department, yes, so that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But the bill of rights for the police or the bill of rights for people? I--
Speaker 2: Well, but it--it'll start--people officially had it, right? They have a [U.S.] Bill of Rights. What we're talking about is how do you get enforcement of that at a level that has impact on people?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: But I mean--but you have a level of visibility. I mean, you know. Go on--but you were talking about the bill of rights, okay.
Speaker 1: Just that--it's like everybody is churning at almost the same time and, and I would--I wouldn't argue it but I would surmise that having a bill of rights inside the department was a positive circumstance which allowed the conversation to take place about having a Civilian Complaint Review Board and not have all of the department walk out on you which is, you know, one--one of the risks when you do something like that. So, to my mind, we got off to a, a very good start that, you know--we had to make some changes on the leadership of the complaint board, but nothing monumental. I think the department--though they would never admit it--came to realize that they were not being, you know--what's the right word for it?
Speaker 2: Targeted? They weren't being targ- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that, that, that their role was understood in a more serious way than might otherwise have been the case, and that they had, within the department, some actors whose behavior warranted correction, and--and stopped.
Story_ID: 640703
Speaker 1: And the guy we got to--the first head of it on the administrative side was an African American guy who had had some police experience. I don't remember his name at the moment, but he was one of the staff who were running this little agency. So I'm feeling pretty good about the ability to access the department [New York City Police Department] and to elevate the people who recognize the department's responsibility to the public, and at the same time that the department will respect the rights of the officers themselves, so if they get into a difficulty, they're not left out on a limb or are only their organization can stand up for them. So, I don't know what the reaction--I don't remember if I did know--was to all of it, but I think there was a--to the extent they blamed anyone for this evolving policy, it was probably Lindsay [John Lindsay] because they saw him as kind of ignoring their--the risks that they run their rights the way they were being abused by the department itself from time to time, and so the ability to constrain the department in its enforcement of its rules and regulations against the officers turns out, in my mind, to have been an integral part of getting at least some movement on the part of the officers to respect the public in the same way that the public would want to be respected. So, I saw those as linked, and I'm not sure everyone would agree with what I just said, but that was my thinking at the time. And, and I was--you know the--it got off to a little rocky first start; I can't--I don't remember all the details anymore, but I think it, it began to, to take roots and I have to believe that the fact that I was an ex-jock gave me a particular relationship with them; not deserved, but I had it anyway (laughter) because it was the way they responded, and I'm now generalizing, obviously, to the way the department operated. And, and it wasn't--and my rationale to myself was that this is a rational way to help the public because these are human beings you're talking about, and they've got this ability to do great damage to people.
Speaker 2: So the police commissioner [Howard R. Leary], he continued to be hands off during the whole time? 'Cause didn't he come under a lot of criticism himself (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He's, he's--well, he didn't know the city [New York, New York]; it was--you know, he--so, I mean--
Speaker 2: Right, so, so people, people don't like people who don't know the city.
Speaker 1: --so, I--you know, it was, it was hard for him, and he had a style--he (whispers) spoke like this.
Speaker 2: He had a--
Speaker 1: (Whispers) He spoke like this, (muttering).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And we would go to lunch--he and I would go to lunch at the Italian place right outside the--around the corner from the department and, you know, it was--what can I say? It was--on one level I can say it was fascinating, challenging, exciting, but I knew I wasn't gonna do that forever--that was, was clear.
Story_ID: 640704
Speaker 1: You were the first African American to have that position [deputy police commissioner]. Who else was senior in Lindsay's [John Lindsay] administration who was African American?
Speaker 2: Oh, there's one--there a couple of people. I can't think of their name at the moment.
Speaker 1: I should know it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'll think of it. It's, it's--there two. Anyway--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --there are--there are some people who, who were there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for Lindsay. I may even have it in my office.
Speaker 1: Okay. I wish Matthew [Matthew Hickey] could look it up.
Speaker 2: How are we doing?
Speaker 1: Okay. So--but you felt you grew in that position though--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) tremendously like someone--you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--but how are you viewed? How are you being viewed by the black leadership? That's--you're, you're not telling that part of it, and that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah. I, I think it's--what can I say?
Speaker 1: Like [HistoryMaker] Basil Paterson and, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think the guys are all--I--what can I, I can only speculate. You have to ask some of them.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I think there was--I don't know the timing of this, but I, I gave a talk at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], and Basil and the guys were there in the kind of front row. I can't now remember what the topic was even, but anyway, it was one of those interesting sessions, what you go through. But I would have to guess; I would say that--I tried a case against Percy [Percy Sutton] and his brother [Oliver C. Sutton]; I think I remember one of those cases (laughter), but it--at least on the surface it seemed fine to me; it, it, it didn't have any--I mean there was no discernable difference than the difference you would normally find between Manhattan [New York] people and Brooklyn [New York] people, okay? (Laughter) That, that was always there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, Brook- but let me--can I ask this? Are Brooklyn people--there's a lot of Caribbean Brooklyn people--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and I--are they more-so than, than Harlem [New York, New York] Brooklyn people? I mean Harlem--I'm sorry--Harlem, Harlem black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yes, Caribbean, more Brooklyn--more Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: More, more, more Brooklyn.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that is a difference in and of itself.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. No, it--and, you know, we would--on the basketball level we played, you know, the different boroughs. Harlem had tournaments up there that we would go up to from Brooklyn and play in, and so I didn't feel--I--that's a good question, but I didn't feel any, any special animosity or anything.
Speaker 1: You didn't? Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't feel that.
Speaker 1: But you may not have known; they may be looking and saying, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, because--or grumbling or doing whatever, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I'm sure, you know. With Columbia, too; I mean you--to take some of the heat for Columbia, too, so--
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 640705
Speaker 1: I wanna ask another question. Now, have you--are you--have--at this point--I know that you and Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] knew each other when you were young and in the drum and bugle corps and at the church (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --but have you maintained your relationship? 'Cause he went off to Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] to attend school, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's--we've stayed friends. He, he's not been well of (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know, but were you--during this period of time?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah; we, we were in touch--
Speaker 1: Okay, that's so nice.
Speaker 2: --and he was, he was wonderfully ambitious, you know?
Speaker 1: 'Cause he--at this point--I mean when he came--you know, 'cause he was a--I think he was a Green Beret [U.S. Army Special Forces Command], you know; he was in the service (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and then he came back and got involved in selling, you know, real estate and--
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And then he, he becomes part of the, the--you know he's, he's there with Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, and it's--he and Bobby Kennedy are the ones who dragged me into the Bedford-Stuyvesant [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Right. And that's why I was ask--
Speaker 2: That's right--oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause, you know, I knew that he got recruited; I was just wondering--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --at one point. So, can you--let's talk about that. So, he's one--so, I mean when I--when you say you're in contact, what does that mean? Do you know--I mean--and--
Speaker 2: Socially, mainly I'd say.
Speaker 1: Socially.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you're, you're in--you're in contact with him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and so--okay, so (laughter)--I just--
Speaker 2: I, I know; it doesn't--it, it doesn't fit easily into a picture; it's, it's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, the two of you are real--two different personalities, too.
Speaker 2: It's a complex picture, you know? But--
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, that's why I would like to know some of the complexity of the picture.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, for example, when Earl was arranging his magazine [Black Enterprise] when he was beginning all that stuff--
Speaker 1: It was a newsletter at that point, right?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but he gets around to the--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --the magazine, and he's--he wants access to different potential users of his service, and he doesn't hesitate to call you, ask for help (laughter); he doesn't stop.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: None of that stops him and, and that was always fine; I mean it was never a problem that I was aware of. Then his sons [HistoryMaker Earl "Butch" Graves Jr., John Graves and Michael Graves]--and he had a great wife [Barbara Graves], fun to be around, and the sons then grow up and go into college, and they're playing basketball and they're doing all sorts of, of, of things, and I--something around here from them. It may be down in the other office. I'll, I'll give it to you. It's a, it's a publication that he put out in which he has pictures of Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] and myself, and this one and the next one--it's a whole issue that he put out on that, and I went down to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] with him a couple a times but, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But--you know--but this is--so when do you meet Vernon? That's what I'm also wondering. Do you meet Vernon--
Speaker 2: In 1972.
Speaker 1: Not 'til 1972?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 640706
Speaker 1: Let's go to Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York]. So you (cough)--so really, at this point--so Earl [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] has gone to work for Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in, in his presidential campaign (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --when Bobby is--
Speaker 2: He's getting ready to run.
Speaker 1: --when he's getting ready to run--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, he, he gets killed, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. That--that happens a little--a little later (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Later--a little later.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, but during--are you in much contact when he's campaigning?
Speaker 2: My deal with Kennedy, at his request, was that I not do anything with his campaign because I was by then running this Bedford-Stuyvesant operation, you see (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I see. So wait a minute--
Speaker 2: They come to see me--
Speaker 1: So tell me how you got chosen that--so--
Speaker 2: Yeah. It's interesting.
Speaker 1: So you're working as a deputy police [deputy police commissioner].
Speaker 2: Then I, I give up that; I don't know--I don't remember what I do immediately, but either there's a change in leadership at the department [New York City Police Department], or--
Speaker 1: So you leave.
Speaker 2: I leave the department, yeah.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And I have a, a--I have an office that I open up, you know--a small office in Midtown [Midtown Manhattan, New York, New York], and I'm kind of thinking about what next to do, and Earl is--I'm trying--the dates are hard to remember precisely, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, this--I mean when--I can give you--I can give you some dates. I don't know about--but you go--you join a Bed-Stuy in 19--I think '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967] sounds right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think--but this is after Tom Jones [Thomas R. Jones] has resigned his chair. Is that, is--
Speaker 2: No, he's, he's still there, he's still there when I go.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you go probably in sixty--I mean you may go--
Speaker 2: I, I (laughter)--they--I read in the newspaper about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because it--'cause I--the, the--Kennedy and Javits [Jacob K. Javits] established the Bed-Stuy in December 9th, 1966.
Speaker 2: That's right. And I hear about it. I read about it first; I don't think anyone called me on it. And I then read in either the Amsterdam [New York Amsterdam News] or the--and The New York Times, or whatever, that Bobby has gone to Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York] and is talking to the leadership there, and is being somewhat vilified by them, and the great sentence I remember is that, either, "Don't walk through our misery to a headline," is the, is the chant that he hears from Elsie Richardson and others in Central Brooklyn [New York]--in Bedford-Stuyvesant when he goes there. And Bobby commits to them in Bedford-Stuyvesant that he will not walk through their misery to a headline but will see their misery and try and figure out an appropriate way to respond to it. And it's in that process of trying to figure out an appropriate way to respond that he and Earl Graves, who works for him, and is from Bedford-Stuyvesant, and Tom something or other--I forget his last name, who works--runs the Bobby office here in New York [New York], are out trying to figure out next steps, and Tom Jones is there, and a number of other--
Speaker 1: And Tom Jones is African American.
Speaker 2: African--oh, yeah, he's African American. And several other of the leadership; in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area, Elsie Richardson being prominent among them, and there's an article that appears in The New York Times in which they--the local people are quoted as saying, "Don't walk through our misery to a headline. If you're gonna come and see our misery, then you gotta be prepared to offer something to address those conditions."
Story_ID: 640707
Speaker 1: And Bobby [Robert F. Kennedy] commits to finding a solution to the major problems that beset the people in Central Brooklyn [New York]. He first looks at Harlem [New York, New York] and he looks at a couple of other places, but he ends up focused on Brooklyn, and he goes out and gets the best leadership he can find in the finance and related communities and the, the list is quite extraordinary--the head of IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], the head of Citibank [Citibank, N.A.], the--you name it, they're all assembled, and this idea of creating a development corporation that is going to focus on Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York]. And then the question is focus on Bedford-Stuyvesant, but the people of Bedford-Stuyvesant are not involved in your organization, so there ensues an effort to create a local organization that would combine with the business group to address the problems of Bedford-Stuyvesant, and a search begins to find that person, and they don't agree on any of the people they've talked to. And the local Bedford-Stuyvesant people have a person in mind who they think can do the job that's needed. By then, Kennedy has--and Javits [Jacob K. Javits] joins him on this--Kennedy has his own view of the competence of the person they have in mind. And so I get a call from somebody on the Kennedy side, asking if I would come to a meeting at which time--and I, I go to the meeting and I hear about this idea that Kennedy has, and the steps that have been taken up to that point, and where they then are, and they need someone who can help take it closer to a reality than just an idea, and would I be willing to meet with some of the local folk. So, I'm kind of intrigued by this idea, and I said, "Sure, I'll, I'll meet with 'em." So I go to Brooklyn and meet with Tom Jones [Thomas R. Jones], Elsie Richardson--you name it; there--there're about a dozen of them, and we meet, and I'm just there to meet them. They launch into a, a barrage that they, you know, you know, "What makes you think you're qualified to--?" I mean that's Elsie's first question to me. We laughed about--almost up to her death, and so I explained a little bit about my own background that, you know, that I'm from Bedford-Stuyvesant, and on and on. And it becomes apparent to me that they have someone else in mind for the job, so I double back to Kennedy and the group and I say, "I, I think they have their own candidate for this position, so," and then Kennedy says, "Well, please--we don't think that person can do the job," on and on. By then, Kennedy has already assembled twelve executives of major companies--IBM, Citibank (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's Watson [Thomas Watson, Jr.] from IBM then.
Speaker 1: Watson--you name--it's, it's a, it's an incredible array that he's got there--Andre Meyer of Lazard [Lazard Freres and Company, LLC], and the rest. So, I'm sit- I'm asked, "Please don't withdraw yourself from this while we search for someone that may be amenable to both parties." So, I actually spent a little time with Elsie and the group, and they go to Connecticut to look at some of the work that Ed Logue [Edward J. Logue] had done in Connecticut, because by now, the business group has already been in touch with a lot of the resource people around the country. The community hasn't had a word in any of that, so the people from Pratt Institute [New York, New York], Andre Meyer, the great finance guy, I.M. Pei, the architect--you name it, they're all--because Kennedy is gonna--is the next president of the Unites States; obviously, that has a lot to do with it. This is an important problem notwithstanding that, and it's a great opportunity for them.
Story_ID: 640708
Speaker 1: Local folk, in the meantime, are so busy banging their heads against each other that this thing [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York] is growing by leaps and bounds, and they don't have any real say in it. So they say to me, "Don't--please don't withdraw your name," and I say, "Well, I didn't put my name in to begin with so I don't have to withdraw it, I'm just--I'm here; if I can be helpful it's all right." So, it goes on for another six months or so, and then they double back and say, "Well, if you don't do it, it's not gonna go." And so I say, "Well, I will do it for two years to get it started, if we can work through the issue with the, the local leadership." And by then you, you're really got--there's a list of names of the people that he had assembled--that Bobby [Robert F. Kennedy] had assembled. And I go out to Brooklyn [New York] and, you know, sit down with the local folk and, you know, half, half on the attack, half laughing a little bit, and I'm saying, "You know, it's, it's strange to have to defend yourself in a community that you grew up in, you know? What is--what do you think this is about for me? Tell me what you think--what's my benefit out of this that you're troubled by?" "No, no, it's not that, it's--," you know, then you got Sonny Carson [Robert "Sonny" Carson], and you got all the--you got all the, the, the Central Brooklyn [New York] people with their own agenda on this matter, and--and then on top a that, the, the, the business group up here has to have some of its own leadership, so I'm saying, "You know, you created something that is fraught with difficulties, and if I take this on, I wanna be at every meeting that takes place among the business group and invite as many of the business group as wants to meet any meeting that takes place in the local community. But I can't go out there and purport to represent the people of the community and you're back here doing whatever it is you're doing." So--and I mean it's all calm; it's not, not hostile because, again, I'm not looking for a job. So, anyway we go back and forth, and they finally say, "Well, if you don't do this, it's not gonna happen." So, I say, "Okay, then I will do it for two years to get it started, by which time you ought to be able to find the right person to take this thing on to the next levels. But you have to tell me how I'm supposed to explain to the community why you have the money, and you have all this authority, and I'm supposed to be doing the work; that doesn't work for me. And I don't think it'll work for that community. So, if I'm gonna do it, the community's gonna establish its own organization, its own leadership, its own financing, and I will take responsibility on the finance side to see to it that it is done the way we all ideally would like to see it done. But I won't do it any other way. And you have to tell me how do I explain John Doar," whom they had engaged to work for them, "to this community? What does he bring to the table that you don't already have?" So we had a lot of (makes noise). So anyway, we get started and, of course, I end up spending ten years there and, and I'm proud to say it is alive and well today, and everybody feels good about it.
Story_ID: 640709
Speaker 1: Well, here, you tell your story, and then I do wanna understand about distribu- D and R [sic. Bedford-Stuyvesant Development and Services Corporation, New York, New York], because there were two parallel--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It was a, it was a complicated beginning.
Speaker 2: It was. Well, you--imagine, you're in a room, and you have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you say yes you're gonna do it.
Speaker 2: I say yes. I say I'm gonna do it for a short stint, and then I--
Speaker 1: For two years.
Speaker 2: --stay ten years. But it's helpful, I think, to--you may already have this, but Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] reaches out to a number of people that he thinks can be helpful in this process--the head of IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], the head (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Watson [Thomas Watson, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Watson. The head of Citibank [Citibank, N.A.]--
Speaker 1: Right. Who is CBS--
Speaker 2: CBS, you got--Bill Paley [William S. Paley] is in there.
Speaker 1: Bill Paley.
Speaker 2: Who else do they have on there?
Speaker 1: You have a C. Douglas Dillon, who's a former head of the Tennessee Valley Authority [sic.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Douglas Dillon, former--right.
Speaker 1: You have a David Lilienthal [David E. Lilienthal].
Speaker 2: David Lilienthal, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And Jacob Merrill Kaplan and James Oates [James F. Oates], and Benno Schmidt [Benno C. Schmidt, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Benno Schmidt. And Benno becomes a major player in this exercise. He's a--I mean there's a whole digression there about Benno Schmidt which is, in itself, worth a moment. He gets recruited--he's a professor at, at a college in the South, I can't remember which one, and John Hay Whitney was a prisoner of war, and comes back to the states after the war [World War II, WWII] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I know who it is.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: I know--the person I was talking to was--about, was Milton Gal--
Speaker 2: Milton Galamison [Milton A. Galamison].
Speaker 1: 'Cause you two didn't get along.
Speaker 2: Well--but I had--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: One of the, one of the reasons we didn't get along was that the money he wanted from the federal government they would only give it if I agreed to oversee the money.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And (laughter) so I, I had to do a report on his utilization of funds to the feds which--
Speaker 1: 'Cause he was a minister, right?
Speaker 2: He was a minister, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm. He had been at Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] and--right--he went to Lincoln, okay, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah--no, it was--it was no fun in those, those jobs. But in any event, you get this collection of highly successful business types who are impressed by Kennedy and his commitment, and then you've got Al Vann [Albert Vann], Sonny Carson [Robert "Sonny" Carson], you got a bunch of the local guys, and all the local organizations that were getting some funding from some aspects of the government, you know. Some of them get their nose out of joint because this new wave has come in, so we invite Al Vann, Sonny Carson to join the board of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation [New York, New York], and Elsie Richardson and a number of the predominant people who--all of whom became great friends but who, at that time, were antagonistic to the idea and to Kennedy's--and Javits [Jacob K. Javits] not so much, but Kennedy in a take charge way, and then he gets killed, and this fear that it's gonna collapse, but instead of collapsing it really expands, and it's still functioning to this day. But it was a, it was a--an understandable though difficult road that had to be navigated because the local folk had felt that if anything positive was going to be happening in the community, they should be the ones to do it because, after all, they've been there the longest, and they're the most diligent in their behavior and understanding of things, but none of that would have worked. And so you get Elsie, who I think was--she's now deceased, but she was fabulous. And, to her credit, you know; we would laugh about it years later, that remind me what a hard time they gave me when I went with them up to New England to look at some of Ed Logue's [Edward J. Logue] work and some of the I.M. Pei work, and they'd gotten all these architects involved, and I said, "All of that's great, but where's the community?" And so, ten years later and it's now fifty-five years, and that corporation is alive and well, and still doing good work in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York], so we're all feeling pretty good about it.
Story_ID: 640710
Speaker 1: So, tell me what you--the task was ahead of you [at the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York] (cough) and--you know, 'cause Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy]--I mean Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York] was--Bed-Stuy was sort of viewed as the--one of the blights on society in the armpits, you know; I mean it was--right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And there were terrific social and economic and edu- problems of education and employment there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know, I--Ernesta Procope [HistoryMaker Ernesta G. Procope], she had, in her interview, talked--'cause she had been there and left (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, because she said all these people on welfare were coming in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, and so she still had real estate there. So I just--you need to provide the context for that that was part of the '60 Minutes' special, you know, that--
Speaker 2: She--yeah, there were tracks--people were on somewhat different tracks that--the big movement is--I would classify it--is when--with all of the outside high profile people and the like, when we started the home improvement program [Community Home Improvement Program] and invited young people from Bedford-Stuyvesant to learn the skills associated with home management and renovation and improvement, and that program became so popular that we had to hold a lottery each year to pick the blocks that would be done that following year, and all the work was done--supervised, but done by young people, and you began to see young people of African descent with their hats on in the park, and the hats had Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration on them. And so you get block associations giving thank you parties for young people who had worked on their housing; you get people from the federal government coming and, and actually being mesmerized by the transformation of this community in the hands of young people of color, boys and girls; they wore their caps in the park in the summer to show their association. The, the tragedy--and we got home credit; we set up a mortgage pool program for people to get the financing they needed. The partial tragedy--and it's, it's, it's human nature--is that the neighborhood became so popular that you have an influx of people from outside the area coming in to buy brownstones in these communities. Well, if you paid thirty thousand dollars for your brownstone when you bought it umpteen years ago and you now have had part of it renovated and fixed up by the local effort, and someone comes along and offers you, you know, five hundred thousand for it, you know, a lot of people grab it and, and that's what is happening. Now, I say that's human nature, and you can't do anything about that, except to be certain that everyone who is grabbing at the, the big number, is aware of what that number will or will not buy when they go out of this community. Because if you--if you paid sixty thousand dollars for your home and someone is offering you five hundred thousand for the home, your first instinct is to wanna take it; well, but then what, is always the question, so we just went tooth and nail with people to be sure they knew what they were doing--no offense to the people who wanted to buy in. That's fine--come on in, but there--there's been some transitioning. Al Vann [Albert Vann] remains in his house, Sonny Carson [Robert "Sonny" Carson] probably still has his, and a lot of people--you know, the next generation has come along, and they got the property from their parents, and now someone is offering a, a big number, there's a propensity to say yes to the number.
Story_ID: 640711
Speaker 1: 'Cause that is more recent. I wanna go back to what--'cause Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York] is--you grew up in Bed-Stuy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And it had changed. It had done some change--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from the time that you graduated to go to, to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And when you came back to be head [of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York]. So, can you talk about the changes, and what was there? And then what the tasks were in front of you.
Speaker 2: Well, the big task was that the street gangs had really entrenched themselves.
Speaker 1: So the street gangs that were chasing you, and that you could manipulate with your bike, or run away from--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they--they've all gotten older and they (laughter), they've gone on to do other things (laughter), but their, their successors were--and I think that the drug trafficking and a lot of that stuff began to be a little more present in the community than it had been in the past (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then New York [New York] itself, in the '70s [1970s], was having all--there were financially--you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. It was--it was a mess.
Story_ID: 640712
Speaker 1: And I think the, the big change was the focus--well, Al Vann [Albert Vann] is a major player in all of this, because he's then a city councilman, and then he's a state--
Speaker 2: State assembly, right?
Speaker 1: --assemblyman. And, and he's an ex-Marine [U.S. Marine Corps] and he's, and he's really a solid, extremely capable guy, and he's working. And we, we get the Medgar Evers College established in Central Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's--that--those negotiations took place, in part, in Bill Paley's [William S. Paley] office at CBS with the representatives of the community and the D.C. [Washington, D.C.] people because the question was where should this college go? And Bedford-Stuyvesant won out on that one, and I think they're all very proud of it. And so there's a, there's a level of appreciation and comfort that people have derived from that start up going all the way back. It's still not without challenges to people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And acrimony, right?
Speaker 1: And, and some persists, I would say.
Speaker 2: First of all are you--you're not--this is the first time you're dealing with bus- you're not a businessperson first, yourself--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --and you're a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And these are very heavy hitting people--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --so you have that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You also have money coming in from the federal government into the urban areas, right? So that, that's helpful, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And you--and then--but you were talking about the lack of community voices. How, first, do you get those two or three; like there's the D and R [sic. Bedford-Stuyvesant Development and Services Corporation, New York, New York]. I--it's confusing, the structure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it, it, it is (laughter). It was confusing even to those who were working in the--
Speaker 2: So how are you--how are you balancing that? And--
Speaker 1: Well, it's--first of all, I don't stay just two years, I stay ten years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ten, but--
Story_ID: 640713
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I'm talking about in the--let's talk about the stages of those ten years.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, I think the big effort was the mobilization of the young people; not the old people but the young people.
Speaker 1: So, so, so who, who spearheaded the mobilization, the young people?
Speaker 2: Well, we have staff on the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation [New York, New York]. Ben Glascoe [Benjamin A. Glascoe] is one of those people who--whose son [Keith Glascoe], by the way, was one of the firemen who was killed some years ago. But anyway, Ben is a super citizen--still there, still on the board of Restoration.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Fifty-five years later he's still there. Al Vann [Albert Vann], still in the same house he was in before; still active in the community. Elsie [Elsie Richardson] has died, others have died. Weeksville [Brooklyn, New York] gets renovated anew, largely out of Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York] and the people Bedford-Stuyvesant has brought to assist in it. So, you have a--I think you have a relatively healthy community with pretty good leadership; I won't say it's perfect, but it's not the one off place that Harlem [New York, New York] would have liked to have it be; it's much more than that, it's much broader than that--much deeper than that. And now it's more racially diversified than it's been in the last fifty years--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and that's now--problem for some people who lunged at the offer to buy their property is that I think many of them were comparing the offer to what their cost had been.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: That's only one measure. The other measure you have to say is, "What can I buy with what I'm now getting?"
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I think that second half of the equation got shortchanged in some cases, not in all.
Speaker 1: I see. But that's later; that's in the--that's more in the last what ten, twenty years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, ten, fifteen years, twenty years.
Speaker 1: You know, so they, they sold, thinking it was a lot of money, but then they couldn't really, you know, put it--'cause everything had, had blown up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--but it--the sales are still--I mean they're--it's happening now.
Speaker 1: I mean isn't it like--I don't know; people paid $1, 2 million, I mean, for a brownstone.
Speaker 2: I know--that's right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) I mean maybe even two; I'm saying one--I think it's like--
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's a million two [$1.2 million] that I've seen some of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 640714
Speaker 1: But I wanna go back to what you accomplished, and how you accomplished that, and who was involved. And like what was the dream--what was the vision for what that could be? And what was--that's--let's start with vision.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, the vision was that home ownership mattered, and the quality of life was influenced by home ownership and decent education, decent schools. The Billie Holiday Theatre [New York, New York] was also a way of attracting the talent that existed in the community, adding to the aspirations people had as to what was possible in their lives. I think all of that remains, and now the neighborhood [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York] is in the--I don't know if this is literally accurate, but I suspect it's close to it. It's gone from originally being only partially African American with a substantial Caucasian population that migrates out, and you get more and more people of color coming in, and now you have more and more Caucasians coming in. You're, you're still not back to where you were in the past, but it's in some ways, to my mind, a better reflection on the quality of life of all of the people, black, white, brown, what--what's the difference? So, if you didn't sell and run, you're now in a very comfortable position financially, and a pretty diverse community socially.
Speaker 1: And the ups- increasingly upscale community.
Speaker 2: Upscale, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So it, it's, it's kind of win-win. It's interesting that some member of the Kennedy family, I think to this day, remains on the board of Restoration [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York]. That's--they've stayed with it throughout. I would say it--it's kind of a, it's a ten strike as far as anything you can compare it to because it is--it's gone through these, these cycles, you know, the Irish were there, the Italians were there, the blacks were there, the--this was there, Hispanics were there, and now it's a community, and pretty well established. I lament only one thing in this whole picture, and that is that we fought like the blazes to get the cable television franchise for that part of Central Brooklyn [New York], thanks to help from John Hay Whitney, who put up the money for the engineering study, and we got that. And about ten years ago, twelve years ago, I guess they were in financial difficulty and they sold their ownership in that franchise to the guy [Charles Dolan] who runs, runs it in New York [New York] and who had the other half of it in Brooklyn--I forget his name.
Speaker 1: Was that--that's not Time Warner [sic.].
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was it Time Warner, or was it--
Speaker 2: No, it's--
Speaker 1: All--but all that's changed now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but I think it was--oh, god, it was a family--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) there was a fam- Cablevision [Continental Cablevision, Inc.; Comcast MO Group, Inc.]. Was it Cablevision?
Speaker 2: Could be, but--
Speaker 1: I can't remember.
Speaker 2: --but that was a--that was a lifeline that we, we worked really hard to get, and that got lost.
Story_ID: 640715
Speaker 1: So, tell me, what were the first--let's say two to four years spent doing? I mean--and how did D and R [sic. Bedford-Stuyvesant Development and Services Corporation, New York, New York] interact with the rest of the board, and what--did--how long did they stay in existence?
Speaker 2: They stayed--to their credit, they stayed a, a long time; they stayed--I don't know--maybe differing members at different points, but John Doar finally gave up and went off to do something else and he--there was a merger, basically, of the two entities, so that you have business leadership in the restoration organization itself [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York]; that's a very diversified board that they have, black, white, brown, and pretty high profile people. Some of us still remember the history and the role that I.M. Pei and some of the other architects performed, and we've got a couple of architects now who were of African descent who were students back in those days who are now practicing architects, and a young guy who was out of Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], African American, who came to work for us in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York] at a--as he was finishing a program at Yale. I had gone up and spoken to the students and--anyway, he ended up wanting to come and work for us, which he did, and he spent about fifteen years there, and then went off to Cummins Engine Company [Cummins Inc.] because Irwin Miller [J. Irwin Miller] and that group had opportunities for him, and he's now very successful and very interested in Bedford-Stuyvesant still, even though it's many years later.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: We just had a meeting about three weeks ago; I think there were fifty of us from the Bedford-Stuyvesant days having lunch together. So it's been--I think it's changed a lot of lives for the better. They're gonna reopen the Billie Holiday Theatre [New York, New York] that we built there; it's now, I think, going to reopen in the next week or two. I think--and the guy who's running things now [Colvin W. Grannum] is very able, and a lawyer by training--good athlete (laughter), and he keeps saying it's time to, to leave, but I think he's now the longest serving CEO of the place (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Had a--and--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And very interesting guy.
Speaker 1: But now--you, as president--you raised sixty-three million [dollars] during your ten years--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in funding.
Speaker 2: But does it also say in there that I signed every check?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No, it doesn't say you signed it.
Speaker 2: That's the fact. I said, if it's gonna go wrong--
Speaker 1: I need to know what's going on.
Speaker 2: --I, I--I'm gonna take the hit, so I'm gonna be responsible for it. And they're doing very well now.
Speaker 1: Right. So, so there were three apartment complexes--the two hundred thousand square foot shopping center [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Plaza, New York, New York], renovating four hundred brownstones, the Billie Holiday Theatre you've talked about (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: A mortgage pool so people could--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but--120 businesses.
Story_ID: 640716
Speaker 1: I'm just wondering what were some of your hardest fights [at the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York]? And what are you most proud of, or what were you regretful about? But what are--what would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. I don't, I don't have--I'm, starting, starting backwards. I don't, I don't have any regrets that I--that I can think of. I'm proud of what I see, and I go to their event every year that--and it's kind of fascinating to hear them talk about what they're, they're doing. And I, I did go and meet with the staff; this was about three years ago, at Colvin's [Colvin W. Grannum] request, and so I spent a day up there maybe three or four years ago. And it was great because they all had questions about the earlier period, and to see how unique their situation is or is not, depending on how things were in the past. So, it was kind of fun to talk to them about some of that. I think there's a lot to be proud of, and I take my hat off to the team that's there now. And they still call, I'd say, every other month or so, with a kind of update, or if there's some new issue that they wanna bounce off. It's--I don't--I don't have any regrets about it at all, which is hard to say about most things in life (laughter).
Story_ID: 640717
Speaker 1: So how did you get to know Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Mike Sviridoff [Mitchell Sviridoff], who was at the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], knew of Vernon's work in Georgia, and he obviously knew of my work here in New York [New York], and he said, "You two guys ought to know each other." So, he arranged a dinner; the three of us had dinner, and as Vern would say, "We've been going steady ever since" (laughter). We still--well, we try and talk every other week anyway, and I go over and have lunch with him at his place, and we smile at some of the history and some of what's going on, and I think we all--we both feel good, you know. You're aging, too, which is a, a pain (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: It's a--you still wanna believe you're invincible and all that, but it's not true--
Speaker 1: Well, everybody--
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: --I mean every--right, everybody ages, but still the fact that--what was it about the--what was it about it that you liked about each other immediately?
Speaker 2: Because you've be- you've become--you became fast friends--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and he was--it was, you know--early days of him being at the Urban League [National Urban League]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and the transformation that happened, and then you have your--so I just--
Speaker 1: Well, we just hit it off; I can't explain it beyond that. One example--I think you may have heard it from him, but any event, we decide we're gonna take a trip to South Africa because we'd been reading all this horrible stuff about what was going on down there, and yet--and some of the companies--U.S. companies who were doing some form of business in that area, and neither of us was comfortable in being involved with a company that was also doing some work there, based on what limited knowledge we had of what was going on. And so he was at Xerox [Xerox Corporation], I was at Citi [Citibank, N.A.] at the time as a director, and we said, "We're not comfortable with this." So, both companies said, "Well, go down and take a look; we'll arrange the transportation, and anybody you wanna see when you're down there, you can do it."
Story_ID: 640718
Speaker 1: So we did; we flew to South Africa, and the South Africans were trying, at that point, to appease some of the foreign investors and the like, and so they were creating these little home--I call 'em little homeland areas, in effect making the case that the people of African descent who you saw in Johannesburg [South Africa] and elsewhere, were essentially selling their labor, and that their homes were actually in these more distant places, et cetera. So, anyway, we wanted to see what these companies were doing, and so we meet with a lot of people and listen to a lot of talk, and we go out to one of the homeland areas and get involved in a conversation with the leader of that homeland area whom I didn't know and Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] didn't know, and the guy's giving us a story about the rationalization of why they're doing what they're doing and on, and on, and on, and I'm--I guess to Vern's mind, I'm challenging him on, you know--not hostilely, but challenging him on this, and I feel this kick on my leg underneath the table, and I know immediately that's Vern who's, who's been kicking my shoulder--my foot because the argument the guy was making was, on its face, not defensible as far as I was concerned (laughter), and Vern's point was, "How the hell are we gonna get out of here?" (Laughter) "Never mind--never mind what you think about" (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So we, we end up leaving (laughter). But it was one of those I cited because it was so natural on both of our parts, and he was right to flag it, and I was right to tell this guy he wasn't pulling the wool over anybody's eyes with his talk. So anyway, that was one event on this trip. The other is, we're walking in the basement of a shopping--a commercial area, and Vern says to me, "We're being followed." And I say, "I only know one way to deal with that; let's just stop and turn around and find out what this is." So we stop, turn around, and these four or five guys come over, of African descent, and they say, "What tribe are you guys from?" And we both burst out laughing, right? And so we have his conversation with them (laughter). But he was sure we were being followed (laughter). I knew we were being followed; I thought it was the bad guys after us, not the guys who (unclear) (laughter). So that was one of those where we, we kind of laughed uproariously about it afterwards, and I guess we've been going steady ever since.
Story_ID: 640719
Speaker 1: So you leave [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York], though there was one--now, I do wanna ask you about the one foundation you were involved with was the Whitney Foundation?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, J.H. Whitney and Company. Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The J.--I'm sorry, J.H. Whitney Foundation [John Hay Whitney Foundation, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And both you and Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] were involved with that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On the board, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But what happens is that when the D and S group, the Development and Services Corporation [Bedford-Stuyvesant Development and Services Corporation, New York, New York] that Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] caused to be created, which was the, the business leadership crowd, a number of them came out to Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York] to see what work we were doing; not immediately, but as we were transforming the Sheffield Farms building [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Plaza, New York, New York] and a number of other things, and among the people who came on one of those trips was John Hay Whitney, and he was brought by Benno Schmidt [Benno C. Schmidt, Sr.], who was on the D and S board. And Benno worked for John Hay Whitney, who had been a prisoner of war, and when he came back, funded a host of education efforts in the South because he--he'd experienced inequity and all of that in the war [World War II, WWII], and he'd been a prisoner and all, so he came back with a mindset to do things that would really help the country, if not the world; and one of them was the J.H. Whitney company, Jock Whitney's foundation for African Americans in education so, you know, a host of people who got their graduate work on--from J.H. Whitney.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he had fellowships, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Academic fellowships.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he, he did that, and he also decided that the country needed another economic system to work, so he created the J.H. Whitney and Company, which was one of the first of those organization that was created right after the war. And I think having been a prisoner was a big element in his, his life. And he had been very successful in his--financially, and he funded a lot of the Hollywood--the big shows and other things and--but he was pretty focused on education as key, and that's why the J.H. Whitney funds, and foundation, and all that started to happen. And anyway, Benno Schmidt was someone that he had heard about as a brilliant lawyer--a brilliant finance person, and so Jock Whi- Whitney meets with Benno Schmidt and offers him a job, and they establish J.H. Whitney and Company, which is the--one of the early investment funds in the country, and Benno remains there all of his--until he dies, and he's really--and so Benno is on the board of the Development and Services Corporation, a la Kennedy, and so he invites Jock Whitney to come and see some of the work that's being done, and so that's when I meet Jock Whitney.
Story_ID: 640720
Speaker 1: And he calls me the next day to invite me to come to his office, and I go and he asks, you know, "What are the stumbling blocks that we're being confronted with?" And so I tell him about our pitch to the city to get a, a cable television franchise for that part of Brooklyn [New York], and he says, "Well, what will it take to get the city to respond?" I said, "Well, we'd have to demonstrate, with an engineering study, that we knew what we were talking about and that what we were proposing could be done." And he said, "What would that cost?" And he--so he gets all of that information, and then the next day he writes a check for the amount of money involved and, and so we petition the city now with our capacity having been demonstrated, and we end up getting half the franchise, and the other half goes to the guy who now operates, you know, Madison Square Garden [New York, New York] and all that whole thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Dolans, it's the Dolan family.
Speaker 1: The Dolans. They get half and we get half. Cut to ten years after I've left Bedford-Stuyvesant [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York], I learn that they had run into financial difficulty and had sold the franchise to the Dolans; that's why the Dolans ended up with that franchise. But Benno [Benno C. Schmidt, Sr.] was--and Jock Whitney [John Hay Whitney] when he--you know--people make decisions they make decisions, but it was--it was not a, a wise one, and I--if I'd known of it I--who knows? We might have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You would have interceded to try--right.
Speaker 1: --been able to dissuade them of, of that and get the money they needed from any other source. But anyway, that cost them that, that facility. But anyway, that's how he gets involved.
Story_ID: 640721
Speaker 1: And then he [John Hay Whitney] has a--because he was a prisoner of war, I think, he really came back with a passion to help the country in all of its ways. And he establishes this education fund for--particularly for African Americans, but not limited to them, but it's primarily focused on them, and it's out of the J.--John Hay Whitney Foundation [New York, New York]. And he does that; he asks me to go on his board, he asks Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] to go on his board; we both agree, and I've known him ever--well, he's now deceased, but I'm married to his daughter [Hay Whitney's stepdaughter, Kate Roosevelt Whitney]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so that's--
Speaker 2: That's sort of nice (laughter).
Speaker 1: Isn't that something (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That is something. And when did you meet her, though? That's what I'm wondering in this whole (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She says that--well, I met her, as far as I remember, when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You were serving up--
Speaker 1: I went to a meeting at her father's foundation, and she and her sister [Sara Wilford] and some other people from the West Coast were on the board, and Vern and I were on the board as well, so that's when she and I met. I was divorced, she was divorced--
Speaker 2: Was that in the '70s [1970s] or later?
Speaker 1: No, it's in the--probably in the '70s [1970s]. I, I can--I'd have to look it up, but she's (laughter)--I knew her mother [Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney] and father before I knew her because I'd gone to a, a benefit--I can't remember which one it was--and I guess they had invited me, or something. I was single at the time, so I guess I went to the--to that with them, and then met her, and she was divorced, I was divorced, she had three kids, I had four kids, you know, so, you know, we ended up saying, "Let's give it a try." And so far so good.
Speaker 2: Look at that and how you smile.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And that's really a blended family.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's--oh, that's, that's nice.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, there they are; you've got, you know, her grandfather is FDR [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], right? So you got the Republicans, you got the Democrats, you got white people, you got black people, you got brown people, you got (laughter), you've got a potpourri of, of life.
Speaker 2: It's lovely. Wow! You've got the American dream right there, and the melting pot, let's put it that way, and right there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it, it--it's working, and--
Speaker 2: It's worth--and, and patrician, too. You've got the, the leaders of the free world.
Speaker 1: Oh, it's amazing, it's amazing.
Speaker 2: And--you know, and--how did he come into the Delano Roosevelt--it was--that was in your high school or something, too; it was a (laughter)--was it okay (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I, I, I, I knew, I knew Eleanor [Eleanor Roosevelt]--didn't know her, but I--she came down to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] campus when I was a student there and talked to the students, and--
Speaker 2: I didn't know the relationship between the Roosevelts and the Whitneys, though, that's--you know, I didn't know that there was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it--I think Kate's mother was, I think, very close to--
Speaker 2: To, to the Roosevelt--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and--
Speaker 2: But they married. There was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: They marry, so--
Speaker 1: And (laughter) we went to the gathering of the, the Roosevelt clan a couple a years ago, and it's about the second or third one of those we'd been to; it's kind of fascinating 'cause, you know, the--people from all walks of life (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --with different and--differences within the Roosevelt family, you know. You got, you know, two Roosevelts as president of the country, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. That's true--
Speaker 1: -- and very different.
Speaker 2: Very different. That's right, that's right.
Story_ID: 640722
Speaker 1: Why I was asking about the foundation [John Hay Whitney Foundation, New York, New York], was, was that the first time that you had exposure to foundations? Except you had gotten money from the Ford Foundation [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you were head of the, the--
Speaker 2: Restoration [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, the Restoration.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. And Ford had come over with its trustees and, and part of its staff to look at the work we were doing, and (laughter), and that part of it is interesting because I'd end up meeting all of the trustees. And then when I leave Restoration to be on my own for a while--'cause I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You went into private practice--
Speaker 2: Private, yeah.
Speaker 1: Which is interesting. Like was that just because you didn't know what you wanted to do--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or because--private practice after you hadn't really practiced--
Speaker 2: I know, I know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in a very long time.
Speaker 2: I know. But I--you know, I, I knew that I needed a change, and it was a--Bill Paley [William S. Paley] had a, a building on 51st Street or something over there, and he, he had some space in there. I told him I was looking for a small office, so he made that available; I rented that from him, and then I'm just getting settled there and doing, you know, little odds and end things--getting started, and the Rockefeller Foundation got in touch with me about their South Africa--and whether or not I thought it made sense for them to fund a study group on policy toward South Africa. Now, now I can't explain how they got to me, but the way the system works they did. So I agreed that I would take a look at that and write a report ['Time Running Out'] for them. This is the Rockefeller Foundation. By then--by then I'm the board of the Ford Foundation.
Speaker 1: Wait a minute--wait, wait, wait, wait, wait (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, it's crazy.
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm trying to develop the chron- you--is this after you've left the restoration project? Or is this--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've left--
Speaker 1: So this--after the--you left the restoration project (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I left there--
Speaker 1: --you set up in private practice--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you also go on the--your--go on the board of the, the J- J- J.H. Whitney Foundation--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then the Rockefeller Foundation contacts you about the study.
Speaker 2: About South Africa.
Speaker 1: About South Africa (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you are also asked to go on the board of the Ford Foundation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, all around the same time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, within a year or two of each other (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A couple years of each other.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so the Rockefeller request is, is it feasible to create a project that looks at South Africa and the possibility of change there? Is it--is that a feasible thing to do, for them to do. And so I say, "Well, it's a subject I don't know a lot about at this point; I--but I'm curious about it, so I'd be happy to do a study for you." So I do--I talked to a lot of people and the experts in the field, read the literature, and I write a report for the Rockefeller Foundation. They ask me to come and attend one of their offsite meetings, two day meetings, so I'm there talking about it to the staff and to the trustees, and so this is really a feasibility study. It's not anything--it's not making any claim about the specifics of the situation, but simply that there is room for an analysis of what's going on there, and what policies ought or ought not to be pursued, et cetera. There's room for that; that's as much as I can tell them at that point.
Story_ID: 640723
Speaker 1: Mac Bundy [McGeorge Bundy] has--retires and--
Speaker 2: Retires from--
Speaker 1: From the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ford Foundation.
Speaker 1: And they go on a search for a successor, and I'm on the board but I'm not involved in the search at all. And they get three hundred, they say, or some odd number of people--names, and--
Speaker 2: I think it was even four hundred. They had a lot; it was almost four hundred (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Some--they had a lot, a lot. And they--the committee that's overseeing that, is reporting to the board the finalists that they've come up with, and the trustees--or some of them--say, "If that's all you have" (laughter), "we need to keep going on this because we don't see the right person in that group," et cetera. And--well, by then I'm on my own, I've got this Rockefeller [Rockefeller Foundation] relationship going, I've got a couple other things that I'm interested in, and sitting on a couple of boards at the time, so I'm, I'm okay. They then double back, so I go on a trip with the Ford Foundation trustees, and we look at some things in India and elsewhere where they're doing work. And anyway, we come back to a board meeting and they--the committee that's in charge of all that reports that they have not found the person they feel super comfortable with, and they'd like to enlarge the pool. I think they had three hundred names, or something like that, and then they asked me if I would agree to be interviewed. So, I say to myself, if I agree to be interviewed and I answer every question put to me in as open and honest a way as I can, and if after that they still offer me this job, it's probably a job I ought to take. And so I go to the meeting--it's on a weekend; and they ask me a lot of questions and all that. And then they're interviewing other people, too, at the time. And I go out to Manhasset [New York], actually, with Kate [Thomas' second wife, Kate Roosevelt Whitney] and her mother [Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney] and father [adoptive father, John Hay Whitney], and I'm out in Manhasset when I get a call on Sunday, would I come in? They knew where I was, so they--I go back in and they say that the board has decided that either you take it or we start over again. So, I said, "I've got this commitment to Rockefeller, I got this--." "We're at least as interested in that subject as Rockefeller is, so why don't you clean up that, and you don't have to start here immediately, you can--." I said, "It'll take me at least six months to close up my office and finish the Rockefeller stuff." So they said that was fine. So I go back out to Manhasset and tell Kate and her mother and father that (laughter), "I just got offered another job," (laughter), "so they're gonna--I'm gonna take it." So that's--so I come back in and I clean up and I go to Ford, and I get an office at Ford before I take over. Mac is still there, and I have an office up on the upper floor, and I'm cleaning out my office on the one side, and then getting ready for this job, and Bill Paley [William S. Paley] says to me when he learns that I'd taken on the--agreed to take on the Ford Foundation job, he said, "I've offered you a better job than that. Why are you doing that" (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, I said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What job had he offered you?
Speaker 1: Well, I was a, a director on his board, right? So he wanted--
Speaker 2: Right, he wanted to let--
Speaker 1: --he wanted me to go on to management, and I said, "Bill, it would be the end of our friendship if I did that, you know?" So--
Speaker 2: Why did you say that?
Speaker 1: Because I knew it was true.
Speaker 2: Because of his style?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, yes. He had already fired three people (laughter) in the time I was there, so--
Speaker 2: He was CBS in many ways.
Speaker 1: Oh, he was, he was--oh, he's also the--he's married to one of the Whitneys [sic. Babe Cushing Paley] so, you know, there was that connection as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh.
Speaker 1: It's a small world.
Story_ID: 640724
Speaker 1: But, you know, the thing is--first of all, the--you being head of the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] was extremely historic--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and viewed very--I mean that made national and international news because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, front page New York Times [The New York Times] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: You know, because for someone to--you know, to rise up to that level of a major--you know, like being--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --major foundation was, you know, huge. And--that's what I was wondering. At what point had you realized that with foundations you can set policy, you know. At what point in your, you know, at--whether it was at the Rest- you know, where they're funding you, or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, when you're on the board of J.H. Whitney [John Hay Whitney Foundation, New York, New York], or maybe not 'til you get to Ford. I mean--but your major policy es- you know you establish--you set what are gonna be agendas--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, and prioritize things basically, you know, on the foundation committee.
Speaker 2: No, that's right. That's, that's exactly true. It's a--by then I think I had already been on the--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you had been on some corporate boards (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'd been on--
Speaker 1: You were Alcoa [Alcoa Corporation].
Speaker 2: I was on Alcoa, and I was on CBS, and I was on--another one--oh, Citibank [Citibank, N.A.], yeah.
Speaker 1: See, this--I mean you have, what? (Laughter) That's industry--Alcoa's like engine- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's crazy, it's crazy, it's crazy.
Speaker 1: --and then CBS the--that's when see, media was media.
Speaker 2: It was something; yeah, it was really something.
Speaker 1: And then, you know, and then--wow. That's pretty--and, and you've got the business; that's pretty financial, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was, it was--
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So it was good. It was kind of unplanned, but it just seems to happen.
Speaker 1: Okay, but--I think it was--now, Leon Sullivan was the first to go on a corporate board. He went on GM [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company], right?
Speaker 2: GM--I think it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But then after that then Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.], I mean that's really the, the chan- you know he really changes the Urban League [National Urban League], really, in many ways, and that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I know.
Speaker 1: --by, you know, his involvement with corporate boards, but--
Speaker 2: Well, it's a whole other learning experience.
Speaker 1: It's a different world?
Speaker 2: It really is, and--
Speaker 1: And it's not like--so I mean--but--are you learning together--those of you who are--are you sort of say- I mean you at least have a friendship.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean it's, it's--well, Vern and I have never been competitors. I want what's best for him and he wants what's best for me, and it's--when he got shot I was in the Caribbean; Kate [Thomas' second wife, Kate Roosevelt Whitney] and I had just arrived in the Caribbean and there was a phone message that Vern had been shot, and we turned around and flew back to the states, and then flew back to Indiana where he was, and he was near death at that point because that shotgun or that gun that was used, it's just a miracle that it didn't take out more of his organs, but it was almost close to a year in recuperation. And there again, you know, the--Walter Wriston, who was at the bank, would stop in to see him every other day. But we would, we would laugh about it sometimes, and when the--when Vern thought we were being followed in the--South Africa (laughter), turns out they wanted to know what tribe we were from (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: They weren't following us, they just wanted (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) They were identifying--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And they weren't all that tall, and here we are up here at 6'3", or whatever it was, and, and then they're, they're saying, "First of all you're giants, and then you got on a suit, shirt and tie, and you're walking," (laughter). So--
Story_ID: 640725
Speaker 1: In many ways, this period that we're talking about is--I'm wondering, when people look at the modern day period, if the '70s [1970s], the '70s [1970s] and early '80s [1980s], but especially the '70s [1970s] will not be looked at as a very prolific period.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In many ways somewhat of a pinnacle.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We've had other firsts since then--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but there was a lot of, a lot of things happening during that period of time.
Speaker 2: Oh, boy; I agree.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, and I don't think it's been well studied yet.
Speaker 2: Not much that I've seen anyway.
Speaker 1: Unh-uh, it's not been well--I don't think people--I don't think scholars have gotten around to it--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I just don't. I think they will, but I don't think that they understand the significance of it at that point.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because it's a lot in the business, you know--business Corporate America.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: The role of the Urban League [National Urban League]. I mean all those things were, you know, really sort of important, but--so you--so tell me about the--I mean for--can we just--a little bit on those corporate boards; a little bit there--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --because I mean jewel- I think--you know people are starting to serve the (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean there're people that are on these boards, and I'm just wondering what are you learning, you know, because that's--well, you already are--you've moved into another part of society that is both black and white--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but it's white--you know, and you're accepted into that society.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It's a--how do I explain it? I would say that I was probably conscious of a lot of the puts and takes that were going on in the society at large. I didn't feel either entitled to anything in particular; I, I thought that life kind of spins its own way, and what you have control over are the--your own behavior and the things that you care about. Other people may or may not care about similar things, or the same thing, or--but I've never had any difficulty, and I've been on different kinds of boards, you know, both for-profit and not-for-profit. But even in the for-profits, there's much more variety than I think most of us assume.
Speaker 1: But not many black people at that point in time--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --were seeing that part--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of society 'cause that's a part of society.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Story_ID: 640726
Speaker 1: I guess one thing is the amount of pride you have in yourself. I don't mean pride in the sense of being condescending, or anything like that, but pride in the sense that it's okay not to know everything, and to acknowledge that you don't know everything; there's, there's, there's no penalty for that. A lot of people are afraid of acknowledging what they don't know, and therefore you keep that lack of knowledge as a burden on yourself unnecessarily. Ask the question. When I went on the board at Citi [Citibank, N.A.], I went to the first meeting, and I knew that I didn't know enough about the way the system worked to be of any use to that board, so I went to the number two person and said, "I need a tutorial so I can better understand the way the system works in this corporation; I don't have that knowl- I don't have that experience. I don't know the language you use, and I don't know the significance of the language in each of the situations that comes up. So if I'm gonna be of any use, I need some filling up of my knowledge base." Okay. To their credit, they announced that there's been a request by--they don't say who, but I think there were two of us who--there was a woman who was also on the board who I talked to, and I think she was more reluctant to say she wanted the help, but she--anyway, so they announced that they're gonna hold a tutorial--I think it's two hours before the board meeting and all that, so you don't have to--it's not a separate day, but--do you know that every member of the board showed up for that tutorial?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Right? And from that moment on, I have never hesitated to say what I don't know, because a lot of people are faking it, and it's to their detriment that they're faking it.
Speaker 2: That's a pretty amazing story.
Story_ID: 640727
Speaker 1: Alcoa [Alcoa Corporation] was the first one? What order did they come in 'cause I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) God, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Was it a--
Speaker 2: I think either, either, either CBS or Citi [Citibank, N.A.]; I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Were first.
Speaker 2: Were first, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it may have been Citi because I thought they were inviting me out to have lunch, and they (laughter) were inviting me out there--inviting me onto their board.
Speaker 1: So how would they do that back then?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: The--would the, the CEO or the chairman of the board--
Speaker 2: The--yeah, the chief executive of the company and the head of the board; it's just sometimes the same person. They usually invite you up for a, a meeting for lunch or, you know, something that allows a conversation to take place. But that had pretty much happened because Citi had been helpful when we were creating the mortgage pool so that you could get credit in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York]. The meeting was held at, at Citibank and we brought in the leaders of the other financial institutions, and then we took everybody over to Brooklyn [New York] to see what we were talking about. So Citi was helpful really from inception, and the invitation to go on their board comes after that initial contact with them. But I can tell you, when my--when my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] died, among the people sitting in the front row were the people from Citibank and a couple of the other--
Speaker 1: Wow (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) boards I was on, so.
Story_ID: 640728
Speaker 1: So by the time you get to Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York], even those periods of the--you know that's about--I don't know, maybe--let's see, you left '79 [1979]; maybe--so halfway through your tenure really at, at Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York] is when you start being asked to serve on corporate boards (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: It's not just corporate; it's Lincoln Center [Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York, New York] board--
Speaker 1: Lincoln Center.
Speaker 2: --they, they asked me to go on, and a couple--you know, some--the not-for-profit world.
Speaker 1: So all of this starts coming--come- come- coming in.
Speaker 2: Starts to happen, yeah, yeah. And--
Speaker 1: And so you're really somewhat, in many ways--well, it's really--you and Vern [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.]--I mean you're the go to people for, for, for--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --it's a wonder you're the one taking your dibs at dinner like, "You do this, I'll do this."
Speaker 2: That's, that's, that's--well, listen, he has said, on more than one occasion to me (laughter), "We can sub for each other," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Exactly. I mean it's a won- you almost had--and, and everybody else was getting the dibs.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You were like letting people onto things because you were controlling--you were controlling the New York [New York] society which was really at the top, so--
Speaker 2: Oh, god, it's crazy (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean isn't that true?
Speaker 2: It's crazy; it's a crazy world.
Speaker 1: It's, it's crazy world, um-hm.
Speaker 2: That's completely so.
Speaker 1: You were accepta- so let me ask you--so when you take over at the Ford--that's what you were starting to say--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so, Mac [McGeorge Bundy] has his office there still--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and then you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have an office and I'm still--
Speaker 1: --are closing down your office but you're--so, so what, what happens in that, that six months? And then on this--I wouldn't want to leave South--I'm trying to think if we just pick up South Africa afterwards, but what--so tell me what happen--what, what is happening in that period of time and transition and--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --was he organizing his transition, too?
Speaker 2: Mac? You mean Mac. He was a--he had a--Mac did something that I thought was quite extraordinary when I first heard about it. He announced to the press that he was gonna be stepping down in four years (background noise); that's how it began. There's an article in The New York Times in which he announces his intention to step down in four years. And--but the arrogance of it was almost breathtaking to me when I saw it, but I just smiled when I saw it 'cause I, I didn't have any dealings except as a grantee, and he did bring over to Brooklyn [New York], to Bedford-Stuyvesant the board members. This is when I was working at Restoration [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York]. They come and see some of the work that, excuse me, we're doing and--including the Sheffield Farms building that we rented it--renovate, and all the rest of it.
Story_ID: 640729
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So Mac [McGeorge Bundy] announced--
Speaker 2: Mac announces--and to the press--I guess to the trustees, that he's gonna be leaving and, you know, a kind of classic arrogance associated with that (laughter), you know; you just assume that that's gonna be your call (laughter), you know (laughter), so--but I got on with him very well; he was very helpful. And when they had some problems with a grantee or two, whatever, and they thought I could be helpful, they would call and ask for some help, which I was happy to give. And they were very good for Restoration [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York] and the shopping center [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Plaza, New York, New York] that we put up there. They put up a chunk of both investment money and loan money so we, we repaid the loan money. But Mac was a classic intellectual, and he was engaged in and interested in a whole range of things, and I think probably less well connected to reality on the ground, I mean I would say. But maybe that's unfair, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Well, I would say that what you're speaking of--I think you're speaking of, within the foundation world at that time there were--it was highly academic.
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And highly research-oriented but highly aca- Ph.D.'s and--
Speaker 2: Very much so. It's a--
Speaker 1: Um-hm. But, but, but my question is--not many people successfully go from the board to being head of a organization.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There, there--you know, that has--that's not un- not unusual, but it's not always successful.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So I want to understand, you know, because you were on the board (laughter), and then you're a successor, and you're both there at the same time.
Speaker 2: I know, I know.
Speaker 1: And the staff--and so how does that work, is what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: It's, it's tricky I would say. The--I was probably (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then there would have been a lot of press around you, even though you were a head.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. The New York Times wants to interview you right away, so I did that and, you know, they had, they had this--and they must still do it--have a, a lunch session that they--where they bring in the senior people, and whoever the guest is comes in, so I went to that, and they asked a number of questions, as you would expect, and we went back and forth about some of it, and I think--it's hard to say if this is accurate or not, but I, I had the feeling that what was unusual in the setting was that this relatively high profile institution that's had impact in a variety of different ways and a variety of different places in the world, and all the rest of it, and even had some run ins with parts of the government from time to time in the, the worst cases.
Speaker 1: You're talking about the Ford Foundation [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, just think of it as an institution.
Speaker 1: As an institution, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And that it was seen as, you know, intellectuals and, you know, higher-folk place rather than something that would get into the nuts and bolts of life, and be involved in that as well.
Story_ID: 640730
Speaker 1: So, there was--and, and Mac [McGeorge Bundy]--as you know, there had been a series of meetings in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and there was a lot of tension coming from some parts of the administration to Mac and to some of the things that had been supported and on and on and--and, you know, he could hold his own in any argument, but I think there was some hostility there that, that I more read about than I actually experienced. So when he announced his four year out, it was seen by some as assuring himself for a period rather than a planning process that's designed to give adequate time and notice and all that. So I, I don't know what the facts were, but he was always very available and friendly to me in dealings with him, and he brought the board over, as I mentioned to you earlier--to Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York]. So it was--the first meeting with The New York Times was the luncheon they have, and they--in those days; I don't know if this is for publication, but just share it with you. They, they then held a prayer before the--
Speaker 2: Before the lunch.
Speaker 1: --before the lunch, and they did that. And one of the senior people over there was also a Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] person who I--someone in the family was also Columbia. I don't remember the exact name anymore, but--so we were talking, and I answered their questions and, you know, you get a lot of questions from the--particularly the younger members who are invited to that session, and they kind of pepper you with questions when they can and--at least they did my first visit to them. So you cut to three years later--two and a half years later; I go back--well, three years--and they open by saying, "Well," you know, "what's happened to the--tell us what's happened to the foundation [Ford Foundation, New York, New York], what's going on." And so I describe some of what's happened and where we then were, et cetera. And then one of them says to me, "Well, you know, it's obvious that place needed those things done to it, you know." And my response was--which I remember to this day, "You mean now that I've survived you, what I did was obvious." And that was, "Oh, no, no, I don't mean that at all." They were so self-important in their style and manner it was just--but I, I knew some from Columbia--of the family from Columbia you could say were trustees that--I hadn't seen 'em in a while, but--I say it only because it's--you know, you can think of that as race driven--who knows? Maybe some of it is, but at the heart, it is how some people are--whatever your race is. That's--they see themselves as up here, and everybody else is down below them. So, whatever your race may be, that's the position they're going to perceive you to hold, and so I just--I get on with them well.
Story_ID: 640731
Speaker 1: But what happened? You went in with a pretty aggressive changing agenda. I mean--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I'm just--how long did it take you to get to that and, and--yeah, I'm just--
Speaker 2: Well, it was about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and, and--
Speaker 2: --it was about two years to figure it out.
Speaker 1: To fi- two, two years to figure it out.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and then to implement it.
Speaker 1: So--I mean you transformed, in many ways the, the Ford Foundation [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. They sent me a--I have a wonderful gift from them--it's in the other office--where they show what happened to the endowment during the twelve years, and--
Speaker 1: Right, it went up tremendously.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it went straight up.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. But that part is interesting but also--and it's--and a very, very large focus on poverty.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you need to explain to me how you, you got to that, you know--why--who--how did you format or, or what this--'cause you had--you had staff with you and you had staff not with you.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that--I mean to the day I left there's always some staff person who's disgruntled about (laughter) one thing or another, and probably more so in my case because it was a dramatic change from my predecessor [McGeorge Bundy]. But again, you know what? I approach these things as a--I didn't seek the job; you sought me out and asked me if I would be willing to take on this job, and my understanding of that means that I'm in charge of this process except to the extent you intervene, as you have a right to do, but in the meantime, I'm gonna run it the way I believe to be in its best interest. And one of those issues was that the assets had declined pretty significantly, and we've gotta chart in the other office that shows what happened during the years that I was running it and what happened to that endowment, which is pretty dramatic. I say that not because it's, it's self-promotional, but because it's different in the way the place was run and the way it had been run, and when it was the big guy in town with all the bucks [dollars], you know, you could have an office in--where, you name it. And you'd have umpteen staff and you'd have carriages, and you'd have an--they even had an airplane in one of the, the, the locations. I said, "Well, why? What's the purpose of that?" Now, if the funds were unlimited, you can say, "Well, it's a better use of the money than might otherwise have happened." But when your back is against the wall you say, "Is this a compelling case to apply limited resources, or are there other things that these resources can be more impactful in areas of interest and concern to us?" So you don't make friends that way, but you ultimately earn respect, even if it's dislike along with it. And I think that was part of a phase of the Ford era and, and as I say, when I went back to The Times [The New York Times], I said, "You mean now that I said I've survived you what I did was obvious." But I understand that; that's all right.
Story_ID: 640732
Speaker 1: So who was your kitchen cabinet? I mean what, what staff do you assemble, and how do you decide you're gonna--'cause you focus--there were, I mean, two very strong initiatives around poverty.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so--and at the same time, during that time you were building the, you know--
Speaker 2: A lot going on, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, it ended well.
Speaker 1: It ended well.
Speaker 2: It ended very well, and I think they've got a good leader now [HistoryMaker Darren Walker] who's a very interesting guy--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and very talented--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and, and I think we're all very pretty proud of it.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Well, he's following in your footsteps--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --or trying.
Speaker 2: I'm here to help any way I can.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 2: And I am a fan. I think he's a, he's a dynamo.
Speaker 1: Similar? You know, has a--when I say similar, has a legal background like yourself (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, and he's got some finance background, too--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --he worked for a bank for a while.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The other thing is he doesn't need much sleep.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: He does not need much sleep, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, you might--you probably didn't need much sleep back then, too.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I didn't get it but I (laughter), I could have used it (laughter). But he doesn't seem to need it; it's an amazing thing.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But do you--but do you wanna--'cause we could stop--oh, no, we can't. We could either stop here--I need to have a session two.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because I mean--we could (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.
Speaker 1: We could stop here, but I still need to--'cause you can't--
Speaker 2: Keep going.
Speaker 1: Okay, good.
Speaker 2: Keep going.
Speaker 1: So, can we--can we talk about the, the--I mean--you have to do the talking (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You have--
Story_ID: 640733
Speaker 1: You have to tell me what you did at Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York] and why you did it and, and what were some of the opportunities and challenges 'cause--are you saying the first two years it took you to decide, you know, what your focus areas were gonna be?
Speaker 2: Well, less that than expanding--getting a better understanding of what we were already doing as a foundation because that was the big (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So how did you go about doing that?
Speaker 2: Well, bringing people in from the different parts of the world where we had operations, hearing from them--where they saw things standing; what the future looked like as far as they were concerned; where were the major needs that they had; what would they do if we had to curtail operations in that part of the world? What, what would be the effect of that so we can get some sense of where the risks are. And actually, I think for some, for the international group, it was a, a bit jarring for them because they had, I think--historically--had a bit of a fiefdom arrangement at--but I don't mean anything inappropriate, but they had people who were on the staff in New York [New York] whose primary interest was in what was happening on the international side of it, and the like. So--I mean I don't know how much detail you want, but I have to share this with you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I want detail.
Speaker 2: --that when I looked at the budget and the numbers and, and the flow of expenditures and what the activity was associated with them, it became apparent to me that there was a need for some tightening of the belt, some adjustments. And it was hard because they had an international staff here in New York, or a staff that worked with the international parts of it--of the company. And I would say an attitude of--a little bit of superiority, you know, because we're the internationalists and we've got all this--anyway--and I was more interested in the ABCs of how the place functioned, and so the discussions would be extensive in that regard. And I had three or four people who I had great confidence in, Al Puryear [Alvin N. Puryear] being one of them who worked for me, and was--is smart as a whip. And so we would listen and ask questions and try and get a handle on where things stood, and what would happen if we pulled back from some of this--what were the risks, what were the possibilities, et cetera.
Story_ID: 640734
Speaker 1: And then looking at the domestic programs to see where there were opportunities to kind of modulate some of what we were, were doing until we got a little better picture of what the finances were gonna be. And so we did that, and it meant a reasonably significant reduction in some of the activity that had been engaged in previously [at the Ford Foundation, New York, New York], and that always brings with it, you know, the people who feel like--it's only because you don't know enough that you think we should stop doing this, or alter the way we do this and--but we had brought everyone in and spent as much time as people wanted to talk about each of the issues that--each of the questions that came up. And I did it on the basis that I'm the new kid in town; I, I don't know this stuff; you are the reigning experts on it so talk to me, tell me, help me understand it. And, and then if I say to you that the flow of funds out of the organization at its current rate is going to produce the following reality, which is not good for any of us, in light of that, what do you see that can be adjusted and how? So, that's a healthier way to start the conversation. I think half of them accepted it, got it, and went to work on it; I think another half probably felt, you know, who the hell are you to be asking me these questions? You know, I've been at this for, whatever. So it reached a point where I think some of the senior--most senior people, decided they were gonna leave; they, they had other opportunities. And I think three of them left, and I think two of the three went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to do something up, up there, and I've forgotten what the third one did. But they were understandably angry with me and, and I respected that and I just didn't agree with them, that's all. And so, since I'm the new kid on the block and I have to answer for all of this, I'd rather be answering for decisions I've made rather than decisions I inherited. So, I wish you well.
Speaker 2: And you said you were gonna focus on domestic--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --poverty.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. And you wanted to have results oriented programming--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, well you got it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) rather than studies.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, no, I just--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it.
Story_ID: 640735
Speaker 1: Why such a big focus?  I mean you came into domestic poverty with almost the same (makes noise) that had been done, you know, in the '60s [1960s] when there was a focus on, you know, domestic poverty and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and some of those issues hadn't been resolved.  So can you--can you tell me--'cause when the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] would speak, other foundations would pay attention too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had been a trustee of the--whose board had I been on before?
Speaker 1: Rockef--
Speaker 2: I'd been on--not--I'd, I'd done some work for the Rockefeller [Rockefeller Foundation] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The J.H. Whitney [John Hay Whitney Foundation, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: --and J.H. Whitney I'd done--
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think who else.
Speaker 2: I was on their, their board but that was, you know, smaller in relation to--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --to this, and--my, my mind's drawing a blank on the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the other foundation whose board I went on before I took the Ford job.  (Unclear) Gregorian [ph.], who's now the--running the foundation.  Vincent--it's not the Astor Foundation [Vincent Astor Foundation, New York, New York], it's--what's the other big foundation on the list over there?
Speaker 1: MacArthur [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, they're--they're out of town.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: The ones that are here in New York [New York].
Story_ID: 640736
Speaker 1: First of all, we have to re-slate the interview, just the date--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and your spelling of the name. So, my name is Julieanna Richardson, and I'm the interviewer, and excuse me if I'm a little froggy; I had a problem with a little cold over the weekend. And Matthew Hickey is the videographer. And so I want you to state and spell your name, and I wanna say we're almost two months and two days from the--'cause we were, we were last together on June 28th, 2017 [sic. April 26, 2017], so--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Spell--state and spell your name again for us.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the date, which is--
Speaker 2: Franklin Thomas [HistoryMaker Franklin A. Thomas], F-R-A-N-K-L-I-N, T-H-O-M-A-S. And what is today's date? It's the--
Speaker 1: June 28th--
Speaker 2: June 28th--
Speaker 1: Two- two thousand sev- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Two thousand seventeen [2017]--
Speaker 1: Seven- seventeen [2017]. So, you know, Franklin Thomas, who otherwise could be known as F.A.T., F-A-T, but we won't go there.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Story_ID: 640737
Speaker 1: So I, I wanna go back to just a few things. One is, I'd like to know a little bit more about Al Vance [sic. Albert Vann], and how the two of you know each other.
Speaker 2: We were both in high school--the same high school, Franklin K. Lane High School in Queens--in Brooklyn [New York]. He was a basketball player as was I, and we ended up playing on the same basketball team at Franklin K. Lane High School, so that's the beginning of the kind of intense relationship that develops between players on the same team who are, in our case, at the same school, and we've remained friends ever since.
Speaker 1: So what was his--what position did he play and what position did you play, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, on the team--we were not the physically biggest team in the high school, but we were pretty agile and strong, so I played center and he was either playing guard or forward on our team, and we had a good team. A number of the players went on to college and beyond. I don't think any went on to--well, one went on to professional basketball; that's Richard Gaines [Richard "Chink" Gaines], who we called Chink Gaines in those days, and he played professionally after high school, but during the high school period, it was all of us, and I had--whether it was unintentional or intentionally, I don't really remember--been put into a rapid advance program in elementary school [P.S. 44, Marcus Garvey Elementary School, Brooklyn, New York], and that meant I skipped a grade, so I ended up graduating from high school in the midyear; other words, I finished high school six months earlier than I otherwise would have. One of the consequences of that, as far as Al Vann was concerned, is something we--he talks about to this day, and that is that our team was scheduled to compete in the national playoffs of basketball teams, and by my graduating early, I was no longer a student at Franklin K. Lane High School, which is where our team was, and so to this day, Al and a couple of the other teammates will not let me forget that I left them because I was the captain of the team and I left before the full basketball season was over, and they ended up playing in the citywide championship and did not win. So it remains, all of these years later, a topic of our conversations when we are together. Someone will make reference to the fact that I abandoned the team, and it's said with a, a combination of mild jest, and deeply felt feelings (laughter) on the part of my friends who were former athletes. Gil Scott [Gilbert L. Scott] was another of the members of that team. Gil went on to become a, a writer, and traveled a fair amount and wrote in Europe and elsewhere. He was--and he talks about it, when we get together, that somehow everything got derailed, according to them. Now, we might have lost anyway, even if I'd been there, but they won't accept that; they feel that--I mean it's partly joking and, and it's partly serious on their parts, and we don't linger on it too much when we're together but we almost, without exception, make a reference to that period in our lives because, in addition to the academic side, the athletic side was also very important, and the idea of winning a city championship would have been a big plus for everyone. But it's, it's also a source of humor among us, as you would expect. But the humor is always accompanied by a little bit of, you know (laughter), "Why did you abandon us?"
Speaker 1: Well, championships are very serious things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --especially for teens.

Speaker 1: I wanna understand about the--were there any racial dynamics at all in the school [Franklin K. Lane High School, Brooklyn, New York]? Because I--you know, previous to that you--we had showed a photo, you know, when you were in junior high school [J.H.S. 33, Mark Hopkins Junior High School, Brooklyn, New York] where it was very diverse--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and I'm just wondering, by the time you get to high school are there different dynamics in play?
Speaker 2: Maybe somewhat less diverse, but still pretty diverse in the high school. Our team had both people of color and Caucasians on the team; the coach was obviously, as you would expect, Caucasian. And, as I was approaching graduation I was getting invitations, presumably from some colleges, about, you know, coming to visit. And the advice the coach gave to me was--and my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] concurred, "If you can avoid it, no athletic scholarships. You're going to college to be a student. If you also end up playing basketball, that's fine, that's positive, but you're not going to college to play basketball," in my case. And that meant that I had to figure out what I was gonna do in the period following graduation until the start of college. And I visited with Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] that didn't actually have athletic scholarships as such; they had need based scholarships which you could apply for. And so from among the schools that had expressed an interest in me and, and were offering athletic scholarships, Columbia stood out because they didn't have athletic scholarships. So if you then played for a season and broke an ankle, it didn't have any adverse effect on your scholarship, so both my coach and my mother said, "You're not going to college to become a professional athlete, you're going to get an education." So, that led to Columbia, and Columbia was great. They--a coach was interested in my coming because he hoped I would play basketball at Columbia, and I kind of fell in love with the idea of Columbia once I went there, and so that began a relationship that--between myself and Columbia that included basketball as it turns out, but was much more focused on I'd say the academic side of, of it, and that was really what my mother had in mind anyway. I think she only came to maybe one or two games (laughter) that I--when I was playing basketball at Columbia--a lot of pride in my being there and then being captain of the team, and all of that, but that was secondary; it was, it was about education.
Story_ID: 640739
Speaker 1: So, you were captain also in high school--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you were captain in, in, in--
Speaker 2: College.
Speaker 1: --college.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know, I had read someplace--well, in high school they called you the Horse--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and that you were, you know, tireless on defense. And, and, and so I'm just wondering, like what did--this whole thing--how do people get chosen to be captain of, of a team, and how--I mean--I--I'm going back. This is really 19--this is even before Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], which is seminal in, in my generation's book.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure, sure. It's a--I don't have a, a thorough answer to that. I think the process involves, in the case of sports, the coach, or coaches, but it's also about the way the school is organized and, and Franklin K. Lane [Franklin K. Lane High School, Brooklyn, New York] was organized really around the academic side of, of school, and they loved the fact that there was a competitive basketball team. But it was, I would say, secondary to the importance of the education you were getting, and I had taken all of the courses they offered in mathematics and whatever, and I was curious about all those subjects 'cause I hadn't pursued them before. And it ended up being--as Gil Scott [Gilbert L. Scott], who was on the team, and as a friend has said, "In the dining room when we had went for lunch, if there were any books on the table, you knew they were Frank's [HistoryMaker Franklin A. Thomas] books." (Laughter) But that's, that's his take on the nature of the relationship we all had. And they were all good students; I mean it wasn't that, it was--I think I took all the math courses they could--they offered, and even when I went to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], I, I did some of the same things. I, I think I told you in our last interview that I had taken a course in the cultural history of Europe taught by Jacques Barzun, who's now deceased--lived to be 103 or 4 [sic.]. The course was taught in French, and I had taken French as a course, but I didn't really speak French well enough to be completely fluent in the language. So I, I took the course because he was teaching it, and I knew enough French that I could follow most of it, and I think I still have the French book with my writings on the side about (laughter) the translation of some of the language into English that made it easier to read. But I think there was a--I never got over the notion that you go to college to, to learn, I mean--and the chance to learn at the hands of people with extraordinary reputations and history was a real prize, and that attracted me more than--more so than even the grade you got in the course, and I--there wasn't any master plan; it just happened--curiosity on the part of teammates as to, you know, "Why are you working so hard on these courses?" And all the rest of it. But I didn't think it was unusual; it seemed appropriate to me.
Story_ID: 640740
Speaker 1: But that's a different thing than how you became captain of the team. And the only reason I'm trying to focus on this is that I had done a part of my research--I went back to look at the 1968 riots--
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, that happened at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] and, and that was--and so this is--you know, I'm wondering how the Columbia then, in 1968, differed from the Columbia that you were at--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, in the--
Speaker 2: Well, it was all-male when I went; it's now--
Speaker 1: Right, coed.
Speaker 2: --both male and female. I think students--I say now, meaning post the time I was a student. I think students were in some ways maybe more demanding? I'm not sure about it, but the--I think teachers were held with somewhat greater--maybe respect than admiration. I'm not sure about this, but I remember going up to Columbia after I'd graduated and gone on to other things when the student protests were on, and meeting with some of the leadership of the university who were struggling to figure out what to do, and then spending some time going over to where the students were in control and talking with them about, you know, what their gripes were and how did they anticipate the protest ending, and what was it going to take to cause it to end. And, and then being able to go back to the officialdom and talk a little more knowingly about what the motivations and concerns were of the students that had given rise to the protests and the like. And for some reason that I, I don't pretend to understand fully, I found it relatively easy to talk to the students about their gripes and concerns and, and then to be able to talk also to officialdom about at least one person's impressions of what the demands were centered around, and what it might or might not take to reach some accommodation that would reduce the--any of the violence and the like. And, for reasons that I don't have an explanation for, I've always found it easy to talk to people of different attitudes, beliefs, what have you. I don't--it's never been a, a problem for me unless we had a severe language difference or we have to go by sign language. But absent that, I didn't have any other agenda, and I think that came through to the protestors--that they were talking to someone who was genuinely interested in what they were protesting about and was willing and able to be an intermediary perhaps to officialdom that may have had a harder time understanding what the protests were about and addressing them. But I don't pretend to know the answers to all that.
Story_ID: 640741
Speaker 1: But you're saying the Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] that you were in in the 19--you know, that you entered in 1952, which is--by 1968 that's a thirteen year difference--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and the other thing, though, is I didn't know you were involved in those negotiations, so interviewing you is like peeling a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --a onion.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But (laughter), but I'm just--you've become--I'm just trying to understand the university that you enter into.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I know--I know that the--your mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] attends a few of the games.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I know that your family wanted you to be a doctor, and that sort of became apparent that you didn't like the sight of blood, so that wasn't gonna happen.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I know you become captain of the, the basketball team. I'm not sure how that happens. I know you're studious. I'm trying to understand how--and, and there is--is there--am I under- you know I also remember your recount of the game, and--is it Mor- Morgan- I--well, in West Virginia--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --where you were--you know, the team didn't even know how to handle--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) how the opposing team didn't know how to handle a black player. I'm just trying to understand your, your, your, your experiences at that point, and to really juxtapose them against a later generation that comes in, and that's what I'm trying--and I--
Speaker 2: It's a--it's either very simple or it's completely complex (laughter). I don't know which it is (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you give me the complex version?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It's the--it's the willingness to talk to your adversary and to find out what it is that's driving your adversary, and engage in that conversation with--I say your adversary because you're coming from the perspective as far as the opposition is concerned--the perspective of the institution. Even though you are not a--directly involved with the institution, you have a history of being involved with it, and the willingness of students to listen to you and, and that's been true throughout my--
Speaker 1: Career.
Speaker 2: --time with a--wherever I've been, but also at Columbia. It goes back to the student protests on South Africa and the like, and I go and meet with them and talk about some aspects of South Africa that I'd come to be familiar with, and to take the protests of the students who didn't wanna hear that; they only wanted to focus on that aspect of the problem that was central to their concerns, and that's perfectly legitimate. But we had done a study, we'd written a report ['Time Running Out'] on it, and I was, along with others, was making the, the rounds to various colleges to talk to students and faculty who were interested in U.S. policy towards South Africa and all that. And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But that's a different time than 1968.
Speaker 2: Well, that's right, but it's the--it's a pattern that is--
Speaker 1: It's this--it's the pattern that--
Speaker 2: --that is familiar, and it's not, it's not organized around the specifics of the situation; it's organized much more around whether or not you think you have anything to perhaps add or provide. And you have to be prepared for people to say, you know, "Hell no," you know. "Get out; this is our problem, not yours." That's fine, too, I mean but (laughter) if you're not willing to accept a rejection, then you probably shouldn't be in the, in the business of trying to enable or facilitate or be a bridge between factions who are struggling over whatever the issue may be. Doesn't fit any particular pattern that most people talk about (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 640742
Speaker 1: But your generation of African Americans who are going to these Ivy League schools are, at a time when the numbers are--I mean--I think you said there were three or four in your class.
Speaker 2: I think the, the rule of thumb was--one of the guys said--when I went to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] in that first or second year, I don't remember which it was, the--it was all-male, there were roughly 5 to 6 percent people of color in that group. As it turns out, the student president of Columbia that year was African American, yeah. So you have this situation where the--I've forgotten what the numbers were, but I'm sure they're around--there was either six or seven, or--not more than ten slots available to people of color in the admissions process at Columbia. Nobody announced it, but that's what the reality turned out to be. So to have within that group over--figured for four years; to have a president of the student body an African American was quite unusual and somewhat spectacular. They were all active, smart, capable. Jeh Johnson [Jeh Vincent Johnson], whose son [Jeh Johnson] has been--was in the Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] administration as the--I've forgotten what his full title was [U.S. secretary of homeland security], his dad and I were at Columbia at the same time. He became an architect and, and, you know, it was the reality of life at that point in time, and what you did, I think, without a lot of planning, was to--you know, you break down barriers through the way in which you engage those barriers if you choose to. And I think they were, they were spot on, and I guess Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] had just be--he had been president of Columbia and had gone into the milita- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, he had, he had already been in the [U.S.] military and president.
Speaker 2: He had been--been in the military and becomes president, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right. And then he had left--right.
Speaker 2: That's, that's right; he left Columbia.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So it was, it was a fascinating time; I mean all this happening around you, and then you're still confronted with the realities of the predominantly African American areas in the city. You still have the gang issues to deal with, you've got--all of the above is still there, and alongside it are these--I'll call 'em the parallel tracks that people engage in in their lives, whether it's through their religions or their--whatever their activities and interests turn out to be. And how you apply your knowledge and understanding in each of those situations seems to me to be a--an important part of life--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that's what we did.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 640743
Speaker 1: I was just--I'm (cough) interested in this time period because you are literally--I think in your--you know, twenty- twenty--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Let's see is it--I have you as team captain in 1955 at twenty-one--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, most valuable player. But this is the other thing, is that Grayson Kirk [Grayson L. Kirk], who comes in after--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and that's why I was sort of interested in this trajectory. When he comes in after Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower], it's the 1968 protest--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that sends him on his way. And, you know--and you were involved in that. So, I'd--I'm really--so, what is the messaging of your mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] and your par--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, parents of your generation like, "Be the best that you can be." I'm just trying to unders--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know that it was ever explicitly articulated as a specific vision, but it, it had as its--in its elements a, "What are your aspirations as a--first as a human being? As a student, do you wanna really learn as much as you can in order to be better able to engage in life in its fuller dimensions? Or do you wanna be contained and limited and excluded from other aspects of life, whether that exclusion is based on race or gender, or whatever it may be? And if you are not prepared to accept those, then how do you counter them without, at the same time, ruining your life?" And that--if I had to put it in words I'd say that's probably as close as I can come to, to that. And I think the other is that reprehensible behavior, whether by someone of the same color as you, or a different color than you are, is defined and ought to be defined the same way. And I can remember my mother saying something--I may have said it to you at our earlier meeting when I was--said to her about not being admitted into the house of a friend that I had--used to ride my bicycle with and, and her saying, "Oh, they're prejudiced."
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: At that point, I didn't know what the word meant. I took it to mean--well, they're, they're sick; there's some problem with them. In a way, that's probably the best definition anyway, but (laughter) it wasn't the one that, that came to mind. It--in other words, it didn't put the focus on my dark skin; it put the focus on a limitation that the person who is saying, "No, you can't come in," or "You can't sit here," or "You can't eat at this location" that they've got the problem. It has an impact on me, but they've really got the problem--I don't really have that problem. So, that's who she was; she was a--she was a warrior in her own way, and I think one of the reasons she didn't come to more of the basketball games was that she didn't ever (laughter) want to elevate the importance of basketball in my life. Great that you love doing it, great that you're good at some aspects of it, but that's parallel and secondary to why you're at that school. And she was right. But it's a hard message to articulate because we all want praise in some form, and part of that praise comes from being recognized for being good at whatever it is you're doing. So--but no regrets. And I don't wanna make it sound simple because I, I--what's--what I treat as simple is not a definition of what is simple in my mind; it's complex because behavior is guided by so many things on the part of human beings, and I'm aware of that but--what can I say? It's, it's the way the pieces got put together in my case.
Story_ID: 640744
Speaker 1: Now, when was the Knapp Commission [Commission to Investigate Alleged Police Corruption]? That's afterwards. Knapp Commission is--what period of time is it?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I have to check the actual time, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. But where were you when you served on the--
Speaker 2: I've been--by then I've already been to law school [Columbia Law School, New York, New York]. I've been in the U.S. attorney's office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York]--
Speaker 1: Okay, no, then I want--I wanna--
Speaker 2: I've done all that before the Knapp Commission comes up.
Speaker 1: Okay, well let's, let's go to U.S. attorney's office because--I, I want you to--you did talk about it some, but I wanna go back to talk about Walter Morgenthau [sic.] and the people you worked with--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --there at the--'cause you developed some lifelong friendships here (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And especially the people who worked on the Statue of Liberty [New York, New York] case with you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But let's talk about Walter Morgenthau first because he, he also is sort of a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Robert Morgenthau [Robert M. Morgenthau].
Speaker 1: Ro- Robert.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right. Robert Mor- sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm thinking of his--sorry--his grandfather--sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But--Robert Morgenthau, sorry. But he was--what I was gonna say is he was also from royalty himself and--you know, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little bit about his background and the person he was? 'Cause he stayed in that position a long time.
Speaker 2: He's amazing. (Laughter) I had lunch with him about three weeks ago, just three of us, Bob Morgenthau, who's ninety-eight maybe?
Speaker 1: He's--yeah--or ninety- between ninety-six and ninety-eight, he's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, somewhere in there. Who, by the way--not to digress, but his brother [Henry Morgenthau III] just published a, a book of poetry ['A Sunday in Purgatory'], and he's 205 [sic.], I think he is, and he's been interviewed recently. This is more--
Speaker 1: He's--how old is he?
Speaker 2: I mean 105 [sic.].
Speaker 1: Five, he's a hundr- he just published a book of poetry?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes. And (laughter) Morgenthau, who was a U.S. attorney when I worked for him, then he became district attorney of New York [New York], and did that for forty years or whatever--some incredible amount of time. He now has an office in a law firm in town. His mind is as sharp as ever. Physically, he's not as strong as he was before in, in terms of walking and all of that, but Steve Kaufman [Stephen E. Kaufman], who was head of the criminal division when I was in the office, and I had lunch with Bob maybe three, four weeks ago, and we're talking about a bunch of things, and Steve and I look at each other and say, "Bob, you're remembering things better than either one of us can remember those same things. We were all in this at the same time; your memory is better than each of ours." And that's, that's just the fact. He's an, an amazing--if you see him walk, you'd think, oh, he has--doesn't have much time left in life. You sit and have a conversation with him and you say, oh, he's gonna be around for a long time (laughter), there's nothing wrong here. And that's a friendship that began really right out of law school.
Story_ID: 640745
Speaker 1: I was so interested in the U.S. attorney's office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York], but they didn't take you right out of law school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Law school.
Speaker 1: So I worked for the Housing and Home Finance Agency [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] until a slot opened in the U.S. attorney's office, and I went there. And in those days, each assistant had his own small office out of which you worked, and then there was the more senior people who coordinated things and you reported really through them. But when I went, they didn't have a single office available, and the other person who came in at the same--roughly the same time was Pierre Leval [Pierre N. Leval], who is now semiretired but a fabulous lawyer. And he had been a clerk for one of the major lawyers in the U.S. attorney's office, so he and--Pierre and I ended up being the only two who shared an office. And they said to us, "Well, as soon as an office opens, we'll, you know, reassign you." And we got to liking working together so well that when the--an office became available for one of, one of us, we both said, no, we preferred to stay where we were. That leads to an--I'm going to work one morning, and there's an article about this conspiracy to blow up the Statue of Liberty [New York, New York], the Liberty Bell [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the Washington Monument [Washington, D.C.], and it turns out when we get--when I get to the office, that it's a case that's been handed to the U.S. attorney's office to deal with, and it was given to Steve Kaufman [Stephen E. Kaufman], who was then the deputy head of the--that division. And he needed some, you know, help from some of the rest of us, and so he asked Pierre and myself to work with him--really for him--he was the boss. And we spent oh, a year and a half, I guess, on that case, and it got tried here in the states, and there were convictions. And then we were--Pierre and I were sent up to Canada to work with the Royal Canadian people [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] because, among the people who participated in the plan were some Canadians, so he and I went up to escort the undercover agent who had been invite- anyway, all of that to say we've worked together a long time as, as lawyers and, and as friends, and we remain close friends to this day.
Speaker 2: So, when you worked on that case--'cause the case is almost what we see in today's world as modern day--and you know ter- what we would call terrorist acts.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Because--and it's three black men, which you don't think about, a white woman [Michelle Duclos], right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And they--I think the police found thirty-six dynamite, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --in their cache and, and they were part of a black liberation front.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it.
Speaker 2: So this is--this is fear, you know--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --this creates fear in a lot of people's minds; this is--
Speaker 1: Absolutely. And it was a--it was an interesting case, because you can have one point of view about protest, and a different point of view about protest that is rooted in destruction of places and people. So--and making those distinctions is never simple, but we did it; we--you know, we did the work and I think the--oh, we got some conviction; I can't remember what the details were anymore. But all of that to say that the relationships that were built up were built more on our responsibility as lawyers and, and less on trying to figure out, you know, what color the person was who was accused of the act.
Story_ID: 640746
Speaker 1: I can remember talking to a guy of African descent who had been arrested and was being arraigned and he, for some reason--I don't know how I got to have the case, and I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now this is a different case.
Speaker 1: This is a different case, but I just cite it because I go down to talk to the officers who have the person there and I say, "You need legal help because of what are called these mandatory minimum sentences." He said, "This is not like being arrested by the New York City Police Department; you've got a federal case now sitting here." And the guy had had previous arrests, it turns out, and he had served, you know, a year here and a year there, or whatever--but these were five year minimum terms, as I remember it. And he about fainted, because as far as he was concerned, he hadn't done anything different this time than he had done let's say previously, except this time he gets arrested by the feds instead of by the city, and so he gets tried under a different statute and different provisions that existed. So you began to see this--the way the system superficially looked like it was just, and the like, but in its application it was all over the place, depending on who was handling the, the matter and what laws were being alleged to have been breached. So it was--you keep learning all the time, and you're, you're trying to understand well, why? What's the motivation behind the decision that this person made, and whatever material he was selling? Or, or did he think at all about whether the risks involved a possible federal crime? And if so, what the consequences of that would be versus a same action but dealing with a local crime where there is no mandatory minimum sentence. And that mandatory minimum became a, a, a real burden on the part of people, including on the law enforcement side, because you saw differential treatment for similar behavior, depending on who did the arrest.
Speaker 2: So you're saying mandatory minimums were in place when you were at the U.S. attorney's office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: Yeah, at the federal side.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: And we were--you know, once you understood the implications of that, you began to say, "This isn't fair; this isn't, this isn't a just treatment because you've concocted this particular implications of the same action, but done in a different geographic setting, has enormously different consequences." So, anyway, it's the ability to get closer to the way the system works in order to better understand the system and also to do what you can to make it a more just and balanced system.
Speaker 2: Right. You were seeing for the first time, really, 'cause you had had the federal housing [Housing and Home Finance Agency; U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development] but that's a little different.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You were seeing for the first time the actual practice of law--
Speaker 1: Oh boy, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and the implementation, and its impact.
Story_ID: 640747
Speaker 1: I'm wondering like--so, was the way you, you know, how it was staffed with Steve [Stephen E. Kaufman] and you, and--
Speaker 2: Working for Morgenthau [Robert M. Morgenthau].
Speaker 1: --working for Mor- was that typically the staffing that you would have? Two assistants assigned to one person leading the case? Was that how things were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it was un- I don't think there was one fixed way of doing it, but Steve--fortunately, Steve and Bob are still around, so it's easy enough to (laughter)--
Speaker 1: To, to explain--to ask them that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--but, but what, what--how--just--your experience there--what else would you consider significant about your experience there and, and working there? Because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it, it demystifies the legal system, or it helps demystify the legal system. And also to reinforce the ways in which people need to be both informed of that system and protected from its worst implications because I think for many, they were unaware. Even people who had previously been arrested let's say for some drug related violation, they were accustomed to a New York City [New York, New York] police officer and a system based on New York and the legal system here. The mandatory minimums come in under the federal side of this picture, and so for the same crime, if you get arrested by the feds, you're subject to the mandatory minimums when it comes to your trial. Same crime, you're arrested by a New York City police officer, and you're under the New York system, you get a very different result. You don't have--they didn't at that point have mandatory minimums in, in the city, as I remember it. So, anyway, you had same behavior, differential consequences, depending on who--which system you were arrested under. So, the beginnings of understanding more and more of that, I think--you know--had an impact, and you wanna know why is the, the knowledge of that not broadly dispensed and understood. And also whether or not you wanted to keep doing that kind of work, and I decided I didn't wanna keep doing that. So when Morgen- when, when Morgenthau's chief assistant became police commissioner, he asked me to go with him--to leave the U.S. attorney's office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York] and become one of the five deputies that the police commissioner has the appointment power for, and to do that with him in the role of police commissioner. And I'd worked with him on one or two cases that he had previously tried and I had worked on the appeal, and I was invited by him to join him, and a couple of my friends in the U.S. attorney's office, and others, said "Frank [HistoryMaker Franklin A. Thomas], why are you gonna leave the U.S. attorney's office to go with, with him? If Lindsay [John Lindsay] gets elected, he's gonna be out of a job in short order," and when a commissioner leaves, the five deputies--each whom has an area of responsibility--are expected to render their resignations to the incoming commissioner, so that that person can select his own five that he wants. "So why don't you wait and see what happens with the election?" And I said, "Well, I think what you say makes perfect sense, but my response is to the request to join him, and I respect him and so I'm gonna do that. I understand what the consequences can be." So, true to the forecast, Lindsay gets elected, Broderick [Vincent L. Broderick] has to hand in his resignation--that's the, the way it ruled--the rules went so that the new leadership can decide who the new commissioner for the police department [New York City Police Department] will be. And along with that, the five deputies each submit their letters of resignation to the incoming chief or, you know, head of the department.
Story_ID: 640748
Speaker 1: So they--turns out Lindsay [John Lindsay] gets elected, Broderick [Vincent L. Broderick] submits his resignation, Lindsay selects as the new commissioner Howard Leary [Howard R. Leary], who comes from Pennsylvania and doesn't have a New York [New York] history as such, but has his own history from Pennsylvania--Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] I think it was. So when I submitted my resignation to Leary, he said to me that he had talked to the mayor's office and they had suggested that he might want to keep me on; would I be willing to do that? And so I said, "Sure, I'd be happy to do it." So I had a period of working for Howard Leary when he was commissioner, and that was quite different from the period working with his predecessor because the first time I took something to Leary for his signature, unlike his predecessor who would sit and he'd read it and say, "Oh, what do you mean by here," and, you know, and you go back and forth and make adjustments if they were needed. The first time I took something to Leary, he read it, took out his pen and signed it. And I didn't--I won't say I almost fainted, but I was, I was really taken aback by that. I was prepared to have a discussion (laughter) about it, and he signed the document. Well, that was a pretty important life lesson there because it says that, in the business I was then in, the buck stops with you. You're not simply taking something to someone with a recommendation, you do that as well, but you've gotta stand behind what you're proposing because in the event the recipient takes out his pen and signs it, it--it's on you, it's not on anyone else. So, I actually had a pretty interesting time working for Leary and, and he was a person who could talk to you, (muttering). You'd have to lean in to hear him, you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You did say that before (laughter). I was like--I would--that's right; you did say that before (laughter). Okay. So, he made you lean in.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's exactly right. And also, you--I think you, you know in a way--in a different way than you previously knew--what it meant with the buck stopping with you, and so I've been grateful for all of that.
Story_ID: 640749
Speaker 1: And at the time that you're at the office, how much of your work is--or are you looking at the Bedford-Stuyvesant area [Brooklyn, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --during that, that period of time. Because Lindsay [John Lindsay], Lindsay has this whole relationship, and he has a lot of--he cultivates the black community--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but it's during a time of a lot of tumult and, and criticism also--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --both within and without. So, I'm just wondering in your--in the police work--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --under Leary [Howard R. Leary], how much of the focus is on Bedford-Stuyvesant?
Speaker 2: Not much.
Speaker 1: Not much?
Speaker 2: Not much at that point; I mean does--the name and the subject come up, but there wasn't the kind of explicit focus on that; that would become the case when Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy]--
Speaker 1: Came in.
Speaker 2: --gets involved and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --then it--it really does accelerate at that point because Kennedy, you know--love it or not--goes to the community and spends time with--listening to the people and being bombarded by them with their demands that, among other things, the phrase remains in my memory, is that, "Don't walk through our misery to a headline."
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: You know, that's the Elsie Jefferson [sic. Elsie Richardson], I think it is, statement. And he never--he, Kennedy, never forgets that, but he has to go back multiple times because Kennedy's idea of what an initiative addressing the problems of Bedford-Stuyvesant would look like, he had recruited the leadership of some of the major corporations in the country. I think he had--I don't know--six or eight of them who had agreed, because he was thought to be next in line maybe for the presidency of the United States.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And he gets them committed to his intent to enable dramatic, positive change to take place in an area of enormous importance to the black community and beyond. And while there--oh, lot of tensions back and forth within the community itself because some people had been working on issues in Bedford-Stuyvesant for a long time before Kennedy came along. But his focus really gave an elevation to Bedford-Stuyvesant it didn't otherwise have, except among people who lived there and, and knew it. So you have this person who is likely to be the next president of the United States choosing to focus on Bedford-Stuyvesant as a place where he can make a positive difference that's demonstrable and beneficial to the people and, and he rounds up the head of IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], the head of Citi [Citibank, N.A.], the head of this, the head that--to be on a board that's gonna address these issues, and then he goes to the community to try and get the community to organize itself, or at least some subset of the community, to become the lead partner in this effort at Bedford-Stuyvesant's development--redevelopment.
Story_ID: 640750
Speaker 1: And it's during that period that I get a call from the senator's office, and Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.], who's then working for the senator, must have mentioned my name to him; he had no other--I don't know what other sources there were, but certainly I suspect Earl was among them. And I get a call and they--I go and meet with the, the senator, and he explains what his vision is and what he's assembled up to that point, and that he's trying to work with these different groups in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York] and they need someone who can handle all of that and be, at the same time, accessible to the business group. And, for some reason, it kind of strikes me as something that--unplanned on my part, but maybe I ought to try and be helpful. So, I--I think I told you this story--I go to the meeting with the local people, and Elsie Richardson among them, and others who later become great friends, but at that point--I mean the beginning is, "What makes you think you're qualified to do what needs to be done here?" I mean that's the opening wedge for this meeting (laughter). And so we have a lengthy conversation, and I go back to Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] and his assembled group and say, "You know, I think it's an interesting idea. I don't think I'm the person that the community would seek to oversee this. And I say that be- not as any knock on me, but because, in my opinion, they have someone in mind who they would like to be in that position--someone they know and have worked with in the past, and who has some credentials," et cetera. So that's my impression from my meeting that I relate to the senator, and he says, "You know I, I know but that--we, we know of that person, and we've done a check there, and it's a well intentioned idea, but he's not the person that can lead this, so would you please not withdraw yourself from this while we search to see if we can find a person of--that's acceptable to both parties?" So, I say, "Okay." I'm as interested in seeing something done well as anyone. So I agree to spend some time with the local folk as they go through looking at what had been done in a, a couple of other cities--where Ed Logue [Edward J. Logue] had worked, and people whom Kennedy had brought into Bedford-Stuyvesant [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York], and I.M. Pei had brought in, and others had been brought in.
Speaker 2: I.M. Pei, who is the architect, right?
Speaker 1: He's the architect, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so--anyway, a few months go by; I--I've got my own job I'm working on, but I spend time with them, and they finally double back and say, "Well, you're not our first choice but unless you're willing to do this, it's probably not gonna happen." And the Kennedy people are saying basically the same thing, and that the person the local group seemed more interested in is not someone that the business group thinks can do the job, so I said, "Okay," I would do it for two years to get it started, and so I did. And I spent the next ten years there, and I'm happy to say it's having its fiftieth anniversary upcoming, and some of the same people are happily still there. Most have passed on, but there's another generation there, and yeah, we're all pretty proud of what's happened--yeah. And Al Vann [Albert Vann] still lives there, Gil Scott [Gilbert L. Scott] still lives there; a number of the people that, you know, I grew up with are there and involved with what's going on.
Story_ID: 640751
Speaker 1: Now the problem they're confronting is it's become a popular place for the influx of Caucasians of wealth, and so (laughter) I said, "Well, you know, you've got a, a decision to make. It's either your home, which has now quadrupled in value, but if you sell it, where are you going?" That's always the problem. And so, I think, for a number of people who did sell their properties [in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York], unless you were planning to relocate to some other part of the country--if you were from the South, you might be going back there--I don't know where otherwise, but the intake of more money than you had ever anticipated getting for your property has to be juxtaposed alongside what it's gonna cost you to go someplace else that you are gonna be equally comfortable with. And when you look at those side by side, it may not be such a good deal. It looks like a big deal now because the numbers are four times what you thought you'd ever get for your, your property. So anyway, that--that's ongoing. The Billie Holiday Theatre [New York, New York] that we set up has now been refurbished and is producing, I think, the beginning of good shows again, so we're all gonna go back and spend a little time there. But it's, it's the--it's a life cycle, in many ways, that doesn't lend itself to kind of one dimensional thinking. You can have absolutely good intentions and work like a mad person to realize them, and then you'll be struck by the fact that there's been an out-flux of the very people whom you thought you were serving, and it's not begrudging anyone else from coming in, but it is saying something about the vision and aspirations of the ones who are leaving and--and that's underway right now, as we know.
Speaker 2: So, Al Vann [Albert Vann] would fit into that because his life has been dedicated to that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: He's--he's--
Speaker 1: And he's, he's kept his house, he's there, and, and Gil Scott's [Gilbert L. Scott] kept his, and he's there--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so it's a--it--it's a human reality, I guess, is the way to think about it.
Speaker 2: So what about your house? You lived at one point, right, in a brown--you know, your family house (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In a brownstone, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: What, what, what is, what is--
Speaker 1: But we, we never owned--my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] never owned a house. She always--
Speaker 2: She nev- oh, because she got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) always rented them.
Speaker 2: Always rented.
Speaker 1: And then--but I--when I was working in Brooklyn [New York], I bought a house and renovated it and lived there for a long time until I ended up in Manhattan [New York], and then I sold that property. But it--it's, it's the place you love, and you just hope that it satisfies the people who live there, both black and white.
Story_ID: 640752
Speaker 1: Did people ever--or were you positioned as a candidate because you had come out of Bed-Stuy, Bed- Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York] that you would be a perfect person to, to place, except for the people who were the community people--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who said, "Wait a minute, we don't want this" (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. I think--I mean I could only speculate. I suspect between Earl [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] and others who worked for the senator and when they looked around to see who was who, you know, I was obviously in the law enforcement business at the time, but more interested in other things, so my guess is some combination of them decided, "We ought to try and get Frank [HistoryMaker Franklin A. Thomas] to do this, even if he'll only do it for two years," and that's--but none of us, that I know of, regrets any part of that history. And Ben Glascoe [Benjamin A. Glascoe], who was here before you, you came today, was a part of the Bedford-Stuyvesant team [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York]. So we all--we still meet together, we help Colvin Grannum [Colvin W. Grannum] as best we can from time to time, and he stays in touch. They've now redone the Billie Holli- the Billie Holiday Theatre [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: But it was the first community development corporation, and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, of that size.
Speaker 1: --of that--
Speaker 2: They had some out in California.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see, I see.
Speaker 2: I, I, I went out to California and looked at some of their work, too.
Speaker 1: I see. So that was--okay, 'cause in some of the reports it says that it was the first of its kind but, but you're saying--
Speaker 2: Well, it, it, it may--it--technically that may be right, but I know there were some efforts out in California because--and I--whether it was Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York] or one or another of the foundations, facilitated some information and knowledge transfers because we were visited by people from California who were looking at what we were doing, and then some of us went out there to see what they were doing. They were, I would say, later in the cycle, but similar in their intentions. And I think nobody had--or none of the other groups--had, you know, the two senators from the state on the board, and the head of IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] and CBS, and you name it.
Speaker 1: Paley [William S. Paley] from CBS. You had, you had different people with different expertise who were gonna bring it to help with the problems.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And that was--
Speaker 1: But I wanted to--I wanted to--
Speaker 2: And, of course, Kennedy's [Robert F. Kennedy] death, you know, he--
Speaker 1: And Kennedy's death.
Speaker 2: --he leads--and to his credit--he said to me when he was campaigning, at the beginning of his campaign, that he didn't expect me to do anything--that the most important thing was to keep--make the Bedford-Stuyvesant project work for the people. So--and then, of course, he gets killed (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So his death is a year after you start.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah. A little ov- maybe a year and a half or so.
Speaker 1: A year and a half, okay--after you start.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you--tell me about that period where you were working in--you know, working with--since this was his brainchild--in the group.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because--and it also took--didn't you--I mean there were all these different forces. You had the community over here, they had the different structures, and--so are your first two years get--well, let's talk about your working in that--you know, you--I mean that setting with him.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause Al Vann [Albert Vann]--he reconstructs the board, right? And Al Vann and--
Speaker 2: Sonny Carson [Robert "Sonny" Carson] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and Sonny Carson and Milton--
Speaker 2: Galamison [Milton A. Galamison].
Speaker 1: Galamison.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all of them.
Speaker 1: But you and Milton have--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we know each other.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And, you know, going back to the Boy Scout [Boy Scouts of America] days, you know, Concord [Concord Baptist Church, Brooklyn, New York] was not that far away from Galamison where he was operating out of, so we knew each other anyway. And it worked fine because--
Speaker 1: But these are the community; this is the, the community side (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but they are the, the kind of officialdom of--that you--whose names you would know, and then, of course there's Elsie Richardson and a number of the people, including the woman who was then writing for the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News]; she came onto the board, too--or at least wrote a lot about the--Bedford-Stuyvesant. So it was, it was an exciting time. And we had, you know, ice skating; we built a skating rink there at Restoration, and every Christmas season, you know, the Kennedy family would be there doing--skating, wonderful pictures of Ethel [Ethel Skakel Kennedy] and the rest of them--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --skating with local--
Speaker 1: But that's after he passes away.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 640753
Speaker 1: I mean, first of all, this is the first time you're heading something, right?
Speaker 2: Ah.
Speaker 1: I mean you've been on a--you were, you were--right?
Speaker 2: Well, it depends. I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean you were, you were with the police [New York City Police Department]; I mean you were sort of--
Speaker 2: Well, it depends how you, you think of it. I'd say--
Speaker 1: Well, you were captain of the basketball (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I'm all--you, you know, it's that crazy period in your life when--you know, I graduate from high school [Franklin K. Lane High School, Brooklyn, New York] early, so I find a job at--waiting to start college in the fall. At that time I wanted to be a civil engineer; that was my personal vision, so I read an ad for an assistant in a engineering firm; Faucus and Baron [ph.] was the name of the firm.
Speaker 1: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I go, get interviewed--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to become--and I work there.
Speaker 1: So, but you're saying--but I understand that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All these things--
Speaker 1: --there's this progression--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but I'm saying that be--here--first of all, Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy]--the Kennedys are very, very well respected, and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you're right, Earl--you know, Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] is there, and you've known him--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but you're dealing with--and I'm not saying because you had come out of the--I mean you--the, the thing is, is up to this point you've touched people, or people--you've been associated with people who are either--come--roy- royal--what I call American royalty families--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --or you are handling, you know, high profile--involved in handling high profile cases, or your career also has become high profile.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But what I'm trying to understand in this initial period--
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: --where it's the community on one side who--and white wealthy business CEOs who have no clue about the community.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How are you bridging that and getting things done? And how long does it take for you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It takes a while.
Speaker 1: --to take--really get the organization [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York] on track?
Speaker 2: It takes, it takes a--maybe two and a half, three years to get it going (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 640754
Speaker 1: So my idea of doing it for a couple a years to get it started evaporates because I've gotta stay to not just get it started, but to build it so that--and then the Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] death is a deep blow to everyone.
Speaker 2: So there are people that would think that it was gonna go away with his death, right?
Speaker 1: I know, I know. But, to their credit, that doesn't happen. And Benno Schmidt [Benno C. Schmidt, Sr.], who actually worked--turns out there're double, triple, quadruple ironies in all of this because Benno Schmidt turns out to be one of the stalwarts on the Development and Services group [Bedford-Stuyvesant Development and Services Corporation, New York, New York], and so he keeps that alive and functioning, so--and re- John Doar is there for about five years or so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that was the, the--I just wanna--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that was the white business--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the business group, yeah; I'm sorry, yeah.
Speaker 2: --the, the group, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, that's--well, our, our group in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York] was racially integrated but it was predominantly African American, but we had--a minister from one of the churches who was Caucasian was on the board and, you know, so--there's some literature on it somewhere. So it was a, it was a fascinating combination--somewhat atypical, because you had both the political power 'cause you had both senators remember. We only talk about Kennedy, but Javits [Jacob K. Javits] was also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Javits, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --on the board. And you have the head of IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], the head of Citibank [Citibank, N.A.], the head of CBS. I mean whoever saw all these people in the same room (laughter), along with others whose names don't pop into my head right away, but--and then you get the assassination of Kennedy, so you, you know that some subset of that group is going to peel off because you reason in your mind that they are in it, in part, for the mission. I, I don't mean to say otherwise, but it's also because it's the, the initiative of someone who's likely to become the president of the United States, so then when he's assassinated, the fear you have if you're in that group is that now what? These--how many of these people will stay and for how long, with no Kennedy soon to be president situation? And several of them stayed quite a long time, but among them--just as a digression, but Andre Meyer who founded (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was the investment--he was Lazard [Lazard Freres and Company, LLC].
Speaker 1: He was in--he, he was in--yeah and, and, and he's part of the group that Kennedy assembled, so I, I smile sometimes because, you know, there's--Vernon's [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] at Lazard (laughter).
Speaker 2: Lazard--and you couldn't have even anticipated that.
Speaker 1: No, no, we didn't--it was--it was not contemplatable, as they say (laughter), you know.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: So, all of this is--I guess the, the message I would take away from it is there's no straight line here; there's a line that, that we use in moves and, and interacts in a way that was, in some ways, among the most distinguishing features of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation [New York, New York]; and the fact that it's still alive and well fifty years later is kind of extraordinary.
Speaker 2: It is extraordinary.
Story_ID: 640755
Speaker 1: I wanna go back. Was it when, when D and S [Bedford-Stuyvesant Development and Services Corporation, New York, New York]--you had to fight for ending their control over the funding.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that before Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] dies, or is it after Kennedy dies?
Speaker 2: That's a--
Speaker 1: So you would have a joint account (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's, that's before--it's roughly around the same time; I don't quite--I'd have to look more carefully.
Speaker 1: Okay. I know it's 1967, and it says you organized a Community Home Improvement Program.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And with that, you were able to consolidate the funding.
Speaker 2: Yeah--oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And that was important because otherwise you have a--I don't wanna call it a planta- you know, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Crazy. Oh, sure; of course.
Speaker 1: --a plantation (laughter).
Speaker 2: So you--you're fighting all--you know (laughter), it's a 24/7 job, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, because much of the community work is in the evening because people are working during the day, and so you've gotta be around for these meetings that take place, and prepared to, you know, explain, explain, explain; resist where necessary; consent where you think that makes sense, and then you also have to deal with the D and S group, the business types, during that phase, who have their own person. They have John Doar who's working for them, and so we work it out.
Speaker 1: Okay. But John Doar, he leaves in time, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he leaves.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he leaves.
Speaker 1: He leaves. And does that allow you then at that--
Speaker 2: Well, then we can collapse everything--
Speaker 1: Together.
Speaker 2: --together, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's really what happened.
Speaker 1: Okay. And that's the period where you can really start taking control and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I really have everything at that point now, and--
Speaker 1: Right--that's--
Speaker 2: --it's a--by then--I mean I had pretty much the, the Benno Schmidts [Benno C. Schmidt, Sr.] and the Bill Paleys [William S. Paley] and that group, right? They knew that there was a need to change the structure the way it had been initially set up and, and so we did--they did. And, you know, we basically put the groups together and it takes a while, but it, it really does make a positive difference in things, and so I end up staying a little longer than I'd originally planned.
Story_ID: 640756
Speaker 1: You could speak both languages, basically, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I was closer to the, the business group [Bedford-Stuyvesant Development and Services Corporation, New York, New York] than John Doar was, for example, and John had a great reputation as a lawyer, and had been involved in some of the civil rights work in the--in the South, but I think it's not unfair to say limited, if any, experience where the large part of the control was in the hands of the African American folks, so I'd say tough on both of us--of our parts, you know? And I--we got along okay, but I, I didn't--I don't think I welcomed him at all into it, and that's--I remember saying to the, the business group--one of the meetings when they told me they were engaging John, and I said, "Then you'll have to tell me how I explain him to the community. What is it that he brings to this situation that we don't already have?" That's a pretty tough conversation to have, right? And, and then I said, "I respect your need to have someone working directly for you; that's, that's fine. But I don't want any meetings that I'm not part of."
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And it didn't take much to--everybody kind of said, you know, what do they say? You know. And it was hard on John because, you know, he'd been a distinguished lawyer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Civil rights activist.
Speaker 2: Civil rights activist.
Speaker 1: He had--he had accompanied James M- you know, he had been--played the role with the James Meredith escort, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know. And so it was a--it wasn't easy, and I think we both knew that in, in our own way, and I think he was--well, I can't speak for him. His son [Robert Doar] still has some affiliation with Bedford-Stuyvesant [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York] so it, it lasted beyond John. But it's a job he shouldn't have taken, in my opinion, but that was his call.
Speaker 1: And he was in that job how long? Do you know?
Speaker 2: Probably three years I'd say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe. I--I'm guessing now, but I think that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he starts to go partly back into private practice, and he takes on a couple of significant cases at some point. And it wasn't--you know I, I both empathized with him on the one hand because he was doing what was asked of him, and at the same time I said, "Well, what's your contribution?" You know; that's really what we need to talk about and--but I'd say we, we handled it pretty well, you know. And, and then, you know, he left. We, we remained friends throughout the rest of his life, but I--but we had to go through that transition where--in a reverse of tradition, the white guy has to give it over to the black guy because--not as a gift, but because the black guy knows more about it than the white guy so, you know, you have to (laughter)--and to be able to understand that without being angry and resentful and the like, and we--I think we both knew it and, I think, acted with appropriate respect, and it got done. I think his--one of his sons still has some interest in the Bedford-Stuyvesant effort and, and I know John felt very positive about his participation in it. And I don't think the, the awkwardness was, you know, debilitating; it was a kind of--well, this is a measure of where we've come from; it's not a measure of where we now are. And now we need to deal with where we now are and where we're going.
Story_ID: 640757
Speaker 1: Well, in some respects, Kennedy's [Robert F. Kennedy] stuff helped with that, too--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) because he had brought in John Doar and, and not really--you know, this is a time where people may be well intentioned but not really understand the black community.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and so there--you know, as you speak to the tension--so what are the things--because the whole concept of the CDC [community development corporation] was really community control in many ways (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --conceptually, right.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And so what were--I mean I, you know, read that lot of things were built around affordable housing, employment, (cough) the relationship between non-profits and government, arts and culture, health.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't know--education? I don't know if education was in there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was--education was in there, sure. And--
Speaker 1: So, how--which structure did you set up, to be successful? And who was key on your staff?
Speaker 2: Well, we'd have to pull up some of the names, but it was a solid staff, which was a, a great part of it.
Speaker 1: And funding was coming in, in, in--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. Ford, Ford stepped in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ford. Now, Susan [Susan Berresford], Susan--was she your program officer at the time (unclear)--
Speaker 2: For, for a minute she was, yeah.
Speaker 1: For a minute.
Speaker 2: She was the, the Ford person who was assigned by Mike Sviridoff [Mitchell Sviridoff], who ran that part of the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], to be the interface for the Ford Foundation in its dealings with Restoration [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York]. And after about--I mean she--you could talk to her, she'll tell you. I think she may have had two or three visits, and realized that Mike Sviridoff was himself directly involved with, with me and with the staff, and (laughter) so I think--I, I wasn't connected to Ford at the time, but I think she went to Mike and said, "You know, you don't really need me because you're dealing directly with, with Frank [HistoryMaker Franklin A. Thomas]."
Speaker 1: With Frank.
Speaker 2: "And he's doing it." So, so--quadruple irony that I end up hiring her to do work at Ford, right (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's really amazing, isn't it?
Speaker 1: So, so who is your, your assistant, though? She--
Speaker 2: Audrey [ph.]?
Speaker 1: Yes, and she--we have to convince her to be interviewed. She was saying--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, she's fine, yeah, she's good (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah. So--but she was your assistant at, at Restoration, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, from, from Restoration and all the way through to here, yeah. When I went to Ford, I took her, or invited her, and she worked with me at Ford all the time I was there, and when I left, she was still at Ford and, you know, we stay in touch.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And it's all been--
Speaker 1: But you first hired her at Restoration.
Speaker 2: Yes, she was a--I'm trying to remember, eighteen, nineteen, something like that. And I think she actually may have--her first job at Restoration. She had just come on as a secretary--not for me, but for one of the other members of the--of Restoration. And I needed someone to come and work for me, and she was recommended by that person to me, and I brought her on to my office. This is before we get to where they're now located. This was when we were downtown Brooklyn [New York] at the hotel [Hotel Granada]; we were working out of a hotel, and she must have been nineteen then, or something like that maybe? And was very efficient, very focused. And so she stayed with me from that point until I retired from Ford.
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: And, and she still stays in touch with the Ford people and, and with us here. Trying to get her to come in and put in a little time while--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, that makes sense (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) while, while the birth is taking place (laughter).
Speaker 1: While the birth is happening (laughter), 'cause I was (laughter)--'cause that's like--oh, a hand in glove relationship.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah.
Story_ID: 640758
Speaker 1: Well, I want--so this is the whole thing. You receive your first honorary doctorate from Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] in 1970. That's when you've been at Restoration [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York] for three--is it three? Three years, I think (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Probably--it's been--
Speaker 1: If I--it's maybe three, three and a half.
Speaker 2: I'd have to--have to look it up, but yeah, it's in that range.
Speaker 1: And, you know, there's this picture that, even your wife [Thomas' second wife, Kate Roosevelt Whitney] was showing me, of John Lindsay accompanying you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: This is like major.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You are thirty-six years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean--
Speaker 2: That's true, that is true.
Speaker 1: Those things do happen, but I'm just saying--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I know.
Speaker 1: So tell me--I mean this is what I--I'm trying to--this is, this is even before, I think, you've met Henry [Henry Schacht]--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and before you've even met Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Because Henry tells me 1971, Vernon tells me 1972--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --you know, in terms of those meetings.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So, was that a surprise to you? And, and how were you notified? And what was it based on and--
Speaker 2: Yeah. I knew--I'm trying to think when I met Lindsay. I guess it's when he becomes mayor.
Speaker 1: Right, when he became mayor, and you worked in his--as, as (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's when--that's when I, I meet him and his most senior people, Jay Kriegel among them, and others. I meet all of them during this period of time when I'm--when they basically ask me to stay with the police department, and I stay for a couple more years and, you know, we do the Civilian Complaint Review Board that Lindsay wanted established--the Civilian Complaint Review Board. Well, I actually--well, not me alone, but we organized the Civilian Complaint Review Board that remains to this day, and may be a little less active than would be ideal, but the--it's, it's there. So that period with--among the people working for Lindsay, is Jay Kriegel, who is a, a well known name. You don't see it so much anymore, but was very involved in all of the social development work that Lindsay was encouraging, and I get to know them. And then the Knapp Commission [Commission to Investigate Alleged Police Corruption] is formed, and I'm asked to become a member of the Knapp Commission. So I have had some experience with the New York police department [New York City Police Department], obviously, earlier, and some work dealing with Lindsay and his administration. So, in a sense, of the five of us who were on that board--
Speaker 1: On the Knapp Commission board (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On the Knapp Commission board, I guess I had more direct experience with city government and the like, than the other four who were, you know, super smart and capable and all that, but they hadn't had the same kind of exposure. So that's another area in which you just--everything blossoms up for you because you're dealing with the investigation that's underway and you're dealing with people, some of whom I knew from when they had worked for Lindsay earlier in their careers, so it was a--it was important. Then, the people on the commission were solid and--I mean all lawyers, and experienced and capable, and all of that, but I don't think any of them had had--I don't remember any of them having any direct experience with the New York police department (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) With the police.
Speaker 2: --and with the mayor's office as I did, so.
Story_ID: 640759
Speaker 1: Now, why did that commission [Commission to Investigate Alleged Police Corruption] get formed? Do you remember what the--wasn't there an incident or a series of incidents (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. It's, it's one of the--it's, it's one of the promises that Lindsay [John Lindsay] makes, I think--
Speaker 1: To the black--to the--
Speaker 2: --to the--whomever--to examine police behavior in New York [New York]; that was one of the elements that's in there. But we've got some--there's a book on it that's around that would be better at, at analyzing that; I've just forgotten some of the details, but I had the, the--I, I would call it a more interesting job in that I knew a little more about the police department [New York City Police Department] from having worked there as a deputy commissioner for legal matters, so--and having worked with the different factions within the department, you know--the associations that are formed by police officers, depending on your rank. So there's a--there's a senior officer's group that argues on behalf of the senior category, then other groups. So, having been in the department for that period, I knew a little bit about each of those groups, which was helpful to the commission as we were conducting the study. And we had, you know, staff who were out getting the information together. And I think the department was--I won't say they were uncomfortable because no one likes to be investigated, but they were aware, and I would say encouraged, that at least one or two of the members of the commission knew something about the department; we weren't just coming based on what we had read about it or what had been in the minds of some who decided on the need to have a, a commission. And the commission did a good job. And I think helped clean up some of the mess in the department. And I think there's a general view among people who study that notion of policing--that periodic reviews of behavior, attitudes, and performance of a department by people who are objective and knowledgeable can be a help to a department as it attempts to do its job. And every time you read about some officer using the gun first, you just--you cringe a bit because you just wonder how much training that person had actually had, and what produced a state of mind that allows you to fire six bullets at someone who, even if what you feared most was that he might be reaching for something that was a potential threat. I mean--how about one bullet? You know? Maybe on the hand? But any rate, that's a--that's a subject that is pervasive and unrelenting and, and sadly covers both black and white.
Story_ID: 640760
Speaker 1: It was the role that you were playing in Bedfor- Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bedford-Stuyvesant. Yeah, I think that's the big part of it, you know.
Speaker 1: --you know. And that Bedfor- Bedford-Stuyvesant was--had a reputation, you know; one because Ken- because of the president received--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It also had, I think, one of--it had a very bad riot, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right. And, and the demographics of it and the issues that were--you know, the poverty, the crime, the--all those things were gaining national attention, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that's fair, that it was kind of being elevated in a way that had not been the case before. Yeah, it's a--there's a big book out on Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. And I saw--I actually saw it. I was thinking maybe we could get over there--that there had been a oral history project done that you had, you know, been interviewed for (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, that's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's for--is it New York University [New York, New York]? I think maybe NYU. So I was going to go and check the--you know, try to do some checking out of that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But (cough) I still say that's young. I mean they--you know--and, and Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], that's your first one [honorary degree]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, okay, I'm just saying (laughter). Ivy [Ivy League] all the way, okay. I mean people would--never mind. Okay, sorry. I'll let that go.
Story_ID: 640761
Speaker 1: But what I want to--because I wanna get to the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], and we had talked about Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York], but by this point in time--so let's talk about your meeting of Henry Schacht. So, he, he was introduced to you by--
Speaker 2: Irwin Miller [J. Irwin Miller].
Speaker 1: Irwin Miller.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what was Irwin's thinking? So this is Henry's recount that you are all, you know, young leaders, you know, emerging--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and he thought--I mean you've got (laughter) Irwin doing it here, and--oh, god--the head of the Ford Foun- no, the other person who introduced you and Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.]. So, you've got these--
Speaker 2: Oh, Mike Sviridoff [Mitchell Sviridoff].
Speaker 1: Mike Sviridoff.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sorry, the head of Ford--okay. So, so tell me about the, the Irwin Miller situa- you know, how that comes about, and how you had met Irwin Miller to begin with. Was Irwin Miller involved with Bed-Stuy?
Speaker 2: I think--I have to double check some of this--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I, I think what happened in the Irwin Miller situation is that at some point while I'm working in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York], maybe through Mike Sviridoff's initiative I'm not sure, but McGeorge Bundy who's the head of the Ford Foundation and the trustees of the Ford Foundation, come to Brooklyn [New York] to see the work of Bedford-Stuyvesant, so there's some wonderful shots of them at the Sheffield facility [Sheffield Farms building; Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Plaza, New York, New York] that we would--had renovated and that's still there today, and Ford had been through Mike, but Ford and McGeorge Bundy who was--had to approve all this, was very helpful in assisting us as we were expanding in different areas and needed financial help of one form or another, and they had invited me up to the Ford Foundation to speak to some of the staff and to McGeorge Bundy at some point, and I think once maybe even to the trustees; I can't now remember that, but--and when Ford had made grants to a couple of other institutions in Brooklyn and they were either having some difficulty of one kind or another--I don't remember the details at the moment. But I get a call from the office of the president of the Ford Foundation wanting some help with a particular problem they were having with a group that they had funded that was doing whatever it was, so--I think that happened once or twice (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Maybe they--they had--it was a controversial grant.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a controversial grant.
Speaker 1: Controversial grant (laughter).
Speaker 2: And so I meet with the--with the people involved, as you would expect and, you know, listened to their story, and tell them that I'm there to try and understand it, and to be able to help communicate it to the foundation that was also providing some support to Restoration during that time. And so I would--that maybe happened three times, or something like that, and Mac Bundy was very appreciative of a willingness to, you know, help take the steam off of some of the situations that they were involved with, and I--and then, of course, he visited us in Brooklyn, along with the trustees. So they had gotten to know Restoration, you know, reasonably well and, I think, were impressed not only with what they saw that we were doing, but also with the fact that there was a business community element in here as well. I mean that's my take on it, but if I were in their place, that would have made a positive difference to me that Benno Schmidt [Benno C. Schmidt, Sr.] was there, and others were there--all super high achievers in their own sectors and, and that Restoration had a board that was a diverse board, comprised not only of local people, but also of people with different kinds of experience.
Story_ID: 640762
Speaker 1: All of that to say that, without articulating it so much, we were--or at least I was increasingly getting asked to be helpful in some way to either some grants that Ford had made, or some group that they were trying to be helpful to that needed--would benefit from seeing some of what we [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York] were doing and how we were doing it, and I think, in particular, how you control those elements in any organization that can be a death knell, if they run amuck in some way. So I think that was, was there as well. And I think we even had visitors from outside the United States that were being supported in part by Ford in one way or another, and this was a chance for them to see something that was tangible, demonstrable, meet the people who were involved in it, much more interestingly than--'cause I remember people from India and people from other countries who had some relationship to the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] coming to see the work in, in Brooklyn [New York], and my meeting with a number of them--not me alone, but including me. So, we had reached a point where there was a relationship, and I think Mac [McGeorge Bundy] was a, a main factor in that because I can remember occasions when I would go to a meeting someplace and there'd be some people who'd been part of the Democratic administration who were close to Mac and some of what he was interested in and, and if I had to analyze it, I'd say Mac saw the range of things we were doing in Brooklyn and, and was happy to see that happening and wanted, therefore, to be supportive of it in all reasonable ways. He saw the business group [Bedford-Stuyvesant Development and Services Corporation, New York, New York] that was associated with us no matter how active they were, and I think they, they both wanted to be helpful to what we were doing, and they wanted to have some aspects of what we were doing manifest in other things that Ford was supporting, both in this country and beyond. And that worked pretty well. There's some wonderful photos someplace of the Ford trustees visiting us (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Coming to visit?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We pro- I probably--I bet they're in the, the Ford archives 'cause Darren's [HistoryMaker Darren Walker] gonna let me have access to it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, so you became really a lead grantee is what you're saying and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'd say that's probably right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 640763
Speaker 1: So--but how did Irwin [J. Irwin Miller]--so Irwin.
Speaker 2: Irwin's on the board of the Ford Foundation [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: So he then--he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He picks up the fact that that there's this--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --this guy out there who's doing this kind of work and we've seen some of the work. We've now met the person; he'd be interesting to have involved in our company if he would be willing to do it. So Irwin invites me to go to Columbus, Indiana where Cummins Engine [Cummins Engine Company; Cummins Inc.] is operating, and I go there and I meet the kind of heirs apparent who are working for Cummins Engine, one of whom is Henry Schacht. I think that's the--I mean I could be wrong as to the sequence of things, but I--that's pretty close to, to right. And so I meet Henry and--by which time I think also (laughter)--I guess--I, I apologize because it's hard to put all these things together. I get invited by Bill Paley [William S. Paley] to become a director of CBS. And Bill had been on the board of the D and S Corporation [Bedford-Stuyvesant Development and Services Corporation, New York, New York]. He had arranged the meeting while Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] was still alive and Javits [Jacob K. Javits]--about getting a, a college in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York]. That meeting takes place in Paley's office at CBS, and I'm there along with the representatives of that part of the government who had to make a decision as to where the funds would go. So Paley's kind of in the thick of facilitating. He's not proactive on the specifics, but by making the invitation to his office at CBS, and you get both Kennedy and Javits coming to that meeting, and you get the people from whatever part of the government have the decision to make as to where the, the next facility is going to be built, and they're pitch- we're all pitching Bedford-Stuyvesant as the location. And I think the fact that we were able to assemble that array of, of talent and experience went a long ways towards what became Medgar Evers College in, in Bedford-Stuyvesant. So, anyway, all of those things kind of fit together in their own way; I don't think Paley attended very many meetings, but he was there to be helpful as needed. So anyway, Irwin Miller is on the board of the Ford Foundation when Ford is especially active with us in Brooklyn [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York], so I think that's where I first encounter Irwin Miller. And then I hear about his firm--his business and what they're doing in Columbus, Indiana and I think I get invited to come out there and meet with them and all that, and I do that and I think that's--I don't know if that's when Henry and I meet or if it's later when Bill Paley asks me to go on the board at CBS. And that's like 1981 or something, and I go on that board and Henry Schacht is invited onto the board at about the same time, so Henry and I meet each other at CBS, as well as whatever happened out in Columbus. And--
Speaker 1: But 1971, he's sure that he met you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that's, that's, that's '71 [1971] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that happened--that happened in Columbus, Indiana.
Speaker 2: Yeah. So--
Speaker 1: Okay. And so he's, he's one of the heir apparents for Cummins.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right. And then--and you are already esta- you know, established, but on the radar of significant people in society.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and--
Speaker 1: So that's how--that's how you first meet.
Speaker 2: Hank [sic.] and I meet in--at CBS.
Speaker 1: Okay. But then you really meet at CBS.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and then we go--then I go on the board at Cummins Engine, so I'm there with Hank also, so we're--
Speaker 1: And at the time that you go on the board with Cummins Engine, where is Hank? Is he CEO at the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He's about to become CEO of that--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's a--he gets appointed CEO at that point and, and we've been hanging out together ever since (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, because you--those relationships--it's like you met within a year of each other but these are two extremely close relationships (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I know, I know. It's a--
Speaker 1: And rose where there--you know, I mean--well, anyway, it's--I think it's the old way of doing things more--you know, the--corporate CEO types and the civic engagement, they were a little different now. I mean I'm not--you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Yeah, I do.
Speaker 1: It was a little different than now, and I'm not sure of the upcoming because I--
Speaker 2: What's next, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, what's next. But--and it was--oh, it was a gentlemen's club, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.
Story_ID: 640764
Speaker 1: So, then you meet Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.], you have your--and you've talked about that, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Mike Sviridoff [Mitchell Sviridoff].
Speaker 1: And--Mike Sviridoff who also is bringing two, two people together that he thinks should know each other.
Speaker 2: We should know each other, that's right.
Speaker 1: And he was a perfect matchmaker.
Speaker 2: He was perfect because (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay. He could've been in the Jewish community, what they call the da- you know the person who finds the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was, he was the organizer, yes.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) The yentel [sic. yenta].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) He was your yentel. So, so that happens in 1972, and I just--I want to--just before we leave the, the Restoration project [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what are you particularly proud what you accomplished? Now, there was a concept of the superblocks--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the two superblocks, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the building out of really the community starting with even the office space [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Plaza, Brooklyn, New York]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, where you were, were located.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and does this--I wanna ask you--
Speaker 2: Actually, the, the superblocks are the product of I.M. Pei, the great architect, who develops this idea and offers it to the Bedford-Stuyvesant arrangement, and I think that begins pretty early because you have Ed Logue [Edward J. Logue] and you have a number of other players who have been brought together by Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy], and the only thing that's delaying accelerating this effort is what's going on in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York]. Who are the leaders in Bedford-Stuyvesant who--to whom we can turn and with whom we can work, and who can help us achieve all the things that are being sought. So you had a, a group going on led by Ed Logue; he gets I.M. Pei, he gets a number of other distinguished people from around the country, and he's ready to go and he's--and I come along and I say, "Tilt! Stop! I don't understand all of this so let me understand it before we go too far down this road." And that produces a, a period in which I spend time with I.M. Pei understanding what he is proposing, we get a couple of the foundations--not Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York] in this instance--who are interested in supporting this idea. We then market it to the community leaders in the blocks where this would take place, and Brooke Astor is a major donor in that, and Brooke wants to meet with some of the people in the blocks, so we meet at the home of one of the families in the block and they meet her, she meets them, you know. We wanna be sure that the construction that takes place is done right; we've gotta get permission from the federal government to close off that block and--from the city and the state, and all that stuff had to be done and--which means lawyers going hither and yon to get the necessary approvals, all of which end up happening, and we wanna be sure that the--not just the superblock, but the building that's gonna go up on that block--we're building a, a residence--residential building, and Jeh Johnson [Jeh Vincent Johnson] is the architect on that building, and that's the father of Jeh [Jeh Johnson] who worked for the Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] administration that's--and Jeh is a graduate of Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], which is where I met him when he was studying architecture at Columbia. So there was a--these pieces just kind of had to be pulled together in a way that--one, addressed the community. One of the things I'll never forget was that the architects had designed the benches that would go on the street, you know, where you could sit and relax, and when the community looked at the benches, they said, "We don't want the benches to be any longer than X amount," and, you know, I think the designers didn't--couldn't quite gather what was the problem, and what the problem was, was that the people knew that if you made a bench that was longer, you would have people wanting to sleep on the bench; if you make the bench shorter, and you don't have that problem. How's that for a little ingenious design knowledge on the part of, you know, supposedly unsophisticated people who know damn well what works, and what is less likely to work. Anyway, all of that--and the fact that it's Jeh Johnson who ends up designing (laughter) some of the, the building that goes up over there. I think Jeh is still alive. He's a couple of years older than I am, but it's his son who worked for Obama and has been in the news most recently. Small world.

Speaker 1: You actively engaged the community [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York]. You had a structure to, to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --at every part of the process.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: I could not help but sort of think about--and I wanted to get your input on this because I haven't seen any place where you commented one way or the other. And that was the Harlem zone [New York, New York] because, you know, that was a later day version of what was--well, you might say no.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But, but I'm just wondering what do you see as similarities or differences in that because that also got a lot of notoriety--of focus on more of the, the education as the center--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but also trying to build the community around.
Speaker 2: Yeah. You're thinking of what Columbia's [Columbia University, New York, New York] doing in particular?
Speaker 1: No, not Columbia but--well--oh, gosh, what is the head of it? He's not--no longer the head. The Harlem promise. I'm sorry, Harlem promise zone, the promise zones.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah. You know, I've not actually spent any time on that. I should, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) See, and I was thinking--I mean--I just was thinking it was a new--like a new--your con- the concept of the Restoration [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but repackaged--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --as something new, and then they were starting to do these promise zones in different part--like Chicago [Illinois] started a promise zone.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so I was just curious about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I, I haven't spent any time on that; I should--I haven't.
Speaker 1: But--okay. So you--what other things that--was there a point where you felt that the Restoration project was ever getting away from its mission, or were there projects that you were not able to accomplish? Because you spoke about the cable television--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --franchise [Continental Cablevision, Inc.; Comcast MO Group, Inc.] and your sadness about how--you know, when they sold it after--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know. And you spoke--you know, you've spoken about Medgar Evers [Medgar Evers College, Brooklyn, New York], which was important--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --because that's--a col- a college within a community makes a huge difference.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Were there--what about on the healthcare side? What were the--
Speaker 2: There were a couple of directors of Restoration who were medical doctors. I--the name escapes me at the moment, but--and they had--they did some work on the quality of the healthcare system in that region, but there were--there were bigger issues that they were working on as well that affected the African American community in particular, and sadly, I think all of those people have passed on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I'm not as--I don't have a good recollection of, of that, but Restoration should have a--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --something on--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no; we'll be able to find that. So the--so are there any other things that you are particularly proud of that came out of that period or any other--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm proud of the fact that it's still alive and working, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, that's legacy (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That, that's the biggest (laughter), and--
Speaker 1: Well, in many ways, it accomplished--I mean for all the reasons that you spoke of just a little bit about the community changing, and people not being able to see the impact necessarily--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --of the change that--'cause people would not have thought of living in Brooklyn [New York] at that point.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: And now some people say it's a preferred place to live (laughter).
Speaker 2: I know (laughter). I just--I, I worry about the people who are endazzled by what they can sell their property for without having done a comparable study of what it's gonna cost them to get something comparable someplace else.

Speaker 1: Now, you divorce [Dawn Conrada] in, in 1972, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And at that point you have--are there four children?
Speaker 2: Four children, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you've been active--and so they're--you have--let's see, is it one girl and three boys?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or no, two girls, two boys (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Two girls and two boys, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Keith [Keith Thomas] being the oldest.

Speaker 1: And then Hillary [Hillary Thomas].
Speaker 2: And then Kerrie [Kerrie Thomas].
Speaker 1: Kerrie, and Kyle [Kyle Thomas].
Speaker 2: And then Kyle, yeah.
Speaker 1: So the boys were the bookends.
Speaker 2: The boys were the bookends, yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Bookends, okay. And, and so during that time, you--but you're very active, active and involved in a lot of ways.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, were they--what ages were they at that point? Do you think--
Speaker 2: What's the year again?
Speaker 1: This is 1972. You're thirty-eight.
Speaker 2: I'm thirty-eight, so they're--let's see, the oldest is now sixty.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah. So it kind of goes down from there.
Speaker 1: Right. Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And they have children (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, 'cause--and, and, and the chi- because I was seeing the, the family pictures--they're beautiful.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean because it's such a integrated (laughter)--
Speaker 2: It's--well, it's all--so crazy (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean you and Kate [Thomas' second wife, Kate Roosevelt Whitney] really merge.
Story_ID: 640767
Speaker 1: Well, I--you know, I meet Kate's father [adoptive father, John Hay Whitney] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And which--right, in ninet--
Speaker 1: --at Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration. He comes on one of the visits and then he sends me a message the next day or two, or something, about the visit, invites me to come to his office, I do, and he wants to know, you know, "What are the--what's the major--what are the major obstacles you're confronting? And where do you see the greatest opportunity?" And all that, so I have a session with him and his--the person that runs his foundation [John Hay Whitney Foundation, New York, New York]; his name--Arch Gillies was his name. And I tell him that we are--the most highest potential opportunity I see is the possible ability to get the cable television franchise [Continental Cablevision, Inc.; Comcast MO Group, Inc.] for that part of Brooklyn [New York], to get that in the ownership of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation [New York, New York], so that as cable television comes into fruition, the restoration corporation, on behalf of the whole community, would be in a position to be a major owner of that operation. He said, "Well, what--," and he says to me, "I understand." We talked a little bit about it. He says, "Well, what will it take, do you think, to be able to get that franchise because the city has to award those through some process." And I said, "Well, we'd have to be able to demonstrate that if we were given the franchise we had both the knowledge and the wherewithal to utilize it in creating what will be the cable system for that area." He said, "Well, what would that--how would you do that?" And I said, "Well, we'd have to get engineering studies to demonstrate what respectable engineers estimate it would cost to do what I've just described, and if that were done, what it would mean in terms of access to cable television in these areas." So, he then says, "Well, who would you get to do that?" And I said, "Well, there are some engineers who do that kind of work, and on and on, and it would cost--I don't know--probably a couple of hundred thousand dollars to get something like that done." So he puts up the money, through his foundation, to Restoration, with which we engage engineers and they do a study of the potential for cable television in that part of Brooklyn, and we apply to the city to compete for that franchise, and the, the competition is the people who run Madison Square Garden [New York, New York] and that whole family.
Speaker 2: That's the Dolans.
Speaker 1: Dolan family. And so the city divides the franchise in two, and gives us half and gives half to the Dolans. I see that as a lifeline for Restoration in perpetuity, as well as of enormous benefit to the community if, as, and when the cable systems come in and people subscribe, and there are costs involved in that and--anyway, so it's, it's a real opportunity. And at some point after I'm gone, I learn from some of the people at Restoration that they'd hit a period when they were in financial straits and they sold the franchise--
Speaker 2: Right--yeah, you were saying that.
Speaker 1: --and I just--you know, what can you say? I mean that's their decision to make. You can't make it from outside but, you know, you just cringe when you see what's been given up. But any event, that happened; the Dolans obviously bought it and they went ahead and did what they, they do, but it was--and Restoration got the benefit of whatever they sold it for, so it wasn't as though it was tossed away but it--I would have preferred a chance to see if we couldn't get it financed in a different way. Anyway, that happened.
Story_ID: 640768
Speaker 1: So, you had gotten introduced to Jock Whitney [John Hay Whitney]--oh, my god--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --by Benno, Benno Schmidt [Benno C. Schmidt, Sr.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Benno Schmidt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He comes and visits and--
Speaker 1: And then, and then, then you get involved in the foundation [John Hay Whitney Foundation, New York, New York] in fact--
Speaker 2: --then he then has, has his own foundation which was--
Speaker 1: And his foundation had a African American focus, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: So this--
Speaker 2: --it was focused on people of color coming from the South who needed enhanced education, et cetera, et cetera, he--and his interests--I'm just digressing for a moment--was that--he had been a prisoner of war for a period during the Second World War [World War II, WWII], and he had been--he along with some others had jumped from a train and--this is in France--and were helped by some local French people to get away from the Germans, et cetera, so he made a promise to himself that when and if he got back to the United States, that he was--you know, he'd been in the movie business, he'd been in a lot of other businesses but he wanted to do something that was bigger than that, and that would affect more people, particularly people who were being disadvantaged based on race. And that begins. He creates his own foundation and starts providing assistance to a cadre of people of color who come primarily from the South, and go to the best schools and get the best educations and the like, and that was part of his connection with Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], too, is that he'd been a student at Yale, I guess, and elsewhere, so he was facilitating a lot of this expanded education too. And the list of people--I, I don't remember it anymore, but we did a run in order to see who some of the beneficiaries had been of his earlier efforts in the South to provide education for--particularly for people of color--and it's quite a list. And I think Yale got a copy of the, the list and others did, and that was something that, you know, he really was--he, he took it on, and then he asked me and he asked Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] to go on his board, and he then invited his two children--adult children (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, well, that's what Kate [Thomas' second wife, Kate Roosevelt Whitney] was saying, that they didn't get invited until later (laughter). That was--
Speaker 2: No. They get in later; they don't, they don't get in at the--at the front end, no. I know her, her father and her mother [Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney] before I know her, and I guess it was just meant to be; that's all I can say because there was no planning involved in all this. And to her, the credit of both her parents, when her father was very ill and he asked me to deal with some issues that he had with some of the--a person that worked for him for a long time and ran his business in--which was the J.H. Whitney and Company business and--this is not for publication, but anyway I--he wanted, the person who was running it was doing things that he didn't want done, or wanted it done differently, et cetera, et cetera. So he's not feeling strong enough to do it himself; he's (unclear) bedridden at the time, and so I go at his request and have the meeting. Now you can imagine what that meeting was like with this senior person who's been running this part of the J.H. Whitney company, and here comes someone on behalf of the chairman-president-owner telling him what to do and not to do, as an emissary on behalf of Jock. So, I--we got very close in that regard. And the same with Kate's mother who, you know, who just--you know, just kind of love at first sight, you know; you meet each other and that's, that's it. And when her mother was at her--I think it was her--either her eightieth birthday or something--by then Jock had died and she was, you know, you know, not well and--but she always dressed to the nines and was--and we, we have the birthday celebration for her and she wants to dance but she's--can't really do it. So she takes off her shoes and stands on my feet as we dance, right?
Story_ID: 640769
Speaker 1: And then what year did you get married? She [Thomas' second wife, Kate Roosevelt Whitney] asked me to ask you that, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. God.
Speaker 1: What year did you meet?
Speaker 2: Beats me.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you know her, her parents [Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney and John Hay Whitney].
Speaker 2: Yeah. Vern [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] and I both go on the--his board of his foundation [John Hay Whitney Foundation, New York, New York] at roughly the same time I think.
Speaker 1: But were they exceptional people would you say?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause this is--you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're, they're, they're the real McCoy, you know; it's a--and I think--I'm just--I'm speculating now; I mean--I think having been a prisoner of war made a huge impact on him, and I think also seeing the degree of segregation that continued even in the [U.S.] military, you know? I mean it's the, the way we had ourselves structured as a country that was not in the long term best interests of black people, white people, brown people. And so he set out to do something that was within his power to do, and that's why his focus on education, his focus on people who had been disadvantaged in one way or another, and, and I guess if you've been a prisoner of war, you come away with some level of awareness and sensitivity and resolve that you might otherwise--you know, your life didn't cause you to interact with any of that experience, and so you could, in good conscience, not pay significant attention to it. I think having been a prisoner of war, with time to think and time to recognize that his life was saved by--not by rich people, but by people who had good values. And--so anyway, he, he came back committed in that, in that way, and to this day--I don't know; it's not for a report, but when he was planning an ev- what to do with what he'd been fortunate enough to accumulate, he thought the United Nations was crucial to the future of all of us, and it had its founding in an area not far from where he owned property in Nassau County [New York], and so he wanted to create a foundation that would utilize that property and make it a place that the UN and other entities seeking to resolve conflicts could meet in a setting that was unique and likely to bring out the best in the people who utilized it, and asked a, a number of us to see to that happening and so we, we did. And in the last, I guess, almost ten years now, this is a four hundred acre property in Nassau County, the, the most beautiful place you can think of. It's a facility; the United Nations uses it as a regular meeting place for its efforts at resolving conflicts in the world, and other not-for-profit groups utilize it as well.
Speaker 1: So he, he endowed that facility then.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I see.
Speaker 2: And so it was--oh, so much of life--kind of fortuitous. But I think the transformation that he went through as a prisoner of war was a trigger point for him. And Kate's mother grew up with a family with the most renown surgeon in the world; I mean he--his work on the brain is still taught in colleges and understood, and it's--his stuff is up at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] where he did a lot of work there, and was part of that World War II [WWII] group that went to Europe to help address the wounded there. It's a--it's quite a history. And quite, quite a burden to be left to be--see that it's, it's realized in the way that they had in mind, you know?
Speaker 1: You mean--
Speaker 2: Greentree [Greentree Stud and Stable, Red Bank, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: The Greentree.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 640770
Speaker 1: And then you've got the FDR [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] side of things (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You've got the FDR, you've got the Whitney side, you've got all that--
Speaker 1: So there it is.
Speaker 2: But at the point that you enter--so wait, when do you meet, when do you meet? You didn't answer that question.
Speaker 1: Met Kate [Thomas' second wife, Kate Roosevelt Whitney]?
Speaker 2: You met--because you said you met her father [adoptive father, John Hay Whitney] and mother [Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney] before you met her.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, because--
Speaker 2: 'Cause you had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Vern [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] and I get invited to go on his board [John Hay Whitney Foundation, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: To be on the board. But when--
Speaker 1: --and he then later invites his daughters to go on the board.
Speaker 2: So that's when you meet? When--
Speaker 1: That's when we meet, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, you don't meet until they get invited to be on the board.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So what--how many years are you on the board before the--
Speaker 1: I don't know. I'd have to look.
Speaker 2: So were they advocating involvement? Or were they, were they saying this is not fair, or--
Speaker 1: I don't know what they were saying (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I don't know.
Story_ID: 640771
Speaker 1: When Ford asks me to agree to be interviewed for the job at the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], I'm then on the board at the foundation but I'm not--I don't work for the foundation--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --just finished working in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York], I'd just got a nice--
Speaker 2: You had a office--
Speaker 1: --office in Midtown [Midtown Manhattan, New York, New York] and--so anyway, I then get asked by the, the Ford team that had been charged with finding the successor for McGeorge Bundy, and they have their three hundred names that they're going through and I'm just one of the twelve or fourteen members of the board at that time, and I'm not part of the committee at all, and so--and I've traveled with them, we've been to Asia with the foundation to see some of its work there, but that was with other trustees as well. And they reach a point where the search committee reports back to the board that they've had three hundred applications for the job and they've been through the list with the help of consultants and the like, and they don't feel that they've found the right person to recommend, but they would like to interview one or two I think--I can't remember if I--I think it was two of us--who were on the board--if we would be willing to be interviewed by the committee. And, you know, I'd just finished the Bedford-Stuyvesant stuff [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York], I was--had a nice small office, thinking about what next, and I agreed to be interviewed, by which time I had already--and I said to them, "I have a commitment with the Rockefeller Foundation to do a study on U.S. policy towards South Africa," which I had taken an interest in and I was--that was high on my list of things I was about to do. And they said, "Well, we're at least as interested in that same subject as Rock- ."
Speaker 2: You explained that in the int- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I--yeah, I told them--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I said, "You know, you can interview me but here's what my situation is." And they said, "Well, we'd like to interview you anyway, and we--Ford are at least as interested in that same subject as Rockefeller, so why don't you--if this works out and if you're--you find a way to restructure the way you're gonna do that study for Rockefeller and take on this successor to McGeorge Bundy role, which you don't have to start immediately, but take some time anyway." I said, "Well, I need to talk to the Rockefeller people to see how they feel about having the heir apparent to the throne at Ford doing this work," (laughter), "for Rockefeller." So, anyway, we go through that, and Rockefeller's delighted at the thought of having the heir to be at Ford lead this study on U.S. policy towards South Africa. So, I--
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: You know, that's interesting because they--if they were--they don't wanna say--you know they couldn't compete with Ford at that point (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 2: You know, Ford is the nine hundred pound gorilla--
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: --in terms of foundations.
Speaker 1: So it's a--so I just about--I go on one of those twenty hour day work periods where, you know, you just sleep enough to stay alive because you've got all this stuff. I gotta close this office, I gotta get the team ready for this South Africa study. Irwin Miller [J. Irwin Miller] becomes part of the group that addresses the South Africa question, as he is interested in that subject, having a--
Speaker 2: So the study that comes out--time is running out.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Irwin Miller is part of that group.
Speaker 1: Part of--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's--he's, he's on that list.
Speaker 2: I see. So now, at that point in time had he been to South Africa? Or had he--
Speaker 1: He knew about South Africa because part of their--the Cummins Engine Company [Cummins Inc.] had done some business with companies that were--in turn, did some business in South Africa, so that was his interest, and he was a devout churchgoing Episcopalian and didn't like, obviously, what he saw there, but he was also a business person, so was it possible to keep--to do work in a place that was behaving the way South Africa was behaving towards its majority population? And so--I say all this because this is a period--I mean just about myself, that I don't have any spare time. I mean it's all--it's all absorbed, but--with these commitments and trying to get them right, and do them right, and, and it's, it's, it's tricky; it's a tricky time, difficult time, important time. I mean I don't regret any of it, but it was not simple.
Story_ID: 640772
Speaker 1: Well, I went back and also read about Mac Bundy [McGeorge Bundy], and he was quite a character in a lot of ways. You, you talked in the last interview about the fact that he announced his--you know, that he was--
Speaker 2: Four years, that's right (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Four years (laughter).
Speaker 2: How's that for declaring something that--over which you really don't have any control but you just take control of it (laughter)?
Speaker 1: And you know, in his--you know he had been very involved or had gotten the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] very involved in race relations and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I think it's a decentralization of New York [New York] schools. But he also--there, there had been the financial issues with--
Speaker 2: Well, the--oh, you mean at Ford?
Speaker 1: At Ford.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, they had spent down the--
Speaker 1: A lot.
Speaker 2: --the--yeah; I mean it's the classic time when you get these jobs, right? It's when--
Speaker 1: The black people get the jobs is what you should--you should say (laughter). You should say it's a classic time that the black people get the jobs (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know it because--you know?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) There is--you come into a situation and, and there isn't even no--there no resour- I mean a billion--a billion dollars back then was--is a lot of money.
Speaker 2: Oh, I know.
Speaker 1: He had lost, I think--well, I had read a billion dollars.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know. It was a, it was a--I mean I have no, no regrets--absolutely fascin- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But did--you knew, you knew that part--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --because you had been on the board. But what was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. But I--I'd been on the board for maybe two years, three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 640773
Speaker 1: But what was the board [of the Ford Foundation, New York, New York] looking for--did it say it was looking for. And--
Speaker 2: I don't remember any statement suggesting criteria for a new CEO. Our--that was given to a, a search committee was charged with that responsibility. Someone in the--whatever the criteria were that they put out because they've published all of that, you know; it was out in the, in the media. And, you know you, you just wait to see who they're gonna come up with and--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: I didn't pay a lot of attention to that search 'cause I--you know, you get three hundred applicants; I mean--so when they doubled back some months later to the board, and say that they don't think they've found the right person at that point and would like to expand the interview to include--I think it was two of us who were on the board at the time who were asked if we would agree to be interviewed. And, you know, I, I did--you don't automatically say no, you don't automatically say yes. I mean I'd--my life had changed a lot, and all that happening; then I thought, well, why not? I'd already turned down a job with the--with the U.S. government, you know, when what's his name became--
Speaker 1: Well, when Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Carter became--
Speaker 1: And why did you turn that down again?
Speaker 2: I--I'd said to him that I'd just finished working on a tough set of assignments and--including some that involved working with parts of the federal government on housing and other issues, and the last thing I wanted to do was to go deeper into that, and so we had one of those conversations. I flew to Georgia to meet with he and his team, and he's made the pitch, you know, and then he--I respond and then he ends up excusing the others who were in the room and it's just the two of us. And he said, "Tell me what's your--what's your ideal job? Tell me what that ideal job would be?" And so I say to him, "Well, I guess it would be president of the United States, but I'd be willing to wait eight years for that." And we both burst out laughing, right? And he knows he's dealing with another crazy guy across the table from him (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So, we've been friends ever since, too. Been helpful to him in a lot of ways, and a great respect for him, but that's the state I was in. I wasn't--I wasn't looking for another position someplace; I just--you know--divorce is a difficult time--
Speaker 1: Yes, they are hard things.
Speaker 2: --on everybody and, and it, it was, it was a time when I just thought, you know, pause, stop, you know, you can't keep doing what you've been doing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At the same rate.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can't do that.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Pace, I mean pace.
Speaker 2: And--so that was pretty good, you know, I'd--but other people look at your life and think they know it and think, "Oh, you're--it's just been," you know, "an easy walk," and it's--yes, in terms of opportunity, no question about that; in terms of doing, it is demanding as all get out.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And, and that's the part that is, you know, understandably not understood, and--
Speaker 1: Well, for people who don't do that amount of work but people who--I mean you have to--you're given those opportunities but you've gotta deliver.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you can't--you're not gonna--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's just--
Speaker 1: If you don't deliver, then you don't get more opportunities.
Speaker 2: That's it.
Story_ID: 640774
Speaker 1: What I was wondering was in this--so I was saying--can you describe Mac Bundy [McGeorge Bundy] to me a little bit? Because you had--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, gotten to know him both with--you know, as a, a lead grantee, and also on his board, and, and then also as his successor [at the Ford Foundation, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause those are all the--all those things are--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Incredibly smart and gifted intellectually, I think with very good values, I would ascribe that to him. I think less flexible than would have been ideal, but willing to defer to others in areas that he didn't feel especially comfortable in. So it was a--it was interesting; he had things he was deeply involved in and interested in--international relations in those arena meant a lot to him because I think he saw--I mean I don't know this for a fact, but I think he saw the world as a--the time he worked in the U.S. government and saw things from how difficult it is to really do the things that need to be done when you're in a position where that's expected of you, and yet your ability to realize that expectation and address it is constrained by a host of externalities that exist. And I think he was probably less tolerant of things like women's rights for example. Not, not negative, but just--it was, it was a notch below the area of his interests. Now, that may be wrong, it may be even somewhat unfair, but I think that was a--an observation I would, I would make.
Speaker 1: He was a hawk, too, I would call him.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean because he had been a proponent of the Vietnam War--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but he was on the other--then he was on the other side with race relations, you know, and you--
Speaker 2: So it was a--it was tricky. And we got on well but didn't have what I would call deep conversations. I think--I'm not sure of all the whys behind that, but that's what I would have as a takeaway. He couldn't have been friendlier to me, and then when I was given what was his--had been his job, and I said, "Well, I couldn't start for another period 'til I unwound some other things I was doing," I think he was helpful, and I don't think he paid a lot of attention to the details of things; I think he deferred a lot of that to his senior people--sorry about that (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't--
Speaker 2: But I, I would say I, I didn't know him well, but I, I knew him and I admired his brilliance in so many areas. But I think I saw limitations, I would say that.
Story_ID: 640775
Speaker 1: So, how do you come in and shake things up the way you did? And I say that because he [McGeorge Bundy] had, he had been iconic--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --as a leader. I won't say noncontroversial 'cause there were things that the Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York] was coming under scrutiny about.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The gov- you know, people at the government, you know--what, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Well, he had a big fight with the government, you know?
Speaker 1: Right. What are you funding? You know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Why are you doing this? You know, that type of thing. So--but it takes--so, one, who is advising you? And how is the board structured? 'Cause then you have your own issues with the staff structure.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and I'm just trying to understand that. Plus, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think what happened with the Ford board is--there was a period in which there was a lot of skepticism about what could be done effectively in both the inner city and the issue of race in the country and, and the role of the U.S. in the larger world community. And with offices in so many places around the world, as Ford had at that time, you know--major offices in India, and some in Africa, but Latin America and elsewhere, it was--and Ford's trustees at the time, I think, included some people who had differing views on the role of the U.S. in the political world, and how things were sorting--and in the business world, too. And I would say particularly the business group of which I would include, you know, Henry Ford [Henry Ford II], who wrote the infamous letter when he stepped down as a member of the board, basically saying that the board was supporting things that were anathematic to the very institutions that gave rise to the money that--you know--you remember that whole period. It's a--he wrote quite a letter about it that's, that's in the archives, so it's available. And so that was a tension that existed.
Story_ID: 640776
Speaker 1: And he [Henry Ford II] finally abandoned ship and wrote--I mean it's one thing to abandon ship; it's another to abandon ship and write a letter that is dismissive, really, of some aspects of what the foundation was doing. So I didn't get to know him well; I overlapped with him just for maybe one year, and then when I was asked to be considered for the, the job, and I ultimately accepted, I sent him a correspondence from time to time to just, you know, give him a little bit of a heads up that there wasn't some irrefutable harm that had been done. He had a point of view and he had a right to express it, but his vote was no bigger than the vote of any other member of the board, so that was the way it had to work. So--hm?
Speaker 2: You--you (laughter)--
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying that (unclear)--no, it's a--but that's how I felt was that, you know, you're entitled to your vote.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: That's a--and the fact that you aren't in the majority means that your vote doesn't prevail, you know; that's how it works. And if you didn't want it to work that way, you would have--should have instructed differently, and then you probably wouldn't have attracted the kind of people that you, you want. So there is a tradeoff in this if you think about it. And then, periodically they, you know, invite you up to their area where they are, and I've quite often made the visit and spent time with them, but it didn't change what we funded. If they had something that fit the agenda then it was fine; if they didn't and--and Michigan was in trouble even then, so it was able--easy to be helpful in some areas that were needed by the broader community there. But--you know, it's interesting--none of these jobs that I--I think about them--is perfect for anyone; I don't care, black, white, brown, male, female, whatever it is. If you're in the position where the responsibility rests, whether fairly or unfairly, you're gonna catch hell when things aren't going as people would--including yourself--would wish them to go. And if you're not prepared to deal with that possibility, maybe even probability, then you probably shouldn't take these jobs because that's what comes with the job. And--anyway, all of that to say I go on Irwin Miller's board [Cummins Engine Company; Cummins Inc.] and I meet Henry [Henry Schacht], and then we go on Bill Paley's [William S. Paley] board and there's Henry, so we (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --and it's--so it's--well, I don't know how many years it's been now. We've served on the--similar boards for a long time.
Speaker 2: So, you went on those boards--now, one of them you went on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Before I went to Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Ford was CBS.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, that--well, no. Oh, 'cause I thought Bill Paley said--I--, "Why'd you take that job? I offered you a job." I--you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a different--yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He said (laughter), "I offered you a job," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, that's Paley saying, "I offered you a better job than that, why?"
Speaker 2: "Job than that, so why are you going over there to work for the non-profit?"
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, that was Bill.
Story_ID: 640777
Speaker 1: And I get Al Puryear [Alvin N. Puryear]; I don't know if that name rings a bell to you or not (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I do--I know that--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's an African American, smart as a whip, and I asked him to join me at Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York], he wasn't looking for full-time thing but I said, "You know, you got too good a brain to not have you involved in this early process as I try and sort what it is we're dealing with, and where the opportunities are, where the pitfalls are." And Al is a understated, calm, brilliant guy. So he agreed; he had helped me in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York] too, and we knew each other from there. And everything by the books--clean, straight, focused. He's a Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] ex-football player, and a brilliant guy, African American. And I said--I told him, "I need your help." And he said, "Okay." And he came and really helped first figure out the place, and how was--who's running what here and towards what end and with what results? And where are we and what might we do differently that would have a positive impact on the then financial condition of the foundation, which had deteriorated quite a bit, and--
Speaker 2: Because people had their fiefdoms, you know, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and they--and the last thing they wanted--you know, they were furious with, with me for (laughter)--I said, "I didn't hire me, you know? The board hired me, so if you have a fight, you have a fight with the board, in which case I think you lose that battle if you engage in it, but that's your call; you can make whatever decision you want, but my obligation is to, first and foremost, understand the way this place is operating, and that means not just here in New York [New York] but across the world--who the people are, what they bring to the organization, how useful are they, and where we think we need to go going forward, and what would happen if we reduce the size of the staff in a significant way." And, you know, many of them, I think, had expectations that they were safe and secure--
Speaker 2: For a lifetime?
Speaker 1: For a lifetime. And I said, "That's--that may be; it may turn out to be that, but that's not the terms under which I took the position that I'm in, and I find it hard to believe that's the conditions under which you were engaged, and if you were, I have to say to you that my recommendation to the board would be that we honor what commitments have been made up to now where we can, and where we can't that we start to close down to reflect the reality of the place, and to get it back on its financial feet." So, you know, a lot of back and forth and people understandably upset because they hadn't--nobody'd bothered them in that way, apparently, before. And so we get going, and Al does a great analysis and lays out some possible strategies to address some of the issues, et cetera. And I--once we work our way through that and agree, I talk to members of the board who are assigned to different areas of the foundation and say, "We're gonna make some changes; here's what I think we should do--here's the problem we're dealing with and here's a way of addressing it that I think makes good sense, and if I'm right, within the next period of years, we ought to be able to get the foundation into a healthy financial position--that's step one; and then we can get it sized in a way that addresses the future, and it's, it's going to be disappointing to some people who feel they have a lifetime arrangement and," even though no one ever offered that, but I guess that was the history that they understood, "so it's not going to be simple, and that's what I think we need to do, and if you think differently then we ought to talk about that, but otherwise, that's what I'm going to do."
Story_ID: 640778
Speaker 1: So I held meetings with the staff [of the Ford Foundation, New York, New York] in all the different areas and laid out where we were, where we had been, what had happened in the ensuing ten or twelve years, what trajectory we were on, and what that could mean going forward. So either we're going to fix things while we still have the ability to do that, with the hope that we can reposition it so it can be around in perpetuity. And that means that some who think they have a lifetime arrangement are gonna be disappointed because we're going to trim the staff and, (makes noise). So, anyway, we did all that.
Speaker 2: You did a lot of trimming of staff.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: This was--it was, I think, what--a quarter of the staff?
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Like over a hundred--it was over a hundred and something positions.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was a lot, it was a lot. And everybody got--I mean they're all disappointed obviously, but everybody got treated as well as you could expect to be treated; you're given three or four years of coverage, but it's the end. So I go to The New York Times, at their invitation--
Speaker 2: After some of this has happened.
Speaker 1: After some of this has happened.
Speaker 2: And this is--this is the--but it took--so it--you're saying within the year of stu- after that year of study this is when you make the decision now?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: How long does it take to get board alignment? That's a--
Speaker 1: I'd say about three years--to get it all sorted, and then I, I double back to The New York Times, at their invitation, and they, they start by saying to me--I've--never forget (laughter) the conversation. "You know it's, it's been a while since we last spoke." He said, "Oh, I would like to know what's, what's happened, you know, since then," and all that. And so we're--I give them a, a, a rundown, a generalized rundown of what we've done and where we then were financially, and how I saw the future and, you know, their, their response was, "You know, well, you know, it's obvious that place needed to be restructured, (mumbling)." And so I say back to them, "You mean now that I've survived you, what I did was obvious, is that it?" "No, I didn't mean that." "Oh, you guys are just so full of shit, you know--stop it!" You know. But I, I knew the, the then head of the newspaper from my Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] days; we'd both been trustees at Columbia, and so I was pretty relaxed with, with--I wasn't angry at all; I'm just saying (laughter), you know, "Now that I've survived you, you tell me what I did was obvious."
Speaker 2: Well, because they had--I remember reading the one article where they were, you know, talking about you being sequestered behind--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and then--well, I--you let go like some key people at the beginning, but you had to get your team in place, too (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right. Well, they were--
Speaker 2: And Harold Howe [Harold Howe II] was one of--but--
Speaker 1: They were all angry when they left.
Story_ID: 640779
Speaker 1: Cut to the chase, three years later I go back at the invitation of The New York Times and meet with their senior group. I don't know if you've ever met with that group; it's a--in those days--it's a roundtable--
Speaker 2: I haven't done that group but I've done that, right.
Speaker 1: There's a, there's a prayer that is spoken beforehand, and all of that stuff--anyway, so I go back; this is three years later I think it is, and they say, "Well, in fact, before we, we get started to get caught up," he said, "tell us what, what--what's happened in the, in the two years [at the Ford Foundation, New York, New York]." So I say, "Well, we've reduced staff by X (mumbling)," and I walk through, you know, the litany of stuff, which they knew, or should have known anyway but I, I go through it like I dutifully should, and they say, "Well, it's obvious that place needed to be restructured," you know, and I--and so I couldn't resist, and I say to them, "You mean now that I've survived you, what I did was obvious." And so (grumbling). Yeah, I don't know; it was a--I lost a little respect for them, and--I mean I won't say names, but one of the persons of color who was at the meeting--by then I'd been to South Africa, had done some beginning work there, and all of that, so I'm talking to the group and there's an intervention from one member saying, "Well, did they make you an honorary white person when you were there?" I said, "I don't ask those questions, and I don't answer them either."
Speaker 2: It came from the white person on the--
Speaker 1: No, it came from the black person on the board (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) board (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right (laughter), yeah--no names at this point.
Speaker 2: But, you know, these, these positions--these first positions can be--high visibility positions are hard positions--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --because you're walking really, a tightrope, and what I'm thinking (laughter) is that--I bet in those first three years you felt like you went--you went from the frying pan into the fire.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, that's, that's--
Speaker 2: Is that, or was it?
Speaker 1: That's true, but you know, all that does is--
Speaker 2: Success looks good from--
Speaker 1: --fire me up; that--that's all it does (laughter). And when I said that to The New York Times, "You mean now that I've survived you, what I did was obvious, but you--implicitly you were negatively critical during the process, and so suddenly now you're giving me praise because the process has been a success and--." But I, I knew enough of the family people there to--from my Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] days, that I didn't hesitate to say something to them that--but, you know, what do you do with this? It's a, it's part of life, and you don't hold grudges, you just adjust to the realities and don't get dissuaded from doing what you think should be done.
Story_ID: 640780
Speaker 1: You decided your focus was gonna be on poverty [at the Ford Foundation, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There had been a lot of investments abroad; you even said that there was, I think, in the last interview, that some--one of the places had a private--I mean one of the--
Speaker 2: Their own airplane.
Speaker 1: --a airplane.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and, and so that--those kinds of things had to end right there.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know. But, you know, it's, it's no fun being the guy or the gal who has to make the call when the call involves depriving people of something they'd come to believe they haven't--you know, not unders- not hard to understand that they believe it was a--
Speaker 1: But, you know, I, I was interested in pov- in your--I don't wanna say focus and definition--
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: --of poverty.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I was especially--you know, this is all hindsight, but given the time that we're in right now, when--because you had rural poverty--
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: --and nowadays people had almost forgotten about that.
Speaker 2: Oh, I know; rural pover- rural poverty and resources, that's we did, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right, um-hm. So I found that--so I was wondering who on your team--or how did you get to that?
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: You know, the focus--like a wholesale onslaught--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on poverty. And coming back--not so much international, you know, had gotten diffused--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you were saying--and this is--you know, we're talking about the early '80s [1980s]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --at this point.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So I'm just wondering how you got to that decision and, and the focus which is the province of a, a new head of a--an organization, that's what you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a--I had met people from different parts of the world while I was working in Brooklyn [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York], too, including some from India in particular, where they had done, you know, their version of some similar work, and other examples of that that you could read about in the literature--who was doing what, and some travel and exposure of staff who were familiar with some of these areas. And in a sense, beginning the process of empowering some existing staff members whose historic focus had been let's say this wide and this shape (gesture), and saying, "Well, what's happening out here (gesture) and over here, and over here? Who's doing what in these areas that we would benefit from knowing more about and finding ways of sharing knowledge and communication that could--?" And it, it's interesting because while it was, in some ways, perceived as a, a rejection of what had gone on in the past where there were the fiefdoms all over the place but they were independent in what they were doing, we were now saying that there're aspects of the human condition that are being manifested all over the, the spectrum, and how do we find out more about what the most successful of them is engaged in, and who do we turn to? Where to we look to find that kind of information? What contact do we have at the United Nations [UN], for example, for the leadership of some of those nations that are going through different experiences? Particularly nations where we have had some interests? But I think if we keep ourselves focused exclusively on the people who initially engaged us to be of assistance, I'm not sure we're seeing the larger picture where we could also be helpful.
Story_ID: 640781
Speaker 1: You know, when I go to a--and I did a lot of travel and I--so when and I go and I see that we've got our own airplane, we've got this, we've got, we've got--and, and we're working in areas that are overwhelmed with poverty, I mean--that doesn't compute for me, and I don't think that's the intention of any of us, but we're leaving the wrong message when we do it that way, and so how can we change that in a way that's beneficial to the people most in need who need our help, and where we can engage people who are either in government or related to government in some way so that we're not like a lone wolf out there but are advancing agreed upon values, usually in the UN [United Nations], if you look hard enough, you'll find that the nation states have made commitments, so we're not alone in wanting to know how those commitments are being fulfilled if they are, and if not, what the obstacles are and who might we be helpful in addressing it. So it changes the way you seek information in order to be able to better understand how to help address because you--you're not addressing these, you're helping other people address these issues; that's how it works. And--anyway, so, so it's kind of changing the way you think about the service you're providing, and how you enhance knowledge in people in institutions that might be able to do something to address some of the worst of these problems. So that--it's just a, a little--I'll call it a small slant on the way things had been, or appeared to have been done up to that point [at the Ford Foundation, New York, New York]. And the fiefdom business, you know, I just blow that out.
Story_ID: 640782
Speaker 1: So this is the thing. What you describe--or you're describing is almost a patrician approach to philanthropy--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --which the 19th century had that aspect of things.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And to a, a more innovative egalitarian approach, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but in helping. And at a time, you know, what--this is the Rea- these are the Reagan years [President Ronald Wilson Reagan]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and so resources are being squeezed; they're squeezed.
Speaker 2: Thin, very thin, very thin.
Speaker 1: And so foundations' role--or what, what they're gonna (unclear) their role right, are--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. So we walk the foundation asset base from--I don't remember the exact numbers, but let's say they had $2 or $3 billion in the--in their asset pool [at the Ford Foundation, New York, New York], and it's probably more like two than three (laughter), and I figure we've gotta get to a minimum of--
Speaker 1: I've even heard it gotten below two, I think.
Speaker 2: It, it, it may well have; I, I just don't quite remember the numbers (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think maybe 1.7 or something.
Speaker 2: But I says, "If we can get this thing up to above five, we're in safe country." And, of course, if you could do better than that fine, but let's, let's just pick a number that we have reason to believe--if we can get to that level, you can be reasonably assured of being around in perpetuity and still being useful during that time. And if we can get to the seven, that's even better. So, you know, we set about making the necessary adjustments, changes, and all that, and fighting the battles of people who feel they weren't guaranteed something in perpetuity and it's not the case. So we get all of that done, and get the endowment away from this 1 to 2 billion up to the 5 to 6 billion, which is really--because they had done investments in real estate in distant places that--they had bought, bought, bought, and there was, there was no market for what they were doing. So it was a lot of change and a lot of resentment. And when I finally go back to The New York Times people and they start in on their questions, and suddenly we've got a, an endowment that's up several billion dollars from where it was, we've got this, we've got that, and the statement--I think I mentioned to you the last time was that, you know, it's, "You know, it was obvious that place needed to be changed." And my response, "You mean now that I've survived you, what I did was obvious--that's what you're telling me." (Laughter) So it was--living through that, you come out the other side feeling pretty good about the, the place. And if you can get it on a track--you know I, I always went with a combination of information from people I trust and personal instinct, so if there's going to be a screw up, I want it to be one that I had something to do with, not something that I get responsibility for not having (laughter) had anything to do with. So it's, it's worked well and, you know, the, the endowment's in good shape now, as you know. And I think they will maintain it in good shape. It doesn't have to stay exactly where it is now, but--and I think Darren's [HistoryMaker Darren Walker] doing a good job.
Story_ID: 640783
Speaker 1: Was there at every- any point where you thought it might not go the right way? And who were your--who were your advi- you know, who were the people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that you counted on for advice and counsel (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Vern [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] and I started at about--I'm not sure how long ago it was, but it's Mike Sviridoff [Mitchell Sviridoff]--
Speaker 1: Who introduced you?
Speaker 2: --who was then at Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York] who introduces us, and Vern's working in Georgia and he'd come up and, you know, we know that there's a, there's a connection. And I go to Georgia, I meet his mother [Mary Griggs Jordan] who had--was the chef, and spent a little time with her, and then--by then, Vern is on a number of corporate boards--
Speaker 1: Corporate--
Speaker 2: --and the like, and I guess we had--we then go to South Africa--he and I. He's with Xerox [Xerox Corporation] at the time and I'm with Citi [Citibank, N.A.], and they both have operations in South Africa, and I--he and I talk and we say, "I'm not comfortable not knowing more about what the particular firm is doing in that country, given the then state of things." Mandela [Nelson Mandela] was still in jail, and all this was going on.
Speaker 1: But you went to South Africa before you went to the--joined Ford, right? Was it (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I, I go to South Africa in--when's my first time there?
Speaker 1: For some reason, I thought it was before you joined the Ford Foundation.
Speaker 2: My--I think I'm at--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember when it is we go 'cause we end up going on a TV show when we come back--I remember that.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: That may have been the--maybe the first visit was before. I guess I'm a, a director of Citibank, and he's a director of Xerox.
Speaker 1: Of--at Xerox. I'll have to go back then. I--
Speaker 2: And--yeah, I don't remember the dates now--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but it's a--
Speaker 1: But for some reason I thought it was before Ford, but I may be wrong.
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: But he becomes one of your chief sounding boards is what you're saying.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We, we really--we connect in a--in a good way.
Speaker 1: But do you--and that is so--like that didn't, that didn't always happen, you know, that people are in those positions and they're able to consult with each other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and they're in the same networks.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it was, it was certainly very special in a positive way for, for me and I think for Vern, too, and we talk about it from time to time. And we recognize our differences, too, which is also important.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we--yeah, well, I was referring to you as two sides of a coin--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --so different, you know, in your manifestations of yourself.
Story_ID: 640784
Speaker 1: Who else besides him, do you think, would you give credit to?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's different in a--but I've spent quality time with Dick Parsons [HistoryMaker Richard Parsons], too.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: He's, he's smart--he's a very good strategic thinker, and, and a good person. That's a--who else fits in that category? It's hard because, you know, the more you get involved in a kind of atypical activity, it starts to separate you from--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --what otherwise might be a very natural ongoing flow. I think spending that ten years in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York] before I actually end up going to Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York], and that was a real learning experience, and I combine that with going into the [U.S.] Air Force when I graduate from college [Columbia University, New York, New York], and going into the Strategic Air Command and becoming a navigator and dealing with flying all over the world with--Curtis LeMay was the general during that period, and we and the Russians were always at each other one way or another and, you know, I've lived in Thule, Greenland [Thule Air Base, Greenland] for three months at a time, and flying out of there going north. And you, you get--I think that's a, that's an experience that is very impactful on your, on your own life and your own belief, and yet I knew I wanted to go to law school but I had to fulfill this [U.S.] military obligation. And I only learned in the last few years that Vern's mother [Mary Griggs Jordan] had insisted that he join the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] when he went to college, right? Well, I was in the ROTC (laughter), you know? And he didn't stay with it--I did. I stayed and then went and served my time in the Air Force and, and spent a lot of time dealing with the kind of problems of first impression, like dealing with the Russians and their behavior, and working for Curtis LeMay who was this legendary general in the Air Force, and then being, you know--attempted to be persuading me to stay in the Air Force after I'd filled out my service years, and I said I wanted to go to law school, and they said, "Oh, you know, you're gonna spend all the money you've saved and, you know, it's gonna be--." "If you're successful, you're not gonna earn as much as you can earn here," and on and on and on, and I told you the story. And then that one officer who took me aside and just said, "Everything we've said to you about your potential future in the Air Force is true, but it's also true if you want the fruits of life; you've gotta go out on a limb because that's where all the fruit is."
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And I've never forgotten that. It was so simple a statement and so clear a message to deliver, and, and I don't regret any of the time I served in the Air Force, and I now finish my nine or ten years--whatever it is--I had to fulfill, and, and it's all been positive. But the thought of being the only one in an airplane who knows where the airplane is at that point in time, because you can read he stars and follow the direction and the speed of the place and, you know, the Russians and we are playing war like games with each other and--but, you know, you're young; you're young and you're self-confident, and you do it, and (laughter) I wouldn't wanna try and do it now, I'll tell ya.
Speaker 1: So you're saying those experiences prepared you--
Speaker 2: For everything (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) for, for, for the Ford, you know, for everything in the Ford Foundation.
Speaker 2: Everything--included.
Story_ID: 640785
Speaker 1: Did the two of you ever think about, (unclear), your mother [Viola Atherly Thomas]? Do you talk about your mothers? Because you both had very strong, strong mothers (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, absolutely. Now I met his mother [Mary Griggs Jordan]; he didn't meet mine, but I met his mother and recognized her right away.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah. And what I didn't know about Vern [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] was that his mother had insisted that he join the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] when he went to college and--I think I have the story right--when he wondered, "Oh," you know, "why? Why? Why?" And she said, basically, "Because all the white people I know whose children did, that's what they're doing so it must be the right thing to do." (Laughter) Oh, god, it's, it's amazing. So I said, "Well, I, I joined too, but I stayed with it." And, and it's been great, you know. I have--
Speaker 1: But these are the aspirational things that that general--you know, that--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --that generation was really about.
Story_ID: 640786
Speaker 1: --Me ask about the truth and recon- I'm--not truth and reconciliation--I'm sorry, 'Time is Running Out' [sic.]. Can you talk about some of the findings, and even that provocative title that it has?
Speaker 2: Well, 'Time Running Out' is the title of the--
Speaker 1: Study that was done (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Study group report that we--
Speaker 1: --of--came out of the Rockefeller.
Speaker 2: Right. That's right. That was the byproduct of the Rockefeller Foundation's request of me that I mentioned earlier to take a look at South Africa in its current-then situation, et cetera, et cetera. And I, I did that, and Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York] had a related interest in South Africa and what was happening there, and the Rockefeller initiative allowed us to assemble a group of about--I forget the exact number; maybe it was ten people who would--who brought differing experiences to the table--to take a look at the issue of South Africa and where it stood, and in effect what U.S. policy might appropriately pursue. And the members of--there's a list of all the participants, and the result of that study, which took about a year and a half I'd say, to two years, including time in South Africa, time at the Rockefeller facility in--I forgot what part of--where it is exactly, but it's, it's--they have a facility in--
Speaker 1: Is it Durban [South Africa]? No?
Speaker 2: No. I'll think of where it is exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, in any event, it was a chance to meet and reflect on what we felt we'd learned. We had advice from people who were experts, or at least experienced and capable in the South Africa context. And we--
Speaker 1: You're talking about the Rockefeller Center here [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Funded. No, the--it's--the Rockefeller Foundation funded the work of the South Africa study group, and after visiting South Africa at some length by the group, the group came back to Italy where Rockefeller has a facility [Bellagio Center, Bellagio, Italy], and held a series of meetings at that facility in which we talked about what we thought we'd learned; we got advice and guidance from people with more knowledge and experience than we, and began the outlines of what a report by the commission might look like, and that continued for about two years, I guess we pursued that issue, and stayed in touch with contacts we had made in South Africa so that if things were changing or evolving in some particular way while we were writing the report, we would be knowledgeable of that and thus able to reflect it in the material we produced.
Story_ID: 640787
Speaker 1: So we ended up producing something called, 'Time Running Out,' which has been reasonably widely disseminated. Just one example of that dissemination was that a--in South Africa, a--one of the white supremacist groups wrote a short report on the fact that the--this document had been produced, and said in effect that anyone interested in the future of South Africa should read this report. So that was an Afrikaner group that had done a--they didn't admit that they agreed with everything in it, but they felt it was something that ought to be read. And that was a big step in, I think, the direction of an opening of possibilities in South Africa, 'cause during that time, Mandela [Nelson Mandela] is still imprisoned; he's not been released from prison as yet and--I think that's right. Did I have that date right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: I think that's, that's right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So anyway, that requires that the group, the study group, disseminate this document, particularly in the United States, but also in the U.K. [United Kingdom] and in other places where we had gone to have meetings to get input from people who knew more about South Africa than we did. And I thought the fact that the Afrikaner media had labeled it as something that ought to be read; they didn't agree with it but it ought to be read by people, so that was the product of the Rockefeller [Rockefeller Foundation] initiative, and we then went on to a number of schools that we would report on the report itself, including some time at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], as I remember. And, you know, most students were--there're always some students interested enough in a--what I would call a balanced assessment of the facts of South Africa, and I'm sure there were others who felt there was nothing about South Africa as it then existed, that ought to be respected.
Story_ID: 640788
Speaker 1: Mandela [Nelson Mandela] gets released from prison and we meet and strike up a relationship pretty quickly. He comes to the states, we host him at the foundation, and we continue to, to stay in touch during the ensuing period as he runs for office and is elected, and we're there for the election.
Speaker 2: So, I wanna ask--so do you meet Mandela before he comes stateside, or do you meet him when he comes stateside?
Speaker 1: I think the meeting--initial meeting is when he's released from prison, and I think that takes place in South Africa--that initial meeting. He then comes to the states; he comes to the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], in fact, and we spend some time with him there, and he goes to a series of locations in the United States on that first trip of his, and has some interesting experiences, I mean--I think generally widely acknowledged and received, but also some people who wanted more of his time than he was able to provide and who he would later say to me, "There was no way to satisfy them," you know; they, they wanted so much more than he could provide. But he then went back and he was still in the negotiation stage, at that point, with both the white ruling group and in somewhat of a fight with Buthelezi [Mangosuthu Buthelezi] in connection with another geographic part of South Africa that was not under the control of the ANC [African National Congress].
Speaker 2: I see, I see.
Speaker 1: So--and I had spent some time with Buthelezi trying to better understand things, and had traveled there with colleagues and had a--I'd say a fair relationship with him, and, and that continued (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can, can you describe him?
Speaker 1: Buthe- he's, he's still alive and functioning there. He was--you know, he'd--they'd been at, at war themselves in, in South Africa, you know--tribal and other. He was someone who had--I would say he--I won't say he enjoyed anything, but he had received some support from the Afrikaner community while Mandela was still in jail. They had gone to Buthelezi in an effort to get him to agree to some terms and conditions about governance in the geography where he was a, a principal player, and he, to his credit, declined those offers and in effect said, "Until you release Mandela and the ANC has its opportunity--," he wasn't going to attempt to displace that by making his deal with the Afrikaner leadership. So all of that happens--Mandela's released, and then the question is getting ready for an actual election that will take place. I may have told you the story of, of this.
Speaker 2: We have--we haven't discussed this at all (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We haven't--okay.
Story_ID: 640789
Speaker 1: So TransAfrica [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica] plays a major role in the Free South Africa Movement--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but there are also companies, you know, willingly starting to divest, and there's a huge movement for that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: What is the Ford Foundation's [New York, New York]--because remember you said you brought--you know, Ford said, "You can bring your study in here," so I'm trying to understand Ford's role, and then I had heard that you had some meetings--conversations with de Klerk, so I--
Speaker 2: Oh, aft- with de Klerk.
Speaker 1: Yes, and, and we can't just skip over all that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I met with all of them, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, No, no--I (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laugher) Okay. In fact, I heard that--well, I, I mean you--if I--what I heard you can't just skip over that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, no; it's a--I go back and forth to South Africa once we've done our study--the, the 'Time Running Out' study. And, and just a little mini-digression, I'm actually in the office of one of the high officials, white South Africans, at the time that some of the banks in the United States decide they're no longer going to recognize the, the currency, and that becomes a huge blowup, and I along with--I don't know who else was with me, but there're a couple--always a couple of other people--are there when that message comes through and the official who's in charge of that function in the South African government is apoplectic because, you know, that really hits home when your currency is no longer being acknowledged and recognized by the, the wider community. So that's a big deal when that happens, and that's F.W. de Klerk, who is then the prime minister [sic.] in South Africa. So all of this is happening. I'm working with a group in Pennsylvania that decides, at some point, that it wants to invite--Mandela's [Nelson Mandela] now been released from prison. They want to invite Mandela and de Klerk to come to the United States for a celebration that takes place annually in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and so I'm asked by this group to see if de Klerk and Mandela will agree to come to the U.S. for this occasion. It turns out that Mandela says he thinks it would be a good idea if they would come to the U.S., but they can't come until they have first resolved several issues that were at issue between the ANC [African National Congress] and the Afrikaner group in South Africa. So I go back and forth between the two of them about this--
Speaker 1: Between the--
Speaker 2: Mandela and de Klerk. I go and visit each of them to deliver this message from the group in Philadelphia. Mandela, right off the block, says, "I'll--I think that's a real opportunity, Frank [HistoryMaker Franklin A. Thomas]. I'm gonna talk to de Klerk and you're gonna talk to de Klerk, and he's going to want to meet with the president of the United States if and when he comes to the U.S. because anything less than that would be a knock on him."
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And--in effect--he doesn't say it like I'm now saying it to you, but--and he's saying, "If, if he and I can reach agreement on these three things," which he names, "that I will march with him," as there's a parade in Philadelphia that they're being invited to, "and I will march with him," he said, "and I will not object to him meeting with the president of the United States, but he and I have to first agree on these stumbling blocks that exist." So I go a little back and forth (laughter), and they end up agreeing that they're gonna come to the states and we--
Speaker 1: Together?
Speaker 2: Together, yeah--well, at the same time, you know. I don't know if they flew together--I'm not sure about that, but we're--there's a big parade in Philadelphia on this--I've forgotten whether--what the nature of the parade was, but they're both gonna march in this parade.
Story_ID: 640790
Speaker 1: And the night before the parade--they both have arrived in the states and are in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and there's a dinner that night for them and the parade is the next day. So I'm in the receiving line along with--Kate's [Thomas' second wife, Kate Roosevelt Whitney] with me and others from the--our group are there, and Mandela [Nelson Mandela] comes in with a big smile, shakes hands; he meets Kate for the first time, and ever the, the statesman, he says, "Now I know why Franklin [HistoryMaker Franklin A. Thomas] is so efficient," he says. He gives her a big kiss, and then in comes de Klerk [F.W. de Klerk], and he shakes hands with, with me and says, "You know, Frank, the reason Nelson and I can work these things out is that we're both lawyers," he says. Now this is the literal truth what happens. And anyway, the meeting--the event takes place the next day is the march in Philadelphia, and de Klerk had indicated to Mandela that he, de Klerk, would only come to the states if he could meet with the president of the United States, and then Mandela said, "You come and we resolve these outstanding issues, and I will march with you in the parade, so that if there's going to be booing and heckling, it'll be on both of us." This is Mandela. And it happens. He comes, they march, they reach agreement or whatever the particular--I don't even remember the particular issues, but it was another powerful example of strategic thinking on Mandela's part, and a good read on de Klerk and where his interests were. And that had happened to me once later with de Klerk where he--this is in South Africa--where he gives me a, a mini-tutorial on how he saw things happening in the country and all that. Anyway, that was--they both felt they were victors in that process, and it was a--I'd say a joyous outcome.
Speaker 2: So, who was the Pennsylvania group?
Speaker 1: Oh, I'd have to go dig out the name of it, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: But it wasn't Lloyd Sullivan's [sic. Leon Sullivan] group, was it?
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no--this was different, totally.
Speaker 1: It's is a different group.
Speaker 2: Different group, okay.
Story_ID: 640791
Speaker 1: Now, were you surprised when de Klerk [F.W. de Klerk] made the announcement?
Speaker 2: About?
Speaker 1: Of freeing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The release of Mandela [Nelson Mandela]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm. Or were you not surprised?
Speaker 2: I was, I was grateful and not surprised because--
Speaker 1: So why were you not surprised?
Speaker 2: Because I had previously talked to de Klerk--
Speaker 1: And can you tell me--
Speaker 2: --with Milford Fierce, who was with me, and another colleague who's since passed on, and de Klerk laid out for me--I, I wrote it someplace--I don't know where it is now--his view of the, the next phase in South Africa's march towards decency I would call it. And it involved releasing Mandela from prison, and also--they were then trying to talk to Buthelezi [Mangosuthu Buthelezi] to get him to agree to some cockamamie thing they had put together, but Buthelezi was too smart for that; he, he didn't bite. And--anyway, all this happened.
Speaker 1: So this is why people say that you played an instrumental role in--I mean you were closer to the decision making than a lot of people, other people.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--I'd say that's probably right, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I knew them--I mean and Mandela--you couldn't get to know him until he got out of jail--
Speaker 1: Jail.
Speaker 2: --but it was a kind of love at first sight, you know--one of those, and, and then we went back and forth to see him when he--after he was out.
Speaker 1: So, de Klerk--do you think that--at the time that you were getting to know him--is he a person who has his--a man who has his back up against the wall and there's only one--it's how to figure out how to have a graceful exit?
Speaker 2: I, I would say that's probably right. He's under enormous pressure from some parts of his own wing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Party?
Speaker 2: --and party. And--but he sees the larger picture. And, as I said, when he said to me in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] when he--we were shaking hands as he came in as part of the entourage the night before the parade, he said, "The reason we--Nelson and I can get along is that we're both lawyers." And that's, that's de Klerk talking to me, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what--the mini-lesson that he gave you. You talked about that he gave you a mini-lesson. I don't know if it was on apartheid or the structure of the, the system there. What did--what did he tell you?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't remember the words, but the, the point was that change had to occur in the country, and the question was how to make that happen without having it do a flip flop the way it had happened in many other parts of Africa when you get a, a change that is more humane than what preceded it, and then you get behavior that is less humane by the ruling group. Now--I mean that's an overstatement, but that's, that's kind of the way I interpreted what he was, what he was saying. I don't--he has a book ['The Last Trek: A New Beginning,' F.W. de Klerk]; I don't think any of this is in the book that de Klerk wrote, but--or at least his name is on it. But he was not a difficult person to talk to, and the conversation that I was describing earlier with him takes place, and there are three of us there--the two colleagues who went with me, one of whom is now deceased. But Milford Fierce, who was the research director on the 'Time Running Out' efforts, he's present when I'm having the conversation with de Klerk and de Klerk is announcing, in effect, his intent to release Mandela from prison. So it's a--and it's good. I mean--anyway, that--that's the real McCoy (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so--
Story_ID: 640792
Speaker 1: So, when that happens, that's--what would you liken that to? The release of Mandela [Nelson Mandela], the--I mean the exuberant tour he made, but the--what the aftermath of that--what would you liken that to, to some other part of history?
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's about as important and dramatic an event as almost anything I'm able to conjure up because it was gonna be bloodshed all over the place. Absent that, his release allowed the whole country to--even the most extreme right wing parts of it--to accept the reality that the black South Africans were not exclusively in the rather small geographic areas where they--their particular group may have had a primary presence, but that they were citizens of the whole place, and anything short of that wasn't going to be acceptable to the world community as well as to the broad South African black community. So it was--I guess if you reflect, it's like any group that's been in power for a long period of time and is not ready to abandon its presence in that area, whatever it is, wants to make an accommodation that allows them to hold onto much of what they have accumulated while it simultaneously, at least in theory, opens opportunities for the broader community to have access to things that, up to that point, had been excluded from. So you get--you get that understanding on both sides. The problem--a problem occurs in a--and I guess it's still occurring in South Africa to some extent, and that is that when so called freedom comes to people, even when you have leadership like Mandela's which is an inclusive leadership that's also realistic, you hope that that's the start of something that's going to broaden and grow, and include increasing numbers of people from each of the sectors that's there. And I think Mandela's time in office was well spent by him; I think he did important, positive things. Nothing's a 100 percent perfect, but they allowed a constitutional court to come into being and to have power, and they were relatively open to diverse, religious, and ethnic groups and the like, but he was not a young man when he took over, so--
Speaker 1: He had been in prison for twenty-seven years.
Speaker 2: That's right. And--well, I've been in that prison a few times; it's quite something to think of being locked in there for all that time.
Story_ID: 640793
Speaker 1: You know, you cringe when you--and maybe every nation goes through some changes that are--when they're as fundamental as this change was and is. And then you get some of the internal warfare going on within the--in this case the, the black African part of South Africa. So there's a struggle underway now with, with Jacob Zuma and his role now. I'm--I was a fan of Jacob Zuma largely because Mandela [Nelson Mandela] talked so highly about him, and when Mandela became president, there was still trouble in different parts of South Africa with different tribal groups, and Mandela asked Zuma to take on the role of dealing with that KwaZulu area [KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa] that was--been very difficult for them, and I thought he did a pretty good job there. Cut to the chase--when he then--Mandela's no longer president; he becomes the elected president, and suddenly he's behaving like a--not as one would have hoped. So they're struggling with that now, I think. I don't think he'll be impeached but I, I think he's going to be out of officialdom. But you know he did all the, the things that you read about but you don't quite believe are gonna happen, you know. You build new roads that lead to a place where you are, and then you spend all this public money enhancing your own circumstance. And, in a sense, you kind of--you abandon the very qualities that enhanced you and advanced the values of the majority of the people of your country, and that's hard. I, I got asked to go over there when--the run up to that first election--because Buthelezi [Mangosuthu Buthelezi] was not responding to any U.S. efforts, et cetera, et cetera, and so I was going over to christen the opening of a Ford Foundation [New York, New York] office in Johannesburg [South Africa], and I got a--I don't know how much of this I should tell you--but anyway, I got a letter from the--our president asking me if I would deliver the letter to Mandela and also to--(unclear)--if I would deliver the letter to the U.S. ambassador who would, in turn, turn it over. So I'm going over because Ford is crowning an, an office and opening a new office there, and Buthelezi agrees to meet with me. Nobody had been able to get him, they said, to meet because he was furious with the U.S., and on and on and on. So, I have my colleague, Milford Fierce, who had worked with me--I know all this stuff--go over a week early to make arrangements with--see if Buthelezi would agree for a meeting, and he said, yes, he would. Anyway--so anyway, I go over and go to the U.S. ambassador's office and he tells me that--how things have deteriorated and what the situation is, and he didn't know if Buthelezi was even gonna talk to any Americans. So I say, "Well, I--." But he would make an effort to have a contact for me and I said, "Well, I've already done that" (laughter). So that's, I'm gonna meet with him, whenever it was--the next day, which was the opening of the Ford office in Johannesburg.
Story_ID: 640794
Speaker 1: So we're having this celebration and in comes Buthelezi [Mangosuthu Buthelezi], and so I come down from wherever I'm standing and to greet him and tell him that, you know, "We can go off and have a conversation." And he says, "No, no, Frank [HistoryMaker Franklin A. Thomas], they're, they're here for, for you; this is your," you know, and he says, "I'm not in a rush; we can talk later." So we do. I finish what I have to do and we have a conversation in which he tells me all the terrible things that, in his mind, Mandela [Nelson Mandela] has caused to be done to him, that--and on and on and on and on. And so I say, "Well, I'm gonna see Mandela tomorrow. How much of what you've told me can I share with him?" And he says, "All of it! All of it! All of it!" So--anyway, next day I see Mandela, and we sit and start talking and he tells me how incredibly difficult it's been to try and work with Buthelezi for all these reasons, and how he, Mandela, is trying to stabilize his own troops who are all furious with Buthelezi, and on and on and on, and he said--and so we, we--we're talking and--just the two of us, and Milford's [Milford Fierce] and Mandela's aide are outside the room where we're talking, and so he says--when he finishes and, you know, he says, "Okay, tell me what you think I should do." And so I tell him what I think, which is, "Right now, you have all of the power. You are the person most likely to be elected at the upcoming election, and you enjoy the respect and support of pretty much all people, including South Africans, and certainly Americans, for the way in which you've handled yourself in all this, so I say in a situation like that, my advice would be that you take the first step because it's not a diminution of your power, it's actually an affirmation of it." And--so anyway, we have this very powerful conversation, and he says--finally, he says, "I'll do it," he said, "but you have to know how difficult this is going to be because my people are furious with him--they are done with him." And I said, "I, I don't pretend to know all of that, but what I do know is that if you don't do it, things are gonna be worse." And so--now I'd been asked to take a letter to him from our president, and I told him, "I don't deliver letters, you know. You've got state department [U.S. Department of State] people there and others, and I--if I become a carrier of (unclear), then I lose all the uniqueness that allows people to wanna talk to me, and that's not helpful." So, I think, to the dismay (laughter) of some people in the state department and others, I wouldn't take the letter. And good for me that I didn't because--what does Mandela say to me? "I understand you have a letter for me." And I said, "I don't carry letters."
Speaker 2: (Sneeze) That's--
Speaker 1: And we shake hands.
Speaker 2: That gained his respect.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 640795
Speaker 1: I have a question, and you've--so this is--you know I, I haven't thought of South Africa this way. (Cough) But it's almost in a different time period--the end of American slavery--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but with a charismatic leader who is president, that didn't happen. So all the systems and structures are not in place, and so where are you thinking, and what is your advice? Because everybo- you know, it's one thing--you have this mesmerizing leader who carries--comports himself as a leader--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --but he, as you're pointing out, there're all these other things happening, as would be (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean system structures, financial, legal systems.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what are--you, you work--I--I'm just trying to see what area you focus on. I thought you focused on the legal system.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is that the--with the Truth and Reconciliation [Truth and Reconciliation Commission]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would say all of the above, including the lawyers (cough), the South African lawyers who are advancing the cause of freedom and the like in South Africa in accordance with the law. (Cough) Now who--and we had been sup- we, Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York], had been supporting the Black Lawyers Association in South Africa, and this is before Man- Mandela's [Nelson Mandela] release from prison and all that, so--and I had gone over to meet with them (unclear)--you know, the familiar problem of a organization that isn't super well run and there's a little question about what's happened to some of the money was--you know, all that sort of thing. So I went over and spent time with them and told them what our concerns were, and that they wouldn't leave me any option if they didn't straighten out the bookkeeping and these other things that were there. This is earlier. And--
Speaker 1: This is before his release?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's still in prison at that time, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, this is--okay. So this is in preparation.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. And--so I know that group pretty well, you know. We get the problems sorted and all of that works out, and they're smart and capable, and enormously decent people, and we kind of remain friends even when they--some of them go on the bench in the Constitutional Court [Constitutional Court of South Africa], and I try to stay in touch with them as much as I can. And the clerks who work in the court who are 99 percent blacks and brown South Africans who work for the judges in the court, we have a program there that Ford funded when I was leaving Ford that provides advance education for those clerks who are finishing up their clerkship, and then they can come to any part of the U.S.--any--I think there were three or four law firms, law organizations, that take them in; they can further their education and the like, and that's--
Speaker 1: And train them.
Speaker 2: And train them further than they'd been, and that's something that Ford ended up doing as a kind of farewell gift to me when I left Ford--that it was--so they created this fund, and it's been great. And I have some pictures in the office of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Of the, of the people who've been the fellows, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 640796
Speaker 1: What I'm also wanting you to talk about, though, is the structures that were or were not in place.
Speaker 2: In South Africa?
Speaker 1: In South Africa.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were--they have, they don't want for structures, they have plenty of structures.
Speaker 1: But the knowledge of the structures and the, and the, the racist systemic structures that were in pla- I mean those things are hard to change (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: --overnight. Or even having the skill sets.
Speaker 2: They're still working at, at that--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and, I would say, more progress than is widely--
Speaker 1: Known or talked about (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) known or talked about, but still a ways to go. And then they get hit by a Jacob Zuma who does something stupid with this property that he has, and using government money to do it, and all that stuff, which just elevates the suspicion about the capacity of people to deal with and to be responsible and all the rest of it. And there's a guy who--I mean he's done dope- dopey things before, but he's been a patriot. Why do something stupid like that at this stage in your, your life?
Speaker 1: Power.
Speaker 2: Anyway--but--so when Mandela [Nelson Mandela] was still alive, I would go over and--he likes Kate [Thomas' second wife, Kate Roosevelt Whitney], so we would always have a good time chatting and, and he's the one who made the statement, "Now I know why Franklin [HistoryMaker Franklin A. Thomas] is so efficient," you know, and all that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But, but--so--but what, what were the stages? 'Cause he gets freed in nineteen eighty- [sic. 1990]. It's been about thir- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. We have pictures. We have some pictures of him here when he comes over for the first time.
Speaker 1: But, but what are the, the stages of your involvement once he's freed? That's what I'm saying--it's the--first the Truth and Reconciliation [Truth and Reconciliation Commission]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or--but you say you're advising on other--
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm with him, pretty much, from inception. He--we found it easy to talk to each other, and you'll--we have some photos in the different events where I'm helping him down the stairs and all that. It's a--it was the kind of instant communication that was easy to manage and, and very helpful, and--
Speaker 1: But not many people can say that. So I'm asking you, in, in those interchanges--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --between yourselves, what are you learning? What are you sharing?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean we're, we're, we're talking about life and about the role of government in life; we're talking about issues that are preoccupying him at that point in time, his travels to the U.S., a little bit about what's frustrating him. He asked me to become part of this group--that it's been supportive of his work and his activities in South Africa from inception towards the end. Before his death he said, "I desperately want a children's hospital in South Africa, and will you help see that that happens?" And I said that I would. And so we've raised money, we've done all that, we built the hospital [Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa]. I'm gonna go over in the sometime not too distant future to see it firsthand, and accept an honorary degree from over there from the university [Nelson Mandela University, Port Elizabeth, South Africa], so--
Speaker 1: So the hospital came after the children's fund--the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he had a great interest in children.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah. We have some great photos of him with, with children in his arms, and I'll give you one before we leave.
Story_ID: 640797
Speaker 1: So, anyway it just, it just continues; there are things that--obviously things that still need to be done on behalf of the vision he had for the country, and where it now stands. Their Constitutional Court [Constitutional Court of South Africa] is like the best of our [U.S.] Supreme Court here, and he--I've been close with that group for a long time. I still do some--
Speaker 2: Can you talk about your role with that? Because the Constitution [Constitution of South Africa] had to be changed in some ways, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they--you know, it's--that's the one case where--one of the cases I know of--where you have black and white lawyers working together in furtherance of something that's in the collective public interest, so one of the white lawyers who had been part of the lawyer group that had defended Mandela [Nelson Mandela] when he was first imprisoned, and then kind of stayed in touch in the ensuing years, and one of them became chief judge of the Constitutional Court--an outstanding lawyer who's unfortunately died and--but he and two or three of the other lawyers who are of African--black African descent--have been outstanding jurists. And, you know, it's a fight when you've got a political party in power that is kind of skirting the rules wherever it can, and trying to seed advantages for itself and others who they want to impress. It's hard on everybody, but the court has thus far been, been very strong, and there's a picture of some of the clerks who have clerked in the court. And what Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York] did when I left was to set up a program for those clerks who wanted to come to the states to further their legal education, and so there's been a whole array of them who've done that, and so that continues to be a connection between Ford, the U.S., and South Africa.
Story_ID: 640798
Speaker 1: How about Albie Sachs too, could you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he's, he's--I don't--I haven't seen him recently, but he's a dynamo, you know, and he's actually signed the, the--one of the documents in my office here is Albie. We saw him--I guess it's now two and a half years since I last saw him.
Speaker 1: But talk about his role.
Speaker 2: Well, he's a brilliant lawyer, he's a--has been on public television in South Africa on issues of criminal justice and the like, he's a--he's been here in the city--I haven't seen him in the last year or so, but I assume he still travels quite a bit. Is part of that first team of lawyers who comprised their legal system, and he's--the last time we were there which is now--it's almost two years since I've been, he was in very good form; we saw him, spent some time with him. He's no longer on the court as such [Constitutional Court of South Africa], but I think he's still very active in the legal profession. And Arthur Chaskalson is the other lawyer who was--had been one of Mandela's [Nelson Mandela] lawyers when he was, was in--first imprisoned, but he, too, had died; and I don't know the current group as well as I did that earlier group of lawyers there. But it's nice to see that the pictures of the ex-clerks who are now--
Speaker 1: Judges, right?
Speaker 2: Well, they--you know, they will be, if they're not already, yeah. So--
Speaker 1: Coming along.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, at, at your, at your help and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, with some help from that fund. It really was Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York] that put up the dough, and--
Speaker 1: But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that was nice.
Story_ID: 640799
Speaker 1: Were you involved at all in consultation around--and maybe not--the whole issue with Winnie Mandela and--you know, and his feeling he needed to separate, you know, from her, you know, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From--oh, no--that, I, I never got into.
Speaker 1: You didn't know--no, no involvement there, okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: 'Cause that was the--you know, that was the--but that was all around issues of the ANC [African National Congress], too--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, and direction.
Speaker 2: But, you know, it--it's--at the same time, and at--not to diminish any of that, there's a wonderful photo of--I don't know if we have it, but Kate [Thomas' second wife, Kate Roosevelt Whitney] and I both saw it--of Mandela [Nelson Mandela] sitting in the sofa and Graca [Graca Machel] on one side and (laughter)--
Speaker 1: And Winnie on the other side.
Speaker 2: --and Winnie on the other side--there they are.
Speaker 1: 'Cause she came back, you know, to help take care of him--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and so they had this whole--
Speaker 2: It, it, it's, it's a joy to see it, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But, you know, it's that--
Speaker 1: Well, the love there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah--really.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm, and both knowing--and she, she--Graca is--it's interesting because she married two presidents of--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --of countries that had a, a huge change, you know--Rhodesia [sic. Mozambique]--
Speaker 2: And she's a--she's a dynamo. She is a dynamo; I, I, I love being around her.
Story_ID: 640800
Speaker 1: So you were--I mean first of all, you were in a position as a black American--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to play a role--I mean really in many ways, as--you know, very much you were behind the scenes in a lot of respects (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But to play a major role in a, in a--with a foundation who had international reach--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and at the same time--that's why I was asking you when you, when you're talking to him--because there're two--you know, he was thrust into leadership. You know, when I look at the--you know, here he is thrust into leadership on a world stage--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you had been cultivated--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in leadership and had a series of, of leadership roles.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean on the Internet--well, actually because when you became Ford--the head of the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] (unclear), but he's thrust and you graduate. That's what I'm wondering. What was the interchange that happened between the two of you? Because--
Speaker 2: Yeah, very--it's, it's much simpler than it--
Speaker 1: It appears?
Speaker 2: --would appear, yeah. I think it's--it's about trust, and so that it isn't about who has more of something, either knowledge or resources, than anyone else; it's about trust. "Can I say what's on my mind to you with confidence that it will stay with you unless you and I decide differently? And secondly, can I--I've been out of the picture for twenty some odd years. What I know, I know from people having said to me when they visited me in prison," this is Mandela [Nelson Mandela] talking. "In a sense, you've been free for those--all this time. I wanna talk to you about my impressions of things, and I wanna know what your impressions are, if you have some of some, of these issues," and it was always very, very easy. When the--when he was in the--when he, Mandela, was in the big fight with Buthelezi [Mangosuthu Buthelezi] over that first election--that major--first time in South Africa you're gonna have an open election--and we're, we're, we're talking about it and (laughter) I say to him, "You know, one of the reasons you have to reach out to him, though it may fly against your current feelings, is that you have the power; he doesn't the power, and the person who has the power has to take the initiative, that's the only way it works." And he sat there and, as you're sitting there now, looking at me and saying, "I'll do it. I first have to clear it with my people who are so furious with," in this case Buthelezi, that, "but I will do it." Otherwise, that first election couldn't have happened, and--I mean that's a big one. That's a--that's a big event when we're sitting there over a early breakfast and it's that you have the power; that's why you have to do it. That's the only way it's going to work. It's a hard message, but it's true.
Speaker 1: But Buthelezi--after that, how was the--things didn't all get settled down even after that, right? After the election they never (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, there's still--there's still partial warfare ongoing but, you know, it's a lot less severe than it--than it was.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean but the tribal warfare has been going on for a long time, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I mean it's, it's--there's no, no easy road there.
Story_ID: 640801
Speaker 1: So what were the critical other issues that were important besides the Constitution [Constitution of South Africa] and the building of the, the--
Speaker 2: Hospital [Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa] and all that?
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, everything about the governance of a nation. I mean he [Nelson Mandela] had--had to deal with--all of that was (unclear) for him and he, he, he did it well, and his--you know, his health deteriorated--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --as you know, and it's a--but that--that line that he gave to, to Kate [Thomas' second wife, Kate Roosevelt Whitney] is the one that sticks in my head, which is, "Now I know why he's so efficient."
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, you know, [HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter-Gault spoke of this Afrikaner woman that was running, you know, that was his--that he had appointed to--and I guess for access, and she really did not like her.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But, you know, he said, you know, other appoint- other positions and things like that--because that's some--I mean, frankly, he is an older man then, and it's a lot to put together--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --at one, at one place. So he--now, you, you, you called him Mandiba though, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I just called him Madiba.
Speaker 1: Madiba.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Madiba.
Speaker 1: And did he ever tell you much about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Not much. I, I remember only flashes of a, a few photos of him in his early life and--well, he spent so much time in jail, I mean it's amazing. No, I don't, I don't have much on that.
Speaker 1: Any time of--any about his time as a young lawyer? 'Cause he didn't really get a chance (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he, he referred to it, and there's--you know, I have a couple of pictures of him, I think, when he's at that stage in the early phases of his legal life.
Story_ID: 640802
Speaker 1: What about the ANC [African National Congress]? What was your, your--what would you have equated the ANC if you were looking at it in the American context?
Speaker 2: Well, I haven't thought about it in that way. It's like a--it's, it's a mixture of a liberation movement which is--you know, we know a lot about that in this country, you know. We, we've fought that battle many times; we're still fighting it in a different way now, and I kind of look at--I don't have much other thought about it. I, I--and I have a sense that you can read a lot into the way in which women are treated by any organization, you know? It's a--and that seems to have no particular boundaries, quite honestly, and that's a--it's kind of abuse with no consequences, you know, just sad. So, in that sense, you know, some of the black South African women--and I assume some of the white South African women, though I don't know as many of them as you would need to in order to form an opinion, but the black South African women are, for the most part, deeply knowledgeable and active, and that covers a pretty wide spread, even though it's still predominantly male-centric in the way they, they operate.
Speaker 1: And, you know, a lot of Americans had idealistically or, you know, moved there--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --located there looking at this new land of opportunity--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and some--you know, some of that has dissipated. Where do--where do you really see South Africa? I mean I know you've already spoken about the leadership there, but what--where do you see its future and its possibility? And do you see it like--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a--I think it's a challenge. I don't know the younger--
Speaker 1: Leadership.
Speaker 2: --group that's come along, and I think you almost have to know something more than I know about that group in order to have a basis for kind of forecasting in this, this sense. Some of them are--I mean not surprisingly--are smart as a whip and capable in a host of arena, but I think probably not unlike what happens in life every place, when the opportunity comes to advance yourself financially or otherwise, if you've been suppressed from that up to that point in time, when the door opens, the instinct to take advantage of that in the most positive way is almost irresistible, and you hope that it can be done--if it is being done--in a way that is empathetic to the less fortunate people in the system. But it's tricky, it's tricky. You, you can find--and this is--I think this is true across the world; you can find abusive behavior, hierarchy in--relative indifference to the well being of people beneath you or of a different cult, or group, or belief system, what have you. I don't know--I don't know of any place that's free of that, and I hope there are some places free of it, but I don't know of them, and--so you try and get the leadership to want recognition, both within their country, and ideally outside their country.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see; I see.
Speaker 2: 'Cause that at least has the potential of introducing and sustaining standards that might otherwise slip away.
Speaker 1: There's a balance there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 640803
Speaker 1: So you--because you have seen, through your work with Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York] and other work--your own interests--a lot of the world.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And places that had incredible wealth and others places that have a lot of poverty.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, where do you see the United States in that realm right now? And, and, and maybe this is--I don't know if it's the best time to ask, but, but I'm just sort of--what did you learn in that process? And where do you see the United States in the world order with that?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, I think we--I mean going backwards, I'd say the U.S. enjoys a stature in the world that is probably greater then we've earned recently, you know. I think we, we were a source of salvation and assistance to people in need in different parts of the world for a long time, and we've had our own internal struggles in that regard as in-migration has increased in say the southern part of the, the states and, and elsewhere where people have been fleeing oppression. I think--you can almost read it as though you make an assessment of the state of struggle going on in different parts of the world where people of, of means are controlling everything, and others are essentially picking up the scraps of what's left, and that impulse to, to want more for yourself at any expense is a hard impulse to get away from for many people. It's, it's--and it's not a surprise, but it is a, it's a fact, you know? I mean I--this is a silly point, but if you take the lottery winners and think about the number of lot- winners of lotteries where we're talking hundreds, millions of dollars? And if you go and do a survey seven to ten months after that event, almost 50 percent of them are without means. And you say, "How's that possible?" And then you watch people who earn relatively modest amounts of income from whatever their regular work is, and the number of people who play the lottery is fifty times greater than the number of people who ever earn anything in the lottery, but there's something about it. And it, and it--you don't have to be a poor person to be in this position; it can be anybody. When you start thinking that there is a route to, to glory--, "If I can just, you know, play the right numbers I can, I can enjoy that." And I see it with young people, too. I mean I see it with some of our own children, grandchildren--what have you. You hear it--because you don't see it but you hear about it (laughter). There's that almost irresistible impulse to want to hit the jackpot for something and, and that can only--you can only help somebody address that if you talk to them candidly about, "What are your asp- what's, what are your aspirations? Tell me what it is you're seeking, and let's talk about that." "And do you know what the experience is of people who played the lottery and actually win something?" Okay, once you have that in your hat, then you say, "And among those who win something, where are they in five years?" And that at least helps you calibrate what the probabilities are of what you're doing. Now, you may still decide that there's just something in you that says, "I wanna put ten bucks [dollars] on this thing." Fine, you--that's what you wanna do--but when you start doing 10 percent of your income invested in that way, and you still have to pay taxes on the total amount of your income, and you, you look at all this and you say, "I'm just digging a hole; I'm not lifting myself up." And you see it downstairs in this building when you're going out.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Gamblers say the--you know really, if you ask them it's the same thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, so it's a--but part of what freedom involves is the freedom to do those kinds of things.
Story_ID: 640804
Speaker 1: So, I wanna ask about you chairing the September 11th Fund--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and, and who chose--who appointed you to do that?
Speaker 2: I don't know who asked me to do it--somebody did.
Speaker 1: Or who asked you to do it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But that was a--
Speaker 2: I think it was the two organizations that established the fund, that is the New York Community Trust [New York, New York] and--
Speaker 1: United Way of New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: United Way of--yeah.
Speaker 1: New York City.
Speaker 2: Yeah, those were the two, and I agreed to do it. I thought it was gonna be a--one of those one year assignments that turned out to be six years, but we got it done and, and that worked well.
Speaker 1: You know that was a--that was a time--you talk about a--you know the opposite of, I would say, South Africa--a time of tremendous fear on the part of the United States--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and others. And I--but money came into that fund like there was nobody's business.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did a good job--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --they really did. And I think we have their--one of their booklets; it's up there, I think, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so, so what were the tasks ahead of you--
Speaker 2: Now?
Speaker 1: --with--no, with the fund. Well, just with the fund, and then I'll say now, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, the--with the fund it was--first and foremost, it helped address the needs of the people who were the victims--the direct physical and emotional and psychological victims of the catastrophe [September 11, 2001]. And that was--I mean--I think I was on every TV show there was and, and, you know, not always in a healthy way because people were disgruntled about, you know, the process and the delay, and all that stuff, and I went--I remember (laughter) one of the shows I went on, the morning show, and they had set it up so that there was a widow who--after they had me mic'd up they said, "Oh, there's a widow who's, who's called--," you know, one of those. And so I listened to her complaint, and she tells the story of how, when she went for financial help and assistance, that--here's what happened to her and this and that, and--anyway, she didn't get all that she hoped for and needed, et cetera, et cetera and, and kind of--you know, how do you defend that? That's the question that was put to me, and so, fortunately, I said, "I don't defend it, that's why that policy has ended; you no longer have to do that." And (laughter), but it just--I was so furious with the person who was running the show because she knew what the deal was, and--but fortunately, I had an answer, which was an accurate answer. And I'd been on three shows that morning and it happened at the last of the three, and--
Speaker 1: That was great.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's like The New York Times.
Speaker 2: You know?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I don't know it--you, you had the right, the right answer (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know? I'll tell you, they just--they just set you up, you know, in that way.
Story_ID: 640805
Speaker 1: I have three questions--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, just three questions. I, I have to ask about Kate [Thomas' second wife, Kate Roosevelt Whitney], though; she has come up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I have to ask about her because she has really--I mean it's--though you never answered when you got married.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: You're not going to do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: See? I should get the point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay (laughter), duh, okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, obviously we are married (laughter).
Speaker 1: I know you're married--okay (laughter). But, but what--I mean sh- it's almost like she was intend- your intended life partner, and I go back to that she attended the meeting that you were part of when you were at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: Intersectionality of all of that. And I just--I think it would be unfair to, to not have you talk about that.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, she's a great human being; I mean--we laugh about that meeting. And it was a time at Columbia when there was a kind of racial segregation, and it's in the housing and the surrounding area to the college, and the students had organized so that a duo of Caucasian students would go in response to a, an ad, or a duo of African American students would go--same ad--and--to see what, if any, differences occurred and, of course, there're enormous differences. When the black students went, "Oh, that's--we don't--no longer have that apartment; it's, it's gone." And the white student go same day, the apartment's available. So--and then we would write 'em up and give them to the university to, "Either they change their practice or you shouldn't have them posted on the university property," that was our, our pursuit. And she happened to be at the same meeting I was at and, you know, we only talked about it many years later, but--and then we get together largely through her parents [Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney and John Hay Whitney]; I mean they're the ones who put us together. And here we are.
Speaker 1: They put you together.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they really did. They, they invited Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] and me to go on their--his board [John Hay Whitney Foundation, New York, New York], which we did, then they invited Kate and her sister [Sara Wilford] to come on the board. And Kate was divorced, I was divorced, and--
Speaker 1: And a, a family of three and four became a family of seven.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Did it take much to merge those together?
Speaker 2: Not really. It was a--no, I don't--I don't think so; they, they all get on incredibly well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, that speaks about--you know, I would say that both of you really--yeah, you've got understated personalities; that's all I wanna say but--I mean like you were born to be together (laughter) in many ways. And so I wanted to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Well, that's true.
Story_ID: 640806
Speaker 1: But what is your favorite thing about her?
Speaker 2: Oh, she's a--first of all, she's smart as a whip and, and I, I love that anyway, just as a personal matter. And she is a--empathetic towards other people and she really is, you know; you can see it just--any dealings you have with her, and it's a (laughter)--it's, it's funny. As we were at--we were rehashing some of that early life and we were leaving a meeting of this organization that her father [adoptive father, John Hay Whitney] had put together, and she and her sister [Sara Wilford], and a number of other people are on the board [John Hay Whitney Foundation, New York, New York]. And at the end of the meeting, the routine was you kind of go off and have a coffee or something afterwards, and (laughter) it just happened we went into the restaurant on a revolving door, and we didn't get out when it was on the inside and we just stayed on and went back outside and we said--we just started walking away together, and that was--that was how it happened (laughter). And, and her, her parents were great, too. I mean they were--they were super and very attentive, and her--her mother, towards the end when she was less agile--she was in her eighties at the time and--but she loved to dance, and I remember I said to her, "Okay, let's, let's dance." So she took off her shoes and put her feet on mine, and that's how we, we danced. That was a--and so it was a--her father saying to me before his--he's in the hospital near death, you know. "You, you have to take care of Kate [Thomas' second wife, Kate Roosevelt Whitney] and Betsey [Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney]," and I said, "I will."
Speaker 1: Oh, my god.
Speaker 2: And--seemed very natural, you know? It's a--I know it's not natural in that sense but--
Speaker 1: It's not natural in the--even the world we live in sense.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But it's a--
Speaker 1: But it's natural in human sense (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We've been good. Oh, yeah, yeah, it's a--I think we both feel lucky.
Story_ID: 640807
Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't think of it, honestly? I think--we try to spend time with these children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren. Twice a year we get everybody together, and we try and be available to them in whatever ways they feel they need help, and so far, so good, you know; they're, they're doing all right. And, you know, give them some responsibility early on, give them support, and hope for the best, you know? They--they're a good group, they--and the interplay is so natural, it's amazing, you know, that--it's, it's not--I don't know any other combination that quite works the way this one does, so we feel lucky (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, it's just--it's--you're lucky.
Story_ID: 640808
Speaker 1: Because so much of your life is the epitome of the American dream--
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, what the country is supposed to be.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and your life speaks to civility, what it means to have a civil society.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But I--I'm wondering when you look--I wanna ask two questions. When you look at the black community, what are your hopes and concerns?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then when you look at the world community, what are your hopes and concerns?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I think the--when I look at the U.S. black community or the global black community--I mean I only know the U.S.--
Speaker 1: Let's--we'll talk about the U.S.
Speaker 2: So it's a--it's really that--what I pay most attention to is the level of advancement that people have in seeing what's possible in life. What's possible? Doesn't mean you have to do it and love it all, but I worry about the, the young ones who have already decided that everything is against them and therefore there's no reason to either work extra hard, or do whatever. And I know I'm a bad example because I've loved work as early as I could do it. I would shine shoes until my mother [Viola Atherly Thomas] caught me and made me stop, but I was only probably six or so years old, but--and, you know, around people like my uncle, who was a carpenter and a jack of all trades, and who played the piano and sang, and was a--and marched in the Brooklyn [New York] marches against racism. And it's very, it's very tricky; that's why I enjoyed working in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York] all those years because, you know, this--Al Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton], if you asked him, would say--he said to me on the street one day--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Yeah. That--he stopped on--we were on the street in Midtown [Midtown Manhattan, New York, New York] and he was getting out of a car--a limousine, or something, and he says to--somebody was stopped--he, he--we sopped to say hello, and he said to somebody, you know, "Don't, don't blame him, blame me, because I met him when he was just twelve or thirteen, so I'm responsible for whatever he's, he's now done" (laughter). That's true, he was an--an early--
Speaker 1: Rabble rouser.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he was a, a kind of a street minister at age twelve or thirteen, and I spent time with him and, you know, he's now gone through the roof and all of that, but he remembers all of that, which is interesting. So, my rule of thumb is, "Has the time been well spent?" And that's what I ask myself, and the answer to that thus far, so far, is, "Yes, very well spent." And that makes me feel pretty good.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what are your hopes and concerns about the world community?
Speaker 2: Just, you know, there's no one solution; there really is a, a need to have a presumption of decency when you meet people, rather than a presumption of something else that's evil, and there's enough evil out there; it'll manifest itself without any help from any of us. But what's not so self-evident is the, the recognition and appreciation we have when we see people who are respectful of others, who hold the door open for you when you're going through, or who behave as though they recognize you to be a human being and not something to be either feared or withdrawn from, so. Beyond that--
Story_ID: 640809
Speaker 1: One last question.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What do you wanna be remembered--when all is said and done--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what do you wanna say about the man that they would--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I've thought about that occasionally, and you know how I end up feeling? I really don't care. You say whatever you like; by that point, I'll be so far gone it won't matter to me one bit. So I don't think about that.
