Speaker 1: Okay.  And your place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in [Plainfield] New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what part of New Jersey?
Speaker 2: I was born in a small town in New Jersey--
Speaker 1: Maybe the next largest town to that?
Speaker 2: --you know, actually I was born in New Jersey but I left there when I was six months old, and I was raised in Glenside, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know very little about my birthplace.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Maybe we'll come back to that birthplace.  And we know you're growing up within Glenside, Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: Yes. Glenside is a small suburb of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay. Yes.  Good enough.  Now, I'm going to ask you where we are today?  You don't have to give me your address but just tell us where?
Speaker 2: This is my home in Encino, California, where I've lived for the last twenty-five years.
Speaker 1: Very beautiful home--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: --I might add.  And, the hardest question--
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: --what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is Monday, April 16th, 2007.
Speaker 1: All right, exactly.
Story_ID: 100794
Speaker 1: I'm also going to ask you some People magazine-type questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We're told that this relaxes you and it relaxes--
Speaker 2: Oh, but you relax me.
Speaker 1: --the interviewer.  Oh.  Okay.  Thank you.
Speaker 2: [laugher]
Speaker 1: First question I'm going to ask--People magazine question I'm going to ask is, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh.  That's an interesting question because I like food.  People look at me and say, "You're so small, you must not eat."  I eat.  I like all kinds of food.  I particularly like French foods, (unclear).  Of course, I like soul food, and I can cook some good greens, collard greens--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --and all that type of food.  I don't eat--I don't eat meat particularly.  Especially, I don't eat any pork.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I like Chinese food, Japanese--I like--I really like all kinds of food, particularly fish, lots of vegetables and fruit.  I eat very healthy.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.  Sounds like it.
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And I make some of the best red beans and rice (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, my goodness.  The next People magazine question I'm going to ask you, what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: I believe that my favorite color is blue.  Blue is a very healing color and it makes me feel good.  I also like red.  Red is a color of action and movement.  I like the primary colors.  I think the African colors, red, orange, yellow, the bright earth colors; I like them because they make me feel good.  And also, I find that when I wear certain colors, people react a certain way.
Speaker 1: So those are the colors you try to wear?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I-- Whenever I'm--
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: --doing something, wherever I'm going, depending upon the type of meeting, I wear a color that I feel is appropriate.  For instance, if I'm going to a business meeting, I'll usually wear black with accents of red.  In the summertime, occasionally, I'll wear white and light, something light and frilly.  But as you can see, I'm wearing my blue (laughter).
Speaker 1: Therefore, we will accept all of those answers for your favorite color.  What is your favorite time of year, season?
Speaker 2: No doubt about it, I like spring.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I like spring because the Earth is blooming, the birds are singing.  I also like fall because I like the colors--the leaves, and I miss that--I don't have spring here in California.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: On the East Coast, you know, we have the seasons.  Winter was too cold, summer was too humid, but the spring and the fall, just beautiful times of the year.  It's spring, I just fall in love whether it's with the--nature or hopefully, a man, but I haven't found one yet.
Speaker 1: Oh-oh.
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: Well, there's still a lot of time--
Speaker 2: It's April.
Speaker 1: --for you.
Speaker 2: It's April (laugher).
Speaker 1: It's April.  It'll happen.  Now, what about your favorite vacation spot?
Speaker 2: I love Paris [France].  I really--and it's actually not the city of Paris as much as the countryside.  I love Fontainebleau [France], which is a small town.  I like to take a bottle of wine, some cheese and bread, and take the train.  Because I'm a country girl.  I may be in the city a lot but I'm a country girl.  I like the trees and the forests in Fontainebleau, and I like the simple things in life.  I like picnics.  I like Hawaii because of the weather--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and there's just something--romance is in the air in Hawaii, you know, the music.  Of course, music is very important to me no matter where I go.  Even, as you know, before when you came in I was playing the French music.  I like--I like Paris and things French.  I don't know if it's from my background, it's just in my body.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.  Wonderful.  And finally, I'm going to ask you, what is your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I guess my favorite saying is a saying that means the most to me, that's "God is Good," because God's been so good to me, and I don't know where I would be without Him.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I want you to passed your People magazine test with flying colors.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  And you know that's an expression that's used very lightly and by so many people.  But there is some depth to that, and I mean that sincerely from my very heart.  God is good.
Speaker 1: I can tell you mean it, that it is--
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: --all the time.
Speaker 2: Yes, he is.
Story_ID: 100795
Speaker 1: Let me begin now by asking you a little bit about your heritage.  I'm going to be asking you your mother's name and a few things about your mother, and your father's name and the same thing, and just how far back we can trace, what your knowledge is and from what they may have told you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --about your family tree.
Speaker 2: I have to tell you, Paul, that this interview--preparing for this interview really enlightened me and woke me up to the importance of knowing our heritage.  And I realized how little I knew about my heritage.  My sisters and I have been talking some time ago about trying to put together our family tree but it's been difficult because, you know, with my father and things like that.  But I'm--I'm so excited.  I'm so grateful to your society for asking me to do this because I'm going to go further and really find out my beginnings.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.  Wonderful.  We look forward to your work in that area.  Let me begin by asking you your mother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Sara Dell LaRue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sara is, S-A--
Speaker 2: S-A-R-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: D-E-L-L, L-A capital R-U-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Do you know what town it was?
Speaker 2: I believe it's Saluda, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what--
Speaker 2: I'm--I'm sorry.  South Carolina--Saluda, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Saluda?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: S--
Speaker 2: S-A-L-U-D-A, I believe it's spelled.
Speaker 1: --S-A-L-U-D-A?
Speaker 2: I think that's the correct spelling.
Speaker 1: Okay.  South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know her date of birth?
Speaker 2: It was April 28th--her birthday's coming up--April 28th, 1921.  I have to do some adding there.  She'll be 66-I mean 66--86 this year.
Speaker 1: Eighty-six, right.  Right.  Wonderful.  And let me ask you about your father.  His name?
Speaker 2: My father's name is James Harris LaRue, H-A-R-R-I-S, and that's where some of the problem comes in because my father was adopted by--raised by a family by the name of Harris.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's why we've been having a bit of problem in our--trying to discover the heritage.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But we did find out that the LaRue came from the islands.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And a lot of people ask me if I'm from New Orleans [Louisiana] because of the French name.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: They know it's from the islands.
Speaker 1: And we're going to go back on that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I want to get the place of birth where your dad--
Speaker 2: I don't know where my father was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then the date?  Do you have that or do you have an approximate--
Speaker 2: My father's birthday--
Speaker 1: year?
Speaker 2: --is December 25th--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he is, I believe, 88 years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he's old-- about two years older than my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Good enough.  And, we're going to say 1919.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 100796
Speaker 1: All right. Now, let's start going back.  Let--let's start back--going back on your father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Usually, I go back on the mother's side first--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but I want to go back on your father's side first, through them telling you about their parents?  Do you have any information on their heritage?  For instance, your--
Speaker 2: (unclear).
Speaker 1: --father's father or adopted parents?
Speaker 2: Speaking of my father [James Harris LaRue] is very emotional for me because my father and I were very, very close when I was a child, when I was very, very little.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But he was away a lot because he was in the armed forces, and my parents ended up being divorced.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my father and I were very estranged for quite a while.
Speaker 1: [PHONE RINGING]
Speaker 2: Hold it.
Speaker 1: Should I start from the beginning?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, your father James Harris LaRue--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --was in the armed services--
Speaker 1: Yes, he was, and--
Speaker 2: --and you and he were very close?
Speaker 1: Right.  But my parents were divorced, and the interesting thing is, they never told us when they were getting divorced.  My--I wasn't home, and my sister said that he came home one day and my mother [Sara Dell LaRue] told him that they were divorced.  Well, to make a very long story short, my father was stationed in Germany.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he--my mother even tells me the story, she said she believes it is her fault they were divorced because he wanted her to join him, and my mother was very close to her mother, and her mother being back then, "Oh, you can't"--I was a baby--"You can't take your child to that foreign country," and you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so my grandmother convinced my mother not to go.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it was quite a few years, I think it was about two or three years, and my father met someone else and got married.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well, my father and I became very distanced because he didn't support me.  He--
Speaker 2: Let--let's--before we get there--
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --let's go back to your earliest memories of your dad.
Speaker 1: (laughter)
Speaker 2: Because that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that love for him--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --grew out of some place.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry (sniffles).
Speaker 2: No, take your time.
Speaker 1: My earliest memories of my father was when I was about--oh, I guess six or seven years old, and he was in the army.  He would come home every weekend because he was stationed--I think it was New Jersey--and he would come home, and Sunday was my day with my dad.  And I'd get to put on my Sunday clothes and we'd go for a drive.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And he'd take me to see his friends, but that-they were beautiful memories--thank you.  As I said, we were very close.  I was daddy's little girl.  My father, he--he was a prankster.  He would do anything to make me laugh.  He would--there was this street in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] along the river, and we'd be driving and he'd drive back and he just, "If we drive fast enough the car's going to fly."  And I believed my--everything my father told me, boy, he was--that was my dad.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And he would do things like--I got a doll for Christmas, and it was a doll that used to wet her diaper.  So I was playing with the doll and she fell in--in the water, and I squeezed her head and she wet, and my dad laughed so hard he got hysterical.  I remember he was on the floor laughing.  And at dinnertime--my mother raised me very strict.  I mean--I was--I had to curtsey and it was "Mister and Misses."  Well, dinnertime we, of course, we said the grace, that was very formal.  So one day I remember my dad came home and it was time to say the grace.  So we bowed our heads, my dad said, "'Lias! 'Lias!  Bless the Lord!  Don't you see the sun is broad?  Get down here and wash your face." ["'Lias! 'Lias! Bless de Lawd!/ Don' you know de day's erbroad?" From "In the Morning"] If you know, that's from Paul Lawrence Dunbar.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well, he had me--and my mother just sat there looking at him, "Now, you know better than that.  I'm trying to teach this child some manners."  But he'd always would try to break that stiffness that my mother was trying--the formalness that my mother--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --had with a joke, although he was very--he was strict.  But he also had a--that sense of humor and wanted to make me laugh and have fun.
Speaker 2: He sounds like he was very special.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: At that time, your dad was stationed there in New Jersey--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and--
Speaker 1: Fort Dix, I believe it was.
Speaker 2: Fort Dix--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --in New Jersey.
Story_ID: 100797
Speaker 1: Did you know about any siblings that your dad [James Harris LaRue] may have had?  I know that he was adopted.  Did he talk about that period?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I had a Harry LaRue and Roman LaRue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They were your uncles?
Speaker 2: They were my uncles, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did your dad ever talk about how he happened to be adopted--
Speaker 2: My father--
Speaker 1: --by the Harris'?
Speaker 2: --never talked about his childhood or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't until recently that my father mentioned his father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I was talking to him, and I was--I said to him--because as we became estranged, and finally, awhile I began--really didn't like him because he never supported me either, financially he didn't support the family the way I felt he should have, and he didn't--but when I became a member of The Fifth Dimension, he would invite his friends over, "This is my daughter," and I would--I'd get angry about that.  So finally one day I went to him and said I wanted to talk to him.  And I want to talk him alone.  And he said, "Well, no, she's my wife, she can be here," and I thought--I said, "You know if I could change my name, I would."  And you know, God spoke to my heart, and you know, the Bible says respect your parents.  And I--I said these things, but I love my dad.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: All my life I was looking for my daddy, dating older men, searching for my father, wanting to get close to my father.  As a lot of girls do.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, finally, he came--and I talked to him and I said, "You know, I just want to hear you say 'I love you,'" because I never remembered him--even though he would do things and show his love, I never remembered my father saying, "I love you."
Speaker 1: Verbalizing it.
Speaker 2: Just, "Well, of course I love you.  I love all of my girls."  You know, he was very--the Army--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --the Sergeant, Master Sergeant.  Well, we finally had a chance to talk, and thank God, the Lord brought us together, broke that barrier; and we were able to--I was able to tell him how I felt, how I had missed him, how I needed him.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was only about two years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I was in my sixties when that happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But thank God that we came full circle.  And he told me, he--and I began to understand my father.  I began to understand that he loved me and showed love the only way he knew how, and it was then that he told me that--that he and his brother were afraid of his father because his father was very firm, and when they saw his father coming through the window, they'd go and sit in the chair and be still.  Yes, I guess that's--maybe that's why he always wanted to have some laughter in my life when I was a child.  But he was always very strict.  Even in his marriage, I noticed, with his wife, very strict.  He was the boss, and this was the way it was going to be and there was no questioning.  Now, not with my mother [Sara Dell LaRue] because, you know, my mother was--he and my mother--and I know to this day, I know that they love each other.  Even when he comes to see us, the way he talks about her and the way she talks about him.  He says, "Your mother's a good woman."  You know, and I know that they still love each other.  I believe it was only that separation that really caused the divorce.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 100798
Speaker 1: Let's--let's go back and visit--to your mother [Sara Dell LaRue].  What are your earliest memories about your mother?
Speaker 2: The earliest memories of my mother are always working and not being there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was an only child for ten years.  And my mother gave me things she really couldn't afford; ballet lessons, violin lessons, new clothes, all of the--the best, the finest.  My mother, wor--, was a nurse and sometimes she stayed in.  She's worked for a very wealthy family, the--Pennypackers, who I'm still in touch with her.  They have a florist in Glenside [Pennsylvania]; they have this big beautiful home, and she helped to raise their children.  And my memories of her is really not --just not being there.
Speaker 1: Who took care of you when she wasn't--
Speaker 2: We stayed with my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your grandmother.
Speaker 2: Ah, my grandmother.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her--now that's where I got Elizabeth, but her name was Eliza.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: My grandmother was--she was a big woman.  She was part Indian and she was--I just remember her being a big woman and she had beautiful legs, even at her older age.  And she walked.  She walked--she lived in--we lived in Glenside, but when we moved to California, she used to walk to church.  And I remember--I think one of the fondest memories of my grandmother, I remember my grandmother was in her sixties, and I thought she was so silly because she was going to Bible School.  You know, I was a little kid, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and kids, "What's this adult going to school."  Now, I'm doing the same thing she did though.  But my grandmother, she graduated from Bible School in her sixties, and my grandmother was a very giving person, very generous.  And--now I know why my mother and I both like to entertain, even to this day.  My grandmother would feed you.  I don't care if we had one chicken, she'd make it last.  There was this--as a matter of fact, there was this couple, he was a minister, and they would come by our house every Sunday just around dinnertime, and they had six children, and my grandmother always fed them.
Speaker 1: Ah.
Speaker 2: I don't care when you come to our house, we may not have had a lot of money--as a matter of fact, there was a dish that I thought was special called goulash.  What I didn't know, it was just a mixture of whatever was left--it was leftovers.  But I never knew--I never felt I was poor.  I didn't know we didn't have money.  I always had new clothes, I always had food, I always had everything that I needed.  And my grandmother was just a--loved the Lord--just a wonderful woman.  As a matter of fact, my grandmother died on my mother's birthday in my arms, yes, of cancer.
Story_ID: 100799
Speaker 1: Any memories of your grandfather on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: I have very few memories of my grandfather because my grandparents were also divorced.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At one time, my mother [Sara Dell LaRue] and I stayed with the Andersons.  This was an older couple.  When we moved--when my grandmother passed, we stayed with the Andersons.  And I called her Ma'Dear.  This was in Ambler, Pennsylvania.  Oh, I'm getting off track, I forgot the question.
Speaker 1: That's okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Yes.  What was that question you asked me?
Speaker 1: Oh, I was asking you about any memories of--
Speaker 2: Oh, my grandfather.  My grandfather.
Speaker 1: --your grandfather.
Speaker 2: But I--I didn't see my grandfather too much, but I remember Mr. Anderson was sort of a surrogate grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us who--now, who was Mr. Anderson?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know what they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All I knew was that they lived in Ambler, and they had this house by--there was a bit of a forest around the house and a pond.  We used to go out there and get sassafras roots and make sassafras tea.  But my room was the attic.  I loved it.  I had the whole attic, and I had dollhouses.  We also--as I said, I was an only child for ten years.  I still hadn't had any brothers and sisters yet, and, so dolls are my friends.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I used to have--make tea, and I did needlepoint, and all kinds of things that girls did back then.  My dolls--as I said, my dolls were my family.  And Mr. and Mrs. Anderson were just a wonderful couple.  I called her Ma'Dear.  I'll never forget one day, my first--my first experience with death.  Mrs. Anderson was a big woman and Mr. Anderson was a very small man.  I came home one day--I came from out playing and she was lying in the bed.  He was just falling over her crying and crying and crying.  She had died.  But they were just a wonderful, loving couple.
Speaker 1: Now, the--I know you spoke of living in Glenside [Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and they lived in Ambler.
Speaker 2: Yes.  When--when my--we moved--my mother and I moved there when my grandmother passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So--  Okay.  Your mother, most of your early life, worked for the Pennypackers?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Oh, I--excuse me.  I need--I need to check something because actually, my grandmother had not passed away yet because my sisters were born and we lived with my grandmother in Glenside also, my sisters and two cousins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I'm trying to remember when I went to Ambler to stay with the Andersons.  That may have been before--it had to before my grandmother [Eliza] passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But she may have been sick at that time?
Speaker 2: I--I--I don't know.
Speaker 1: There was a reason for-- I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I don't know what the reason for--
Speaker 1: But you then had siblings?
Speaker 2: When I lived with the Andersons, I didn't have any siblings--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --because--I remember now.  I was in--it was the first time I ever went to a black school.  I think it was about the third grade.  It was just that one year.  So for some reason, I don't know why we moved to Ambler.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then we moved back with my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Sorry.
Speaker 1: That's okay.  That's fine.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is (unclear).
Speaker 2: This is great for me.  I'm loving the memory thing is--I have very good memories of my youth beacuse I was very, very unhappy and very sad.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, so I don't remember--my mind has just erased a lot of it.
Story_ID: 100800
Speaker 1: Well, during that early period, there came a time when your father [James Harris LaRue] was transferred from Fort Dix [New Jersey] to Germany?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you were still young at that age?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I'm sure you missed your father a great deal.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then your mother [Sara Dell LaRue] was working for the Pennypackers?
Speaker 2: Yes, and we lived with my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Right.  And you lived with your grandmother because your mother was living in--
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: (unclear) the work she was doing.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How old were you when your first sibling--
Speaker 2: I was about ten because she's ten years younger, yes.  I was ten.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So my parents weren't divorced yet.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And my father was still in the U.S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was still at Fort Dix, probably?
Speaker 2: Right.  So it was around--around when I was ten that he left.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because when he came back, I had a sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then he went away again, he came back, I had another sister (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's deal with those siblings.  Let's deal with those siblings.  I'm going to ask you the name of each one, and if you can remember the year they were born or the date of their birth, and if you can't, don't worry about it.  Let's deal with the second child, which would be--
Speaker 2: My first sister--my sisters were--were blessed.  They got all the pretty names.  I got named after everybody because I didn't have a choice.   So my first sister was Cynthia Yvonne LaRue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Cynthia Yvonne LaRue--
Speaker 2: C-Y-N-T-H-I-A, Y-V-O-N-N-E.
Speaker 1: Yvonne.  Okay.  And you remember what year she was born?
Speaker 2: She was born when I was about ten.
Speaker 1: Ten?  So maybe '52 [1952]?
Speaker 2: And her birthday is in September.  I forgot the date.  Oh, they're going to get me (laughter).  See, I told you I don't remember dates and numbers.
Speaker 1: Not a problem.
Speaker 2: I write them all down.
Speaker 1: Not a problem.  We'll say September 1952.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then the next one after that?
Speaker 2: Eighteen months later came Bernadette Marie LaRue, B-E-R-N-A-D-E-T-T-E, M-A-R-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Bernadette Marie?
Speaker 2: Right.  Her birthday is January--January 28th, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  January 28th, and what, '54 [195]4 or '53 [1953]?
Speaker 2: It'll have to be '54 [1954], I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And my baby sister is Carlotta Eleanor--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: C-A-R-L-O-T-T-A.
Speaker 1: Eleanor?  Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: She's eighteen months [younger].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her birthday is--I wonder if Lala's birthday is in June, I believe.  See, she's Taurus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's got to be May.
Speaker 1: Okay.  May--
Speaker 2: She's Taurus, so I don't know exactly what date.
Speaker 1: We won't worry about it.
Speaker 2: Oh, May 10th or 11th.
Speaker 1: Okay.  May 10th.
Speaker 2: Around mother's--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I'm going to say 15th--.
Speaker 2: Oh, wait a minute.  Her birthday's around Mother's Day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Did I miss her birthday this year?
Speaker 1: I hope not.
Story_ID: 100876
Speaker 1: And we were going through your sisters, Cynthia Yvonne [LaRue], born in September '52 [1952]; Bernadette Marie [LaRue], born January '54 [1954]; and Carlotta Eleanor [LaRue], and I have May of, what, '55 [1955] or '56 [1956]?  '56 [1956].
Speaker 2: Somewhere around there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yep.  Okay.  That's cool.  All right.  Now you have these siblings, of course, you are growing up.  You are--you're getting to be around fourteen.  Tell us about those memories, maybe in school, what it was like.  I know you spent a lot of time--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --playing with your dolls at home.  But your school.
Speaker 2: My school years were very--were painful, and I was very lonely.  I believe the main reason was I was never accepted by the black or the white race.  I lived on what I called the dividing line.  There was a street--the black people lived in North Hills [Pennsylvania], the white people lived in Glenside [Pennsylvania], and I was right on the line.  So I ended up going to white schools.  The black people didn't like me because they said that our family felt that we were better than they were, because my mother [Sara Dell LaRue] taught--and also because I had long hair and they threatened to cut my hair and to beat me up.  'Cause my mother raised me to believe that if you work hard and you believed in God, you can do anything you want, you can reach any goal you want.  And I actually told them, "I'm going to Hollywood and be a star," "Well, who do you think you are.  You're black.  And you're this and you're that."  And they never really--they never supported me.  And I was--also I wore nice clothes, I guess because I was the only child for ten years.  And even when my sisters came along, I still wore nice clothes.  We were not allowed to use certain words like "ain't."  We were taught to use proper English.  So I didn't have--I didn't even sound black, so to speak.  So naturally, they thought, "Well, we think you're better than we are."
Speaker 1: Since you went to white schools, where would the primary interaction with other blacks come from?  Would that be from church?
Speaker 2: The primary interaction with blacks was church.  I went to Salem Baptist Church [Jenkintown, Pennsylvania], and we took--the bus picked me up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And also my next door neighbor, who is still my friend to this day, Mary Ann Waugh [ph.], who is now Mary Ann Razor.  She was my next door neighbor, she was black and we played together.  But even--even Mary Ann, you know, she was still a little rougher than I was.  But--and when we got older, I wasn't allowed to go to North Hills to those dances and things, so Mary Ann would come to my house and say, "Miss LaRue, can Florence go with me?  My mother said I can go if she can go."  "Well, okay."  Then I go, "Miss Waugh, can Mary Ann go with me?  My mother said I could if she could go?"  And we got to go to certain things, but not a lot (unclear)(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: In North Hills?
Speaker 2: In North Hills.  I remember my mother only spanked once in my life, and I was sixteen years old, because she found out that I went to this dance and didn't tell her, and there was a young black--I say boy--you know, but he was a man.  I was, I guess, about eighteen, so he was--compared to me he was a man.  And he liked me, and--so he would sneak and walk me to the store, walk me different places.  And I remember one time he asked me to go to a dance--somehow, I don't know how I got out of the house to go, and he took--he was older than eighteen because he had an apartment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had to be in his twenties.  And he took me to his apartment.  Now, I didn't know anything about boys or sex, or anything like that, but I knew that there was something that went on, so I wasn't--so I felt like, "Oh, tonight, I'm going to become a woman."  So he sat down and he played music, gave me a soda and sat down next to me.  Then he jumped up, he says, "What am I doing here with you, you're just a kid."  And he took me home.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.
Speaker 2: I was hurt because I thought, "Oh, he doesn't like me; oh, I'm not woman enough."  You know, I'm just a teenager.  Well, do you know I found out, I guess, several months later, maybe even years later, he was the town hood.  And his nickname was "Rat."  But I called him by his name, Carlos.  Well, when I became a member of "The Fifth Dimension," I got this letter from this gentleman who was incarcerated, and it was that gentleman.
Speaker 1: Carlos.
Speaker 2: He said, "Can you please write to me because nobody here believes I know you, and you're the only one who was nice to me."  Well, I was nice to him because I didn't know about his reputation.  You know, I had no idea he had about three illegitimate children, but I treated him nice and he treated me nice.  He was always a gentleman.  And that's why I said the Lord has been watching over me all my life because some of the things I've done and some of the situations I've been in, I should either dead or in jail by innocently not knowing.  Here I was dating the town--not dating, but, you know, associating with the town hood.
Speaker 1: Did you write him back?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So I'm sure he was able to show--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that letter to all of his --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --friends.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 100877
Speaker 1: Now, you went to principally all white schools even though you were living right on the edge--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --between the black and the white community [in Glenside, Pennsylvania].  What was life back--what are your earliest memories of--( simultaneous)
Speaker 2: My earliest members--
Speaker 1: --attending school?
Speaker 2: --memories are of excelling in everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although, I was only about five-two-and-a-half, I played varsity hockey, I played varsity basketball, I ran track, I excelled in sports.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And also, I participated in all of the musical galas.  I sang in the chorus, I played in the orchestra, so I was, I was accepted.  But when I think back now, there were certain things I wasn't invited to.  And I realize now also, it wasn't the students; it was their parents.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I remember there was this white boy, Frankie Sykes [ph.].  Oh, did I like him.  And I think he--(unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Why did--what was his last name?
Speaker 2: I think it's Sykes [ph.].  I don't know how you spell that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think he liked me, too.  But his parents would never have allowed anything like that.  And I remember going back--
Speaker 1: So you never did date?
Speaker 2: Never did date him, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And, as a matter of fact, I never dated a white boy until I was an older, an adult, and dated white men.  As a matter of fact, one of my ex-husbands is white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I remember being on the teams and that was fun.  When I went back to the reunion, there was this old man, and you know if it was my high school, he'd have to be old.  He was the janitor.  He said he remembered me.  He said, "You were always by yourself.  Sometimes you would cry--" he said, "And you were always different.  You wanted to wear your hair different, you wanted to be different."  I didn't remember that, but he remembered that, and he reminded me of--(unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: And he took you all the way back to what, elementary school or--
Speaker 2: This was high school [Abington High School].
Speaker 1: --just high school?
Speaker 2: He was the high school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --janitor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 100878
Speaker 1: Now, the-- are there any special memories from elementary school [North Hills Elementary School] that you--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  All I remember from elementary school is walking to school in the cold.  You know how Bill Cosby says, "My father walked ten miles."  Well, let me tell you, I did walk a mile to school.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I remember one time it was snowing, and girls had to wear leggings, you know, to keep warm.  Well, I wanted to be grown-up, but the big girls didn't wear leggings, so I took my leggings off.  Let me tell you, my mother [Sara Dell LaRue] never had to tell me put leggings on again.
Speaker 1: (laughter)
Speaker 2: I froze, and I never did like playing in snow.  I'd be walking to school and the kids would be playing with snow, throwing the snowballs, "Don't you through any snowballs at me."  I didn't like being cold.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But no incidents because you--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: --were one of the few blacks--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in your elementary school, right?
Speaker 2: I don't remember--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I don't remember anything good or bad.  I don't remember elementary school.
Speaker 1: How about--
Speaker 2: I remember the fifth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember the fifth grade because there was a teacher, Miss Stover [ph.].  She was a very big teacher.  She was white, and for some reason she just loved me.  I did very well academically, so a lot of times she would allow me to do extracurricular things.  It's because of her that I wanted to be a teacher --
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --because she was an old maid teacher, and I loved her, and I said I wanted--(unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: You felt the love she had for you? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes, and I wanted to be a teacher, and I did end up getting my teaching credential, Elementary Education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's because of her.
Story_ID: 100879
Speaker 1: How about some early memories in junior high school [Glenside-Weldon Junior High School]?  What was it like then?
Speaker 2: I don't remember junior high.  All I remember--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --again, is the sports and the singing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was my life.  My mother [Sara Dell LaRue] was very smart, too.  Encouraged me to get involved in sports and in the music because it kept me out of trouble--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and it gave me something to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And she gave you violin lessons?
Speaker 2: Violin lessons, yes.
Speaker 1: So you were--
Speaker 2: I played in the school orchestra--(unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --Orchestra so violin--
Speaker 2: --and I could have been much better if I practiced, but I wanted to play songs, I didn't want to play scales.  Speaking of junior high, my coach came to a Fifth Dimension concert and brought me a picture, which I will show you, of me on the team after all those years.  We were performing in York with the York--I think it was with the York Symphony Orchestra--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and she came to the show and brought me the picture of me on the team.
Speaker 1: Now, this was York, Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where she--where we were performing.  I wasn't living there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But she brought me--she was living in Glenside [Pennsylvania] and was my coach on the hockey and basketball team.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't very hard to remember me, I mean, I was the only black girl there.
Story_ID: 100880
Speaker 1: You said that you did have some memories of whites not inviting you to their--their home in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Vague, vague memories.  There were parties that I was--that I would hear about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But never get invited to?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And when you sort of were around your black friends, who were really over in North Hills [Pennsylvania], what was it like there; you did go to a few dances there--(unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No, I really didn't go--it was really church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it actually--Salem Baptist [Church] was actually in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, but the bus picked me up.  I remember that because I was not allowed to wear makeup, and one day I decided--I decided I wanted to be grown.  I was a teenager, so I left the house, stood on the corner waiting for the Sunday School bus, put my lipstick on.  My mother [Sara Dell LaRue] came out in front of all my friends, "Young lady, you just wipe your lips."  I was so embarrassed.  But I went--I went to Sunday School there and sang in the choir--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: --unfortunately, I didn't develop that great gospel sound.  But I remember--my memories--my memories of Sunday School were memorizing poems, you know, Easter, and Mother's Day, Children's Day, you memorize something, or play the violin.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When--there came a time when some of the kids around you that you were growing up with, did they perform or sing or have ambitions of singing and so forth?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  The only one I remember really involved was Mary Helen Kessler, who was a white piano player.  And she would accompany me sometimes.  She was very nice, we were friendly.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't remember anyone wanting to go to Hollywood [California] or have a career as an actress or performer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then there came a time when you were graduating from high school.  What was the name of the high school by the way?
Speaker 2: I went to Abington High School.  I went to North Hills Elementary [School], Glenside-Weldon Junior High [School], and Abington High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which now is very integrated.  Toward the end of my high school years, there were a few other blacks attending.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And you were a good student at--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Abington High School, and--
Speaker 2: A little lazy.  Unfortunately, things came to me easily, so I didn't work as hard as I should have.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I--I remember one time I was going to get a "D" in Latin and I was afraid to bring it home to my mother, so I changed it, and well, I got my marks up.  My mother expected good grades.
Story_ID: 100881
Speaker 1: All right.  And, your mother [Sara Dell LaRue] expected you to go on to college?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And you did?
Speaker 2: She, I wanted to be a movie star--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and she said, "Okay.  Well just get your teaching credentials then you'll have something to fall back on."  Which to me as an adult--don't get me started about teaching.  Teaching is not something you fall back on.  Teaching is--teachers should paid more than performers and athletics because teachers are molding the minds of the future--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and I truly enjoyed teaching, especially the little ones.  Because they come in there curious, their minds are open, they want to learn.  And I'm a very good teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I make teaching and learning fun.  For instance, when I taught--I did my student teaching at Grant Elementary School in Hollywood (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (unclear) before you go there, let's--let's get you into college.
Speaker 2: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You went away to college?
Speaker 2: Actually, my grandmother [Eliza] and mother moved to California because of the weather, and also, because it was less expensive for me to go to college.  I could go to a junior college.  I think it cost me six dollars plus books at the L.A. City College [Los Angeles City College in Los Angeles, California] at that time.  So I--
Speaker 1: And you graduated--
Speaker 2: --I was graduated, yes, from L.A. City College--
Speaker 1: --with an A.A. degree?
Speaker 2: --with an A.A. degree, yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us what that is.
Speaker 2: Associate's in Arts degree.
Speaker 1: Associate's in Arts--
Speaker 2: Yes.  So I took all of the subjects that you have to take anyway in higher institutions--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, your basics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I went on to California State College in Los Angeles and got my bachelor's in elementary education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those--my college days were interesting because I took fifteen and a half units each semester while working eight hours a day--
Speaker 1: Where were you working?
Speaker 2: --while (unclear)--I worked at Hughes Aircraft [Company] and North American Aircraft [North American Aviation].  What happened, when I was ready to go to college, you know, my mother was raising four girls by herself, and, you know, she didn't really have a lot of money.  So I wanted to get a job to help her.  Well, I had no work experience.  I couldn't type.  All of my subjects were academic.  So I looked in the papers and I saw, "Trainee."  When I saw that word, I went to Hughes Aircraft, you know, and I was trained in soldering, and--oh, first I went to the phone company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I--after they interviewed me, I failed the interview.  Well, I took the test.  I passed the test, of course--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but I failed the interview because they asked me, they said, "What are you doing?"  "Oh, I'm in college."  "What are you studying?"  "Oh, I'm going to be a teacher."  And "blah-blah-blah."  Well, they knew that when school came back, I was going to quit the job and go back to school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I went to the same phone company--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --a different office, took the test, passed it.  When they interviewed me, they said, "What do you do?"  I said, "Well, I'm studying communications, I'm taking Latin, French," all the subjects which I was.  And I said, "And I hope to get married."  So this was great, so they hired me, and I worked as a telephone operator.  I almost got fired because I have a very low voice in the morning, and they thought I was trying to be sexy, but that was my normal speaking voice.  I tell you, it's an interesting thing.  You get asked questions--I had men ask, "Are you blond or brunette?"
Speaker 1: (laughter)
Speaker 2: All kinds of interesting things.  But anyway, so I went back to school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My next job, as I said, I didn't have any experience, so I saw that word "trainee."  I tell people, if you really want to work, you can.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I went and I got a job, but when I was in line I heard them ask the lady in front of me, "Do you have a car?"  She said, "No," and they didn't hire her.  So I got up, they said, "Do you drive?"  I said, "Yeah."  Because I did, I didn't have a car.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I stood on the corner and waited for the bus, and I worked the morning hours, you know, after, you know, after, like, one in the morning--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I went to school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I stood there and I got--I had to get two buses, and I did that until I finally found someone to give me a ride from--from work home.  So I know that if you really want to work, you can.
Speaker 1: Right.  Where were you living then?
Speaker 2: I was living in Englewood, California--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --85th Street--(unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: And we're talking about approximately 1964, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 100882
Speaker 1: And, you were going to school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you successfully got your B.A. [from California State College in Los Angeles].
Speaker 2: How, I don't know, because, like I said, I--I--I never--hardly ever studied, I hardly ever slept.  As a matter of fact, one night I was coming home from bowling, actually early in the morning, and I was driving on the freeway.  I must have been doing at least (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Nobody--now you had purchased a car?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because my mother [Sara Dell LaRue] bought me my first car.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: It was a '42 [1942] Chevy [Chevrolet] something.  I couldn't go up hills, but you know, I knew which way to go so I could get where I was going.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Well, somehow, I came off the freeway and I fell asleep at the wheel.  And, I went through a red light and there was a policeman turning, and I just missed him.  Well, he stopped me, he asked me what I had been doing, he knew I didn't--found that I hadn't been drinking.  He said, "You get in that car and you go home."  Had he not done that, I probably would never drive again because it was a frightening experience.  To this day, if I'm sleepy, I will pull over, go to a hotel, I will not drive when I'm sleepy.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: That was very, very frightening.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: But I went--I would--I did that for four years and got my bachelor's degree in education.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 100883
Speaker 1: And where did you start teaching?
Speaker 2: Actually, I was involved in my student teaching when I was approached to join this singing group called, The Versatiles.  I didn't want to join the group.
Speaker 1: What school were you doing your student teaching?
Speaker 2: At Grant Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Grant Elementary.  Okay.  And now you were approached by someone.  You were singing locally also at your church?
Speaker 2: I did a few little things.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: Nothing substantial.  But, meanwhile, a friend of mine entered me into a beauty contest because, and knowing that I wanted to be in the movies, I thought, "This is great," you know, not because I thought I was beautiful or anything, but I said, maybe there'll be a producer.  Because they explained to me that producers come and people are discovered that way.  I said, "Great, maybe he can see me and give me a part in a movie."  So my friend entered me into the contest.  I won the contest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nothing happened.  As a matter of fact, the next contest I was in, there was a producer there, pretty well-known producer.  And he approached me for a part in a movie.  He says, "But I want-you have  to come over to my apartment and read this--," little me from Glenside [Pennsylvania], I go to--
Speaker 1: You want to give us a name?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's alright.
Speaker 2: I go to the man's apartment in Hollywood [California], and I'm, "Oh."  And this beautiful black girl was reading something.  "Oh, and I hope I get the part, not her." Now, please, who auditions at somebody's apartment?  I didn't know.  So I went.  So he gave me this outfit.  He says, "Let's see what you going to look like."  So I went in the other room and changed and came back.  He's probably watching through the keyhole.  To make a long story short, I ended up running out of the apartment.  And I learned then that you don't audition in the producer's apartment, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: But I did enter--
Speaker 1: You said someone approached you about singing.
Speaker 2: Yes, I entered another contest.  I was in several contests.  My friend entered me into the Miss Val Verde--I didn't even know where Val Verde was--but I entered and I won that one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  These were all beauty contests?
Speaker 2: These--right.  They're all small beauty contests, Miss Coppertone, those type of things.  So one year I entered the Miss Bronze California contest, which now would probably be the "Miss Black America."  You know, we changed from Bronze to whatever.
Speaker 1: Right. Whatever.
Speaker 2: And I sang.  Now, there were girls, Paul, that could sing circles around me, and they put on their gowns and they sang.  Well, I guess there was a singer, his name was Eddie London.  He helped me, and also Be--Ed-Bill [ph.], Eddie Bill --
Speaker 1: Awesome.
Speaker 2: Eddie Bill was an older man, he's a black man, and I--I worked with him.  This man would have me in tears working so hard.  What I did for the contest, I ended up singing "April in Paris" in French--
Speaker 1: Ah.
Speaker 2: --and instead of wearing the gown like the other girls did, I wore a white suit, a hat, carried a hatbox; in other words, I--I had some--
Speaker 1: Props?
Speaker 2: --had props, and I--I didn't just sing, you know.  It was a performance.
Speaker 1: Performance.
Speaker 2: A performance.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I won.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.
Speaker 2: Years later, I was singing with "The Fifth Dimension," and this man came up to me, I don't remember his name but he was one of the judges.  And [HM] Eartha Kitt was one of the judges.  He says, "Oh, yes," he says, "When you came out and opened your mouth, Eartha said, 'There's our winner.'"
Speaker 1: (laugher)
Speaker 2: So I guess, in one way, I owe my career to Eartha Kitt--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because I won.  Well, when I won--
Speaker 1: Now, was that the time you also sang in French?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So that would have impressed Eartha Kitt also--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: She was one of the judges in the Miss Bronze California where I sang--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --with all these other girls.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I won be--and--and I do believe it was my presentation.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Plus the fact that I did something different.
Story_ID: 100884
Speaker 1: Well, after I won the Miss Bronze California contest, this young photographer came up to me and says, "Oh, I have this group and we need one more girl."  I said, "I'm sorry.  I don't want to be in a group.  The only reason--I'm not even a singer.  The only reason I sang was because I wanted to be--you know you have to do something, and I was hoping to be discovered for the movies, I'm also doing my student teaching.  I don't have time."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, that was [HM] Lamonte McLemore.
Speaker 2: Okay. (laughter)
Speaker 1: And he--he persisted, he persisted.
Speaker 2: Now, let's tell people who Lamonte McLemore--(unclear)
Speaker 1: Lamonte McLemore--(unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --because at that time he was working--was he working for Jet at that time?
Speaker 1: Lamonte was working as a photographer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think--I think he did do some things for Jet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I said, "I don't want to be in this group."  Well, Lamonte has a way of talking you into things.  So he talked me into it and I said, "Okay."  We had this manager, Marc Gordon, and I would miss a lot of rehearsals because I was doing my student teaching and doing other--I was very busy.  And he was going to put me out of the group [The Versatiles].  Finally, he didn't put me out though. I ended up marring Marc years later.  He was The Fifth Dimension's first manager.  He is also the brilliant mind behind The Fifth Dimension.  You know, I get very, very upset when I hear Johnny Rivers being given more credit than he is due.  It was Marc Gordon, a black man, who had the idea of putting The Fifth Dimension with [James] Jimmy Webb.  Jimmy Webb was a young, poor, white singer with holes in his shoes, and he was trying to peddle his music and no one understood it.  It--it wasn't R&B, it was Pop.  It was very different from that time.  And Marc said, "Well, I have a group, and I think this group would be good--a good marriage with your music."  And that was Marc Gordon.
Speaker 2: All right.  Now, tell us about your relationship with Marc because you are coming into womanhood, you really are a woman now--
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: --one another.
Speaker 1: (laughter)  Right.
Speaker 2: You are a student teacher.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And you're just beginning--Marc has come to you about singing with this group --
Speaker 1: Lamonte, came to me about singing.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry--right.
Speaker 1: (unclear)(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --and let's--but you--you had an independent relationship--we have two trails to follow.
Speaker 1: (laughter).  Right.
Speaker 2: One as the group The Fifth Dimensions [sic, The Fifth Dimension].  You know, they started to evolve.  Marc is the leading proponent and manager.
Speaker 1: And actually called ourselves The Versatiles at that time.
Speaker 2: The Versatiles, right.
Speaker 1: Originally called ourselves The Versatiles because we had five people with five very different voices, which allowed us to sing all kinds of music.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And you started getting engagements?
Speaker 1: Yes, we did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We sang locally in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 2: You remember who the first--
Speaker 1: I think Maverick's Flat was our first place that we sang.
Speaker 2: Okay.  How about the relationship between you and Marc?  Did that grow at the same time or did that come a little bit later?
Speaker 1: Well, when I met Marc, the relationship kind of grew and he was very--what's the name--"worldly?"  You, know, I was very--I was--I was from Glenside, Pennsylvania, still.  I was very naive.
Speaker 2: A country girl as you called yourself (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: I was a country girl.  I was very naive and Marc was a city man, you know.  And we developed a relationship--I was--"Oh, this city man is interested in me," and--but he was a very nice guy.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was very nice, he was kind.  And we lived together for about a year which I regret because I'm a Christian, and, at that time, I was a Christian then.  I've been a Christian since childhood.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But I wasn't a practicing Christian, evidently, because we lived together for about a year and then we got married.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 100885
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your--Marc [Gordon] has come into the--your relationship but I also want to hear about "The Fifth Dimension," and I should correct myself.  It is not an "s" -- it is "The Fifth Dimension."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: As different parts start to come together--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --tell us about it.
Speaker 2: Well, there was a group called The Versatiles.  I think the stu- The Hi-Fis, I believe, were the first group, and [HM] Marilyn McCoo, [HM] Lamonte McLemore-- I think [HM] Harry [Elston], I don't know who the other guy [Lawrence Summers]-- and they sang; they did some backup with Ray Charles.  Well, something happened and I wasn't there, something happened and the group broke up, and Lamont said, "Oh, I like this singing," even though he wasn't--he's really a photographer.  He will tell you himself he is not a singer.  But he enjoyed the traveling and limelight, so he got Marilyn--and [HM] Billy Davis [Jr.] had come from St. Louis [Missouri] to seek a career in singing, and Ron Townson's also from St. Louis, and they had another girl, oh, I can't remember her name.  Fritz [Fritz Baskett].  But she decided--she had--she didn't want to be bothered with this because I don't think they were really taking care of business.  It was just getting started and they didn't know what to do, and she had got a very good job.  So Lamont was looking for another girl to replace her.  That's when he came to the contest [Miss Bronze California] and asked me to join the group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's interesting because Marilyn had won the talent and the contest the year before I did.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  The same contest, Miss Bronze?
Speaker 2: Same contest the year before.
Speaker 1: Miss Bronze.
Speaker 2: She won the talent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, we got together; we called ourselves The Versatiles because we felt that there were five different type voices, and we could do all different kinds of music.  So that's why we called ourselves The Versatiles.
Speaker 1: Now, The Versatiles were made up of, what, I guess--
Speaker 2: Lamonte McLemore--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Ron Townson--
Speaker 1: Ron.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Billy Davis Jr., Marilyn McCoo--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and myself--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Florence LaRue.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: And we were looking for a conductor, and I don't know how I found--but I found this gentleman, and to us he was old.  Now, we're in our very early twenties--I was very early twenties, and he was in his fifties (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his name was Rene DeKnight, R-E-N-E--
Speaker 1: All right, R-E--Okay.
Speaker 2: --D-E capital K-N-I-G-H-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And DeKnight--Rene was very sophisticated.  He was a jazz musician.  He was one of the original Delta Rhythm Boys.  I don't know if you've ever heard of them.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Yes.
Speaker 2: I had never heard of them at the time.  And Rene always did things that we felt were weird.  He was into health foods and yoga and standing on his head.  But we noticed Rene traveles with us he never got sick.  And, as a matter of fact--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: He could take the pace?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I think that's where I adopted some of my health habits and became very much into health.  Well, Marc Gordon--Lamonte knew Marc from Motown because Marc was a producer at Motown Records.  As a matter of fact, he and Hal Davis co-produced some of the Supremes' recordings.  And there was a young man, young white boy, who was trying to peddle his music.  He had--he was really poor, he was broke, I'm mean holes in his shoes, and nobody could understand his music.  It was some beautiful music, and Marc said, "I've got a group who does beautiful harmony," because Rene--Rene is really responsible for our harmony, I believe, because at that time, Motown was hot.  So we were singing R&B because that's what was popular and that's what we knew.  Then Rene came and refined that.  He didn't take away anything, but he refined it by introducing jazz harmonies.  And Marc said, "I've got a group I'm managing.  I think your music would work very well with them."  So he introduced The Versatiles to [James] Jimmy Webb.  And Jimmy had this song called "Up, Up and Away."  And we liked it.  We sat it on the piano and we recorded--we were going to record it but--and Marc was an A&R [artists and repertoire] producer for Johnny Rivers' record company Soul City.  And they came to us and said, "You know, we like the group, but 'The Versatiles,' you've got to change your name to something more hip."  So we all got to together, we thought of the Marc Five because Marc was our manager and there were five of us.  And I don't remember what --I remember that name but I don't remember what other names.  But Ron Townson thought up "The Fifth Dimension" because there were five of us, and we liked that because there is no fifth dimension.  So the fifth dimension is our dimension of sound.  So we said, "We like The Fifth Dimension, and Marc says, "Well, I'm glad you do because that's the name we chose too."
Speaker 1: (laughter).
Story_ID: 100886
Speaker 1: And Marc [Gordon] and Johnny [Rivers] co-produced the song called "Up, Up and Away."  And that was the beginning of The Fifth Dimension's sound--but, no.  Before that we recorded, let me see, is it "Up, Up and Away" before "Go Where You Want To Go?"  There was a song that The Mamas and [The] Papas recorded called "Go Where You Want To Go."  And they had the same configuration, three gentlemen and two ladies [sic, The Mamas and The Papas had two men and two women], and we recorded that song.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But people thought we were The Mamas and Papas because it was very similar, because their harmonies were similar.  But then when we recorded "Up, Up and Away," that established The Fifth Dimension and having our own sound.  And we got quite a bit of--there was quite a bit of confusion in the music industry because we were a black group, it was the sound that they--people thought "sounded white."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Not realizing that black people sing everything, from opera to hip-hop.  As a matter of fact, I saw The Three Tenors Saturday night.  Fabulous.  But anyway (laughter), so we recorded "Up, Up and Away," and it was getting a lot of--people still don't know we're black because they haven't seen any pictures of us.
Speaker 2: Oh.  Okay.  So even when "Up, Up and Away" was all breaking records across the country--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --people still did not know you were a black group?
Speaker 1: Right, because they heard it on the radio.  Some of them hadn't seen us yet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean we took pictures and sent out pictures, but many people hadn't heard us so they didn't know that we were a black group--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: --with this sound.
Speaker 2: Okay.  When did you start traveling around the country to where people could see you an individual?
Speaker 1: When "Up, Up and Away" was released, the record company came to us and said, "Well, you've got to go on tour."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So we had to make our decision then; that is, quit our day jobs.  I think Ron [Ronald Townson] was working for the post office, I was working at Hughes [Aircraft]--we all had day jobs.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we said, "Okay.  Let's do it."  So we quit our jobs--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --went on the road (laughter).
Speaker 2: You were also still teaching?
Speaker 1: No, I'd finished my student teaching.
Speaker 2: You had finished your student teaching at that time?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And fortunately, Rene DeKnight had put together some songs and harmonies, so we had a show when we went out.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We were able to do a whole show, and Rene conducted for us.
Speaker 2: And how many cities did you cover on that?
Speaker 1: I don't remember, but I know we toured the U.S., we went back East.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is where I need Ron.  Ron Townson had a memory--he could remember what day, what city, who was in the band.  I don't know how he did it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was--he was--he was my sweetheart.  I know you're not supposed to have favorites, but Ron was always my favorite Dimension.
Speaker 2: Well I think that was true for a lot of people.
Story_ID: 100887
Speaker 1: But the--at this time, you and Marc [Gordon] had a relation--personal relationship--
Speaker 2: We were married.
Speaker 1: Oh, you were married?
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we got married after "Up, Up and Away" came out, and our PR [public relations] man, David Mirisch came to us and said, "Why don't you get married in a balloon?"  Because, "Oh, that would be different."  So our wedding invitation said, "You are invited to the parking lot of the Century Plaza Hotel."  Because that was the only place in the city where we could legally put up a hot air balloon.  It was tethered, and [James] Jimmy Webb's father [Robert Lee Webb], who was a minister, married us in the hot air balloon.  I always say, years later after about eleven years Marc and I were divorced, I say, "My balloon burst."  (laughter)
Speaker 1: (laughter)
Speaker 2: But we're still friendly.
Speaker 1: The, the-- Let's--let's trim this down now to a year.  We're talking about '66 [1966]--'67 [1967]?
Speaker 2: Sixty, I think it was about '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: '68 [1968].  Thank you.
Speaker 2: I don't--I don't know the years of any of my marriages or divorces (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  But eleven years of happiness--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --and The Fifth Dimension becoming a household name.
Speaker 2: It's wonderful.  And a lot of people ask me how was it working with our--my husband.  It was great.  Marc didn't always tour with us, but he also managed Tony Orlando and Dawn, Thelma Houston, and a couple of other groups.  Brilliant man.  Marc knew music.  I mean, when we heard "Up, Up and Away," we liked it but we didn't think it would become the hit that it became.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Marc really had a--had a mind and an ear to recognize a hit.  As a matter of fact, there was a song called "Precious and Few" that he had and nobody believed in it.  But he went, put his own money into it, and it became a big hit with another one of his groups [Climax].
Story_ID: 100888
Speaker 1: Okay.  The personal--stories--not stories, but certainly your--the thumbnails that you're on, each one of your--of the people that made up "The Fifth Dimension," Ron [Ronald Townson], I thought you sort of gave us a hint of your feelings for-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Ron, Ron was-- Ron was my sweetheart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think it's because, you know, I don't believe in astrology but he was an Aquarian; he and I are both Aquarians.  But we had--we were like night and day.  Ron would say to me--and I would wear real short, short miniskirts, and that was popular--"If you were my wife, you wouldn't be wearing that."  I said, "That's why I'm not your wife."
Speaker 1: (laughter)
Speaker 2: You know, we had those kinds of friendly battles.
Speaker 1: But loving.
Speaker 2: Oh, but all but loving, but loving.  And I think we always kind of felt--I think in a way maybe we felt like the underdogs, too, because, you know, Marilyn's [HM Marilyn McCoo] parents were doctors, and she was doing a lot of lead singing--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and then I was from Glenside [Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and Ron just had a warmth about him.  Ron loved birthdays and Christmas until he became a Jehovah's Witness.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But before that, he loved life and he loved--I know his spirit's still here with The Fifth Dimension.  He just had a light about him of loving--he was a dreamer too.  He was a dreamer and--
Speaker 1: Most Aquarians are.
Speaker 2: --liked to fantasize, you know.  But just, just a dear, dear man.  I feel sorry because I think--I really believe he died before his time because he didn't take care of himself.  Also, I believe when he changed religions, I saw his life and his health change because we would sing the National Anthem and he loved that.  He was for the country, but when he became a Jehovah's Witness he couldn't do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So a lot of the things that he loved were taken away from him, like celebrating birthdays, celebrating Christmas.  Those things were taken away from him, and I saw his whole persona change and his health fail.  One time, Ron came to me and said, "I want you to help me with my weight and with my health."  I said, "Oh, okay."  I was surprised that he knew that I was a health nut.  We were out one day, and Ron had these French fries and a hamburger, and I said, "No, no, you got--."  I said, "Okay, you got it."  That was what--that--that relationship as health monitor ended there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But he--
Speaker 1: (simultaneous)  There came a place and time then when you could not help him with the eating diet?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because he just didn't want it.  As a matter of fact, Ron's nickname was "Sweets."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because he would sneak--you would hear something "crinkle, crinkle, crinkle."  Candy wrappers.  He'd sneak cookies and candy.  He was like a big kid.  I think that's why so many people loved him.  I called him the "visual image of the group."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so many people loved him because they saw--they saw that light.  They saw the child in him.  And it's something, you know, so many adults--when we become adults we become hardened, and we lose that, the love of life that children have.  I believe we should lose childish things, but not the child, the laughter and the loving of life, the appreciation of nature.  I try to keep that.  For a while I lost it too.  But that's what Ron had. (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: You've regained it.
Speaker 2: I hope so.  I'm trying.  But I think that's what Ron had that people saw.
Speaker 1: And he was loved. (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: He was a dreamer.
Speaker 1: And he was the face for The Fifth Dimension?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was the visual image.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: He--he was.
Story_ID: 100889
Speaker 1: Now, how about [HM] Billy Davis [Jr.]?  How did you rate that assessment?
Speaker 2: Billy-- wild child (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When Billy first, when we--when the group [The Fifth Dimension] first got together, Billy and I were like partners, only then we didn't have a car and he lived near me and I would give him rides.  And I think Billy was used to being in other groups and dating all the girls in the groups, but Billy and I just didn't--didn't hit it off, you know, so we were like--we were just friends.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, we were friends before he and [HM] Marilyn [McCoo] got together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because actually Marilyn and [HM] Lamonte [McLemore] dated for awhile.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But Billy, this man, I could hardly sing background for him without going into tears.  When he sang "A Change is Gonna Come," this man had a voice that was different, it was fabulous.  But I know--I don't think he was ever really happy in The Fifth Dimension because with the voice that he had, and with Marilyn doing most of the lead singing, The Fifth Dimension was a very female-oriented group.  And actually it was Billy who wanted to leave the group.  I don't think--not Marilyn.  Because I think--I really feel that he felt he could have more of a solo career because he had a fabulous voice.  Very gritty, R&B, gospel.  Just--just awesome.  But he never really--never really had a chance to have that career to showcase that voice.  But he--he--he was the wild child.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: You know, he was from St. Louis [Missouri], and you know, he was the--what do you--not--.  Trying to put my finger on the right word [pause].  But, yeah, Billy was the clown because he would do just do fun things, and people thought that Billy and I were dating because we were--we were the--we were the fun kids.  You know, let's just have a good time, and you know, take a chance and do this.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Whatever.  Like Billy would do something to make Marilyn mad, and I would laugh and egg him on (laughter).
Speaker 1: (laughter)
Speaker 2: We were partners in crime (laughter).
Story_ID: 100890
Speaker 1: And how about Marilyn--[HM] Marilyn McCoo?
Speaker 2: Marilyn was always Miss Sophisticate.  She was the sophisticated one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, as I said, her parents were doctors and she studied voice, and I don't think Marilyn and I were friends until recently.  We were always friendly--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and I've great regard for her.  She is--Marilyn is one of the most disciplined and one of the most professional people I like.  There're other people I prefer as vocalists, but she--that's one thing I miss about not having her in the group.  She's very professional.  She will study and she will rehearse.  Also, she is very good at business--she has a business degree.  She always helped us with the business.  She--
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) Which is very important.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  And it's one thing that a lot of the entertainers neglect.  And they forget it's "show business."  To this day, we still have, Marilyn, [HM] Billy [Davis, Jr.], and [HM] Lamonte [McLemore] and I, still have business because, you know, we have residuals, and we have--and Marilyn will call, "Did you read that in the contract, did you see that?"  And I, "No, I missed that."  You know, so I really respect her for that.  We were always--it was almost like I was in school again.  It was that same kind of relationship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Right, right.
Speaker 2: It was almost, almost--almost like a sibling rivalry in a way.  I always--I didn't really envy her for the lead singing because I was proud to be able to sing my backgrounds, you know.  There were times when I did want more solos in the show--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: It's only natural.
Speaker 2: And I remember they would--all the reviews would talk about Marilyn singing and about my dancing, you know.  I was the one with the energy.  Then finally, one day I realized, you know, this is a singing group, a vocal group.  Maybe I should take some voice lessons.  So I started taking voice lessons after I got in the group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But Marilyn was always the very, you know, the sophisticated one and the business person.  I remember one time we had a performance and Marilyn missed the performance because she had her appendix out.  Well, when she was away, and Billy had a little drinking problem at first which he overcame, and it's nothing--not a secret.  She even talks about it in her book that they wrote.  Well, so, Billy was --Marilyn was--came back to Los Angeles, we were on the road, so the guys were going to play a joke on her, and Marilyn was not one to take a joke, you know.  So they called her, "Marilyn, Billy's been drinking and he's been arrested and blah-blah-blah."  "What, what, who, who, who."  Marilyn was mad.  Then they go "Ha-ha-ha-ha, we're just teasing."  She was like--then they put my son on the phone, he was a little boy, thinking that was going to cover it up.  But Marilyn was mad that us, boy, for playing that trick on her.
Speaker 1: 'Cause she was business and serious?
Speaker 2: She was business and serious.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 100891
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And let's go to Rene DeKnight.
Speaker 1: Rene.  We lost Rene about a year or so ago.  He went to be with the Lord.  Rene was an awesome man.
Speaker 2: Awesome in the sense of--
Speaker 1: In many ways.  He may have been older, but he was a flower child at heart (laughter).  Rene was also married to Freda DeKnight, who was, I think, in charge of the Ebony Cookbook at Jet Magazine.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well, he was married to her at one time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But not when we met him.  When we met him, he was married to Sally Blair.  I don't think you know who Sally was.  Sally Blair, she was black, beautiful lady--beautiful.  And she was also a singer.  But Rene was, as I said, he was a flower child at heart, and Rene loved life.  And, of course, he loved music.  He was a fine musician.  He did some of our--the greatest charts that were ever performed, Rene did them.  Because, as I said, he had that jazz influence, and he had lived in Europe at one time, and I think Rene had quite a colorful life (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: You know, but he was just a great man.  Rene taught us--tried to teach us discipline.  The one thing I remember Rene is, "be here now."  In other words, if we're doing this interview, we talking, don't be thinking what you're going to have for dinner or what you're going to do tomorrow.  Be here now.
Speaker 2: Focus.
Speaker 1: Focus on what you're doing. In other words, "be here with me."  Not minds splattered elsewhere.  That was one thing I really got from Rene and retain to this day.  He taught us about rehearsing and focusing and rehearsal.  He taught us about--what's the word?  Excellence.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: Excellence. I really--I really thank Rene for that.
Speaker 2: Would it be fair to say that he brought maturity to the group?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Rene brought maturity (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Because he was the oldest one?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  He was much older than we--, but he brought maturity--he was also fun now, but it was far from being a stick in the mud.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Rene, because Rene surrounded himself with young people and that kept him youthful.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: As I said, he ate in a very healthy manner.  Sometimes he'd carry things with him, he ate his nuts--that's what I do today (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But I learned a lot about life.  And I didn't realize it actually, until I'm sitting here talking about it, how much I learned from Rene about taking care of yourself, but also how to just live and enjoy life.  Don't fear the future, don't be afraid to take risks.  You know, Rene did things that people half his age wouldn't do.
Speaker 2: Such as, an example of that?
Speaker 1: He married a beautiful young woman, he bought a house somewhere he couldn't afford, he left the country, he lived in France.  Just adventurous.
Story_ID: 100892
Speaker 1: If you had to rank all the hits of The Fifth Dimension, highest first then and going down a little, how would you rank the top, let's say, five to ten?
Speaker 2: Now, am I ranking them in sales or songs that I like?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: How am I ranking them?
Speaker 1: In terms of popularity or performance?
Speaker 2: In popularity there's no question.  I believe it's a tie between "Up, Up and Away" and "Aquarius."  Probably "Aquarius" now because it's be used in films.  "Aquarius," "Up, Up and Away," "One Less Bell," "Stoned Soul Picnic."  How many is that (laughter)?
Speaker 1: That's six--five.
Speaker 2: And actually, I can still look at residuals and tell you exactly what they are and what countries they're being played in because we're still receiving residuals from those songs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 100893
Speaker 1: You're still a group [The Fifth Dimension].  How much are you performing now?  Meaning that do you--certainly you're not doing as much as you had been doing?
Speaker 2: We've been performing--actually, The Fifth Dimension broke the original The Fifth Dimension's records as far as performance and attendance.
Speaker 1: Oh, Okay.
Speaker 2: At this point, we are not--in 2007 we're not performing as much because I'm reconstructing.  I'm the only original member left, and I have some wonderful, fabulous singers. Willie Williams has been with us now ten years; Leonard Tucker, awesome young man, about a year; and also, Michael Mishaw, about a year; and I'm looking for a young lady.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We have reviews that look like I paid the people.  I will show you.  I mean they just rave.  And I believe what it is, I believe we're better than the originals, not because of the people or the voices, but because we matured to a point where you learn.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: As I said, we have awesome singers.  I think the differences in the group now than the original group, the original group is classic.  There'll never be another.  You can't duplicate that.
Speaker 1: You can't duplicate classics.
Speaker 2: But The Fifth Dimension today is more spontaneous, more hip; however, we still retain that class.  We sing our songs, we sing them just as they were recorded.  People--I put the show together, and I feel that people come to see The Fifth Dimension, they have memories.  You don't mess with "Up, Up and Away," make it a hip-hop or different.  They come, "Ah, I remember, I was in high school."  "Oh, I remember."  So when we sing "Up, Up and Away" and "Aquarius," "One Less Bell," I never did care for "Stoned Soul Picnic" that much, but people love it.  We sing them with the same harmonies as when they recorded.  Now, what we do, though, with "Stoned Soul Picnic," we sing it just as it was recorded, then we do--we insert a little fun rap.  "What can you say about Up, Up and Away.  Forty-two years and it's here to stay.  When we do "Stoned Soul Picnic" today, it's "For sure we're going to do it in a brand-new way."
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Just a little fun thing.
Speaker 1: I appreciated that.  Would you give us another piece of the one of your classics?
Speaker 2: Oh, no (laughter).  I need--I need my group.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  We will go to see that group.
Story_ID: 100894
Speaker 1: Over the years, I want to be sure that I'm not leaving out anything in that history.  Do you think I've left out anything, can you recall anything I need to?
Speaker 2: Yes. One important thing I remember about The Fifth Dimension is that, [HM] Marilyn McCoo and [HM] Billy Davis [Jr.] were with us for ten years; yet, when people think Fifth Dimension, they think Marilyn McCoo because she lead--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --on "One Less Bell" and several other of our hits.  So people-- "Marilyn."  I'm tired of people saying, 'Where's Marilyn McCoo?'"  We're still in touch.  You know, there is no, you know, rivalry--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --we're both-- Marilyn has become a Christian, so we both attend many of the same functions.  I saw them, as a matter of fact, last Saturday at The Church on The Way's Gala, (unclear) King's College.  But--so they left, and when they left, it was very difficult to replace them.  So we searched, as matter of fact, we found one young man, but he wanted to make the group more R&B.  The hardest position to replace has been the other female.  Part of this has been because, and I had to take responsibility in the beginning--I think I was a little hard to get along with.  I was pushed into a position that I wasn't ready for and didn't want, of leadership.  I was too dogmatic, too--what's the word?  I was not a nice lady at times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But only because I was trying--I was trying to accomplish something and I didn't know how to go about accomplishing it.  And many of the young ladies that entered, they act--they really wanted to be solo artists.  And I think I was trying to make them into a Marilyn McCoo, you know, to get the class, the professionalism.  And a lot of them just didn't have it.  So when I got on them about it, you know, I was the "you-know-what." (laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 100810
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were talking about [HM] Marilyn [McCoo] and [HM] Billy Davis [Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --leaving.  Can you tell us the events that just lead up to that?  You were a very successful group.
Speaker 2: Yes, we were.  We had history traveling all over the world, and then we start recording, and Bones Howe, who was a white producer, H-O-W-E, is the one who brought songs like "Stoned Soul Picnic," and we never would have recorded that song, you know.  We were black.  We were-- heard more R&B songs.  But Bones would bring us different songs and we all listened, "Oh, yeah, we can do that."  Well, Bones had a certain formula, and after awhile the formula wasn't working.  We weren't having hits.  And, as a matter of fact, Marilyn and I were talking, "What are we going to do--blah, blah, blah?"  Well, little did I know, but Marilyn had already told Marc [Gordon], my husband, (unclear) that they were going to leave the group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he didn't tell me because--one thing Marc always did, he always kept the business from our personal relationship.  He didn't give me leads to songs because I was his wife--
Story_ID: 100811
Speaker 1: And I'll--I'll never forget how I felt when I found out that [HM] Marilyn [McCoo] and [HM] Billy [Davis, Jr.] were leaving.  I was angry because of like--"Well, we were had just been talking about what we could do to get the group back on top."  I felt all kinds of emotions, you know.  And I thought, "Well, maybe this will give us some time, an opportunity to get on a different direction."  But anyway, they did leave and as I said, were very difficult to replace.  And actually, what I think about, I should have never tried to replace them as car--people as carbon copies.  Because I tried to make the girls that come into the group carbon copies of Marilyn.  I didn't realize what I was doing at the time.  But you'd be surprised how many people are good singers but are not professional, who don't respect time, who don't listen to--who don't like to listen to criticism.  And I had to learn how to criticize people.  Sometimes, in my way of trying to get to the point, I was often was not as kind as I could have been.  And I prayed about that, and the Lord--the Lord showed me, you know, sometimes God will show you things about yourself that you don't like.  And I realize now that sometimes I wasn't nice.  And then we had a manager who wanted to make me--he wanted to make the group "Florence LaRue and The Fifth Dimension."  And I said, "No, I didn't want that."  First of all, I was afraid of it.  I didn't--I was--I didn't have confidence in myself as a singer and I said, "No."  At the same time, he pushed me ahead of the other members of the group.  And, well, I liked that treatment so I didn't resist it, but I--I had to realize what it was doing to the other people, how it was making them feel.
Speaker 2: You were taking the lead in looking for the replacements for Marilyn--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and Billy?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So you had already assumed that role.
Speaker 1: Right.  I had to because there was no one else who could, because [HM] Lamonte [McLemore] was in the group, but Lamonte to me is not a singer.  And also, I have more of a knowledge of music than he, and he agreed to allow me to do this.  So it wasn't like I went behind his back or anything.  But he agreed to that.  He said, "Oh, you go ahead.  You do it because you know what you're doing."  So we had young ladies in the group.  One of my favorites was Joyce Wright, W-R-I-G-H-T.  Joyce--the reason Joyce left the group, she married Ricky Pierce, who was a basketball player.  Joyce and I are still friends.  She has a beautiful big home in Texas, and I visit her and her family.  And, Joyce could really sing, really sing.  But--and there were other girls who could sing, but there were these personality clashes.  One of the girls clashed with Ron [Gordon].  You know, she was very "street" and Ron was not, you know.  Ron was a gentleman and he expected ladies to be ladies.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he did not get along with this young lady at all.
Story_ID: 100812
Speaker 1: So there was really like a revolving door of people for a while [in The Fifth Dimension].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I didn't like it because, first of all, it was expensive, you know, buying new costumes and revamping the show.  But that was the reason, and I believe the main reason was because we had people who would come into the group who really didn't want to be part of a group.  They really wanted solo careers and wanted--some of them used The Fifth Dimension and have gone on to work, and I know they're getting more work because they say, "Well, I sang with The Fifth Dimension."  I do remember there was one young lady, I don't want to mention her name, but I hired her; I shouldn't have because she really didn't have The Fifth Dimension personality.  And my manager convinced me, "Oh, she'll be okay.  We'll be put her back there in the corner."  I'm like--but we finally did have to leave her go.  But it was--and it taught me a lesson.  It's really not fair to people to hire them to do something that you know they can't do.
Speaker 2: Right, right (unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Her voice--
Speaker 2: Trying to force a square peg into a round hole (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Right, because she couldn't even find--she's singing, but she didn't have The Fifth Dimension personality or sound.  So it really was unfair to hire her.
Speaker 2: Is it a fair question to ask that whether you had ever been able to reach that plateau you would like to reach since [HM] Marilyn [McCoo] and [HM] Billy [Davis, Jr.] left?
Speaker 1: No, not yet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I know we will.  If didn't feel that we could, I would just say, "Okay, pack it up, I'm beating a dead horse."  We reached that plateau as far as our show is concerned--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --we surpassed it.  And as I said, with all due respect to Marilyn and Billy, I'm not saying this because we necessarily have better voices, but we've matured, and we've grown, and we've surpassed the original group.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Even I've had people come to me and say, "You know, I saw you years ago and you're better now than you were then."  And that was with the original group.  We haven't reached the plateau as far as recognition, and that's something I'm working on now with management.  There're some people who think the group broke up, don't even know we're performing.  Because when you're known as a recording group and people don't hear your new recordings, they go, "Oh, I guess they broke up."  And, again as I said, when you say Fifth Dimension, people associate it with the name "Marilyn McCoo" and they see her out working.  Also, Billy and Marilyn, at one time did say "of 'The Fifth Dimension,'" and we asked them not to do that; say, "formerly," and to please let people know that, yes, you're gone, you're successful, but The Fifth Dimension is still working as a unit.
Story_ID: 100813
Speaker 1: The Fifth Dimension, you are principally a leader--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: -and manager, now, of the group?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, I work with--we have a manager, but I work very closely with management.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So there's a role that you are in, and would someone have that role that Marc [Gordon] had?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, definitely.  Yes, we have to have a manager.  And, I tell you sometimes I say, "I just want to sing."  It's a very difficult position to be in, to be the lead singer, and to have so much to do with the business end.  It's very time consuming.  I pray a lot.
Speaker 1: I'm sure.
Speaker 2: I pray a lot, say, "God, please, please guide me."  As a matter of fact, people ask me this all the time, "Is the group ever going to have a reunion?"  I say, "Well, first of all we couldn't because [Ronald] Ron Townson is not alive."  Second of all, I say "No," and I say no friendly because when the group--when Marilyn and Billy had left the group, okay, we had The Fifth Dimension performing, then our manager said--suggested that we have a reunion.  Well, we did.  The original group had a reunion [1990 and 1991].  We went out, we were on television.  I didn't want to do it.  I was the only one that didn't want to do it.  Everyone else did.  I did not want to do it because exactly what I thought would happen, happened.  First of all, it was not fair to the people who were singing in the group.  It was like suddenly they're not good enough or their friends and family, "I thought you were in The Fifth Dimension?"  "I am."  Because if we were going to have a reunion and there're working in Fifth Dimension, then we should have taken them with us and say, "This is the original, but these people have carried on the name."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Carried on the tradition.  It was disrespectful to them.  That's why I said "No, there will not be another reunion" for those two reasons; Ron isn't here and we have a group.  Now, if we decide that we're not going to have a Fifth Dimension, let's just have the original group reunite.  That might be a possibility, although I did say we would have to get a replacement for Ron Townson.
Speaker 1: Right.  Do you ever expect to start recording again?
Speaker 2: Most definitely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's one of the things; we really want to record again because it's needed.  We need some new music.  Also, I want to have something new for the young people who don't know The Fifth Dimension.  Our fans keep asking us, "When are you going to record again, when are you going to record again?"  We need--I want to record some music that is fun, but that is also palatable to all the ages, like we did before, something that's positive.  So I'm very excited about recording it, but very different.  I'll never forget the last time I went into the studio.  Where are the musicians?  Everything is, is electronic now.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean we recorded our songs.  We--I could remember one time we sang a song, Orange Air, for seven hours to get it perfect, on pitch.  Now they just have a machine, you sing it and they turn it up or down.  But then what happens to these people when they sing live?  You see?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We are one of the few groups who sing live.  There are many groups who, they're singing but everything's on tape.  None of our music is on tape.  Everything you hear sung is live.  And I'm proud of that.
Speaker 1: Right.  You should be.
Story_ID: 100814
Speaker 1: Let me not forget your family.  You had been reaching most of your life for that father figure.  Just to hear your mother [Sara Dell LaRue] say or your father [James Harris LaRue] say that "I love you."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But that was also missing from your mother--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --who was stern--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and showed you the affection, showed you the love, but never verbalized it.
Speaker 2: Right.  My mother didn't show me love physically.  She was not one to hug you and kiss you.  My dad was the one that did that.  As a little girl, when I sit on daddy's lap and watch T.V., and do things like that.  But my mother was never that type of person.  And then years later when my grandchildren came along, she said, "You know, I never told you kids that I love you," you know.  But she does all the time now.  My mother lived with me for, oh, twenty years.  And she's now in a nursing home because she has Alzheimer's.  She's bedridden.  She has--she's on dialysis, but she's not in pain, and she's just in good spirits.  My mother taught me about faith.  The doctors gave my mother three months to live. She was in the last stages of cancer.  My mother said she told the Lord, "Lord, I don't want to die.  I want to raise my girls myself."  That was over forty years ago.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So I know what God can do-
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --and I know what faith can do.  Now I look at her little body.  She's half my size, she weighs about ninety pounds.  And I know she's tired.  And sometimes she'll refuse dialysis because she doesn't know what it is.  And I say, "You better go do it, do you want to die."  "Well, it's my time."  Like that. (laughter)  But she's been this way for a while.  I don't know when or how long the Lord's going to let her be here.
Speaker 1: He'll decide. (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: But as long as she's here, we know we'll love her and take care of her.
Story_ID: 100815
Speaker 1: The part that we left out of this conversation are your children and your grandchildren.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about your children, the names at first.
Speaker 2: People who don't--people who just meet me recently think I have three children because I raised my ex-husband Marc's [Marc Gordon] three children; Robin [ph.] Gordon, Chris Gordon, and then we had a son, Geoffrey Gordon.  The interesting thing about that is when Robin and Chris came to live with me, they were four and seven.  I said, "Now, you can't call me Florence."  I don't allow children to call me Florence.  I said, "Now, your mother's living, I'm not trying to replace her.  You respect her.  But we have to come up"--I said, "You come up with a name that will be respectful for me."  Well, they decided that I was "Mommy" and their mother, "Mommy Sara," because that was her name.  Well, when my son was born, he called her "Mommy Sara" too.  It was--my divorce to Marc was sad because I didn't realize it until a long time after that when I divorced him, I divorced the children.  And that's the wrong thing to do.  The children were grown--I remember when I got divorced, my son said, "Mommy, are we going to take Robin and Chris with us?"  I said, "Well, they're not your brother and sister."  "Yes, they are."  Because I had built such a family.  And then in my stupidity, I almost destroyed it.
Speaker 1: How old were they at that time, the children?
Speaker 2: Chris was--I think Robin was 20 by--let's see Geoffrey was 11, Chris was 15, and Robin was 19.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So unfortunately, now Robin and I, the daughter, are not close; but Chris, we're still close, still calls me "Mom," and his mother is still living.  She's in a nursing home.  But--and I go and I--when I speak to people, I tell them--because I lecture at times--I say, "Be careful of divorce.  Children don't deserve to be hurt."  And unfortunately, I did almost to them what my parents [Sara Dell LaRue and James Harris LaRue] did to me.  I didn't learn by that.  You know, when you're divorcing, you have to sit down with children, explain to them, "I love you, it's not your fault.  Your father and I are just having problems."  I said--as a matter of fact, my divorce was so amicable, my husband and I lived together during the divorce (laughter).  Finally, my lawyer said, you know, "If you're going to get divorced, don't you think he should move out of the house?"  Because we never argued, we never--there was no violence, no mental violence.  There was just--my husband was unfaithful and there-- had habits that were not palatable to raising children.  I won't go into details out of respect for his family.  But that's what happened because we had everything.  We had a big estate in Pacific Palisades, we had money, we had the children.  It was a wonderful life.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But as--and had I known then what I know now, if I were mature, I may still be married to him because I may have to say, "Okay, you have this problem, you have to go to therapy or go to counseling."  But me, in my Aquarian nature, came home, found out he was having an affair.  I went and filed for divorce, very quietly went to his office and said, "I filed for divorce."  He said, "Don't you want to go to counseling?"  I said, "No, I don't love you."  I was just young and--
Speaker 1: And hurt. And hurt. (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --immature, you know.  Immature.  But the children are still in my life very much so.  Chris, and of course my son is now thirty-six years old; he's married, been married for eleven years and has three gorgeous children.
Speaker 1: And you have three gorgeous grandchildren.
Speaker 2: Yes, brilliant.  Whenever I get low, I turn on my cell phone and play a message that I've saved.  "Hi, Granny.  I miss you so much."  I saved it (laugher).
Speaker 1: The--give us their names, your grandchildren.
Speaker 2: The eldest is Sarah--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --she's named after my mother.
Speaker 1: So it's S-A-R-A?
Speaker 2: S-A-R-A-H.  She spells it S-A-R-A-H.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She puts the "H" on it.
Speaker 2: And she's Sarah, and Elizabeth for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's my middle name, so Sarah Elizabeth Gordon; Isabella Gabrielle Gordon, and Zoe--what's Zoe's middle name?  I forgot Zoe's middle name.  Zoe Gordon.
Speaker 1: Zoe Gordon.  All right.
Speaker 2: I forgot his middle name-- Zoe Isaiah.  Zoe Isaiah.
Speaker 1: Zoe Isaiah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They have biblical names.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They love the Lord, praise God.
Story_ID: 100816
Speaker 1: Now, the--after [HM] Billy [Davis, Jr.] and [HM] Marilyn [McCoo] left, there were other subtle changes that started coming to the group [the Fifth Dimension].
Speaker 2: Not subtle, they were major.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Anytime you replace Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis, they are major changes.  Marilyn and Billy were major elements in The Fifth Dimension's success.  I will never dishonor that at all.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: There were major changes (laughter).
Speaker 1: But there were other changes after they--after they left?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We changed managers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what--when did that occur, do you remember the year approximately?
Speaker 2: It was in the late '80s [1980s], I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: That was--(unclear)(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: The new manager--
Speaker 2: Erick Sterling and Jason Winters.
Speaker 1: Who took Marc's [Marc Gordon] place, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what other changes occurred in the group?
Speaker 2: Personel changes were the main changes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they were--
Speaker 2: One change--Erick and Jason--well, I think Erick was mostly, handled mostly the business.  Jason, who's black, was more of the creative force.  With him we did something that no other group had ever done.  We, as a group, performed in the play "Ain't Misbehavin'."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a brilliant idea, and it was very, very successful because actually theatre is really my first love.  I love theatre and musical theatre.  I starred in three plays:  "Ain't Misbehavin'," and then two plays in Canada, "Mo' Magic" and "More Magic."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was one of the--a big change for The Fifth Dimension, something we'd never done before, was doing the play.
Story_ID: 100817
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other historical highlights there for The Fifth Dimension, bringing us up to the present?
Speaker 2: We have so many I don't know where to begin.  We've sung at the White House [Washington, D.C.] three times.  And people ask me about that.  I say, "Well, you know, even if it's not the President of your choice, it's an honor to sing at the White House in the United States.  I'm one that believes that once have an election and the President wins, you should support him because he's in that office.  Now, if you want to get rid of him, you go out and vote him out the next time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was very unhappy with the United States, the way they treated [President Bill] Clinton.  Because there are presidents of other countries, but you don't hear about the things that they do.  I think it was a lack of respect to treat our President that way.  Not that we should just, you know, throw it under the blanket, so to speak.  But once someone is in an office, you respect that office.  And make other countries--how can you expect other countries to respect the office if we don't?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So singing at the White House was always a great honor.  We also--The Fifth Dimension went on a State Department-sponsored tour to Eastern Europe.  At that time it was Communist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was quite an honor.  We went to Turkey, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Poland.  Awesome trip.  It made me realize that no matter what our problems here--racial problems, whatever problems we have, this is still the best country in the world.
Speaker 1: Right. And all on that tour, all the people, the crowds that you met, all of them knew and had heard of The Fifth Dimension?
Speaker 2: We had an experience, I'll never forget.  I get chills thinking of it.  The Fifth Dimension's music was not allowed in some of these countries because it was freedom.  And we were very big in the black market.  I remember we were in, I think it was Poland, and we got a message that there were about six men from the Communist Party that were coming to our rehearsal to censure the show because they wanted to make sure that we didn't cause any riots or anything like that.  Marc [Gordon] stepped in, he says, "Oh, no."  He says, "We were brought by the State Department.  We won't do this."  We ended up--we went and did the rehearsal, they sat there, we did the show.  They were all going backstage with dogs laughing and asking for our autographs.  At the end of the show, hundreds of people rushed the stage.  We were terrified.  They wanted to touch us.  We were their touch to the free world.  I'll never forget that, with music.  It's awesome.
Speaker 1: Devastating.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Devastating.
Speaker 2: We don't know what we have in this country.
Story_ID: 100818
Speaker 1: We don't know how blessed we are.  We are blessed.  When we look at other countries--I went on a tour to the Gambia, East Africa [sic, West Africa], with my church.  We took medicine, we set up a pharmacy.  People would walk for miles to get an aspirin, and, of course, we ministered to them.  And to see the looks on these Muslim faces when they received the Lord, the freedom that they had.  It was awesome.  We are so blessed in this country and we so take it for granted.  But the one thing, also, that I feel, yes, I went to Africa, and I just--I really got a heart for Africa.  I always thought that--I had a pen pal in Ghana, and I used to think Africa was the bush and wild animals, and he sent these beautiful pictures.  Well, I thought, I'll go to Africa on a safari and I'll be dressed in my, you know, linen and watch the animals.  The Lord had another way for me.  I went to Africa on this mission, and I saw people, and I met people, women nursing two, not infants, but young children because they had no food.  And people yearning and accepting the Lord.  It was an awesome experience.  And I really gained a heart from Africa, and I have a picture--I'll show it to you after--of three African children that I took when I went there.  I didn't get any pictures of me because I was taking the pictures of them.  But also, my heart is very heavy for the United States because we don't have--I see all these celebrities going to India and Africa and all these people---I think that's good, but I think we need to start in the United States and start with our families.  I have nephews who are not saved.  I have nephews who need to be taught.  Start with our families and then branch out.  And then--they, too, can go.  So not only will you go, but you'll be sowing seeds, and those seeds can be sowing seeds, and we'll spread the word and spread love all over the world to more people.

Speaker 1: Well, I know you're continuing your work as you see it, and that's very, very important.
Speaker 2: I'm trying.
Speaker 1: I know you're continuing to make sure that The Fifth Dimension do not die.
Speaker 2: I pray that The Fifth Dimension will be a light in the world of entertainment that is often dark.  And I don't knock these young rappers, I'll tell you why.  Because they're doing what they know.  It's the adults who have--do you know that the average person who listens to rap is a white, young man?  But these people who've taken the arts out of school, so they're using rhythms, what they know.  They're talking about their life experiences that they think, that they know, and they think this is life.  We have to teach them that, okay, this is a part of life, but there's this bright part of life, too, that you can sing about.  And you can spread that.  I'm just starting a foundation, I haven't named it yet, where I want to bring the arts to the schools, to the young people.  I like classical music and operas because I was introduced to it.  Children don't like that.  They don't like that because they don't know it.  When I taught, I always took classical music.  I'll never forget, I had a large--a white teacher, my master teacher, "What you bring that for?  These kids don't know that."  I said, "I know they don't.  That's why I'm bringing it."  So I would start with the Grand Canyon Suite [by Ferde Grofe].  "What do you hear?"  "Oh, we hear the donkeys."  And that--you can't please--everyone's not going to like it.  So there was this one little black boy, you know, he didn't like classical music, I don't care if there were donkeys or what in it.  I said, "I tell you what, you don't have to like it, but what I want you to do, I want you to bring music that you like."  Sure enough, he brought in this rock and roll music, R&B rather.  So I said, "Good.  What do you like about it?"  And he said he liked it.  I said, "Good."  I made him get up and dance.  I said, "Now, you see you have a choice.  You have music you can dance to, you have music when you're happy, you have music when you're sad; there's all kinds of music."  And I let them know that there's a choice.  And I want The Fifth Dimension to be a light.  And also, I want us to--most of us are Christians, I want us to spread the love of God through our music.  Because people don't want to be preached that.  I remember one time--I sing a lot of spiritual music, not gospel, because as I said, I don't have that wonderful gospel sound, but I sing spiritual music.  And there was a time when I did want to do gospel music.  And you know how they say the Lord speaks to you?  Well, I was Alhattie's Camp [Alhatti Christian Resort and Retreat Center], it's a Christian business camp; it's in Idyllwild, California.  And the Lord woke me up at three in the morning.  I don't know why he does that.  Why can't He tell me something at five in the afternoon, you know?   But three in the morning He woke me up, and I went up to this mountain where they have their prayers in the morning, and I looked and it was dark, pitch black.  And normally you can see the stars.  Not a star.  And I looked and there was one star, and the Lord spoke to me in my spirit, I didn't hear His voice, but He said to me--because my company was called "Rising Star."  He said, "No, no, no.  You call it 'Shining Star' for this one star, and that's Jesus."  And I want The Fifth Dimension to be that shining star.  We don't have to say--we don't have to preach to people, but they will see that light and they'll know that there's something different about--I've had people say, "There's something different about you, what is it?"  And it gives me a chance to minister to them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 100277
Speaker 1: The Fifth Dimension and your life has been very, very inspirational.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: And I'm sure it'll continue to inspire people.  I want to start to close by asking you, how would you like to be remembered as an individual for your contributions here on Earth?
Speaker 2: That's really a difficult question, Paul.  You know, sometime ago I was taking a little survey in a magazine and it said "Ask three friends to describe you in one word."  Well, I asked many friends, and the one word they all used was "caring."  I'd like to be remembered as someone who is successful.  Now, what is success?  Success is taking the gift that God has given you, using it to the fullest and helping others.  I want to be known as a farmer, someone who sows seeds; seeds of kindness, seeds of--and someone who also brings other people up.  In other words, while I'm there as lead singer of The Fifth Dimension, "What about the background singers?  Am I teaching them?  Am I teaching them to be--to reach their potential, to help others reach their potential?"  That's what's important because you don't succeed if you don't have a successor.  So you have to have someone coming up.  I want to teach the young people, to give them hope for the future; to let them know that no matter what's going on in the world, there's a God, and to know their priorities, which I have gotten mixed up in the past.  God, family, career, in that order.
Story_ID: 100278
Speaker 1: Okay. Is there anything that you can think of in your life that, if you had the power, you could go back and change, would do differently (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh, there are so many things I would change, Paul.  One thing that stands out in my mind is something that is very dear to my heart, and that's parenting.  When I had my son [Geoffrey Gordon]--first of all, I worked the whole nine months.  I was nine months pregnant working at Caesar's Palace.  Since I was very healthy, I didn't gain a lot of weight. Then I gave birth.  My son was in Japan at three months.  I took him all over the world with me.  I paid for a nanny, her--if I--if I had the money I spent on him.  But then my son started school, and he was a brilliant child.  He was exceptional, he went to a school for gifted children.  But if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't have left him as much.  My aunt lived with me--I found out later she was Auntie Mame, my mother's sister Mary (laughter), and things weren't being done as I thought.  I wish--I wish I had my mother [Sara Dell LaRue] live with me instead, things would have been different.  But more than that, what can I change?  I would not have left--I would have given up my career for my son.  Other thing, I would not have divorced my husband, at least until my son was 16 or 18, because families need to be together whether they're good parents or not.  I would have stuck it out with him and helped him to get help for his problems.  I would have not been so shy and not allow so many people to take advantage of me.  I would have said "No" more in a nice way, but really said what I felt.  I was a people-pleaser.  And it's okay to be a people-pleaser if you please God and yourself.  Those are the things I think I would change the most.
Story_ID: 100279
Speaker 1: Okay.  And one thing I'm just remembering, so this is my fault (simultaneous)  I wanted to go back briefly to visit your siblings, where they are--
Speaker 2: All right.  Okay.
Speaker 1: --today, starting with your first sister--(unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: My sister.  Well, Paul, every family has an odd child; that's my oldest sister [Cynthia Yvonne LaRue] (laughter).  My oldest sister is the different one.  She's probably more intelligent than any of us but doesn't use it.
Speaker 1: How is she different?
Speaker 2: She's different in that she's not focused.  I pray for her all the time.  She's never been married, she has three children with three different fathers, and she's a nurse, but a little bit of a lost soul.  I love her and I pray for her, and I'm trying to get closer to her.  My sisters and I, when we were younger I was more like a mother because they were young.  Now that we're adults, we're getting much closer.  But then, thank God, there's my middle sister Bernadette [Bernadette Marie LaRue].  I call her and her husband the "black Barbie and Ken."  If ever there was a perfect relationship, this is it.  Bernadette has a--her degree in business, and she worked for Johnson and Johnson and outsold all the men, got all kinds of trips to Hawaii because she was so good at what she did.  When she married her husband, he was studying to be a doctor.  Well, I believe she was probably the bigger wage earner than--she can straighten me out if this is wrong--however, they work together.  You know, sometimes women marry men who are a little bit below them, and then they help them.  And once those men make it, they leave them.  Not my sister.  Whitney LeBlanc is a man from the Lord.  They love the Lord.  My sister now, she doesn't have to work.  He's got a great government job.  They have three children who are the perfect kids.  I mean no drug problems.  The one that's working on his master's, the next one is in college working on his degree, and their daughter graduates this year and has been accepted at several colleges.  So she's just an example of what you can do if you work together and pray together.  And I wished I had let her handle my business because this young lady knows about business.  She and her husband have been married thirty very happy years.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She's great.  Then there's my baby sister Lala [Carlotta Eleanor LaRue].  I don't call her my little sister because Lala--well, once we started having children--
Speaker 1: Carlotta?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Carlotta, we call her Lala.
Speaker 1: When my mother [Sara Dell LaRue] started having children, she started small.  I'm the shortest.  Each one got taller and taller until my baby sister is, I'd say six feet.  She says, "I'm not six feet, I'm five-nine and a half."  She is just a beautiful person, giving; she reminds me of my mother, loving but don't cross her.  She's never been married, she's a teacher; now she's in a position on the teacher's board and all this, but she's a special teacher because she loves the children.  She works in a neighborhood--what do you call it--deprived neighborhood, and the gangs.  They love her because they know that "Miss LaRue loves us."  She takes them on trips, she does things with them.
Speaker 2: What neighborhood is this now?
Speaker 1: San Bernardino [California].
Speaker 2: San Bernardino.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She's just a wonderful teacher.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She does things like--the kids were fighting one day she said.  She said she gave them boxing gloves and made them fight.  She comes to their level but with respect.  When my sister was younger, she was very thin.  I wanted her to model, I mean men just loved her, black and white, you know, she was gorgeous.  But she's never married.  I still hope that she gets married, if she wants to, that she'll marry.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 100280
Speaker 1: Is there anything you think we may have left out?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm single, wanting very much to be married.  I'm not looking for a husband, I'm preparing myself, because the Bible says, "A man finds a good wife," so I'm preparing myself, hoping the he finds me soon.  I've been married three times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm friendly with all my ex-husbands.  As a matter of fact, you know, I see them--.  And I'm the one that got the divorce each time.  But, as I said before, if I could, I would have stayed with my first husband [Marc Gordon] (unclear), of course, knowing him now, we're very different people.  But I'm a good wife, and they know it.
Speaker 1: All right.  Just for the record, there was Marc--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and I did not get--
Speaker 2: Then I married Errol Aubry and then Bennett Curland.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Thank you very, very much.  This has been very interesting.
Speaker 2: (laughter).  Thank you, my pleasure.
Speaker 1: And we're going to go to--some of the collections of your life are next.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  Bless you.
