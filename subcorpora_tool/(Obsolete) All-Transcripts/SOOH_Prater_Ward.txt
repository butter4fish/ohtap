 Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Today is February 16, 2012. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I   m with  the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. I   m in Ada, Oklahoma, at the home of Ward and  Jean Prater. I will be interviewing Ward today as part of the  Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History Series. It just so happens that today  is your eighty-seventh birthday.  Yes.  So, happy birthday.  Thank you, thank you.   We are also joined by his Ward   s wife Jean and his son Jess Prater.   Thank you for talking with me today. To start out, would you mind  telling me when and where you were born?  I was born in Southeastern Oklahoma in McCurtain County on a farm, a  ranch-farm deal. Six hundred forty acres of ground is where it was, and  we was a truck farm. We took sections of that and farmed it for a living.  That   s how we made a living, furnished the house, everything. Of  course, them houses wasn   t very good. It wasn   t very much of anything  good. (Laughs) But we made it. We scratched out a living. I stayed  there. I went to school at Broken Bow, went to school at Eagleton.  That   s just on a   it   s not really a town there. It was just a little  settlement. Then later on, I went to Broken Bow High School. When this  war broke out, I wasn   t quite eighteen years old, or like about four  months of being eighteen. So, Mother was strictly against me going in. I  told her I wanted to go because I wanted to go into the Marine Corps.  Well, I didn   t know what that meant either, and she sure didn   t know.  But they finally agreed to sign me over. They said,    Well, you   re going  to go in anyhow. We might as well just give you permission.    So, they  5  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  did. I went from here to San Diego.  Well, can we go back to your childhood for a little bit real quick before  we get into that?  Okay.  What is your birth date?  The second  month   February  16th, 1925.  And were you born in that house that you were telling me about?  Yes, yes.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  I   m the next to oldest. I had a sister older than I was.  And then were there any that came after you?  Yes, I have four brothers and three sisters.  Quite a mess of kids.  Yes, well, we worked. (Laughs) We had to work, boy  I know that I   ve  heard Dale say,    Well, I got these kids here to work. I could handle them  cotton pastures and stuff.    (Laughter)  So, what all did your father farm?  Just cotton and corn and feed for the stock. We   d bale the hay and stuff  like that.  Had he been in that area for very long?  No, he was born in Arkansas. Yes, he was born in either Arkansas or  Kentucky. He come here when he was about twelve years old.  So, he met your mother in Oklahoma?  Yes, my mother came from Texas.  Do you know what part of Texas?  Sulphur Springs, Texas. That   s  Northeast  Texas, I think. I   ve never  6  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Jess Prater  Jean Prater  been out there but about one time. (Laughs)  How did your parents meet? Do you know?  No, just working in the fields, and they farmed     Well, your dad was friends with her brothers.  Yes, my dad knows   he was in the military, World War I, with my  mother   s brother.  Oh, okay.  That   s one of the reasons how they know each other.  What branch of the service was your dad in? How did he serve in World  War I?  Yes, he served in World War I.  Was he in the army?  Yes. He was in Argonne Forest and Belleau Woods. He was wounded.  He got gassed real bad, and he got shrapnel wounds. I don   t know how  long he stayed overseas. A good while, though.  Did he tell many stories about that war when you were growing up?  Yes, he used to tell us stories about it.  Do you remember any of them?  Well, not very well.  Do you remember the story about the family he stayed with? He talked  about that family a lot, remember?  No, I can   t remember, Jean.  Well, Jess might remember. Do you remember about those stories your  grandpa used to tell about when he was with his German family?  German or French?  German. I remember it, but I can   t remember the details.  7  Jess Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  I don   t think I ever heard that.  Well, he was fascinated with the way they did things.  Oh, you mean the Jackson family?  Probably   well, I don   t know. It was a family he knew.  Well, the Jackson family is the one that owned that land.  No, I mean a German family that he knew when he was overseas. Do  you remember that? Jess told it in school. That was after the war, now.  Yes. I forgot last     I shouldn   t have brought it up.  Ten years ago, I had pneumonia and I   ve forgotten quite a few things  since then.  Do you know when your parents got married?  No.  A few years before you were born, though?  Yes, yes. My sister was the oldest and, yes. We was born. That wasn   t  two or three years, just two or three years.  What were your parents    names?  My dad was named George Henry Prater, and my mother was Jimmy  Belle Smith. That was before she was married.  What were some of your chores helping out on the farm as you grew up?  Mostly picked cotton     Chop cotton.  And gather corn and pick beans and peas. Just everything, just generally  everything. (Laughs)  Did you have quite a large garden?  Yes, we just laid off about twelve or fourteen acres next to the house and  8  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  put truck patches there. Then we had our cotton patches out here and  corn patches, where we   d grow the most. And then the land was pretty  good. It growed good stuff.  Was your father farming with tractors yet?  No. No, my dad was a blacksmith. He run a blacksmith shop a long  time. Then he bought the blacksmith shop, and then he sold it. But he  owned it two times. He finally sold it to a guy that dad told us,    We   re  not going to have a blacksmith,    because we had to work, too, when we  had that blacksmith shop. (Laughs) So, that   s the way we got out of that  blacksmith shop. My daddy was a veteran of World War I. I remember I  was way up   a teenager, I think, and he started drawing a pension that  drawed twenty-one dollars a month for his veteran pension. That   s what  we lived on. He farmed. He still farmed, and run truck patches. So, we  lived pretty good after that. But then it got bad again in the    30s.  What do you remember about that? Did you know that there was a  Depression?  Oh, yes. We went hungry, some. A few, we didn   t starve or anything.  Sometimes we didn   t have enough food for a meal. It usually was night  when we didn   t have food, but they always tried to fix us a big breakfast.  That   s the way we operated, just eat that big breakfast and if we missed  something, we just missed it.  What would you have for breakfast?  Oh, eggs, pork, we was in open range, hog range. There wasn   t any pens  for the hogs. We had to catch pigs to fatten them. But them razorbacks,  just all in them woods. We marked them. We marked all we could catch.  We used dogs to catch them. We marked them all. But you still wasn   t     it wasn   t really your hog. It was just a wild hog. (Laughs) Then when I  was about ten years old, I think, Arkansas was going to stock their  Arkansas wilderness. Arkansas is a mountainous side on the west side  next to Oklahoma. They was going to bring some of them Russian boars  in there, they put with those razorbacks. Well, they did, and them stupid  things just multiplied everywhere  Oh, we   d have a few that we   d feed  along, keep them in contact.  In September, along in there, we   d build us a   we never built a board  bucket. We used little pine trees about that big around. (Gestures) There  was just piney woods just all    We just built a hog trough. We built it so  close that the hog would have to stay in, couldn   t lay down, couldn   t rear  up or anything. It   s the only way you can keep them and feed them  because they   ll bite you. Yes, that was pretty bad, the bite.  9  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  One time, my brother, Aubrey, which is about six or seven years  younger than I am, he   s dead now, but he was always following me to  feed them hogs. We   d feed three or four at a time. So, he kept going up  there in them pines. Them pine pokes, the bark had died on them.  They   d slip every once in a while. If you put too much pressure on them,  they   d slip. I   d have to watch him back there climbing up on that fence.  One day he fell off in there and fell right down beside the hog   s head. I  was pouring a bucket of chops in there, or cornmeal. The old hog was  squealing and squawking, and I just reached out there and caught him by  the gallaces on his britches, on his overalls, and just pulled him back out.  That old hog was just biting at him. (Laughs) Mother put a stop to that,  him going to the hog pen with me. (Laughs)  Did you ever get bit?  No. I had to help my daddy get out of the woods down there. We was  killing hogs because they was eating our corn. They were coming from  across Little River. And they didn   t range in there, they   d just come in  there. And so, we had two or three old sows that had little pigs. Well,  they   d just stay in the corn patches and just ruin the field. So, Dad and I  went in there. I was riding a horse, and he was riding a mule. It was just  our plow animals that we plowed with and used the wagon. There was  briar patches here, and we had them circled. They just run out and  growled, squealed, everything. So, finally, well, I run him out. I got in  pretty close to him and run him towards Dad. He was coming towards  Dad, and Dad was over on the mule. He was on that mule. Comes  toward him and he had a double barrel shotgun, 12-gauge shotgun. He  just stuck the gun down like that and killed him. (Gestures) Then that  old sow was behind him, he didn   t even see it. He got off that mule and  that old sow bit him right through the thigh.  Oh, my goodness.  We had trouble getting it to stop bleeding. It didn   t break a bone or  anything, he was just bleeding. So, he about went out, about passed out a  time or two because he bled so much. And so, I was walking, holding his  legs, and leading that old mule until we got him up there and got to a  doctor. There was a doctor about six, seven miles from there. But he  wasn   t really a doctor. He had a wagon, a buggy. He come in there and  doctored him. He said,    The dang poison is worse than the bite  You  don   t want it to get bad and get an infection.    But he had a sore leg for a  long time.  Oh, I bet. Did the Russian boar taste different than razorbacks?  10  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Oh, yes. Half the hogs down there is bluish, white and black, white and  red. They don   t look any more like   very much more like a Russian hog  than they did before. The old bores and their offspring was darker  colored. It has just real dark colors, like a bore was black. Well, it was a  dark color. That boar had gray hair on his back. It hasn   t been too many  years since I   ve seen them down there in the woods. We   d see them.  They got to where they   or we didn   t bother them. Of course, we didn   t  put the dogs on them or anything. I bet you there are just as many as  there ever was down there.  Oh, yes. They   re all over this state.  Did you raise milk cows?  Yes, we raised cows. One time, we had about thirty head of cattle.  Mostly, though, what we raised was milk cows. We sold cream and stuff  like that. We ate the milk products. And as long as you keep a cow with  a young calf, you have plenty of milk.  Where would you sell the cream? What was the nearest town?  We   d sell it at the store, a grocery store.  In McCurtain  County ?  Well, see, we lived close to Horatio, Arkansas.  Oh, okay. Horatio, Arkansas.  We lived about six or seven miles from Horatio. We lived in Oklahoma,  but now that was in Arkansas.  How far was Broken Bow?  Broken Bow was about twenty-one miles, and we took all of our stuff     well, no, I take that back. We have taken black ties   ties for the railroad  tracks. We sold them, and then we sold a lot of pine. Of course, we sold  a lot of oak and sweet gum. But you go out and then to sell for ten cents  apiece, and you go out and if you make ten ties, you   ve done a pretty  good day   s work.  Did you have a vehicle to haul these? What was the car that you would  haul them in?  Oh, wagons. We didn   t have cars. A few people in the country had cars,  but we didn   t have. My dad didn   t even drive. He, of course, if it had a  11  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  wagon, he knew all about them, but he sure didn   t fool with no cars   (Laughter) The old guy that owned that land, he took all of his people  that worked for him, that leased ground from him, and he   d see about  them. If they needed to go to the doctor he   d take them to Idabel or  Broken Bow. Idabel was about twenty-six or twenty seven miles and  Broken Bow was about twenty or twenty-one, something like that.  They   d go in a wagon. He   d go. Of course, there wasn   t even gravel  road, but they had them old Model T   s and trucks like that that   d go over  them roads.  When did your parents get a car?  My dad never did get a car. My mother drove my car some. After I got a  car, that was before I went in the Marine Corps. My dad never would  drive a car.  What about a tractor? What was the first   ?  No, we didn   t have tractors.  Never?  We couldn   t afford them. There was a few tractors around, but people  had to be doing pretty good to buy a tractor.  When did you start to school?  When I was five years old.  And where was that?  At Black Creek. The name of the school was Black Creek.  Was it very big?  No, it wasn   t very big.  Was it one room?  No, there was more than one. It was two rooms. I know we had soup.  They give us soup to eat for lunch. It tasted pretty good. Then I went  from there   oh, after we got up near grown, we kind of outgrew our  ranch where we made a living on. We moved from there, moved in  different houses, closer to work and stuff. I went to two or three schools  there.  12  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prate  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  How would you get to Black Creek school, did you walk?  No, they had a wagon road, just a wagon road. Them old trucks, they  drove on it, too. They come out of Broken Bow and Idabel. That country  down there in that area is not mountainous. It   s just flat land, farm land.  It used to be real good land, too. In the    30s and before, it was real good  land. But the    30s just sacked it down until it wasn   t any good.  Was there much dust blowing in the thirties down there?  Yes, but not like out in this country.  But it was still pretty dusty?  Yes, I   ve seen one or two real bad dust storms where you couldn   t see  good enough to walk when we were out. I know people that lived in the  western part that said that   s the way it was all the time there because it  was just out in the open. There wasn   t any timber or anything.  Did your parents talk much about politics?  Not much.  Did they like President Roosevelt?  Yes. Yes, they did because he got a lot of people out of bad trouble. He  made things better for them.  Were there a lot of people working with the WPA  Works Progress  Administration  in that part of the country?  No, he never did go to the WPA.  Your father?  My dad didn   t, but we have friends that their kids went to the WPA.  Let   s see. My sister   s husband, he belonged to that WPA. He stayed in  that four or five years. It was kind of like military. I wasn   t old enough  to really work. I believe you had to be seventeen before you could join  it. Yes, it was seventeen.  How old were you when World War II broke out?  I don   t know. About fifteen years. I   d say around fifteen years.  So, were many people going into the service at that point?  13  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Oh, yes. Yes, they was going into the service and hunting jobs. There  was a lot of jobs far off. It was a lot of   just everything picked up. A lot  of people left Oklahoma and Texas and Kansas, all the Dust Bowl,  moved. A lot of them moved.  In the Dust Bowl?  Yes.  To California?  Yes, most of them was California.  Did you know many people, personally, that moved?  No, I don   t remember anybody that we knew personally. Well, I  remember seeing the people that was moving there, but I didn   t know  them personally.  Would you see cars loaded down with people   s belongings?  Yes. Yes, old Model A cars and them old Model A trucks. They had  some old ones in there. They carried their extra spares, carried their tools  to work on that vehicle. People raised chickens on them wagon caravans.  (Laughter) Hogs, everything, it was just like a wagon train.  Wow. Were there many trains in the area that came through?  Well, quite a few. There was quite a few, but there wasn   t any really  close to us. They were more the northern part.  In what grade did you start going to Broken Bow to school?  Oh, I was a sophomore. And then when I went in the service, I was a  sophomore when I went in the service, too.  A sophomore?  I didn   t finish when I come back out. I didn   t finish at Broken Bow, but I  finished at Dallas, Texas. I was going to a   of course, I had my leg  messed up. I was crippled up pretty good, couldn   t get around too good.  I went to Texas trade school and learned to be a watch repairman and  jewelry repair.  A watch maker.  14  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  Jess Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  I watch repaired for twenty-six years. Then jewelry repair, that one was  a little longer. Then when I come back to the United States and was  discharged, I went down there and took a test at that trade school and  took a test and passed it. So, they said,    Well,    that was my     Your diploma?  Yes.  Well, what made you decide to join the Marines?  Well, I had a good friend that his daddy was a Marine before the war  even started. I worshipped him, I thought he was it. But he wasn   t in the  kind of Marine Corps I was in because that one we was in was just  killing people. That   s all they had in mind was to kill people.  So, since you were younger, you had to get your parents signature?  No, I didn   t have to get it.  Okay.  Eighteen is your break off point.  Yes, they did. Yes.  Because you were seventeen?  Yes, I was seventeen.  So, what did they think when you asked them to sign off on that?  Well, they said,    If you   re going anyhow when you get old enough        (There was three or four months.) They said,    We   ll just let you go.     That   s how come they let me go in.  Did you have any friends at the time that joined at the same time?  No. No, I didn   t. I didn   t have any friends.  Where did you go to enlist?  San Diego, California.  How did you get there?  15  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  On a train. Well, part of the way, I got there hitchhiking. I hitchhiked all  over that western   all over California.  So, did you first sign up in Oklahoma?  Yes.  What town did you go to, to sign up?  I take that back. I went somewhere     You went to Oregon, didn   t you darlin   ?  It was Oregon, wasn   t it?  Right, you went there to work, worked in the ship yards.  Yes, I went there to work, and they didn   t have anything I really wanted  to work at. So, I joined an electrician on a shipyard and I worked, oh, a  month or two, and then they signed me on to the Marine Corps. They  shipped me back to San Diego.  So, were you pretty excited that you got to join the Marines?  Yes, yes. I thought it was all right. (Laughter) And it was. I liked the  people. But, boy, it got   them people   you wouldn   t believe what they  would pull on their people. They didn   t fool around. They meant   business . When you went to do something, you better do it, boy   Did you have any idea what you were getting into?  Not really. Not really. You know, I   d heard stories about it. I know they  killed people and everything, but I sure didn   t know they punished them  like they did and just done everything wrong.  How long was your training in San Diego?  I   m not sure.  Three months, wasn   t it, honey?  I think it was three months. I think it was three months. I went straight  from there to    Let   s see.  Was it Hawaii?  16  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Oh, yes. I went from there to Hawaii. Then I went through a company. I  went through the Sixth Marines.  Second Battalion, Sixth Marines , that  was the way it was.  How many were in your group? How many were you training with?  Let   s see. I think six hundred and something. I believe there was around  six hundred.  And then did all of you head to Hawaii at the same time?  Yes.  On a ship?  Yes.  Do you remember what the ship was called?  That I rode there on?  Yes.  No. I believe it was a battleship. Yes, they put us aboard a Higgins boat.  See, I made two landings on Saipan. I made one in the Higgins boat,  then I made the second landing on the motorized boat. They was up to  date, they was. You didn   t have to wade in the water out there to the  ground. You just got on that ramp and waited out there, jumped off on  dry ground. Yes, that was a lot easier. We didn   t have any problem until  it got night and they come alive. As soon as it got night, we was dug in,  but still got to come alive. We don   t know   we had some post-looking  logs there. That beach was real sandy, and they   d file along on that  beach. We got out in between them logs and dug that sand back and  made a bed. Well, in the night, they would just blast the heck out of that.  They   d hit them logs in the ground, just shake the ground. You just lay  there, like that. (Gestures) I thought,    Boy, I   ve a good  mind  to get out  of here and run off     But I got to thinking it over and I thought, well, I  better stay with this cover while I could. We stayed there three or four  days before we moved out.  And that was at Saipan?  Yes. Yes, well, see, we was on Saipan, but we was just on the beach.  The Japanese had a   there was a ridge of mountains up around it from  the beach where we went in. And as soon as it got dark, they   d run them  17  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  little guns made out of   it looked like a little train. But to carry  ammunition and artillery guns on that track   little narrow gauge tracks  is what they was. They had holes all in that mountain. As soon as it   d get  night, they   d start bombing that place, just blasted it.  The United States did.  So, I don   t know for sure. I think three or four days they moved us on  out. That   s when we went to the hills, and I stayed the rest of the time in  the hills. Now, I seen people jump over the cliffs, the Japanese soldiers  and the civilians, too. I seen them jump over the cliff, over hundred feet  falls.  The Japanese had told them, those people on that island, that the  Americans would just rape them and kill them. So, they chose to go up  on this cliff to just kill themselves. I   ve heard of that a lot.  Yes, I   d seen about fifty or sixty of them jump that morning, jump over  that cliff that morning. That was a pretty good ways from us, but you  could tell what they was doing. But then that night, after that, that night  is when I got hit. Let   s see. He killed the old boy in the fox hole with me  and the grenade hit me right in the shoulder. It went off and it just fell  halfway. It felt like it fell halfway to the ground and just blowed me out.  It didn   t hurt or anything. The only thing I could hear was a big roar and  a flash, like fire, just fire everywhere. I was hearing that buzzing. I heard  that buzzing for a year or two after that. (Laughter) Every time a little  noise, it   d just buzz and raise Cain.  So, where were you when that happened? Was that still on the beach?  No, no.  He was up in the mountains by this time.  No, we was clear across the island. See, we went across and went to the  southwest. I may be wrong on the direction, but I was pretty close to it. I  went back to   they carried me out of there. They put me on a jeep, and I  had a   I bled a lot.  They found him the next morning after the hand grenade had gone off.  Yes, they was going to leave me for dead.  They thought he was dead.  I couldn   t talk.  18  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  He couldn   t talk. He was batting his eyes.  But I could move my eyes. One of these Corpsmen checked me and said,     He   s dead.    Well, I tried to tell him I wasn   t. Trying to move my hands,  I couldn   t. I finally got my head turned to where I could blink my eyes.  He said,    Wait a minute  He   s still alive     They put me in a tourniquet. I  already had a tourniquet on my leg, but they put another one on there  and stopped it up pretty good. Got me back, they carried me up and  down them hills in one of them Jeeps and sat me down. Was so rough  that they sat me down and then  would  go on up to the top  with  that  Jeep and carry me up there. (Laughs) It took me all morning to get to the  field hospital. Then they just shipped me right on to the Naval Hospital  there in that airport. Ended up, I stayed there.  I know they had the grenade, the fuse, the fuse is about that big around  and about that long, and it was stuck into my knee. (Gestures) So, they  had to get it out before they could do anything with it. So, they got me  back to the hospital, and they gave me a piece of shingle, a board, told  me, said,    Bite down on it.    They already had me buckled down. They  said,    Bite down on it.    I argued with them. I   d get in trouble. (Laughs)  They   d give me just enough stuff to make me argue with them. So, I told  them, I said,    Hell, you   re not going to cut on me without doing  something     They said,    You just bite on that board, and we   ll do the  rest.    Well, they did. (Laughs) I thought they were going to kill me, but  they got it out.  They were out of sedation, whatever you would call it, they were out.  They used it all.  Yes, we didn   t have any anesthetic at all. They used it all up at   but that  healed up pretty good. But, boy, it come back alive later on when I tried  to walk on it. It come back alive, and they   ve taken at least a hundred  pieces of shrapnel out of me.  Out of your leg?  Yes, out of both legs, clear to my shoulder. They still work out of me.  Oh, it don   t bother me. It   ll be like a little ball will come up there, and  it   ll be dark in the middle, the center of it. It   ll just keep growing toward  the   it   ll get to itching. If I   m not careful, I   ll scratch that and break  that, and that piece of shrapnel will come out. If I don   t, I just fool  around and whenever it comes up there and hangs, won   t come loose,  I   ll have to go to the VA hospital and have them take it out. They keep  me there ten days to keep me from getting an infection they said.  19  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  They couldn   t take it all out because it would do more damage to take all  of it out than it would to leave it and let it work out gradually.  So, how long were you out of commission for that? How long were you  in the hospital?  Oh, a long time. Let   s see. I stayed there two or three weeks before they  put us on a hospital ship to bring us back to the Hawaiian Islands. Big  flood lights all on that hospital ship, right out there in that war zone.  They said,    Japanese said they don   t bomb hospital ships.    Well, hell,  they   d been bombing them all along. That scared the hell out of me  I  didn   t know. I didn   t get out there on them decks. I was on crutches, but  I didn   t get on the deck. A month from there, they done surgery two or  three times when they had to take some leaders and stuff out of my knee.  Then they done two more surgeries on that knee, below my knee. My leg  is off right here. We done two more surgeries on it, getting them leaders  uncrossed and straightened out to where it could handle them. Then I  went to the hospital in McKinney, Texas, the therapy hospital where  they shocked that knee and everything, trying to get them leaders to  work right.  Where did you land when they sent you back? San Francisco?  Oh, San Francisco.  Right. From San Francisco to Norman.  Oakland. Right out of Oakland.  Norman Naval Hospital.  Oh, yes. I about froze to death. I was just out of the Navy, didn   t have  any clothes. They give me   some of the Navy had given me some pants  and a jacket and a cap. Well, landed up there on one of them docks there  at San Francisco and that northeast wind was cold  Boy, it was just like  icicles  I was about to freeze, and they finally picked us up. They put me  in there, they sent me one of them water coolers. You know them  coolers that heat? Gave me a blanket and wrapped it around me. I got  warm and quit shaking.  Well, he only weighed about 118 pounds by then.  So, when I got in there, well, they wrapped that blanket around me and I  sat there and I thawed out. I never was cold like that anymore. I come  nearer to freezing to death than I ever did  (Laughs)  20  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Ward Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  How long were you on the hospital ship off of Hawaii?  At Hawaii?  Yes.  I on that Naval Hospital ship for   I   d have been on it since I was on  Saipan, and so that was for a month or so. I guess it   s probably closer to  two months because they don   t go very fast. They just wander around  out there and made a few more places, a few airports that had injured  people.  Was it that ship that came back to San Francisco? Did that ship take you  to San Francisco?  No.  Or were you transferred to another ship?  No, no.  It went to the Hawaiian Islands.  And then from there     Yes.  Yes, you were in the hospital in the Hawaiian Islands, right?  Yes, oh yes. I came back from the Hawaiian Islands on a ship.  Right. Then they sent him from Hawaii to San Francisco.  That was the roughest water I ever seen. They come in there and tying  me. I have a cast on my right leg. They come in there tying me to my  bunk. That was unhandy as hell because I would get   throw me against  them rails and bruise me up. If I   d have been loose, I could have kind of  went with the bed and it wouldn   t have banged me up so much. Finally,  my second day I got them up there to help me. That old boy, I went out  there and sat down, hadn   t been in the sunshine for damn near a year.  Here comes a Marine swimming through there. He just had his clothes  on. He didn   t even have his shorts or shirt. He had just his regular GI  clothes. Come through there swimming and hollering at people. He  come pretty close to me, and I spoke to him and I said,    Where are you  going?    He said,    I   m going home     Just kept going. So, another sailor  21  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  sitting over there on the bank, I told him,    That guy, something   s wrong.  You better get somebody to see after him.    He said,    He did act funny,  didn   t he?    And he did, he was leaving, and they found him. (Laughs)  Looked him down or run him down, probably locked him up where he  couldn   t run off. (Laughs) But he was getting out of that ship. He didn   t  want in there.  Did you make many friends?  Yes, I made a lot of friends. But really, they wasn   t really friends. They  was friends, but they wasn   t friends.  Did you stay in touch with any of them later?  No. Do you know what   s funny? I   ve never   there was two, three  people, three of my friends that I knew real well that was killed there,  over where I got that shrapnel, that grenade in the hole with me. There  was three killed and about two or three more beat up like I was. I never  knew what happened to them people, and I know two of them died. But  that   s the only ones I know that died. They changed hands so much  because a lot of them died. I used to have nightmares until it was  ridiculous  I still do occasionally, but not like I used to. I   d get out and  start working, and I couldn   t keep my mind on what I was doing. I  finally got to where I could say I was there. I wasn   t there. Before, I   d  always just feel like I was there when I was dreaming. But now, it seems  like I   m not quite there. Things is not happening like there was.  So, it seems a little bit more like a dream, now?  Yes. Yes, it don   t seem so real. Before, it   d bug me for a week  sometimes. Oh, I   d get up and run off the bed and hit people when I was  asleep. I never did hit Jean. I   m afraid she   d whip me  (Laughter)  I   ve awakened you several times over the years. It   d get so rough.  Hollering, you   d carry it home. I   d wake him, but I kept my distance.  (Laughter)  That   s smart. (Laughs)  My sister, she   s about twelve years younger than I am. When I first went  to the Marine Corps, I went by the folks    and spent the night with them.  We got out of boot camp, I went by the house. I was going to ship out  from there and go overseas. My sister was   it was Sue, Jean. She was  about seven or eight years old, and I was sleeping on a single bed in one  of the back rooms. She come through there running and just jumped on  top of me. I was asleep, and I don   t know when I   d slept last, but it was  22  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  after I got hurt. She jumped right in the middle of me. Well, I just hit her  with the ceiling, throwed her clear at the ceiling. I really bruised her up,  boy. Scared my folks   it scared me  I didn   t know what happened.  Mother said,    You throwed her up and hit the wall     I couldn   t  remember that, but I remember getting a hold of her. I guarantee you,  that stopped that fooling me when I was asleep.  I bet   Didn   t none of them kids fool around on me when I was asleep. Have  you ever heard that the Japanese used perfume?  No, I   d like to hear about that.  I was in contact with Japanese soldiers that used perfume. When they   d  get ready to go on a big Banzai Charge, drinking beer and using that  perfume and stuff    I got to where I could smell them things, oh, four or  five steps from me. When you get really among them, you can smell  them, just everywhere. You talk about upsetting you. That   ll upset you  because you know they   re in those weeds and bushes, but you can   t see  them.  Trees, in trees.  I don   t know, I never did   really, I never did know why they used  perfume.  It was a dead giveaway, wasn   t it? If they   re creep up on you, you could  smell them.  Yes.  That didn   t make sense, you   re right. (Laughter) It doesn   t. But it   s some  kind of ritual.  Yes, I   ve seen a lot of them that have been killed, and they still smell  like perfume.  It   s some kind of ritual before they go into battle.  What year was it when you enlisted?  What was it,    43 or    42?  I guess it was    42, wasn   t it?  23  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  Yes, it was    42.  Did any of your brothers go to the war?  Yes. Yes, one, two    One, two     The one next to him didn   t     Three of them, three of them went over there.  But then the next boy did.  All of them went but George.  One went in the navy.  No, Aubrey was in the army.  No.  No, no. Excuse me. Aubrey was in the navy. Jimmy is who I was trying  to think.  The younger boy was in the army.  Jimmy was in the army?  Yes, my youngest brother is about twelve years younger than I am. He   s  still living. And George, the one who is just a little more than a year  younger, he   s still living.  Next to him, didn   t.  Were your parents still farming at that point, when you went to World  War II?  No, no. My dad, he was just about retired. He had been injured, too, in  World War I. He drawed from disability and then, oh, he   d usually work  like blacksmithing and stuff like that. But I still, every once in a while,  I   ll have a damn dreaming spell like that and it   ll just bug the hell out of  me. Then, it may not bother me anymore for six or seven months. I   m  glad it didn   t because it used to be pretty regular.  Oh, yes. Two or three times a week.  How did you stay in touch with your family while you were gone? Did  24  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  Jess Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jess Prater  W. Prater  Jess Prater  W. Prater  Jess Prater  W. Prater  Jess Prater  W. Prater  you write them letters?  I wrote my mother letters. She   s the only one who got any letters from  me. (Laughs) Yes, I tried to write her.  And his sister was real good with communicating with him.  Yes, she   s     Your older sister?  Yes.  So, when were you injured? What was the date or the year?  Same year he went in.  Yes, you were only there like five weeks, weren   t you, Dad?  Okay.  Yes.  You were injured twice, though. You got shot through the leg once,  right?  Yes.  That was somewhere else.  No, I was shot through both legs. As they say, gunshots in both legs,  both ankles.  Okay.  Then they called that other shrapnel, the hand grenade deal. But I don   t  know, some part of that might have been from hand grenades, too. Well,  I know there was.  You were talking about   you were a runner. And they were having you  run back, and you stopped, and you were bleeding, and somebody had  shot you through the leg with a pistol or something. Do you remember  when they said that the   you asked them if you got to go home for this.  He goes,    No, we   ll have you back on the frontline in two weeks.     Yes. (Laughs)  25  Jess Prater  W. Prater  Jess Prater  W. Prater  Jess Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jess Prater  W. Prater  Jess Prater  W. Prater  Jess Prater  W. Prater  Jess Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  They took a rifle ramrod, put merthiolate on it and ran through that hole.  That   s how they treated it, right?  Yes.  Now, that wasn   t the same spot, was it, Dad?  No.  Where was that?  Well, that was     While he was a runner? He was promoted to Corporal during that time.  I was promoted to Corporal. When I got shot was when I had that   was  a rifle.  Oh, it was a rifle.  The Japanese shot me there because I was down, and they was up there.  They didn   t know which holes the other guys were in. They dug the  holes I came out of, but I wasn   t fixing to go back in there because I  know they went and    I know that they was liable to just walk up there  and start shooting in that hole. That   s the way they do. I had a problem  with dreaming and couldn   t remember   I couldn   t get straight of it, and  that bothered me a lot.  You were on another island besides Saipan when you were fighting over  there, right?  Yes, I was on     Johnson?  No, not Johnson. I don   t   oh, I take that back. I went over to a Johnson  Island as a   well, when select four or five people to go look an area  over, well, I was in one of them.  Scout, okay.  I decided that was a good place to get shot, out there prowling around in  them bushes.  So, you started out in Hawaii? After San Diego, you went to Hawaii for  26  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  just a little bit?  Yes.  Yes. The ships left from Hawaii to take them to those islands.  They sent you to Hawaii. Then you shipped out from Hawaii to those  islands.  Yes, that   s right. I had the flu when I left San Diego, so they took me up  from Hawaii to the hospital. We went to Johnson Islands by plane, by  small plane. We took me from there to Gilbert Island. But most of the  islands, a lot of them had already been captured. But I come back that  same route when I come back. When they took us off there, they had a  hospital ship to come and get us   or a carrier come and get us and carry  us back to the hospital. The one down at the   not the one up in the hills,  the one that   s down by the coast. They kept me there. I never will forget  how I   ve seen them doctors try to doctor them guys, and they   d bite  them and everything else. (Laughs)  One time, on about   I was second or third bed up from this old boy, and  he was as wild as he could be, biting people and everything. I guess one  of them Corpsmen was trying to get him dressed, they was going to put  him in the nut ward. They was trying to get him dressed and somehow  he got his thumb in his mouth, about like this, and just locked up on him.  (Gestures) They had to pry him loose, get him loose. They got him  loose, and they put a piece of metal around him. They called it a brace,  but he couldn   t get loose from it. He couldn   t get his mouth open or  anything until he got calmed down. (Laughs) I guess he probably wasn   t  completely crazy, he   d just have spells. That   s what a lot of them do,  just have crazy spells. Boy, that doctor stood up there on one foot and  had an opening at the top of that tent, said,    Get him loose  Get him  loose from my thumb     (Laughter)  I bet  Was life on a ship much different from life back at home?  No, not really. A lot of times when it was hot weather, I slept out on the  deck. But I   ll tell you what happened. We was close to that barrier on  the straights where that real deep water is. We was in that somewhere so  that we was going to Saipan, that   s where we was going. It was two or  three days until we was going to land, but that   s where we was going to.  Me and the old boys were laying out there. I just took my wool blanket,  throwed it down there on that steel deck. Sleeping is cooler up there. He  was just over, laying over there. He said,    I got the best hold here,     because we was right out and that sea was pretty rough. I told him, I  said,    Well, I   m not going to turn this loose. I   m holding this rail here.     27  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  About that time, a siren goes off, and about two or three Zero   s come up  that channel. They just strafed the heck out of them. They bombed them.  They strafed that ship I was on, a bomb hit it, but a whole bunch of rifle  fire hit it. Boy, you talk about getting that cover  You was back under  that   I was glad to get back down under that. (Laughs)  What are Zero   s?  Oh, that was a fighter. That was their fighter plane. That was their little  Zero   s. That was the little suicide plane, a lot of it was.  Was there a cool breeze at night?  No, but it was comfortable. It wasn   t really cold, but it wasn   t hot either.  But when it was storming, it   d get cold sometimes. I   ve seen it sleet, just  sleet like heck on top of them  But we just stacked in there. When the  water was so rough, so we had to lay on them bunks, reach under here  and catch them underneath the bed and hold you on. If you got throwed  loose from that, you just had to grab something else. Boy, I   ve been  bruised up from getting run over and stuff. But I was going to tell you,  that night they was strafing us, I lost one of my boots, my left boot. I just  had them   I had my socks on, but I just had my boots on. I had a hold of  one of them. I thought I had them both. When I got down at the bottom  of that ship, I had one boot. (Laughs) We was fixing to land on that  island there, so they was hunting for me a coat and finally, they found  me some navy dress shoes, and that   s what I wore. (Laughs)  Did you have much entertainment, ever?  Oh, yes. We had shows, and we had big shows a certain night a week.  That   s when we was on transport, and on battleships, we had shows on  them. So, it was pretty common. We also had funerals on that ship, too. I  wound up in several of them. But, boy, I   ll tell you, it didn   t really  bother me. I wasn   t spooked over them people. I   ll see them Japanese  dead, and it didn   t do anything to me. But I seen our people dead, it kind  of   it did something to me. But not them Japanese, because I knowed  what they   d do to you. I   d seen them. I   d seen them up there in the  mountains. I seen them have four or five Marines. It was about six or  eight Japanese. They had these Marines captured, and they tortured them  and killed them. All you can do is turn your head because you couldn   t  keep from looking at them. So, I know if I just started shooting, they   d  just start shooting back. So, I   d just get up and walk off.  Did you use different types of weapons, or did you have a specific one?  Well, I used an M1 Garand. That was the weapon I took. That was the  28  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  regular, and it had a BAR  Browning Automatic Rifle , too, which I   ve  also used. And they   ve had a carbine, which I   ve used. I used that  carbine mostly when I was a runner. I used it sometimes when I just had  my regular old M1 Garand, which is as heavy as a steel pipe. The M1,  ammunition and all, is a lot heavier than that. But the only thing with  them, you had to be careful about shooting. Open fire with that  M1Garand, them Japanese would really get after you. They   d try to wipe  you out because them automatic weapons killed a lot of Japanese. When  I was in the hospital there, the Seabees were just across the fence from  us.  What was?  Seabees. They   re a branch of the Navy that was the work crew of the  Navy. They come over there, and these two was in the hospital there.  They had them wired off, but somebody would pry the wires for  somebody. I imagine it was the Seabees. I   d went with them on a beer  party. We   d drive way up in the mountains and stuff like that and drink  that beer and eat sardines and stuff like that, just parties. (Laughs) But I  was   I weighed a 116 pounds. That   s after I got hit, see.  How much did you weigh when you went in?  About 175.  Wow.  I weighed 116 pounds, and they   d come over there and get me to go on a  beer party. They called me Skinny. He said,    Hell, Skinny, that   ll make  you get fat  Eat some of them sardines and drink some of that beer and  eat crackers.    And so I said,    Well, I   ll eat it. Might as well try it,  anyhow.    But they caught me. One day I was in line and a Navy officer,  I don   t know what rank officer he was. I don   t really remember their  names. He came up there to me and said,    Are you getting enough to eat  here?    I said,    Yes.    He said,    Well, how often do you come here?    I  said,    They told me to come here any time I wanted to.    He said,    And  also       He got out a piece of paper and wrote on there that I can get  anything I wanted in there to eat as long as I wanted to. So, I thanked  him and put it in my pocket. I   d eat ice cream and cake. (Laughter) But I  never did gain any weight back. It was a year or so gaining that weight  back after I   d come back. I spent    Jean, do you remember how long I  spent up here at Norman?  Was it nine months?  Something like that. They was still treating me.  29  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Yes, they did surgery on you. Well, you   d been there about six months  when I met you, and then they did some surgery on you after that  because I went to see you at the hospital.  Yes, it was a long time there, I spent.  Did you get to go to the Norman Hospital because it was in Oklahoma?  No, no, it was a Naval Base.  No, what they tried to do is tried to send the wounded to a hospital near  their home, so they could go home and visit. See, my folks live in  Broken Bow. It was a long ways down there.  Yes.  I never did   I went a few times, but not many. But boy, I was glad to  get out of that place. I   d been up there and had my   when I was  overseas   now, why they shipped this stuff, I don   t know, but my  bedding, my clothing, my footlocker, and everything was shipped out of  the Hawaiian Islands. Well, they sunk. The ship that they was on, it  sunk. Do you know it was nine months after that before I ever got a  paycheck? I got a lot of play. I got what the Navy had that I could wear.  That   s what I wore  (Laughter)  So, did you meet your wife while you were in the hospital?  Yes. You worked for Western Union at that time.  How did you meet her?  I was working for Western Union     Yes, I needed some money. I had to get     And he just said that he hadn   t been paid and his folks would send him a  little money along for expenses, cigarettes, or just when you went to  town. That   s how they sent it, by Western Union.  Well, the Red Cross gave me cigarettes and stuff like that. As far as   I  got the cigarettes to smoke and     But that   s how I met him. I worked for Western Union at that time.  Everybody did our bit in World War II. We tried to.  30  Wilson  Jean Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  So, had you been working for Western Union very long?  Not a long time. Years, I don   t remember how long. But at that time,  they had a school in Springfield, Missouri. They advertised for girls to  come and go to their school, and then they sent them where they needed  them. They needed them in Norman, believe me, that   s where I went. I  lived in Ada and went from here to Springfield, Missouri. Then they sent  me back to Norman, and that   s where I met him. I don   t know why or  how. I mean, he came in and got his check, probably be five to ten  dollars. He did that several times, and we got to talking. I don   t know  why, I saw a bunch of them  I saw a bunch of them  (Laughter)  So, did you go on a date?  Yes.  Yes.  I don   t know how long after we met, but by that time, we knew each  other. (Laughs) He was in every couple weeks or so for quite a while.  And then when did you wind up getting married?  Three years later. I wasn   t but seventeen, and he was only nineteen at  that time, when we met.  Yes, we   ve been married a long time. (Laughter) Sixty-four   is it sixty  four years?  Will be this year.  So, what year did you get married?     48.  Yes.  Yes, when we met, we weren   t old enough to get married.  Once you got out of the hospital, what did you do?  He went home.  Where did you go?  Went home.  31  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Back to Broken Bow?  Yes, but nothing there was right. I didn   t stay there. I just prowled  around, mostly.  And I remained in Norman.  I drove a taxi cab.  In Broken Bow?  Yes.  Were there many taxi cabs in Broken Bow?  Yes, at that time there was three. I was one of the three, wasn   t many.  (Laughs) That ol    guy, he didn   t like to be taken   I knowed quite a few  of them people, and I got a lot of his customers. He didn   t like that. He  threatened me. I had my gun down under the cab. I wasn   t scared of  anybody  (Laughs) He wasn   t going to fool with me.  Where did you go after you left Broken Bow?  He stayed in Broken Bow for a long time. He and I got together three or  four years later, and we went to Dallas, and he went back to school.  Yes. Yes, that was   I   ve even forgot where we got married. (Laughs)  Oh, you just tell me that   It   s been a long time, I tell you.  You just tell me that  He still likes to aggravate me. (Laughter) He keeps  me alive that way. When I get mopey, he   ll pull something like that.  Where did you get married?  In Dallas. Dallas, Texas.  Did you live there very long?  Yes, three years, didn   t we?  Yes.  32  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jess Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Well, he was in school, see, in Texas Trade School for, I don   t know,  nearly that long?  Oh, yes, I was on crutches half the time.  He was not    What would you call it? He couldn   t work. People  wouldn   t hire him. You talk about prejudice or whatever. That   s not the  right word, but he would get a chance for a job, and they   d find out that  he had an injury. They   d say,    Oh, our insurance wouldn   t cover that.     Yes. Oh, yes.  So, he wouldn   t get the job. He had no choice but to go back to school.  Especially when they amputated my leg.  Instead of going to college, he opted to take trade school.  They amputated it three times. Started out at my ankle and amputated it  three times. I had osteomyelitis, that mold infection.  So, did you get a disability check or anything?  Yes, they paid me disability and paid me pretty good. To start with, I  was drawing 60 percent. Then somewhere along the line, they raised it  to 80 and then when I decided working, they raised it to 100 percent. But  they won   t even see that I get a ramp out here.  They won   t?  Well, they say I   ve got four or five estimates and taken pictures of it,  and it still has been three months. I still haven   t got it.  That   s just the way it works. That   s the way they work with things. I bet  you get it, Dad, eventually, but you don   t get it quick.  Takes a while.  See, I belong to the DAV  Disabled American Veterans . I   m a life  member of that DAV. Long before I quit working, I belonged to them  and went to their    And so, I paid, I think,  175. Yes,  175 for a life  member. Well, about two years after that, they dropped that DAV out of  Ada because they couldn   t keep enough people to keep it going. Sulphur  down here is the closest place. So, I   m going to   they was supposed to  call me every day or two, and they always say the same, that they don   t  know if they   ll approve them or not.  33  Jean Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  Did he tell you he was in business for twenty-five years here?  We haven   t got to that yet. Did you move to Ada after Dallas?  Yes. Yes, we moved to Ada. We bought a house and moved here.  So, what was your business?  Watch repair.  Watch repair and gun repair.  That   s what his business was.  What was it called?  Just Watch Repair.  Ada Loan.  I mostly done gun work at home. I done the watch     What he did, he bought a loan. He worked for a man as a watch  repairman. After five years, he moved on, and he got a family   s business  for sale. It was called Ada Loan, and he bought it and put in his watch  repair.  I worked there twenty-six years, yes.  But in the meantime, he picked up gun repair. He taught himself, right?  No, I already knowed how to     Well, yes, he knew that, but   well, you tell it. I can   t. (Laughter)  I just tried to do that work at home at night, and I   d just take them.  They   d come to my house at night and pick them guns up that I   d repair.  They   d wait until the day before deer season and then just rush me.  Until Jean put her foot down  He didn   t look it, but I did.  I just started writing it down when they   d bring them in, and I gave them  plenty of time to get that for a season.  Was that a pretty good business, though?  34  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Yes.  Yes, it was, but it wasn   t really big enough for our gunsmith.  It was a business. The kind of business he was in was very stressful. I  mean, like he started to tell you, until I interrupted, I beg your pardon,  gunsmith, he was probably one of the best gunsmiths in the state of  Oklahoma. And they didn   t have very many of those gunsmiths. Those  hunters will bring in their gun two days before hunting season and want  it the next day. He didn   t talk back to them. (Laughs) It got real stressful  for him.  So, did you work on guns for twenty-six years?  Yes  That was part of making the living.  My daddy was a gunsmith.  Gun repair and watch repair.  They also had a blacksmith shop, and that   s where I learned most of my  stuff.  And what he didn   t know, he learned it from books, gunsmith books. He  ordered   like he would order a book from a gun company. A lot of his  work was simply putting a gun back together after someone had taken it  apart and couldn   t get it back.  After you retired from your business, did you keep working on guns,  also?  Yes, I did.  No, he gave all that up. He went into ranching. Oh, gosh   Yes, I tried it a while, and then it got worse.  Oh, yes, that   s right. You worked out of the house for a while.  Yes. Yes, working out of your house is bad. Get up at eleven o   clock at  night and want to get their gun to go hunting. So, I quit that.  Then what did you get into?  Nothing, nothing. Oh, I still occasionally will repair a gun.  35  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Wilson  Jess Prater  Ward, you went into ranching, don   t you remember?  Yes.  I don   t forget. After he retired and was at home, he had to have some  rest downtime after about twenty-six years. He had to have some  downtime. He had bought some acreage. In those days land was cheap,  and he bought some acreage east of Ada, and he decided to go into  ranching.  Yes, I went and I run forty, thirty-five head of cattle is all I run. I didn   t  have that much land. I just had 160 acres of land. I done that until I  started seeing the light, couldn   t get people to help you work. Like if I  was going to     Cattle were so cheap.  Yes. People would tell you,    I   ll be right out there by eight o   clock.    I   d  see them a week or so later. (Laughter)  That   s hard work  Who   d want to do that kind of work, anyway?  How many kids do you have?  Oh, kids? Three.  We have twins.  We have twin boys, Jess is one of them.  This is one of the twins.  And then we have a daughter younger than they are. That   s all we have.  So, you   ve lived in Ada for quite a while now.  Since    51.  Yes, that   s the only place I know to say home anymore, is Ada. (Laughs)  But, boy, it   s been hard on me the last few years, making all them trips  to Oklahoma City. I   ve had something wrong with me the last five years.  And that   s quite a little trip.  It   s a VA hospital up there is what     36  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jess Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Jess Prater  Well, he always has had something, ups and downs. He couldn   t go  locally to a doctor. He had had so much   he got some of the first  penicillin. He was one of the guinea pigs for penicillin. He   d had so  much of that stuff, if he got something happened to him, he   d get  infections in his arm. The shrapnel would get in a place and cause an  infection, and he couldn   t use that arm. Well, he   d go to a local doctor,  and they   d give him a little dose of penicillin. It wouldn   t even faze him   He tried to tell them,    I   ve had so much of that, it takes a lot.    They  wouldn   t listen, of course, and he had to wind up going to the city before  he could get straightened out. I wasn   t any good at running his shop. I  tried, but that   s what we did for years while he was in business. And  they kept them. They did not want them going back and forth to the  hospitals, so they   d keep him a week or so. And Ward couldn   t be off  work that long  So, his trips were very infrequent.  Well, what does Oklahoma mean to you?  Well, its home. Yes, I don   t know any other place I   d like to be.  To live. We   re both restless, but we didn   t know any other place we  liked any better or as well.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  Well, I don   t know. I   m glad it   s over with, that   s all I know. I hope we  don   t get any more deals like we was in.  You   re talking about war.  Yes.  Well, we   ve had wars ever since then, one right after the other.  Yes.  Right after World War I, or not right after, they had this compact where  they would not let Communists spread. Truman sent troops to Vietnam,  they stayed there twenty years. And of course, the Cold War with  Russia, which lasted, what, twenty years or longer? It   s just something  all the time, just wars all the time, one right after the other. Korean War,  that was Communism. The Vietnam War...  War is not the only thing that defines you, though. I mean, you   re an  Oklahoman first, right?  37  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Jess Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Jean Prater  W. Prater  Jean Prater  Wilson  Jean Prater  Wilson  Yes.  Yes.  War is just a part of it. That   s a part of your life.  Yes. His duty.  Are there any lessons that you learned from your parents that you   ve  carried through life?  Yes, but I can   t think of them.  Maybe hard work?  We had to learn to work, and there wasn   t any way around it. We had to  do it. (Laughs)  He   s frugal. He always planned     Are you careful with your money?  I try to be.  We always had to be, and we always had money for emergencies. Or if  they come up, we always had money. He was a good provider.  I had a fear of being broke. I feel better if I   ve got enough money to get  me out of a bind.  Well, we were brought up, you   re supposed to live that way. You didn   t  spend every dime you had. You always kept some in reserve for  emergencies, nothing else   And that   s quite a bit different than some people today.  Oh, very, very. All we wanted was to buy our home, and we did. That   s  one of the first   we were married about three years or so when we  bought our first home. We came back from the wars wanting to own  their own home. Most of us were sharecroppers. We did not own our  farms. But now, most of the people came back from World War II with  the intention of buying their own home. Ownership was important to us.  Are there any more stories you can think of or memories about your time  during the war or your childhood or later that you   d like to talk about?  38  W. Prater  Jess Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  Wilson  W. Prater  No.  I bet he   ll think of them later. He acts tired to me. (Laughter)  Yes.  I feel proud of what I   ve accomplished.  Well, you should.  They   re kind of horsing me around on that wheelchair deal. But they   re  not going to beat me because I   m going to keep on until I get that  wheelchair  ramp . Straighten up, and I have to get someone to drive me.  I can   t see when I have to drive. So, I   m going to get my niece to go to  Sulphur and talk to that guy down there. If he don   t know, I   m going to  take it back to Oklahoma City. They wanted me to take it there. I  thought that would have been a better place up there to take it. But that  place is a big kid   s house, crowded place up there.  Well, I want to thank you for your service to our country. And also, I  hope you have a great rest of your birthday.  Yes.  Thank you for talking with me.  Well, I thank you for interviewing me. I wish I could have remembered  better, but     -------  -------
