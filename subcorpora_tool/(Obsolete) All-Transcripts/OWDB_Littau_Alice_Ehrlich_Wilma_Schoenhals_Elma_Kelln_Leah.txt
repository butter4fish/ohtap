 Lemons  We are at the Shattuck Senior Center in Shattuck, Oklahoma on the 25th day of  January 2001, 3:00 in the afternoon. We   re doing an oral history this  afternoon on women who lived during the dustbowl. What I   ll have each of you  do so we can stay kind of organized and remember who   s talking is before we  get started in the conversation have each of you, staring with you, one by one  go around and state your name, when you were born, and where.  I   m Alice Littau. I was born May 5, 1917, right here in Shattuck.  I am Wilma Ehrlich. I was born February 15, 1918 in Ellis County, Oklahoma.  I   m Elma Schoenhals. I was born 8.5 miles south of Shattuck.  In what year, you want to tell us?  Yeah, May the 7th, 1917.  Okay and one more.  I   m Leah Kelln. I was born in 1911 in November the 10th, and I was born in  Fargo, Oklahoma.  Where is that? I don   t know where that is.  We just passed it.  It   s east of here; there   s Gage, and then there   s Fargo, before you get to  Woodward.  Oh, okay. Well this is to get us started. Basically this is just you talking and me  asking a question now and again. We   ll start with, did all of you grow up in a  rural area or would you consider it more like you lived in town?  I grew up in a rural area.  And how about you?  5  Littau  Lemons  Littau  Lemons  Schoenhals  Lemons  Kelln  Lemons  Ehrlich  Lemons  Ehrlich  Lemons  Littau  I was born and grew up, until I was probably about ten or eleven, and then my  parents moved to town.  Okay.  Yeah, and then I was more or less a town girl.  How about the two of you?  I was born in a rural area and lived out in the country until 1935, when I  started work.  Okay, and you?  I lived in the country at the time when we had the dust storms, but I   m living  in town here now.  Well, since it is kind of evenly distributed, experiences in town and a rural  area, we   ll start with the town people first. How would you describe a typical  day in the 1930   s? What was it like? You get up in the morning and what  would you have to do on a daily basis?  Well, at that time I was 16 or 17 years old, so I was still a schoolgirl. My  typical day was to get up and go to school on most days. The day might have  started in pretty good during the day, and then by late afternoon the wind came  up. The dust would be filtering in, and at times it was pretty hard to keep it out  of the home. The windowsills and furniture and the different things would be  covered in dust. I remember we had moved to town, and we had a new home  to move in. I still remember that they took some of this   I think, it   s what you  would call masking tape now   and went around the windows to try to keep  the air and the dust out.  Did it work?  Well it might have helped, but it didn   t always keep it out. I don   t think we  knew from day to day what kind of weather we would have. I depended on the  wind and how much dirt it would pick up.  You   re nodding your head. Did you have similar experience?  Well, of course, I went to school out in the country and we had to walk, oh  about two miles, and my grandpa and grandma lived in between. We all just  stopped there before we would even go to school or go back home. And there  was a little pond there and a pasture, and we   d always stop there and skate  when it had ice. Of course, there wasn   t any dust really when I started to  school. It was maybe years after. Oh, I think I might have been about 17 or 18  or something like that, and that   s where the dust, like she said, it   d come in. I  don   t know how, but we   d clean the house on Saturday nights and think,    Boy  we   d got everything clean,    and here she comes again   6  Lemons  Littau  Lemons  Littau  Lemons  Schoenhals  Lemons  Schoenhals  Littau  Schoenhals  So was Saturday the usual cleaning day then?  Usually, yeah it was at our house.  So what was the routine for Saturday cleaning day?  You   d just dust everything and wax. We   d wash the cabinet I think every  week. Of course, we tried tape, like Wilma said, to kind of keep some of it out.  What about the two of you?  Well, now I was raised in the country and our routine in the morning was to  get up and help with the milking and the other chores. Before we went to  school, a lot of times we milked the eight to ten cows and had to do the  separating; then we   d go in and have breakfast and rush off to school. We had  to walk about a mile and a half, in fact Alice and I started to the same school  (Laughs) for how many years? About two or three.  Did you guys know each other then?  Yes.  Yes  A lot of times, like Alice said, there was a pond, but their   s was on the other  side, our   s was on the west side, and we   d go skating on that. I   ll never forget,  we walked home   they were older than I was, Bill and Mark, and they said,     You   re the youngest and the smallest, so you get on and see if we can skate  across that.    (Laughs) Then I got on it, and it broke down, and I was in the  water this deep. We were about a half a mile from home, so we went home.  My folks weren   t even at home. I changed clothes and thought, well I   ll go  with my Uncle Dino. He was really my uncle but he was just three years older  than I was. He said,    Will you go with us?    because I spent a lot of time with  my grandparents when I was growing up, well til I was about six, til I could  work (Laughs) and had to stay at home.  In the late 20s, and I think the early 30s, is when the dust storms came. At that  time, I was going to high school at Shattuck. I had to catch the bus, and a lot  of times, at night, my folks wouldn   t, if it was nice enough, walk at all; I had  to walk home about two miles, and I walked about a mile. I had an aunt living  and I   d always stop there, and she   d have cookies or something for me to eat.  Then I   d go walk the other mile, and then I had to walk about another half a  mile to take the cattle home to milk, took them home, and then we   d do the  chores. Mother was very particular. There was a crack you could almost put  your finger in. We don   t have that now. Mother would stick rags in there and  put sheets in front of the windows, because the dust would come in. You  couldn   t see the color of the linoleum in front of the door. We never thought  too much about it, I don   t think. If the dust would get in, it was dusty, but we  got so used to it or something; I can   t remember that we   d complain.  7  Lemons  Schoenhals  Lemons  Littau  Kelln  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Kelln  Schoenhals  Do you remember the first time you experienced a dust storm? What was that  like? Were you scared of it?  Well I   ll tell you, the only time that I really remember that I was scared was  that dark Sunday. Maybe you   ve heard of that.  Yeah.  That was Easter Sunday, Black Sunday, yeah.  Yeah.  I   ll never forget, because we had baby chickens at the time. It was such a nice  morning. It was a bright sun-shiny morning, and Mother said,    I   m gonna  carry those baby chickens out in the pen,    and she did. We were in the house,  and Mother went out and said,    Oh my, we   d better get the chickens in.    In  north, it just looked dark; it was real dark. It was coming, and by the time we  got that done it wasn   t very long before the storm hit. That came so fast. It  rolled in like smoke almost. It didn   t blow, you know.  There wasn   t that much wind. There was probably some wind but not a lot of  wind.  It was so full of dust. Some said that the dust came from Colorado and  Kansas, but I really don   t know. It was such a black dust. After we got the  chickens in, Mother said,    Let   s go to the cellar.    We went to the cellar, and  before we got there, well, we were going down, and she closed the cellar door,  and it was just black. You couldn   t even see your hand in front of your face.  So we went to the cellar, and I think mother had an old lantern down there, and  she lit it. You could hardly even see, and the cellar wasn   t from here to here,  maybe just a few feet, but the air was so full of dust the light wouldn   t even  penetrate through.  It was scary. I thought it was the last day of the world.  Well that   s what a lot of them thought. In fact, we had a neighbor that said that  he thought that was the end of the world. It scared the people. Now I did not  see this, but several people said there were birds that hit them. Now I did not  see that, but the neighbor said there were birds flying ahead of that storm. My  Dad, he was out on the road, and he didn   t make it home. He just stayed in the  car, in that old pickup he had. He said,    You just felt like you were going to  choke.    That dust was just so you could hardly breathe. After it got lighter,  we decided we   d come out. I don   t know how long that took. It seemed to me  like an hour, but I don   t think it was that long. Anyway, we came out and  Mother looked around. It was still pretty dark, and she said,    Oh, look at the  old hens,    and they were all dead, laying in the yard on their sides. She went  and picked one up and said,    No they   re alive; lets put them in the chicken  house,    so we picked those chickens up and carried them in the chicken house,  and they were just as full of dust.  8  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Lemons  Schoenhals  Kelln  Schoenhals  Kelln  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Lemons  Schoenhals  Littau  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Lemons  Ehrlich  It must have been the atmospheric pressure or something that  I think it was that dirt in their eyes, and it was terrible.  Do you remember any other kind of signs from animals that something was  coming?  I don   t remember too much about that.  Oh before that black one came you mean? Well we weren   t home at the time,  before it started, so I don   t know. I know the chickens went in the chicken  house after it got dark and didn   t come out until it got daylight again.  Well our   s were lying around, some of them outside.  But it was bad.  We didn   t have time, I don   t think, to look at the animals. It came so quick  you know.  Ours didn   t give us that much time to prepare. I remember now, how I became  aware of this rolling cloud coming in. I had a little brother that was out  playing with a neighbor boy. I knew I had to locate him and get him in, get  him home. I would call and holler, and at first he wouldn   t answer. I guess he  didn   t realize that this was urgent. Anyway, he finally answered, and I just got  him home just very shortly before this whole dirt cloud rolled in.  Did you have any experiences with family members or people that you knew  getting lost in a dust storm?  No.  No.  Now we had dust pneumonia, and towels were hung up and they fixed a room.  I know our neighbor, their daughter had dust pneumonia. They just hung  sheets and fixed a little room up. I don   t know, the people at that time were so  poor. They didn   t have the money, I guess, to stay in the hospital. I don   t  know why they didn   t stay.  Well I know of some people that lived by Beaver, and their child kept taking  dust pneumonia. They finally went over to Missouri and located there, just to  get that child out of the dust.  So they would leave in order to protect their child.  So they would leave. Yes, a lot of people that probably couldn   t make a living  on their farms anymore, I guess. Do you know about the Grapes of Wrath,  which I don   t think portrays everything just right, but that   s not for me to  9  Lemons  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Littau  Lemons  Littau  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Lemons  Schoenhals  Kelln  Littau  Ehrlich  Kelln  Schoenhals  Lemons  judge. I know some people who went to Colorado and some people went to  California.  Did people that you knew personally friends or family leave?  Yeah, I had one sister that went out to California. I don   t know what year that  was, they went out to California, and the other sister went to Colorado. I guess  some of the younger ones just thought they   d do better someplace else. It was  pretty desperate and desolate around here. The sand would drift up and maybe  cover up the posts and maybe some machinery too. You may have noticed  some of those pictures where the sand would drift and cover up some of the  machinery.  I know it was at least that high under the fence. It   d come up to the first fence  roll, some of it, especially when there was plowed ground.  But I guess it still wasn   t as bad here as it was like out at Dalhart, Texas. I  guess it was terrible out there. I think the dust covered the fence posts out  there.  That   s hard to imagine when you try to picture it now.  I know it.  You tell the younger kids, the grandkids, about this, and they can   t imagine.  Well, I just don   t remember exactly what years some of my sisters left, but I   m  sure that one was married, and her husband moved out to Colorado to try to do  better.  Why do you think that you and your families stayed?  No money. The Depression was on too. There wasn   t nowhere to go.  (Laughter)  We had to stay here and make the best of it. It was our home   It was our home.  The farmers were quite self-contained. They had cows for milk and chickens  for eggs, and they had their cream, so they were pretty well able to, if they had  cows and things like that.  But when those that had too many cattle didn   t have feed, the government  came and killed the cattle and paid them.  Yep, paid  8 and  10 for a cow, I think.  What was the Shattuck community   s reaction to that? What was the reaction  10  Kelln  Schoenhals  Kelln  Littau  Kelln  Lemons  Kelln  Schoenhals  Kelln  Littau  Schoenhals  Kelln  Littau  Lemons  Kelln  Schoenhals  to that here of killing the cattle?  Well, there was nothing they could do. There was no feed to feed them.  And the cows would starve.  Of course we didn   t have very many. We just started out farming and didn   t  have any of ours killed. We just had two or three milk cows, and we had a few  horses. We still farmed with horses at the time. We just did what we could to  get by.  Milking cows was our living. Eggs were too.  We had two children, one was five and the other was one year old. It was hard  to keep the diapers washed and dried. (Laughs)  I bet. Tell me about doing laundry. Not necessarily because it   s during the  dust bowl, just in general, if you don   t have electricity. How are you doing  laundry? What is the process of that?  We didn   t have diapers that we could buy. We just had to make them ourselves  out of material. We had to wash them and use them and wash them again.  On a washboard.  Well at that time, I already had a washing machine with a gas motor, but one  day the sun was shining, and you made sure you washed and hung it out, and  the next day the storm came in again. It was just changing off to where if  you   d came out one day it was nice and the next day it came on again. We had  a house that the dust came in from the top and from the bottom. We had  rented that place. It didn   t have a foundation. It just had rocks for foundation.  The ceiling was made of those wood boards.  Ceiling boards.  Ceiling boards.  They had cracks, and when the storm was blowing, it came in from the top  (Laughter), and the floor had cracks too, so it lifted up the linoleum.  There was no carpet.  Which might have been a good thing, actually.  We tried to make do with what we had, and I   m still doing it.  You know, the people who had rugs or carpeting, they weren   t fastened down.  They were just lying there, and they were taken out and hung on the line, and  we   d beat the dust out with a broomstick or something.  11  Kelln  Lemons  Schoenhals  Kelln  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Lemons  Schoenhals  Kelln  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Then the windows, like the ladies were saying, we   d take rags and stick them  in the cracks around the windows and the windowpane, and then put sheets or  blankets over it while the dust was blowing. Then we had a one year old and I  always had to put a sheet over his baby bed. That wasn   t very big, but it kept  out the dust so he could breathe without breathing in all that dust. That was a  lot of fun.  It sounds like a real blast.  Well, when we had a nice day, we   d almost work ourselves to death.  We   d just work. We didn   t have to worry about, the next dust storm coming in.  I knew what was coming.  I guess we had droughts along with the dust, kind of like what we had this past  summer. It didn   t rain for how long, two months?  Yeah but that wasn   t anything.  Yeah, but if that would have been prolonged for very long, everything would  have burned up. I don   t know, you need that rain thing to make things grow.  I think that Rubin said it was around    37 and    38. He   my husband   knows  more about this than I do. (Laughs) It rained, and that   s when the people think  that the prices kind of stabilized. See, the wheat was down to 25 and 35 cent  bushels, I think.  Cents, 25 cents.  25 cents a bushel. The way we made our living, there were three girls in the  family, and every week, it was usually on Fridays, we   d bring the cream and  eggs we got to count and bought gas and the necessities. With what was left,  we bought groceries and such. But we did our own butchering. We had all of  our own meat, and we had to can that at that time. There was no ice or  refrigerator.  Yeah, how do you can meat? Now what is the process that goes into that?  Well I don   t think it would keep anymore.  You canned the meat with a pressure cooker. Then you put it in jars and put  the seasoning on there and put it in that cooker and set it. I don   t remember  how long it was, but you had it in there so long and then opened it up and took  it out after the steam was down, and then it was sealed and put in the cellar to  keep it cool. It was good meat.  You   d cut your own pot roast, and it was just like roast. It was so tender.  They would fry it, what you would call fry it down, and they   d have these big  12  Lemons  Kelln  Lemons  Schoenhals  Lemons  Kelln  Littau  Schoenhals  Kelln  Lemons  Kelln  Littau  Kelln  Kite  Kelln  Lemons  Kite  Schoenhals  crocks that they   d put the meat in and fry it. Then poured the grease over it,  and the grease would seal it and would preserve it. All you   d have to do it is  dig some of that meat out and heat it up, and it was delicious.  What was your favorite food?  Anything that was edible  (Laughing)  You didn   t have one thing that you thought, oh this is a big day because we   re  having this today?  Do you know the one thing we always had? We made a lot of ice cream.  Every time that Dad went to town and that was two and three times a week,  and at that time there were relatives living around there. We   d call them and  fix a freezer of ice cream. I still like crackers with ice cream. That   s what we  had.  Crackers with ice cream, I   ve never heard anything like that. You guys had it  good.  We had fruit on Saturday nights with supper, and Sunday we had fried  chicken.  And that was good fried chicken.  It was home grown.  We were big fans of it. We   d always have five to six chickens.  How many people were in your family?  Well, if they were all home, there were 14 kids and Mom and Dad.  Oh, my goodness.  That was his and hers and ours.  I   ve figured it out, yeah.  That was before the dust storms. I was married when we had the dust storms.  Yeah.  I have a question. You said that you didn   t think it would    keep    today, about  canning meat?  Because times have changed. Do you know that I canned some meat when, I  guess, 30 years ago. We were still out on the farm. You put it down in the  cellar and the grease got soft. I had to bring it up and put it in the icebox.  13  Kelln  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Littau  Schoenhals  Lemons  Kelln  Schoenhals  Kelln  Schoenhals  Kelln  Schoenhals  Lemons  Kelln  Lemons  Well, then we got the deep freeze, and we quit canning. But that steak used to  be delicious. We   d fry it, and mother put some in jars and that grease, you  know. It was just so tender. You could cut it with a fork.  And that German Borscht was good canned too.  Yes, we always had that.  A lot of them had geese and ducks, and they would butcher them and can  them. I know my mother-in-law filled half-gallon jars with the meat. She put  hers in the oven and had it cooking so long in the oven, and then when it was  done, she   d take it out and seal it.  We   d have to turn the jars over all the time.  We had boilers where we   d boil our clothes some times, because you couldn   t  get them, and we used that boiler to can our meat. You   ve probably never  even seen a boiler.  That   s what we did.  No I haven   t. I have a pressure pan. I don   t know how to use it, but I have  one  (Laughs)  They were big and round. You could put about five or six quart jars in one.  The water pack, we just water packed ours.  My folks, they had a steamer, and I think there were five or six quart jars and  four of the half-gallon jars that did it anyway.  And we dressed the geese and the ducks. I know mother used to always have  20 or more geese and that many ducks too. All the neighbors around were in  the same boat. I guess we were all poor. We raised our own poultry and our  beef and meat and all that. We never did buy meat; in fact, I still have  problems sometimes when I go to buy meat. We lived on the farm and we  always did our own butchering. In fact, her husband butchered for years.  He also butchered for all the neighbors, I guess, and finally he butchered for  the store.  Yeah he butchered for us for years, almost as long as, since we were married.  So what did you guys do for fun? What would you do for fun and  entertainment?  We didn   t have any time.  All right you must have done something to mark a special day that was kind of  14  Schoenhals  Kelln  Schoenhals  Lemons  Schoenhals  Littau  Schoenhals  Kelln  Schoenhals  Littau  Schoenhals  Kelln  Schoenhals  Kelln  Ehrlich  fun.  Well we   d go to church and visit neighbors. There was a lot of music. At that  time, there was no T.V.  At that time there was no T.V., and we   d all go and visit.  No, and we   d visit. It wasn   t like it is now at all. We   d go to the apple orchard.  What about that?  That was something to look forward to once a year in the fall. We usually  went and got about five or six bushels of apples.  Five or six bushels.  They were put in the cellar, and they kept most of the winter.  Yeah, they went to the south by the river there, the apple orchards.  Because we kids, we   d always go in wagons. Now see, my folks didn   t, I don   t  think, have a car till    til I was 23 years old, and they had a buggy when I was  smaller, and Dad had a horse. Mother, when she got married kept enough  money saved up, and she bought this buggy. It had a top on it, and I will never  forget one night, we were coming home from church and there was our  neighbor, Baker. He had an old wheel, and Dad said,    I   m going to pass them  with the horse and buggy,    and mother said,    You better not pass him,    and he  passed him, and we got home quite a while before they even passed our place.  (Laughs) But those were the days.  I   d like to tell you about the ducks. My folks used to raise a lot a ducks, and  we had a pond pretty close, and when evening came, they   d come in and  follow each other. I know my cousin was there, he wasn   t very big at that  time, and he said,    Aunt Mary, that looks like a funeral     He was thrilled  about that. He thought they looked like a funeral.  And we   d raise our own. We had big gardens, and that   s what we lived on in  the wintertime. We canned a lot of stuff, mother would.  It was too dusty in the dust storm days to raise gardens.  Yeah, but   I don   t remember.  I don   t know, but I know the bad storms were in the    30s. Well, Norman was  born in    34, and he was a year old, so it would have been    35.  You asked about if family left and moved away. Not so much a family but  there were other people from the area that did. I know my husband had a  couple of uncles that went on out to California.  15  Lemons  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Lemons  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Littau  Schoenhals  Littau  Schoenhals  Lemons  Did they stay there?  Yeah, they stayed, I guess.  Some of the people that moved, they moved back after the storms.  Well, those people that went to Dalhart, I guess they kind of got blowed out.  I don   t know, but you know, most of them came back later it seems like.  The land opened up out there, and people would go out there and buy land and  go in and break the sod. Evidently it   s the type of land which, like much of it  around here, should never have been broken up. When it got dry and the  winds came, it was not good.  Was there ever anyone that said,    Hey don   t do that, that   s going to be bad,     to those people who were breaking up that land?  Well, that   s why they bought it, you know. That   s how all of this got under  cultivation. People would come in here and homestead a quarter of land, and  then they   d buy another quarter. In order to raise wheat and crops, you had to  get in there and break up the sod.  When my Dad   s parents moved down there, he was eight years old. It was on  his eighth birthday, and they came from Lehigh, Kansas. There was a bunch  of those German people came from Lehigh, Kansas, and the strip was open for  homesteading. I know my grandpa came down a year before and filed on this  place. Dad was telling us about when they came from Lehigh, Kansas. They  came on the train, and they brought five children and the twins, who were just  about three months old. He said it took 24 hours to get Shattuck. Then, some  neighbors that were already out here, they came and picked them up. They  went out there that night, and he said that they slept under the wagon. They  turned the wagon over and slept under that. I think grandma and the two little  ones went to the neighbor   s. Dad said when they filed there, there was  nothing. None of that land was broke, it was all sod. He said the first year he  and grandpa plowed up there by the walking the plow over 35 acres, and that   s  where they started putting wheat and feed and growing there.  They didn   t farm like they farm now. Now they farm hundreds of acres. We  had to do a lot of work with the horses.  I never did work with horses.  Yeah, I did.  I did, but at the header barge.  Did you like that?  16  Schoenhals  Littau  Schoenhals  Littau  Schoenhals  Lemons  Littau  Ehrlich  Lemons  Littau  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Kelln  Ehrlich  Yeah it was fun. I got a new color bay.  The row crop, I didn   t remember. I don   t know how many, I think I just had  two or three horses. Or was there four? I don   t remember that. But anyway I  would watch the row crop so I didn   t get over too far this way or that way.  That wasn   t easy to do.  No, it wasn   t.  I didn   t have to do that much. Now Dad got a tractor, I think I was about ten,  and he let me run that tractor. I   d plow a lot of times in the summer, and I   d  help him with the plowing. At that time, the old tractors, they had those long,  long wheels. They didn   t have tires.  Well, this is changing the subject a little bit, but I wanted to ask you if you  remember any tramps or hobos or wayward people coming through and  wanting food or work and what happened when came to your house?  I remember it was on a Sunday morning. I think we were gonna have  company, and Mother had fixed a bunch of pies. They were out there in the  pantry and Mama came home and said,    Well, where are our pies?    They  were gone. So I imagine some of them came in and helped themselves. We  didn   t lock doors at that time.  Gypsies, I vaguely remember a big band of gypsies that would come through.  I don   t know of any particular dealings with them.  Just to clarify the difference between a gypsy and a hobo, how would you tell  the difference?  I don   t know. I   ve never seen gypsies. I think there were more of them hobos.  Gypsies were selling things.  Yeah, they would have something to sell or trade.  Trade for chickens or something, wouldn   t you say?  But they were of a darker color.  They looked more like a Mexican.  Yeah, and they weren   t Mexicans, but they were     I think they could hypnotize you. (Laughs)  Anyway, I think most kids were kind of scared. Well, or the parents scared  them.  17  Lemons  Kelln  Schoenhals  Lemons  Schoenhals  Lemons  Schoenhals  Kelln  Lemons  Kelln  Lemons  Kelln  Lemons  Littau  Kelln  Were you scared of the gypsies? You said they could hypnotize you?  Yeah, I was scared. I wouldn   t let them come in the house if they had come to  the yard because they looked kind of scary. And what did you hear about them,  they tried to steal things, some way or another. We never had any that  bothered us, but I used to hear stories. I saw some though. They would  hypnotize you and make you do things you wouldn   t want to do. (Laughs)  Well I remember the tramps, but we never had gypsies or any of that that I  know of.  What do you remember about the tramps?  Well, I remember three of four times where they   d come up and want food,  and the folks would give them food. It was usually towards evening, and  they   d sleep in the barn on the straw or hay. I know Dad always said to ask  them if they smoked, because he wasn   t gonna let them sleep in there if they  did. But I don   t guess they did because in the morning, they   d get up early and  knock at the door, and Mother would give them some food and they   d leave.  Did your Dad ever have them do any work around?  No, he couldn   t depend on them, I don   t think, because they were just  traveling, walking through.  There were a lot of them on the railroad tracks and on the freight trains,  because we were just a quarter of a mile, before I moved in here, from the  railroad. They wanted something to eat, but I never let them in the house, just  handed out whatever they wanted to eat.  What about bed bugs? I heard a lot of people tell stories about bed bugs.  I didn   t have any. (Laughs)  From what I   ve heard that   s a good thing, because they sound like a real pest.  I know. I knew people that did, and it was a mess.  What did you do after you had the bed bugs?  Oh, they had little yellow things that had powder in them, and we   d just get in  those little cracks around the mattress and just squeeze that in there and finally  got rid of them. How they ever get started, I don   t know.  I worked for some people that had some, and in those days, the beds had those  wire springs, and we   d take kerosene or something like that, with a feather  brush made from the geese, you   d use the wings, and dip it in the kerosene and  just paint it on that spring and the bedstead. If you had an old house that was  taped, they were working themselves in there when there was a crack, and they  18  Schoenhals  Kelln  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Kelln  Lemons  Kelln  Schoenhals  Lemons  Kelln  Lemons  Kelln  Lemons  Kelln  Lemons  Kelln  Lemons  Kelln  Ehrlich  Kelln  got the young ones in there. So if they didn   t use the kerosene on the wall,  washboards or whatever, why they used that powder. That   s what we did at  that place.  We never had any. The first bed bug I saw was when I was     Some people that had babies, you could tell the bugs were biting them. They  had red spots.  Little red bumps on them.  I never had any experience with them that I can remember.  I know a story that my mom told me. There was a lady she had a baby and it  had all them red specks, and they said to her, why called her by name,    You  must have bed bugs, your baby is all red spotted.    She said,    Well that   s  nothing, everybody   s got bed bugs      I don   t know if she really thought that or just said it.  Maybe she just thought it was like that. I think I   m talking too much.  You worry about that more than we do.  You mentioned you worked for another family, what did you do?  Mostly babysit. That was before I was married.  What was the going rate for a babysitter then?  What I got for babysitting?  Yeah, how much did you get paid to baby sit?  Oh, I got something to eat and a place to sleep, and maybe some material to  make a dress or something, or maybe some hand-me-downs.  Pretty good though.  That was all right when you didn   t have nothing.  So did you ever have clothes or make clothes out of feed sacks?  Oh yes.  Yes.  Everything that could be sewn together we made out of feed sacks.  19  Ehrlich  Littau  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Lemons  Schoenhals  Kelln  Lemons  Kelln  Lemons  Kelln  Schoenhals  Kelln  Lemons  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  There were so many sacks of the same material and print, so they would have  enough material for whatever they wanted to make.  You used to have a feed store didn   t you?  And make tea towels.  And you could get the plain ones, kind of an ecru color, and you could make  curtains or sheets out of them. (Laughs)  In fact, I   ve still got a sheet. Mother sewed together four feed sacks, and I still  use that to cover things up.  That was good material.  It was.  It must have been.  Mother fixed our dresses and blouses out of it when we went to school. A lot  of people had dresses.  And I made shirts for my boys and anything that could be sewed.  Did you have a favorite pattern, one that stands out? Do you remember  searching for this pattern that you really liked on the feed sacks?  Well if I had shirt that was worn out, I ripped it open and used it as a pattern or  also as dresses or aprons or whatever.  We were talking to a woman this morning and she mentioned that her mother  would look through catalogs and then make her own pattern after seeing  something in a catalog.  A lot of them did.  That   s what my mother did a lot of times. She   d have something to fit, and  she   d cut it, you know. She   s a seamstress here.  I wasn   t much of a seamstress. I had to have a pattern. I couldn   t look at the  picture and just make it.  What would you say is your fondest memory from that time, something that  when you think back, you know things were bad you didn   t have a lot of  money, there was dust, but this part of it was pretty good?  I think people were closer.  And worked together.  20  Ehrlich  Lemons  Littau  Schoenhals  Lemons  Littau  Lemons  Schoenhals  Littau  Lemons  Littau  Ehrlich  Littau  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  It seems like if you want to go see somebody now, maybe you better call first  and see if they   re home or watching their favorite story or something. But  again, I don   t take the time to call. I   m one of those that don   t do much  calling.  What about the rest of you? What   s your fondest memory from then?  Well I think the visiting. We didn   t have many new people to meet, but I know  we did a lot of visiting, and we always had company. Get together with my  cousins. (Laughs) We   d walk two or three miles to get together. Then we   d  just play games, I guess.  That   s kind of the way it was with us. We had a lot of company, and Mother  would fix dinner with my grandmother, and she had grandkids   there were  maybe four or five of them. That   s what I always enjoyed, going there and  playing with them.  What did you play? You said you played cards, what kind of cards did you  play?  No, Chinese checkers and dominoes, I think, mostly. My folks didn   t allow us  to use cards. (Laughs)  Oh really, and why didn   t they?  It was their religion, I guess.  The religion.  That   s interesting.  I think we were the first ones in our community that had a radio, and I never  will forget my teacher. He lived about a half a mile up the hill, and when he   d  go home at night you could hear him sing,    How do ya do, how do ya do  folks,    or whatever that went like. Oh, he really enjoyed it. We had those  earphones to put on.  I remember, my dad had a radio. I think the first one was kind of like a horn.  Anyway, my grandmother, my mother   s mother, when she would hear this she  would say,    That   s witchcraft.    You know this radio talking, that was beyond  her. She thought that was hexed.  I wonder what she would have thought now with what   s going on.  This computer business, I don   t know.  When we kids were growing up, just small, there would be at my grandma   s     we   d have a little brooder house, and we   d have a playhouse in there. We   d  make mud cakes, and go to the chicken house and get some eggs.  21  Ehrlich  Lemons  Schoenhals  Lemons  Schoenhals  Littau  Schoenhals  Littau  Lemons  Kelln  Littau  Schoenhals  Kelln  Schoenhals  Kelln  Kelln  Lemons  Kelln  Schoenhals  Maybe she doesn   t know what a brooder house is.  I do know what a brooder house is. I was always scared to go in there though,  because it was kind of dark, (Laughs) and I would say,    Oh, that doesn   t look  very good.    Yeah, we did play in there.  Yes, for a stove, we   d put bricks and things and act like we were baking.  Did you ever get in trouble for taking those eggs to make mud pies? Yeah,  what happened then?  I was the oldest grandchild, and I got by pretty lucky, but my uncle caught us,  my other cousins and me. No, it wasn   t cousins, it was a friend, a neighbor,  Omar. You know, we   d come to town on Saturday nights. We   d always come  to town.  Couldn   t find a parking place, dragged Main.  Dragged Main. (Laughter)  Up and down, up and down. This used to be a really busy town on Saturdays  and Saturday nights.  Did you ever go to play parties or square dances or anything like that?  My folks wouldn   t let us go to dances.  Yeah, here either.  We never went.  They had them in the old country, but they were different, Momma said.  Yeah, they were different than what they think.  The boys and the girls didn   t dance together, each one of them danced by  themselves.  So I don   t know how to dance. I could jump.  Well then you   d do pretty good with modern dance style, because that   s pretty  much what they do. (Laughter) I heard some people talk about rabbit drives,  did they ever have any rabbit drives here? What was that like? What did they  do? How did that work?  Well, as far as I know, they got together and spaced off so many miles, I guess.  And there were circles of them.  22  Kelln  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Littau  Kelln  Schoenhals  Lemons  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Kelln  Ehrlich  Littau  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Littau  Lemons  Well, they had so many acres or miles, I don   t know just how big, but they had  enough people that they could be close together. They started out on the  further end of it, and then they all had guns, didn   t they?  I guess that   s the only way they could kill them all.  I don   t remember rabbit drives, but I remember wolf drives.  I remember the coyotes. I don   t think we had many wolfs around here. I think  it was mostly coyotes.  But anyway, they   d come from all four sides, I think, and when they got close  enough, they shot them. I guess everybody picked some that wanted some.  Some took them home and fed the meat to the chickens, chopped it up you  know. I guess some would eat them.  They ate them.  What were you saying?  I remember that if they would catch a rabbit, they   d cut the ears off and collect  them and bring them in. They would get so much for rabbit ears, and for  coyotes, I think.  For the skins you know, they   d skin them.  I know my brother was kind of a trapper, he set traps.  They   d skin the coyotes, but not rabbits. Who ever wanted them I guess.  I didn   t go along with them, but that   s the way I understood it. They had it for  rabbits, and then they had it for coyotes. I guess maybe by the time they got  close together, they had both kinds in that ring. But there were so many  coyotes. They got in where the cattle were, and when they had baby calves,  they   d tear them up and all, so they had them coyote drives.  I don   t know if that   s illegal anymore.  Maybe not, but there are no more rabbits out on the farm.  We used to have a lot of rabbits, you remember?  I know, but there were too many. They ate up things that belonged to the  cattle. That   s why they had those drives. But now, I guess there are hardly any  rabbits, and the kind that are around, don   t eat them that much.  We used to eat cottontails.  Oh yeah.  23  Littau  Lemons  Littau  Kelln  Schoenhals  Kelln  Lemons  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Lemons  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Lemons  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Lemons  Oh they were good.  Did you have rabbit stew?  No, we fried it. That   s when they were young, you know.  I never fixed rabbit.  I didn   t either.  The cottontails, they were more tender than a rabbit.  Can you recall any sort of public assistance type of thing in Shattuck to help  people who maybe didn   t have as much money or were going through a rough  time during the Depression, like maybe through a church or through a  government agency or anything like that?  The WPA came in here in about    32 or    34 maybe, I don   t know, in the    30s.  This was government property, and they started building roads. That   s what I  know of, and I don   t know what else they did.  They would hire the people with their horses or whatever they could move dirt  with, and they would pay them so much for coming out and working.  Did you have husbands, brothers, dads, that worked for the WPA?  My dad worked on the roads for I don   t know how many years ago, and he  worked with horses, but that wasn   t the WPA. He was paid by the county or  something to keep the county roads up. But they were all dirt roads at the time.  That did help a lot of people. They could earn money that way, and then up at  Boiling Springs, where the boys could earn more money. They must have  built up Boiling Springs.  Like a CCC camp.  But I remember when the WPA started, they were hiring people and asking  what all they owned and this and that. I think one guy, one of the men, they  always brought their lunches, and he had an orange and a banana in his dinner  pail with other things, and they fired him. But now I don   t know if that   s true.  (Laughter)  He had too much lunch, huh.  Yeah, he had too much lunch. I don   t know if that was true or not, it   s just a  story.  What was the general feeling towards Franklin Roosevelt?  24  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Lemons  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Ehrlich  Lemons  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Kelln  Ehrlich  Lemons  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Littau  Kelln  Ehrlich  Kelln  Schoenhals  Well the farmers liked him. I think he kind of got them on their feet.  I don   t think there was very many that didn   t like him.  I still remember my folks, when the banks closed, it scared everybody to death,  for the first day or two, but then he really helped the farmers, I think all the  people.  He was good for that time. He was good.  Do you think living through something like the dust bowl changed how you  view the environment and Mother Nature and seasons changing?  Not really, I don   t think.  I don   t either.  I think it just makes you stronger if you live through something like that.  What would you say would be the most enduring characteristic that you got  from living then? What do you think is something that has stuck with you  because you lived through the dirty thirties?  We had outhouses. Now, if the conditions would be like that   would have to  go back and live like that     The older people.  But the younger ones wouldn   t.     the younger ones, I don   t think, it would be awfully hard on them.  Would you want to go back and live through it again?  No.  No.  No.  I   m too old to go back.  They   re having that electric crunch out in California. Well now, if they  wouldn   t have any electricity, we   d have to get back to some other basic thing.  That would be hard to do.  Some people had carbide lights, but we didn   t have electricity. I don   t think  the REA was    till the late thirties.  25  Kelln  Ehrlich  Kelln  Lemons  Kelln  Littau  Kelln  Lemons  Schoenhals  Littau  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Kelln  Schoenhals  Kelln  Littau  Kelln  Littau  We didn   t get electricity until 1948.  Yeah, around    48 or    49.  There were different territories, but we got it in    48. That   s when I got my  electric appliances. That   s why I remember.  That   s what I was going to ask you. What   s the first thing that you got after  you got electricity?  The refrigerator, and it was a Gibson Brand, and I   m still using it.  Oh my goodness.  It was bought in 1948, and it   s supposed to outlast me. (Laughs)  So do you guys remember when you first got electricity?  Well, I was working. Now when we got married, 55 years ago, we couldn   t  get electricity up there where we were living for about six months, and it was  difficult.  I don   t remember what year we got it.  Our first refrigerator wasn   t by electricity but by gas.  Oh, you had one? Now the folks, I think they got theirs   it seems to me it was  in    40 or    41, because I know when they got the refrigerator that it was quite  something.  Well I remember the icebox that I had.  The old wooden ones.  Yeah, mine was a metal one, and I   d always have to go to town and get some  ice to keep some food cold in that box. You didn   t dare chip any off so it  lasted longer.  Before we had the iceboxes, we had a little thing around our well, and the  water would go through this barrel, and we   d keep butter and cream, we   d  keep it in that cold water. Down in the basement, we   d keep butter and cream  and things.  That windmill was going all the time, pumping water, and it pumped them to  that cooler, and then it was piped out in the stock town. The fresh cold water  came in there, and that   s where we kept our things cool, like milk and cream.  We   d put it in buckets and set it in there when we made butter.  Even meat. I think we had meat hanging in that.  26  Schoenhals  Littau  Schoenhals  Kelln  Littau  Kelln  Ehrlich  Littau  Littau  Schoenhals  Lemons  Littau  Kelln  Lemons  Kelln  Littau  Ehrlich  Kelln  Schoenhals  Kelln  Ehrlich  Schoenhals  Oh well maybe, I don   t remember.  I remember going out and cutting that old piece of meat.  We churned our own butter for years.  Oh yeah, we churned our own butter and made cottage cheese and all that stuff  out of milk.  And cream cheese out of cottage cheese.  Ice cream, you put it on a cracker.  How did we get everything done then?  Well we didn   t have as much to do. (Laughter)  We didn   t.  Well, there was a lot to do, but we didn   t have the entertainment that you see.  Didn   t have all those distractions.  Yeah. (Laughs)  Yeah, we didn   t have T.V., didn   t have radio. We just had to work. That T.V.  and radio and all that stuff takes a lot of time away.  Well how do you feel about the dirty thirties and the depression, today?  What   s your general feeling about that era?  We don   t want it again. Not me, but we made it.  I   m a little different now you know, too.  There   s quite a bit of broken ground that has gone back into grass.  Well I think that helped when they put the shelterbelt in, you know planted  those trees in a row, three or four layers across. That was after the dust storms  started, I think. I don   t know how many or how far apart on the farms they   d  planted them, but they called it a shelterbelt.  Oh, they were a mile and two miles.  Yeah, a half a mile, I think.  What kind of trees were they? Were they elm trees?  I think Elms.  27  Kelln  Schoenhals  Kelln  Schoenhals  Kelln  Schoenhals  Kelln  Lemons  Kelln  Lemons  Kite  Lemons  Kelln  Lemons  There were cedar trees, and there were two or three or maybe four different  kinds. You can see some places yet out in the country where they kept them  up.  Or the ones out on that road out.  Or out on the highway.  Yeah, the tornado tore them down.  You know, out west from the highway, from that house. When was that built?  On the north side there are still some trees they had planted for shelter.  Yeah, you can see that from the driveway there.  I think that helped the wind from blowing the dirt. Yeah, there   s a lot of things  were known at that time, can   t remember it all.  Is there anything I didn   t ask that you want to talk about, anything I forgot, or  didn   t think of, that   s probably more important, something I didn   t think of to  ask?  I think we covered it and maybe even more than that.  Well, that   s all the questions I have unless you want to ask something Steve?  Nope, think I   m good to go.  Thanks for talking with us.  I enjoyed it.  Well good.  -------  -------
