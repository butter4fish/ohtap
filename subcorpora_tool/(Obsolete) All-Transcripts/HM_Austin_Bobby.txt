Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe; I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers; our videographer is Carey Lane.  Sir, could you state your name and spell is for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes, my name is Bobby William Austin, and that's spelled B-O-B-B-Y, A-U--W-I-L-L-I-A-M, A-U-S-T-I-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have any nicknames or anything or?
Speaker 2: No I think Bobby is quite sufficient (laughter) that's a nickname (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: That is my actual name.
Speaker 1: Now this is, you know, I was--my mother did a similar thing to me.  But--so they, they really just they named you Bobby without calling you Robert or anything right so you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Actually (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: It's, it's not, it's not short for Robert or, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, my mother [Mary Anderson Austin], who was the love of my life, had one child, my brother Skip, whose name is Herschel [Austin, Jr.] named after my dad [Herschel Austin, Sr.].  And I was a wanted child but I didn't have a name (laughter).  So when I was born the doctor, who, whose name was Dr. Walter Francis Beckett [ph.], was their good friend.  And my mother asked him if you had a son what would you name him.  And he said Bobby and that became my name.  Now believe me I asked them when I got old, "why would you name me Bobby?  Why didn't you find some other name?" And that's, that was the story.  I still feel very loved.  But (laughter) there was no name for me when I--she had a name for a girl, 'cause she had a boy and she wanted a girl so she--didn't have a name.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.  But, so--and, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is December 29, 1944, and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was born in a little place called Jonesville, in Kentucky, and so it would be Warren County, Kentucky.  Just outside Bowling Green, Kentucky.  So I'm being very specific, so I won't say Bowling Green because I was not born in Bowling Green but is very close to Bowling Green.  I was born in Jonesville.
Speaker 1: Okay, and sir what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well it's hard to say sometimes, but I am--well I just got to think about this.  Well, I've been an editor.  I am an editor to this day; I guess that has been my consuming passion.  A philanthropist.  Worked in, in a major foundation.  And I had my own foundation, the Village Foundation, and I've been in higher education as a vice president of a college.  So in those terms I've also been in politics.  I wrote speeches for Patricia Roberts Harris.  Things like that, so I don't know what you would say very acatalectic background as far as occupations are concerned, but that's basically it, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay that's, that's yeah, that, that gets us into the, in the mix here.  And so what is today's date?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh my god, today is August 5, 2004.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Well we're in my home which is in Washington, D.C., and the address here at 1800--
Speaker 1: --You don't necessary have to give us the address (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh okay, (laughter) oh okay, but in Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 120676
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth there are five People magazine-ish type questions that we are--
Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: --that I'm compelled to ask you, and they only require a short answer.  First one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Fried chicken.

Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I have one that's mine.  I like the word "Social Infrastructure" because that's what I'm working on all the time.  So, and no one ever knows what I'm talking about but I like that. "Social Infrastructure."
Story_ID: 120677
Speaker 1: Okay all right.  Now, I'm going to ask you about your family history.  We'll start with your mother's side but I, I'm gonna do your father's side too.  So, so we try to do 'em on a separate stream and then we, we'll bring them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But can, can you give a mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes. Her name was Mary Elizabeth Anderson Austin, and that's M-A-R-Y, E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H, A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N, and A-U-S-T-I-N.
Speaker 1: Now what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well I could not give you the exact year, but I can certainly tell you it was July 4th, and she was born in Simpson County, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Is that close by--?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.  Next County from Warren County (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: 'Cause as a child she moved to, to Woodburn, which is in Warren County.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Which is in Warren County.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're not sure of the year but can, can you put us in--?
Speaker 2: Well when she died which was about eight or ten years of ten years ago she was seventy-one, so I'd say 1914, 1915 maybe somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: Well, just checking sound like more 1925, '26 [1926] something like that?
Speaker 2: No, I think she's a little older than that.
Speaker 1: Lil older than that, okay.
Speaker 2: Well, let do it this, my dad [Herschel Austin, Sr.] is ninety now, and he was three years older than she is, than she was so if you figure it back from there I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, so 1918 maybe some like that '17 [1917], '18 [1918]?  Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: That's what I thought maybe '17 [1917], '18 [1918], '16 [1916] or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back first of all can, can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, very oral on her side.  I do know the name of her, her grand, grandmother her name was the best I can remember Tinnie [ph.] Austin and--Tinnie Anderson, I'm very sorry, Tinnie Anderson.  And she was I believe a, a washwoman, and she was a mulatto.  And my--her husband name--all I can remember is Pap that's what they called him.  And I think he was a cook and then my--that was my grandfather's mother and father.  My grandmother's, mother and her husband my great grandfather, I think he was a minister.  What I can remember he was a preacher I guess, you know, one of these itinerant preachers.  And then my grandmother her name was Beadie Bratton was a teacher she finished a good old place called Gravel Hill Academy in Tennessee.  She was sent away to school, boarding school, and my grandfather's name was Burford Anderson and he lived in this little town called Andersonville, Tennessee because they were all Andersons and it was a huge family, and they are still there till this day.  But their city has a different name it's very near Gallatin, Tennessee.  But it was a whole I mean I would say he had like 17, 18, 19 brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: Gallatin the home of that, that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Fair, the Black Fair?  It's a circus, that--what it was called yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh I didn't know about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  We used to go every year to that thing (laughter).
Speaker 1: But I was thinking about that--the radio station with the (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah right.
Speaker 1: The house the man (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: You know, and WLAC (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: WLAC right.
Speaker 1: Which broadcasts all over the country (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And people--black folks were tuning in late at night (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Gallatin, Tennessee, right.
Speaker 2: Right, right Gallatin, Tennessee, it's right near Gallatin.
Story_ID: 120678
Speaker 1: Okay yeah, are there, there any stories from that side of the family [maternal] they passed down about life during slavery or reconstruction and, you know, that or early period?
Speaker 2: Well a couple but really not many I, I guess we're like a lot of families they didn't talk about it very much.  My, my mother's mother [Beadie Bratton] as I said was a teacher.  And my mother's father [Burford Anderson] was a horse trainer, and I guess the stories that she [Mary Anderson Austin] told were personal to her.  Even though she had a good relationship with her mother and father, she was very pained by her dad.  Because he, he stopped her mother from teaching eventually.  And even though there were four or five kids, five kids in the family, did not allow them to go past the eighth grade.  And my mother was very hungry for education, and I think I'm a result of that.  And to her that was a very pained story for her.  But she told it regularly to me, and I think it was her way of saying I want you to go, and go, and go.  And I don't think she actually held it against him but she certainly never, ever forgot it as long as she lived.  Now there is another part I can tell now that I'm thinking about it.  He was very giving to his family; it was a huge family.  Very pretty people actually, but always seemingly in need of something.  And my mother said that the last thing that she became very upset about is he sold their home.  He mortgaged their home and then lost it helping his brothers and sisters.  And so she and her mother and family had to move into, in those days it would be called a duplex in, in the little city of Franklin, Kentucky.  Because he sold their little, their little home and land they had to to help his, to help his family out.  And she use to say, "I love family, but I don't you put yourself outdoors to do that."  So that's what he did.  So those are, you know two.  I guess both kinda painful, but that's the what I remember her telling me.
Speaker 1: Is there any--did she ever talk about of reason for his (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Love of his family so?
Speaker 1: Placing a--no, placing a ceiling on their education?
Speaker 2: No, just that I think he was a very domineering person.  And a very nice man I thought, 'cause I certainly knew him, he lived with us before he died.  But, just very domineering, and I, and I guess he had his own way about how he thought life should be.  And I guess men-and I guess as a man he thought that there was dominance of a man in a home.  It doesn't make sense but yeah I know (laughter) but it happened on that side (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, those are the days.  Now so did your mother talk about how she grew up very much with (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yes, they seemly worked a lot, and, and they worked hard.  They did go through the eighth grade, and she grew up in and around Woodburn, Kentucky because doing some period there they moved over from Franklin near Woodburn, Kentucky.  And actually that's where she met my dad they then went to elementary school together there in, in Woodburn, Kentucky.  Now, she never talked about whether she worked, actually did work as a child.  But on a farm, the had a, you know, they had farms, and they did that kind of work.  You know, and potatoes, and strawberries and corn and things like that I remember her talking about how hard it was, you know.  They had to do all this work and, you know, and how everybody was expected to do it, and they did it.
Story_ID: 120679
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Mary Austin and Herschel Austin, Sr.] met?  Were they--?
Speaker 2: Well, they were childhood sweethearts.  I mean, you know, they were both in the same grade.  I guess, in the eighth grade, they finished the eighth grade and they didn't marry immediately though, which is interesting.  I don't think they married for another ten years.  And I can't tell you what happened those intervening years.  But my mother was almost twenty, my father was twenty I believe when they married, and I think she was nineteen when they got married.
Speaker 1: Well that seems like old enough (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah that's old enough.  They didn't want rush into it yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: They knew each other for ten years?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Absolutely they didn't rush into it at all.
Story_ID: 120680
Speaker 1: Give us your father's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: His name is Herschel H-E-R-S-C-H-E-L, Harold H-A-R-O-L-D, Austin A-U-S-T-I-N.
Speaker 1: Okay and, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well again I can tell you May 30th, he was born on Memorial Day.  Used to be she was on the 4th of July, I cannot give you the date he's ninety now so that would be what 1914.
Speaker 1: Fourteen [1914], yeah I think so yeah.  Okay, well what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Probably a little more for some reason because we live with them so closely.  I didn't live with the Andersons that closely they were in Franklin [County, Kentucky] or other places.  But we lived and saw the Austins every day.  So, my, my great-great grandmother on both sides and my great-great-grandfather on both sides paternal and maternal.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did they have stories from, from back in the slavery days or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah well their stories actually didn't come out until someone, you know, told me, and then I went to ask.  Because they certainly were not forthcoming in our family.  No one ever talked about it.  But once I did ask, they did begin to, you know, tell you what they wanted you to know.  And so it was a small farming community there in Woodburn.  And my grandmother, her name was Annie Bell Moore Austin; was from what I would I guess you would call a very--kind of an important family.  They were music teachers, they owned land, the Hamptons, and the Moors did.  And there family gave the, the land that the church was built on.  It is her, her father my grandfather we called him Pap, Pap Will Moore, built First Baptist Church Woodburn which sits there today and is a functioning, wonderful little church there.  They were very involved in the church, and, of course, they play the piano for the church.  And her brothers my great uncles were musicians.  One was blind but he wrote music.  And they were just a really interesting group of people.  They were a mixture of Cherokee and African and of course European.  And did rather well for themselves as people who were very, I guess you could say thrifty but also made a living by doing--they were seamstress as I said musician's things like that.  And I, I can't think of the, my--I know the name of my great grandmother is Lucinda, Lucinda Hampton Moore.  And as I said her husband's name was we called him Pap Will, his name was Will Moore.  And I can't go beyond that.  There's my great great's.  And then my--on my paternal side my grandfather's name was John, I can't think of his middle name, but I know it's John Austin.  John William, I'm named after him, what am I talking about, John William Austin, and now the trick here is that he was the son of this very beautiful mulatto woman named Amanda.  And I don't know what her name would've been as a child.  Even though she's not mysterious, no one ever told me.  And I would have to go home and look at our family Bible.  Just the, a real good record but my grandfather was the son of a white man whose name was Mr. Bluitt [ph.], and that's all I ever knew was Mr. Bluitt.  And she was the cook there on his farm there were no plantations that I know of in Kentucky.  They were farmers (laughter) big farmers.  So this big farm, this boy was raised by her and ironically by this white man.  But she married a free black man who came to--through that area.  And his name was Henry Austin, and she gave my grandfather his name, Austin.  Consequently we became Austins, but my grandfather continued to work for his father.  And, I found out from my dad much later, as an overseer and as a driver for his white father and when he died, 'cause he did not have sons evidently he had a daughter, he left my, my grandfather I would say pretty well-fixed, and I guess that's the interesting part of that story.  I won't say he ever claimed him because I don't know that.  I don't think he went around town saying that my son (laughter) but.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a tricky cultural--
Speaker 2: That's a tricky culture right.  But that is what--and, and as my uncles would say everybody knew who John--who daddy was but nobody ever said who he was but--
Story_ID: 120681
Speaker 1: I'm gonna tell you a little story, and this is true.  I was working at the Kellogg Foundation about ten, fifteen years ago.  And we went to a meeting in--at a retreat, and we were at a table.  And they were having--they had everybody go around the table and say where you were from, but you had to say where you were born.  And so this very pretty white lady who was the president of a small junior college gave her name and said, "I was born in Woodburn, Kentucky."  I said, "wow," so when it got to me I said, "you know, we have something in common."  I said "my ancestors all come from Woodburn, Kentucky."  And of course, she got so excited, and she said "and what were, you know, their names," I said "well, you know, the name is Austin."  And she said "well my ancestors are the Cheneys and the Bluitts."  I said oh, I said, "well my real ancestors' name is Bluitt."  When we finished we were cousins, we are cousins and so she had me come to the college and be and introduced me as her cousin which I was shocked by it, but such a sweet person.  But when I told my father this is how I think that they deal with things like that, he said "why would you have to go around looking for people to be related to" (laughter).  I said I wasn't looking for her; you know, she was sitting across the table and it just it happened.  And I was very, I was very pleased.  It was a very open--we're still friends.  And she's down in Florida now haven't seen her in a while but it was became, throughout the entire Kellogg Foundation by the time I got back that I had met my, my white cousin.  And it, it was a fact we, we were, we're certainly distant cousins.
Speaker 2: So you feel a kind of tied a loose end?
Speaker 1: Well it was a strange feeling, I mean, you know, sitting across the table from someone that you would think you had no connection with.  And all of a sudden here you have this really blood connection, because this guy was his father and this guy really was her grandfather or great something like that.  You know, what she said Woodburn [Kentucky] and she said Bluitt and Cheney I was like, you know, now this is much too close for comfort (laughter) so, you know, we went through the whole thing.
Story_ID: 120682
Speaker 1: Now I didn't know names but she [Austin's cousin] knew names, and, and had heard of this woman Amanda [Wormley], who was my great-grandmother.  And she was known as a person who was very vain, and she evidently was very pretty.  She had gray eyes, and she had dresses made of gray material so that it matched her eyes.  And her, her, her dresses never went below her boot top, so she was quite something (laughter).  She left there as a young woman; Mr. Austin died, I believe, very young.  And went to Toledo, Ohio, and there in Toledo married a man named James Wormley.  And Mr. Wormley we were always told was related to the Wormleys we think it's the ones who were here who had the hotel.  Where Lincoln did something, but she was married to him for a very long time and they, they stayed and they died in Toledo, and she became a missionary.  I think she went abroad.  I'm gonna look--I'm gonna really do some work on her because she truly is a fascinating person in our family.  And she sounded like a lady who just sort of lived her life, you know, pretty freely and well with great, you know, she was a great person and did well.  And, and evidently she--when she was in Toledo, they did very well but lost everything in the crash of 1930 [sic 1929].  And my people until this day are very leery, the Austins, about putting all their money in the bank (laughter) because they say grandma lost everything just about during the, in the '30s [1930s], so.  Very interesting woman though.  As I say I'm gonna do some work on her one of these days.
Speaker 2: That's an interesting story.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: It really is.
Story_ID: 120683
Speaker 1: Now, what's your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well frankly my earliest childhood memory is being at my Aunt Bee's house, who lived next door us.  They had a chicken farm; I have some pictures of (laughter) 'cause I use to love that.  And my--have in my feet between a chair and in the arm of a chair and playing the arms.  I remember that distinctly, and I know I couldn't of been more than four or five years old.  And I that all day long that was what I used to do (laughter).  And that, that's a very early clear memory for me.  And I think it's the youngest that I can remember sitting there.  And she would hum with me or she would sing and I would pretend, you know, and she would let me pretend.  I remember this so, so vividly I can remember (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: You'd pretend you were playing the piano on the arms of the chair?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) the arms, remember that clearly.
Story_ID: 120684
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: I have one brother [Herschel Austin, Jr.]. I had a sister who died in, infancy.  Again a very painful thing for my mother [Mary Anderson Austin] seemingly had a painful life but she was the most wonderful person in the world.  But the child died of pneumonia, and they lived in the country and they couldn't get her to a doctor in time to save her life.  She was the oldest.  Her name was Shirley Maxine, and she died at six or seven months.  And then my brother was born about two years after that his name is--we call him Skip--his name is Herschel, he's named after my father so it's the same as my father's name.  And he lives in Bowling Green, Kentucky; he's a horse farmer.  He raises show horses, and we just bought a race horse, Nag [ph.].  I hope it does something (laughter), we're hoping we can be Smarty Jones (laughter).  Buy something for nothing, you know, and make something out of it.  I don't know if it'll happen or not.  But he's a great guy, he is about sixty-five now but still working on his place down there.  And his wife is a retired schoolteacher, and they have one son, and that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: That's my, that's my immediate family; have nobody else.
Story_ID: 120685
Speaker 1: Now, now tell us something about the neighborhood you grew up in and some of the, you know, what, what you remember about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.
Speaker 2: Okay, I wouldn't--I guess it was the neighborhood.  But it was in the--kinda in the county.  It was rual by -- it was rural farm but also truck patch kind of thing.  You know, what I--where you'd have people had pickup trucks, and they'd have a garden or they'd have big fields of something and all, and my uncle had this, my dad, all those people.  So it was that kind of community I would call it, Jonesville [Kentucky] was.
Speaker 1: How, how far were you from your neighbors, I mean how, how far did you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh, not far, not far.  My aunt would be about two or three hundred yards there's a huge garden that separated us, and a lot of my family lived in the same place.  Now that's, that was one of the things that was nice about it.  I, I had--I think I had two aunts and a uncle and several cousins, many cousins of who all we were Austins.  We all lived out there together in Jonesville.  There was a church, community church, and, a small, small store kind of a rundown shack of a store.  And then there was a small roadhouse.  The roadhouse is where--like a place where people go and drinking have barbecue and stuff like that.  I guess that was out there because people could come in from the cities and out from the city and go out there and have a good time I guess (laughter).  But I don't know why was in Jonesville but it was in Jonesville.  And that about it, there was a dentist who lived out there named Dr. Yarborough [ph.].  And it was very, it was very pretty 'cause it was rural, it was green, space it wasn't--you didn't feel pent up, there will fields you could run in.  Which I did behind the house.  We played all kind of games, you know.  I was the perennial Indian.  Don't ask me why but I liked being Indian (laughter).  So I did that.
Speaker 1: Well, I have to ask you why, now--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: ==you grew up in the age of a lot of Western movies (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right.  Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: And the Indians were always supposed to be (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Always losing (laughter).
Speaker 1: There de, depicted in, in (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Always losing. (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Well in a few cases they were heroic (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, like Tonto (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, but he was always, but, but subservient to the white man if you weren't.  And they, the Indians they really were so determined were the ones who got, they got shot.  And so, so you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I just thought they were heroic and beautiful, you know, and I, I--that's what I liked.  I had no idea I was kin to them at the time, but I mean I really liked the Indians.  I didn't like the cowboys too much, and maybe that's something you instinct, instinctively learn in a culture that you absorbed thing, you absorb signs that you don't even know as a child.  But that, you know, that the one thing you don't aspire to be is the white man so (laughter).  I guess I think about it that's what that meant.  But there were kids that were, you know, they were cowboys.  But I was the perennial I was the Indian.  I had bows and arrows and all that yeah.
Story_ID: 120272
Speaker 1: How would you characterize yourself as a, as a little boy?  What, what kind of little boy were you?
Speaker 2: Finicky, I could tell you that.  I--my wife [Joy Ford] says I had the most blissful, happy childhood on record.  Because I don't remember anything bad ever happening.  I think I have a good mind for pushing things out of my head that I don't like but I, I had a wonderful childhood.  I had a great childhood I had lots of people around me who loved me, who let me do anything.  I don't ever remember people saying no or you can't or don't.  I was taken everywhere.  I had uncles in New York, and I had an aunt in Ohio.  And my life was spent fitting between these people who--every summer I spent just about in Troy, Ohio, and I would go to New York, and then this one would send me to my Uncle French in New Jersey and then they would send me back 'cause they--either they had no children, or they had one child.  And then my aunt in Bowling [Green, Kentucky] and Jonesville had no children, my Aunt Bee, so I was like her child too.  I just had a great childhood.  And I don't want to go against the prevailing winds of people who had suffering child--I did not have one.  And, God--there are days when I sit here in this house and say I wish I was a child (laughter) because everything was so good.  But it really was good, I mean, it was great.  I have to say that I was also a young man who--I play the piano.  And that gave you a real credential because I dealt with older people.  I, I played I was playing for my senior, senior choir at my church by the time I was thirteen.  So I was ordering big people around.  I had junior choirs at that same time.  By the time I finished high school I had--I was singing in a singing group.  I didn't play for them, called the Gospel Ambassadors, but I was teaching music to community children.  I was like an old person, I guess that's what I'm trying to say.  So my childhood was consumed in all these good things.  But I wasn't always digging in the dirt, I mean, I wasn't that kind of kid.  I wasn't up a tree and even though I would climb trees sometimes.  I was, I was pretty much involved in practicing my piano.  I really wanted--which probably a little weird but in those days there were lots of men and boys who played the piano.  I had two in my own family, so that wasn't considered unusual in the Moore family.  And my--when as a little boy, when I was about between the ages of four, three, four, five, before I went to school, I, I stayed with my aunt next door 'cause my mother [Mary Anderson Austin] would do day work sometimes.  She didn't work often, and I used to answer the phone and I would say, you know, good morning Stallard's [ph.] chicken farm; that was my job (laughter).  So, you know, I did that, and she and I were like buddies.  I mean, she told me stuff we--I, I remember just hanging on to her all the--even as a big boy.  I would hang on to my Aunt Bee.  I just loved her.  My mother said, "Stop holding on to Cleva."  Her name was Cleva.  But I was just totally attached to her, just unbelievably attached to her.  And the happiest thing in my life is that she lived long enough to see my oldest child, Sushama [Austin-Connor], as a baby, and I named my oldest child Sushama Cleva, after, after her because, you know, there was just no thought.  I, you know, was gonna do that, but very, very, very nice childhood, very happy.
Story_ID: 120273
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't remember any major incidents except one and that incident I had put out of my mind until about, oh, eight years ago.   I was at home with my dad [Herschel Austin, Sr.] and my, my wife [Joy Ford], and we were just talking and talking about childhood and I was talking about how happy it all was and everything.  And he said but do you remember what happened when you and your mother [Mary Anderson Austin] went up to Western Kentucky University [Bowling Green, Kentucky].  And I couldn't, I couldn't even remember her going with me.  I said she didn't go with me to college you know I was like I'm big enough to go the college by myself 'cause I just walked up the road.  And he brought back to my memory something that I have put out my memory.  And that was in those days.  I was about in the seventh grade when a local music teacher and the county had those music teachers that would go around from school to school in the county came and the principle of our little country elementary school called Delafield [Elementary] School [Warren County, Kentucky] told her that I could play the piano, and she asked me to go.  And I did, I played for her, and she was like wow, you know, this boy is talented he needs to, he shouldn't--he needs to go somewhere where he can really learn.  And she got me to Western Kentucky University to the music department where I was taught by students mainly.  But I was myself only, what, in the seventh grade but I remember the first time that I went.  I had forgotten this, but he brought it back to my memory, but I put it out of my mind.  A young--a student pushed my mother and me off of the sidewalk as we were going up the hill to this to my first music lesson but my mother pushed him back.  Now I kind of fell on the side in the grass but she pushed him back when it happened.   And I think it must the frightened me so that I put it right out of my head that is the most difficult thing I can remember in my childhood.  That's it.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Well, it sounds like a wonderful childhood (laughter).
Speaker 2: I know my wife's said it's ridiculously untrue (laughter) but, you know, hey it's mine.  So I that's how I see it but anyway.
Story_ID: 120274
Speaker 1: Okay well, well tell us about school where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: I went to a grade school, it's called Delafield Elementary in Warren County [Kentucky], and it changed its name to H.D. Carpenter when I was in the eighth grade.  From there I went into the city.  County kids that went into the city because they only, the one consolidated school for black kids.  And I went to High Street High School [Bowling Green, Kentucky], which I loved.  Great high school, great basketball team, great band, great friends.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: We still see each other when I go Bowling Green [Kentucky].
Speaker 1: Okay, now in, in grade school were, were the school still segregated when you went there?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I went to a school of four rooms that set up on white pillows that you could go up under the school if you dared and played and play in the dirt.  I never did that (laughter) as you could imagine.  But lot of people went up under that school and played in the dirt because that's--and wind would blow up under that, that thing.  It would be we had holes in some of the, some of the boards and we had to go get coal and kindling.  I was a part of that group, coal and wood I guess you'd call it, for the fires in the, in the winter.  Now I'm not that old but that's the kind school I went to.  We had outhouses in the back way up in the back in the field and boys were on the right side and girls on the left.  And we had four teachers and I can remember their names: Mrs. Dorsey was for first and second; Mrs. Poole, second and third; Mrs. Hudson, fifth and six.  And Mrs. Cole was the principal, seven and eighth and that's how I went to elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what kind of student were you and what did you like in school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, as the elementary student I was pretty good.  I always got A's and B's.  High school, same.  A's and B's and finished, I think I was like third in my high school class.  Loved high school was in the band and chorus all music.  High school was fun for me I didn't have a big problem.  College became--I didn't do too well. I went to Western Kentucky [University in Bowling Green, Kentucky]; I really did not want to go to Western, and I did not do well.  I showed up for the exams, but I passed them.  I did get out in four years, which most people couldn't say.
Speaker 1: Okay now I don't want to take, take you too far (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay I only want to talk about (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Grade school for a minute (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Okay grade school, okay grade school okay (laughter). But (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay grade school okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, did you have any teachers during your grade school days that really made a tremendous impact on you, you know?
Speaker 1: Yes, I think Mrs. Hudson, who was a very difficult teacher but she had taught my mother [Mary Anderson Austin] and father [Herschel Austin, Sr.] too.  But she taught ancient history and I remember that was the first course, first class, that I had that I was in love with.  I read that book--it was a yellow book, thick book.  I think I read it I read it through first or second night that I had the book about the pharaohs and all that.  I was just--that thing fascinated me.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the book, do you remember?
Speaker 1: I don't know, I think it was call ancient, "Ancient Societies" or something like that.  And I kept--it's still in my room.  I think at, at my house in Bowling Green [Kentucky].  I just--it was the first time I remember falling in love with the book.  And fallen in love with words and ideas and things like that 'cause before that I think it was pretty mundane.  You know, it was Alice and Jerry and God knows nobody could fall in love with Alice, Jerry and Jip (laughter). I mean, you know, that's what that was all about you know.  And then Kentucky history was all right but I wasn't all that interested.  But (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: They taught Kentucky history?
Speaker 1: Uh-hum, and by the time I got to the seventh grade we did Kentucky history.  It was called "The Dark and Bloody", "The Dark and Bloodied Ground" something like that (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Really.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum, uh-huh yeah.  But ancient, the ancient history thing I just loved it.
Story_ID: 120275
Speaker 1: Now was there an attempt during this time to teach any black history within the context of ancient history?
Speaker 2: No, what they did--we--I remember we had on our walls about three or four old photographs, big ones though like I have in my living--those are paintings, though.  But, Booker T. Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and George Washington in the various rooms.  And every now and then someone would do a lesson on "this is the great Booker T. Washington," you know.   And I do remember that or "this is a great emancipator" but there was no course, so there was no class that was devoted then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: And I'd never heard of W.E.B. Du Bois, maybe they didn't like him too much because (laughter) they didn't, they didn't talk about him.
Speaker 1: Booker T. Washington was the major (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Booker T. Washington, now Washington, yes.
Speaker 1: I know that near, near you was the--now I just found this out in recent years were something called Paducah Industrial School [now West Kentucky Community and Technical College, Paducah, Kentucky]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --which I think was modeled after the Tuskegee type--
Speaker 2: I had two uncles who went there one for masonry and one for barber.
Speaker 1: All right, well I think it's now closed it's been closed for some years now, I think yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and when we were in high school we went there for field day.  Every year they had a big track, and track meet for the area high schools.  Black high schools, we would go down to Paducah [Kentucky] for that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, so the ancient history I mean why do you think it, it really connected with you?
Speaker 2: You know, I have no idea except it took me so totally out of my life.
Story_ID: 120276
Speaker 1: You know, being there in, in the country in Kentucky and I tell you one thing I remember about as a kid, it was so dark.  I wanted to go to a city so bad.  That's the one thing I knew as a child: that I would not be living in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  I didn't care what was there I was going to live in Washington [D.C.] or Dayton [Ohio] or, or 'cause I'd seen these cities with lights.   Even Louisville [Kentucky] would've been better.  I just hated when we were in, in Jonesville [Kentucky] we had kind of this moonlight.  I mean, you'd walk home from church some nights, you know, have a little tiny lights, and you'd (laughter) be walking in the dark.  So I did not want that.  I didn't like that; I didn't like the dark.
Speaker 2: I often wondered how people'd do that and, you know, visiting that, that part of Kentucky and other places in the South.  I mean, does the moon actually provide enough light to see?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh absolutely, I mean, but it would be pitch black sometimes, I mean, just if it's cloudy.  I mean, so if you got caught out after dark, you just had to know your way through those puddles and holes (laughter).  If you were on your way home from something like 'cause I would have choir rehearsal sometimes, so that would be late at night.  Now usually they would--the Reverend would, you know, take me home sometimes you would brave enough to say I'll walk.  You'd walk up the road, and you might have three or four crazy people with you and that was fun.  You know, so you'd play games with each other and scare each other.  And we did that a lot make the girls scream and claim you see something (laughter) but you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Carry a, carry a light with you or something?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah we have a little flashlight or something maybe.  And then eventually we got little this little tiny lights that they finally but they were far, you know, really far apart.  But for a while there, there was nothing.  It was just pitch black except for people houses, there would be a light coming.  Well, I knew then what I tell you we could see every star.  And I made a real thing with watching the stars.  I still love that today, you know, the constellations--the big dipper little dipper all of that I could do that but it give you a lot of time to think.  But I knew I did not want to live in that darkness, and I can only--don't ask me why.  But that's something I remember I wanted to go to the light so when people talking about they want a garden, or they want to go to the country.  I'm like well go right ahead (laughter).  I've been there done that.  I want to stay right here in Washington, D.C., you know, I may retire to Bowling Green, now that they have lights.  But this I love, I love city life; I love city lights.
Story_ID: 120277
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now high school and now it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: High school was again fun.
Speaker 1: Was, was it still segregated when you was there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Still segregated, very segregated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All of us came in from the county into the city, but it was also segregated by blacks.  City kids were in their own homeroom and we county kids who were lesser (laughter) we were in--really we were in our homeroom.  So they made a difference between the two groups: those of us from the county were rural kids who were kind of, you know, country-looking and the kids from the city.
Speaker 1: Was there an educational difference in terms of what you knew?
Speaker 2: No, we were better than they were I think but they kept--we were separated through that period.  You know, the county kids were on one side, and city kids were on another.
Speaker 1: You think it may have had to do with budget?
Speaker 2: I don't know what it had to do with.
Speaker 1: The line items in the budget or something, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I don't know why they did that, but that's, that's how it was done.  And, you know, our buses would come in brings us, and we were go to our homeroom, and the city kids would all go to their homeroom.  So we knew there was a difference.  And there was a difference.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how, how many students were in school with you?
Speaker 2: I would say maybe 350 in the high school altogether.
Speaker 1: Oh that's not too bad, you know, that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yep, not huge.
Speaker 1: What would you guess would be the number that actually would finish graduating?
Speaker 2: Graduating in my class there were thirty-two.  We started off with 100 and something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But in those days, lotta kids would fall out with work just on those farms and things.  I didn't do that, but a lot of the kids in county areas did.  So, you know, by the time you got there, you know, you'd lost a good number of people.
Story_ID: 120278
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were there any teachers there that were mentors or, or did you or made you excited about something they were teaching?
Speaker 2: Well yes I was very--I think I was more impressed with her, her name was Mrs.--you'll find this interesting--her name was Mrs. Claudia Nichols I think that was the name; Claudia, I think that's the name.  I can remember Mrs. Nichols.  She was my English teacher from Dayton, Ohio--Chillicothe, Ohio, with a beautiful voice.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's like a, a place where blacks been a long time, Chillicothe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah and her husband was from there.  His name was Professor Nicholas.  He taught French.  She taught English.  And she was just so didactic I had never met anyone so perfect, you know.  And she would follow--we have what we called exercises in this thing that.  And she would follow every exercise just as it was written and very precise.  I mean, the period, the comma I learned how to be directed toward being precise.  But she would not let you go to the next exercise until you have finished it.   And there were kids crying at graduation who could not graduate.  I mean, they--in order for them to graduate that night they had to come and redo those exercises that they had done wrong.  She would not relent so you learn early don't mess with Mrs. Nichols because you will not (laughter) graduate.  And she was very quiet, very pretty lady.  She was old when I got there.  She never raised her voice but she just meant what she said.  And she would say, "You have time to do this.  It has to be done," and she would tell you, "Well, you know, Austin, you are three exercises behind"--activities they were called.  Now I was never behind, I'm just giving (laughter) you this--But she would let you know up front that you were, you know.  So but you have to do this for you to go on.  And she meant it, so something about that I absolutely loved about Mrs. Nichols.  I learned--I don't that I learned a lot, I'll tell her in English.  I certainly learned that you have to perform, and you did it to a standard.  And she didn't, you know, she didn't let anybody by.  You know, she, she failed people, and even then there was social promotion, not a lot.  Not with--her name was Alroma, Alroma, Alroma Nichols.  We used to call her Romy (laughter).
Speaker 1: Alroma.
Speaker 2: Alroma Nichols, but she let no one by and I'd, I-it was a great lesson for me.  And I've tried to actually sort of live by that, that you have to set some standards in your life.  Some things that you will not give into, that you will just say.  And my own kids, you know, this is a, this is something we won't give in to we eat dinner together we always have, we always will.  That's just a standard for us.  And they now do that, they now tell us well, you know, so we set--you know, they but you set that, and it becomes a habit with you.  And I think she helped a whole generation of young people in Bowling [Kentucky] to succeed just by learning how to show up and do what you're supposed to do and don't complain about it.  You know, and just do it.  And I really, I really credit Mrs. Nichols for that.
Story_ID: 120279
Speaker 1: Okay, were you involved in high school activities?  Did they have clubs or-now, now you were a musician?
Speaker 2: I was in, well I was in a band.  I was in a chorus; I was in anything with writing, I was in that.  I--nothing athletic 'cause I wasn't good at it.  My brother was great at football, basketball, and track.  I, I was not so I didn't--I never tried to do anything I couldn't do.  I wasn't one of those kinda people; I didn't wanna make a fool of myself.  I certainly engaged in all of those activities.  I was in the drama thing.  We had plays.  Junior, senior plays I was, I was the lead in that.
Speaker 1: What, what plays were you the lead in?
Speaker 2: The one I can remember was a senior play and it was called "This Ghost Business," oh my god, I can't believe I actually remember.  And I was the lead character in "This Ghost Business" (laughter) at the time my, my best friend was a big fat guy (laughter) named John.  And he played the maid, and I tell you he was hilarious (laughter).
Speaker 1: He played the maid?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) he played the maid, it was the funniest thing it was so good, we did it two nights in a row.  We had, (laughter) we had to come back.  But we had tragedy in that because young lady named Carolyn [ph.], who was dating one of my distant cousins, was playing, it was about a ghost, you know, this whole thing was about ghosts.  The young man that she was dating was killed the morning of our play in a car accident, was killed in a car accident by a Greyhound bus, killed him and we thought we were gonna have to cancel the play.  And we were prepared to do it, and she came and people talking about troopers this girl played her part like nothing I have ever seen did it two nights in a row.  I will never forget that.  That was a kinda valor and courage like we had just never seen 'cause we were all so, oh god we can't do the play but we understand.  And she said no, we're gonna do the play.  So she did it, I will never forget that. Just fantastic, it really was.  But that's all I did in high school.  High school was fun, but I didn't do a lot of--also don't forget, we lived in the country, so I had to get back home.  Sometimes I would walk and sometimes my--lots of the time my mother [Mary Anderson Austin] would pick me up and she would also take to school, and she would pick me up and bring and take me home back out to Jonesville [Kentucky].
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you have like a did you have a prom and that sort of stuff when you were (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes, I was president of the junior class, I was always a class officer.  And we had a junior prom and a senior prom.  At our school, the juniors gave the seniors a prom.  I can't remember what the junior prom--or can I.  One of the proms was called "moonlight and roses," I remember that 'cause I think I was in love at that point (laughter).  And actually I have pictures of that.  And we wore white tux--
Speaker 1: Tux, tuxedoes.
Speaker 2: White dinner, dinner jackets.  And we decorated the gym with roses.  From our home and places like that, we had a fountain.  It was very nice very pretty, we did a good job with that so, yeah.  We did it a nice, the junior class I was the junior class president.  Senior class, I think I was the vice president for the senior class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 120280
Speaker 1: Now what I neglected to ask you earlier was when, when did you start playing the piano I know you started when you was about?
Speaker 2: I was about, well I actually my first formal music lesson I was in the second grade.  Went to a man named Professor Wilson.  I had to go into Bowling Green [Kentucky] for those lessons and, and all through that period I was taking music.  We had people who my parents would bring to the house and they bought me a piano.  And in those days that was something, bought me a piano and they would come to me, and then the kids would come to my house sometimes and have their music lesson at, at our house.  'Cause Professor whoever was coming through town and they would--that's when the lady decided it was too--I to--it wasn't stable enough and I needed to go to Western [Kentucky University].  Then when I went to Western [Kentucky University, Bowling Green, Kentucky] it was a, you know, I just went there and studied for about--till I was in twelfth grade (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's when I started.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had these supplemental piano lessons, now what did you play in the band?
Speaker 2: Drums, can you believe that.  My mother [Mary Anderson Austin] was like drums? (Laughter) but that's what I want to play, so I played the drums.  I was good too (laughter).
Story_ID: 120281
Speaker 1: So when you were a senior in high school what were your career aspirations?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a social worker or a concert pianist, but I never told people that I wanted to be a concert pianist.  That sounded a little too funny even for Bowling Green [Kentucky] (laughter).  So I had enough sense to keep that to myself, in my own heart that's what I thought I was going to do.  So when I went to Western Kentucky [University, Bowling Green, Kentucky], even though I wanted to go to Fisk [University in Nashville, Tennessee], and I tried to convince my parents [Mary Anderson Austin and Herschel Austin, Sr.] but Western had to open up a year or two earlier and I live right down the hill from Western.  I mean, I could hear the bands playing every--at every football game that's how close we were to Western.  And that gave us light out there in the darkness too, when they lit those-- when they lit the field up; it was way up on the hill.  But I really wanted to go to Fisk but they did not want me to do that, so I went to Western Kentucky. I did what my parents told me.
Speaker 1: Now why did you wanna, did, did you have contacts at Fisk?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the librarian at my school had gone to Fisk and I loved her very much.  Very nice lady.  And my aunt had attended briefly, and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, well tell us about Western.  Now Western is right in Bowling Green [Kentucky]--
Speaker 2: Right in Bowling Green.  It's between Bowling Green and Jonesville [Kentucky].
Speaker 1: And will you'd been living on the outs--
Speaker 2: And right, I could see it every day from--I didn't know what it was as a little boy just look like a whole lot of buildings on a hill.  And eventually, you know, became--I had become aware that it was the teachers college.  You went there to become a teacher.
Speaker 1: Now it was cheaper.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, a state school.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and my dad says, you know, "It's integrated now, you know.  I don't have to pay it very much money, and you could go there," and I did that.
Speaker 1: This is 1962?
Speaker 2: I finished since '62 [1962] and went to Western in 1962.
Story_ID: 120282
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Well, tell us about Western Kentucky [University, Bowling Green, Kentucky].
Speaker 2: Well Western Kentucky was an eye opener for me.  It was my first real unhappy moment in my life.  To each of us some rain must fall.  Mine started to come in but get when I went to Western Kentucky.  I never felt so alone and so put upon and so I just could not understand how people didn't like me.  I mean, I had been like all of my life I just was floored by this.  You know, walk into a classroom and people would move.  I had that happen to me on more than one occasion.  Meet some, you know, relatively nice person in this crazy world and then they wouldn't speak to you outside of class.  If they would ask, you to pay something or something but you see them straight ahead.  You know, so you had to learn I did all these--and there were people I guess who weren't as stupid as I was, but I had to learn how not to do that.  It was painful for me now after the first, second year I didn't care anymore.  You know, you know you get pretty hard, rejection has a way of hardening you.  And I can see that plays out through life you know, you will not do this to me very often.  You know (laughter) I have enough sense to learn from this, and I learned and I said okay that's fine.  And I didn't I, I really was not antisocial.  I actually joined a fraternity.  I was invited.  At that time there were two great basketball player there: Clem Haskins and Dwight Smith, they came the same year.  I think the last--I think they may have come a year after I did.
Speaker 1: And that's something that just for me to just editorialize a minute there (laughter).  The great Western Kentucky basketball team--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, the Hilltoppers.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Hilltoppers.  They, they seemingly came out of nowhere in the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] tournaments of the, of the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s].  And they had, they had teams that would take some of the top teams--
Speaker 2: Dominate.
Speaker 1: --to the wire right, you know, (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And great--and then the Smith brothers, Dwight and Greg Smith and Clem Haskins--
Speaker 2: Clem Haskins.
Speaker 1: --was an All-American ball player.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, fabulous.
Speaker 1: Jim McDaniels later on in the '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: McDaniels, McDaniels right.
Speaker 1: --you know, was the seven-foot guy that shot three-quarters, but it was, it was a great.
Speaker 2: Great basketball dynasty.
Speaker 1: You had some great teams.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The Hilltoppers, they act--they wanted them, they really did want those basketball players.  Those of us who were not doing that, I don't think they could (laughter), they could have cared less if we lived or died.  But--
Speaker 1: This is also a state that--where the, the principle sports team in Kentucky was the University of Kentucky [Lexington, Kentucky].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Adolf Rupp and Ripley would--tried to stay all white as long as possible.
Speaker 2: As long as they could, well, you know, [Edgar Allen] Diddle did too.  He was the coach at Western, but they relented early 'cause they wanted to win.  And these guys came in and they won for them they did.  And that's how I became friends with them at that time.  So we did, we joined A[lpha] Phi Omega.  And I had really one or two really good friends there who were both black and white.  Very small circle, though.
Speaker 1: You said you joined what now, what was it?
Speaker 2: Alpha Phi Omega, it's a service fraternity, and they were white, but they invited Dwight, Clem, myself.  A man, a young man, was already in it named Ed Goins.  And I can't think of the other people, I think there were about five of us who actually wound up joining, joining and it was very nice.  'Cause we had good fun, it was social--those young men were quite daring to go against the prevailing winds of that white institution in those days.  But I will also say this, Western was not overtly anything.  I think that's what Kentucky is, people don't go out of their way to harm you or hurt you.  I was just the kind of person who wasn't used to rejection.  And I was, they never did anything actually to me.  No one ever hit me on the head or called me nigger.  I don't ever remember that or--but it was just that wall of silence or, you know, not speaking to you when I saw, you know.  When, you know that was just something I wasn't used to and didn't like it and wanted to get outta there as fast as possible.  And I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 120686
Speaker 1: So all right Western Kentucky [University, Bowling Green, Kentucky], and so well I do know that Dwight Smith died when you all were in school.
Speaker 2: He died when I was at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] in a, in a car accident he and his sister.  But I, I do want to say in, you know, in retrospect as you grow older I have grown quite fond of Western Kentucky.  They've been very kind to me.  They've named me alumni of the year and so forth.  And, and I think it was just a part of the era that we were going through.  And, and the fact that I wasn't quite prepared, I mean, we were not what we call prepared integrators.  No one came to prepare us to go to Western Kentucky like, you know.  They might've prepared people to go to University Of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama], and all that and so I just think we fended--do the best we could for ourselves.  There was no NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or anything like that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --o help you navigate that you had to do that on your own (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: And now we're at an age when psychologists are assigned to schools--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to help people through traumas.
Speaker 2: Right, we didn't have anything like that.
Speaker 1: And it's was nothing like that then.
Speaker 2: No, no.  So I think it was a great lesson for me and I learned a lot.
Story_ID: 120687
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] next right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now that's where I (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: You got a chance to really go right?
Speaker 2: Yeah and Fisk was like a whole new world.  I thought I've actually died and gone to heaven.  I had never seen girls this beautiful in my entire, in my entire life, I mean, it--that place was like--it was just it just the most beautiful people I'd ever seen.
Speaker 1: That must really be true [W.E.B.] Du Bois said the same thing in, in "The Souls of Black Folks."
Speaker 2: Oh, it was just amazing.  I had just never seen anything like it, and I even called my mother [Mary Anderson Austin] and said, "I think this place must be heaven (laughter)."  It's just amazing what it looks like.  And they were all--unlike me they were also sophisticated, I mean, they were coming from these big cities.  And for the first time I was, you know, I liked who I was, certainly, you know, I mean, I had enough country me to do that.  For the first time in my life, I know I saw what it could be like if you moved to different levels in education because most of them were, you know, the kids of the elite.  You know, they had doctors and lawyers and that kind of thing and we were more, you know, landed, you know, country people.  But--very nice, they were very kind.  I mean, I've heard lots of stories but that is not what I felt when I went there.  It was open I had lots of friends made good friends.  I had joined Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, I mean just--I had a great time at Fisk University.  I only have one bad, crazy roommate but (laughter) I got rid of him soon (laughter) and got a really great one.  But that place now that changed the course of my academic life because I did a master's in sociology there under the Dr. J. Masuoka [Jitsuichi Masuoka], who studied under the famous Dr. [Robert] Park.  As you know, Robert Park retired from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] to Fisk where they created the great Fisk University Race Relations Institute and the department of sociology, so I study there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yeah he's called the father of sociology.
Speaker 2: He's the father of sociology.
Speaker 1: And, and who the other one doc, doctor?
Speaker 2: Masuoka was one of his students.
Speaker 1: Masuoka is, is he from?
Speaker 2: Masuoka is Japanese.
Speaker 1: Japanese.
Speaker 2: From Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Fisk got a very, I would say a cosmopolitan teaching staff in those days.  You know you got all kind of people there working and, and still do.  But, and, and for me it was really a very cosmopolitan.   I had never even seen a Japanese much less (laughter) to be taught by one.  He called me "Dummkopf" [German word for idiot] most days (laughter)--but 'cause he was quite difficult.  But as, you know, Charles S. Johnson was the first black president of Fisk was also a very famous sociologist.  And he had established that department and Dr. Park came there.  So it's a great tradition, and I wanted to be in that tradition.  And I--and then so it, it served me for the rest of my life being a part of that great tradition there at Fisk in sociology.  So that's where I was for two years.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, so you, you came out of Fisk in (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968], okay.
Speaker 1: You know, Fisk had been very involved in all the civil rights activities down there with SNCC [Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee] and so forth.  The year I graduated was the year that [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed, that April [1968].  And actually the, the Tennessee National Guard bivouac was right outside of my apartment.  We had had an apartment right off of Jefferson Street.  Very frightening thing.  They went on campus and actually wounded two students that, that evening because they were throwing rocks, and they were very upset.  People were--I was upset for the first time in my life, I was truly upset by it.  I guess I was in--I knew--where people were talking about it and here was this great man of peace.  I mean Dr. King was a man of peace and to shoot him like that--I guess we thought it could happen, but I was at the age where I truly understood it.  And I was just, I was very angry for the first time in my life; I was really angry at white people.  I mean that I that--I think it made you angry because what you thought, what you knew was they knew better.  They knew that this was going to happen and that there--they really didn't care to protect Dr. King.  That's how I feel about it I just, you know.  I think, I think they thought it would go away and, of course, that's not how life is.  That's not how history plays itself out.  But I was among those kinda throwing rocks and very upset about what, what had happened during that period.  So, yeah I, I had a good experience there but I also had an awakening there both academically and I think socially as well and politically.
Story_ID: 120688
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers on camp--well you name a couple of those but, but who is (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, mainly because we were cloistered in the department of sociology [at Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  I, I had two I thought were really outstanding, superior--I well Dr. [Jitsuichi] Masuoka was superior; it's no doubt about that.  And then Dr. [Raytha L.] Yokley was outstanding I had him, and then Dr. Onwuachi, who was an anthropologist.
Speaker 1: Okay, P. Chike Onwuachi.
Speaker 2: Yes, you know him, well okay.  Yeah well, he taught me.  Taught me anthropology and I was very (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yokley, I've heard of Yokley too, I've heard of him (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah he's from Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And taught me--those three were very instrumental in helping to form and shape my social imagination for the work that I was to do later on.  But (laughter) a good story about Dr., Dr., Ma, Masuoka they still probably should've kept Dr. Masuoka there he would've saved them a lot of money.  He wouldn't let us use the computer cards.  He made us draw.  He got paper, little-boxed paper, you know.  And fixed this huge poster and put it up against the wall and, and we had the code it by, by hand (laughter).  And that's how we did our--we correlated our materials that we had (laughter).  He said it was a waste of money to give us these cards, so I learned how to do it by hand.  If you could imagine this (laughter).  We would it wasn't funny when I was doing it, but this was a great lesson in, in the end.
Story_ID: 120689
Speaker 1: Okay, now who were some of the students--I know there was there was a lot of acti--civil rights activity [at Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]; I don't know who was still there when you were around.  I think most--the sit-ins were over with and all that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Sit-ins were over with when I got there but (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Was Lawson Doc--I mean Reverend [James Morris] Lawson still around?
Speaker 2: I think he was still there, I know that [HM] Nikki Giovanni was still there.  Don't for--that was in the period black power stuff.  So Nikki Giovanni was still there, there was some kids out of, out of California, can't think of their names, they were still there.  We had a lot more people coming through like Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture]; I think [Eldrigde] Cleaver may have come through there.  At the time, I was there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Was Gerald McWorter [Abdul Alkalimat] there?
Speaker 2: Gerald taught me, Gerald McWorter taught me.  Oh gosh, I'm forgetting Gerald McWorter's taught me, and so did Dr. Williams, who, both of 'em went to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  They came the year I went to Fisk, Gerald McWorter, and I can't think of Dr. Williams's first name.  Oh, they were so sharp and cool I wanted to be just like them (laughter).  Actually Gerald McWorter eventually took over the university library (laughter).  'Caused great consternation to the university.  But I'm trying to think--oh John Oliver Killens came there as a professor in residence.  David Driskell was there; I didn't study with David but I, I--he was there at the time.  And we've become very good friends now that I'm here in town.  But Professor Killens I studied with Professor Killens.  He, both there and here when he came here: writing and writing techniques.  And Phillipa Thompson [ph.], who was very much involved in the civil right activities, she was from Chicago, her father was a minister there in Chicago.  Phillipa's now here in town; she was very much involved.  I can't name them all, but that's there was a milieu there of both intellectuals who were teaching and working there like Killens and [HM David] Driskell and Arna Bontemps was still there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: I see he's on the library right?
Speaker 2: Honored to see him, yeah.  They were all still there, and you could feel these people that had really shaped and touched history.  But just, just an unbelievable place really, just unbelievable.
Speaker 1: Now did you still play the piano any at this point?
Speaker 2: No, I had stopped by that time because I decided when I was at Western, that I was not going to be good enough to do what I wanted to do.  And so I then began to focus on economics and sociology.  And I am glad I did because I wind up--I would've probably been a second rate music teacher somewhere (laughter), and I didn't want to do that.  So very happy with my choice.
Story_ID: 120690
Speaker 1: Okay, so what happened next, what happen when you--?
Speaker 2: Well while I was at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], I ran across a book called the--what's it called "Black Jews of Harlem."  "Black Jews of Harlem" had been written by a man named Howard Brotz.  And I thought he was the clearest--I had never read anyone as clear about race relations and leadership in my life.  And didn't realize where he was at the time but a flyer came to the school from McMaster University [Hamilton, Ontario, Canada]; it's like--all like the world sometimes, I do believe this, the world sometimes just works for you.  There was this flyer that came in and I--it was in the fall I hadn't decided what I was gonna do.  And I saw this flyer, and it said west of--McMaster University and then it said how much the fellowship was.  And I said, "Oh that sounds interesting," and it said, you know, Canada.  And I said, "Well I don't wanna do" and I read down and it said, it gave the name of the professors in the department.  And there was his name Professor Howard Brotz, author, you know.  And I said, "I wonder what would happen if I apply."  So I asked Dr. Masuoka, he said--for one he thought it was a good idea, he said, "that the good idea."  And he, he didn't know him but we had a professor there named John Lewis well-known sociologist who had done a lot of field work with Dr., Dr. Johnson, and John Lewis knew him.  Louis Johnson, Louis Johnson, I'm sorry Dr. Louis Johnson knew Brotz well.  And the two of them got together; I did my proposal and my letter, sent it to Dr. Brotz who was then at McMaster.  He was no longer at the New School for Social Research.  And I--it was just within months they wrote back and said yes.  Gave me a full fellowship, 10,000 for about--I think it was like seven or $8000 a year; paid for everything.  Paid me a salary--I mean I taught it was just like a godsend.  And I went to work for Howard Brotz as a graduate student.  But little did I know when I got there he had only had one graduate student before because he did not like working with students and was he difficult.  But he took me because he--what I, what I wrote to him what I said to him he said, "I think you will be very important for how I see sociology and the African American and so I'm, I'm willing to work with you if you're willing to work hard."  By this time, I was already sitting in Canada.  So I said, of course, I said, "Yeah I'd be glad to."  Little did I know I'd be his personal slave about two years, but that's how graduate school is anyway.  But boy was he an eye-opener.  I, I will tell you that I learned a lot of things, one of which is how to drink a martini with nothing in it but vodka and how to write.  Now when I--my first papers, I had not cried since I was a little boy--now this is the truth, and I hate to admit this on camera.  My first two papers that I gave him--he gave them back to me, I went back to my apartment, and I cried.  I just couldn't believe it, and I mean I because I was thought I, I was pretty well-educated but not to the level of what he expected.  And he had a way--he was a New York Jew, and he would say, "I'm a New York Jew."  So I say it, and he had a way of cutting you that--and it would it would be piercing, you know, but he didn't mean it that he meant it for your good.  And it was for your good but it was like, "Oh my God can I take this?"  I mean, I knew people in this class who would just get up and just, they'd have to go out (laughter) 'cause he could be so intense and so brilliant.  I mean he was truly brilliant.
Story_ID: 120691
Speaker 1: So I think to have stood under him [Howard Brotz] for three years and then for him to have become my friend--I mean, he will call me on a regular basis used to come visit me and my children--said a lot about my growth and development from Fisk [University in Nashville, Tennessee], to, to working with him because he truly was a genius of a person.  It--I, I hate that he is not as well long known as he should be because his work truly is more in line with what I think most African Americans would, would like.  Even though he was not a, he didn't internalize you.  I mean, he was he would be very difficult about how he thought we ought to core about it--he was a conservative.  And a lot of blacks didn't like him because he did work on South Africa.  And he didn't always agree that what happened in South Africa should have happened the way it did.  But that's academic; you and can do that but you can still take from people if they are honest, an honest appraisal or something.  You don't have to agree with them.  I did not agree with him, and we had great fights about that.  But what he was for, he was a liberal in the true sense of the word.  What liberal it means individual and individualistic type person that you don't you can't make it by doing group things in a democracy you have to deal with the, the individual.  And of course, as blacks were far more group-oriented because we think the group has to progress and then you deal with the individual later.  But anyway I learned a lot from him and, actually changed my life.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah it sounds like an interesting (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Oh, it was real tutelage one on one for three years.
Speaker 2: So he, he actually he--I would suppose he heard about the black Jews of Harlem while live living in New York [City, New York].
Speaker 1: Living in New York.  He was very proud of them, thought they were a perfect example--he was not if, if you read his, this work here.  You will see he was not a great admirer of [W.E.B] Du Bois.  He was a great admirer of [Booker T.] Washington and a great admirer of, of--
Speaker 2: [Marcus] Garvey?
Speaker 1: Garvey.
Speaker 2: Yep, I, I know Rabbi [Arnold Josiah] Ford of the Black Jews of Harlem is the one who--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --wrote the anthem for UNIA [Universal Negro Improvement Association].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's who he studied (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And became their good friend.  He thought Du Bois was on the wrong track, but he thought that Washington and Garvey were on the right track.  He was all about self-help and how self-help created a nationalism that, you know, and that blah, blah, blah.  I was on the other side of the fence, but that's why we worked well together, he didn't ever try to change me, but we have great arguments about the whole thing, yeah.  That's where, that where I went with him.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright.  It's interesting like Johnson, [Charles] Spurgeon Johnson had a lot of association with, with Garvey I've seen key people that were associated on the Garvey movement (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yes, he did.
Speaker 2: Including Arthur Schomburg, who he trained accurately to (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Oh I didn't even notice that.
Speaker 2: To curate his collection.  Schomburg [Center For Research in Black Culture] collected the books, but Spurgeon Johnson brought him there for a year to have him train in the physical library.
Speaker 1: Really, now, you know, I did not know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was there for a year.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, okay.
Speaker 2: To learn how, how to, you know, minister the archive, you know, 'cause he didn't know anything about, you know, professional archiving or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that's just a little bit of something but.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 120692
Speaker 1: Well let's move on now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We, we got you here in Hamilton [Ontario, Canada] oh, oh it's--having been raised in the United States in [Jonesville] Kentucky.  And then going to school in Nashville [Tennessee at Fisk University], more urban situation and then going to a place like Hamilton, Ontario.  Was that did you find Hamilton different from--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I found Canada different even though it's very much like the United States.  I've--the people were very open very kind, and I liked that very much.  And then there were lots of people from all over the world who were there.  I met my--who was become my wife [Joy Ford] later on at the, the university there in Hamilton; she's from Guyana.  Lots of young people from throughout the [British] Commonwealth countries went to McMaster [University, Hamilton, Ontario] too--for their undergrad or their graduate work.  So it opened up again a whole 'nother world for me.  That's the international world, so I went from Fisk where it came from a more cosmopolitan than in the United States, these big cities and then moving to, to Canada where the world so it was open to me.  So lots of kids from England; my roommates were all English one was--had studied in England.  But he was Chinese from Hong Kong, became my best friend.  So I just developed this whole new world of people and then all of them have been very good to me.  I remain friends with most of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now, now what, what did you do next?
Speaker 2: I married. No, (laughter) no, I finished I finished McMaster about three and half years came back here to teach at Georgetown University where I was the first (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: So McMaster though you got your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: I got a Ph.D. there, yes in sociology.  And I came back to wash--I didn't come back to the United States and came back to Washington [D.C.]. Not back, I keep saying back came to Washington 'cause I had never been here before.  I couldn't live in New York [City, New York].  I wanted to; actually I got a job there, but I was hoping that Joy and I would get married and she didn't want to live in New York.  And so I came to Georgetown where I was the first full-time black professor, assistant professor at Georgetown University.  On the faculty of the undergraduate school and that was in '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Now that's significant.
Speaker 2: That's very significant (laughter).  I didn't realize that myself till not long ago.  But I was the only first now there were people who did part-time but I was first full-time in the department of sociology.  And then I became chairman of the department that summer but I left because I wanted to go to the Urban League.  And I had felt that I had missed the whole civil rights movement by being a little too Kentucky and I wanted to get into some part of it.  And so I talked to Bob Hill, who was then the head of the sociology department, and I came over to work in the--at the Urban League.  But in the meantime I got married.  The year that I left Georgetown I married Joy Ford, Joy Lolita Ford, and we came back here to, to Washington [D.C.] to live.
Story_ID: 120693
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you worked with the National Urban League when you was (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yes I was--I worked--I went to the National Urban League as a research associate, did my first--study there which I have, and it was sent around the country called population policy in the black community.  'Cause in those days, the whole thing about Tuskegee [experiments] and the--we were among the first to talk about that in, in this book which I have here that it was a mimeographed book.  It around the country about 1000 or more copies were sent around.  It was a Ford Foundation grant, and we did relatively well with that and from there I asked Bob and, and he in turn talked with [HM] Mr. [Vernon] Jordan.  And they listen to my concept for a national policy journal.  At that time, there was not at that time there were a lot of things out "Black Books Bulletin" was out.  There was a guy who did a piece out in California, not Staples, but I forget the name (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: "Black Scholar?"
Speaker 2: "Black Scholar" is out (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: You talking 'bout yeah Robert Crisman (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And the two Roberts we called them (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And [HM] Nathan Hare was involved (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Nathan Hare yeah right but there was no puppet there no policy journal.  So the "Urban League review" became the policy journal for the people at that time and great, was a big hit did really well.  And lasted about thirteen years and tell you a story about that when we get to that Kellogg [Foundation] part (laughter).  But I was very young I was about twenty-eight and I was the editor of the Urban League Review and I thought I was everything (laughter).
Speaker 1: You were doing it.
Speaker 2: I was doing it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Bout what year is this, this is about?
Speaker 2: This is about 1974.
Speaker 1: Okay 1974, okay.
Speaker 2: When the first edition came out.
Story_ID: 120694
Speaker 1: It's now, now Washington D.C., around in the early '70s [1970s] as I remember--I was here a quite a bit for conferences Black African heritage study (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, everybody was here.
Speaker 1: And Negro life and history (unclear), (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: A lot of the groups from, you know, lot of meetings (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: In and out of D.C. and you were here when they had those huge African liberation (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, all those (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Yeah, [P. Chike] Onwuachi would--came to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] around that time. (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Came to Howard then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I used to see him here he left us at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and came to Howard now I think he went back he's now in Africa.
Speaker 1: Right he sure--yeah.  He was in--had something to do with Festac 77 [Lagos, Nigeria].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Went back to Nigeria.
Speaker 2: And he stayed.
Speaker 1: Right.  Yeah, well this is a--this is an exciting place to be in the early '70s [1970s] in terms of black studies (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: And anything to do with the black condition (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So many minds were here.
Speaker 2: We thought those days would never end.  And we thought we were doing something I guess we were, but it was fun.
Speaker 1: So when you say though you thought those days would never end, do you think they're really over?  I mean it's not really that kind of excitement anymore?
Speaker 2: Yeah, everything ends (laughter).  There's an energy, and there's a synergy that goes with that and then it has to rekindle itself in another frame and another lens.  And that's what we're searching for now we're in transition the whole world is in transition now.  And you have to transition with it because the all the mechanisms of constructs that create a world, create the world that you're in too, and you have to find a way to move your agenda on the stage of the world.  As well as your community, and it changes I mean we're so digitized.  Now with--your story goes around the world to quickly and you don't have time to even grasp it to write the script for it (laughter), you know.  They're telling it, and you're like no, no that's not quite, you know.  But in those days you had time to script and get it ready set it up, do it.  Now we just gotta find a new way of building that social infrastructure that allows us to do that.
Story_ID: 120695
Speaker 1: Yeah, "Black World" was still being pub, published then too.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Hoyt Fuller in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know Hoyt.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's ceased in '76 [1976, sic 1977].
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.
Speaker 1: So, so The Urban League Journal--your urban league is always been your training was very useful.  I suppose because of the statistical and now I since that you can bring to (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yes, right and policy look--policy, because in those days remember that was the Carter, and not well Carter came afterward.  Nixon, Carter era and see you had a lot of puppet policy, urban policy things being done.  You had the beginning of revenue sharing in all those things which cities needed to know about how to go about it.  And I did a piece on that was used widely politics was just beginning to bloom.  So these people needed to know how to handle certain kinds of things they hadn't had to do that before.  And so we were really able to be cutting edge with public policy issues, and that's what we did.  And so we were very excited about that and that's--it was a niche that the Urban League held for a very long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay now, now what happened?  You didn't stay there long though right?
Speaker 2: Well I stayed there about yeah I stayed there about four or five years and then I left.  But I remain the editor of the magazine for about eight or ten years really I still edited thing, the thing--the journal.  I didn't give that up even though I went to other jobs (laughter).  I held onto, I held onto the review because it was my life, you know, and I wanted to do it; I didn't want to give it up (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Eventually I did because I was doing something else, but I think I did about ten, ten, ten or eleven years at least.
Story_ID: 120696
Speaker 1: So about 1979 you left the Urban League and moved on to--?
Speaker 2: Yeah I moved on after that I--as I said I was married by that time.  And I had I had two children.  No, in '79 [1979] I had three children [Sushama Austin-Connor, Julian Austin, and Leah Austin] (laughter) by that time.  Two girls and a boy.  And I can't tell you where I went next, but I believe I went to--I can't tell you where I went next.  I have to think about it either I went to the Board of Higher Education here at in, in Washington [D.C.]. The board of higher education or I went to the humanities of--what was it called, [Joseph] Joe Duffey was the head of the Humanities Endowment maybe I went (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Oh National Endowment for [the] Humanities.
Speaker 2: National Endowment for Humanities--I think I went from there I'm, I'm not sure.  I have to think about this, and I wish I had a paper to look at because I get those eras a little bit confused because I, I was very interested in a number of things, but I think I went to the National Endowment for Humanities where I was his special consultant on American culture and became very involved in defining what the American common culture was.  Joe was great to me.  And I love being with him, and it was quite, quite an interesting period of time for me.  Got to meet a number of the major American intellectuals at that time, white and black.  I was able to bring them into the endowment and to discuss what is the American common culture and how can we make this, how can we make it work?  Does it work?  A lot of people did not like the idea that we were doing it, so I never publish the work from it.  But I intend to publish the work from it in the next two years, and it's called "Diversity and the American Common Culture." And so that's my--been my life work for a very long time: trying to define what the American common culture is.  And then I think I left Joe, and I went to work for Ron[ald Harmon] Brown at the Board of Higher Education, where I was the policy director for the consolidation of the three postsecondary schools here in, here in Washington, it's now called the University of the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.].  Ron Brown was the chairman of the board; I was policy director.  And so I oversaw the policy work in consolidating those three public postsecondary institutions.
Story_ID: 120697
Speaker 1: Okay, alright so you're your at UDC [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] at this point.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, I, I what--I was, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is, this is 19-what, '80s [1980s], something mid-'80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Mid--I guess it might've been mid '80s [1980s], early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe '79 [1979] actually and we were into consolidating those schools.  And so we consolidated all of postsecondary education, and Ron [Brown] led that.  And I was very happy to be a part of that.  And then I, I'd been at UDC off and on about at least three times.  Once as the executive director of the, of the board and then as a vice, a vice president off and on through the years.  I won't give you the years because I don't know what they are, but--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, that, that was--has been a big part of my life.  And I've enjoyed that tremendously.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Well, now when did you--and I'm I jumping ahead too far but when did you get involved in the Kellogg Foundation?
Speaker 2: No actually you are about on target.  After I did some work at--and I'll try to fill the same for you--I did some work at the university; I decided to go into consulting because I was really interested in this American culture stuff.  So I did a lot of consulting pieces, and I did a lot of writing, speech writing.  I'm speechwriter for Patricia Roberts Harris when she ran for mayor.  Very historic thing, you know, I was her speechwriter and issues director.  Same thing, I was an issues and speechwriter for [HM] Sharon Pratt Kelly, who became the mayor at the district--in the District of Columbia.  I was her speechwriter and at this time I was doing all of this consulting, trying to build up my understanding of the American common culture.  And I also edited the volumes that were the proceedings of the [Washington] D.C. statehood convention.  You know, there was a D.C. statehood convention here.  Very start and I was the, I oversaw all of the research and background work.  And I put together the verbatim testimony.  With the staff of about eight to ten people and that's published, and it's part of the archive here in the District of Columbia.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a very important (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Very important, and it was named New Columbia and I sat through all of those preceding, and I was the editor and re--head of the research department for that.  Very pleased to have been a part of that very historic moment in the District of Columbia if we ever get statehood, and I think we will.
Story_ID: 120698
Speaker 1: Then I eventually moved on; I went back to the university [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.].  But I got a fellowship, it's was called the W.K. Kellogg Leadership [Network] Fellowship.  And this leadership fellowship was the kind of thing where you had to work but you received a great deal of money.  And you did what I would call leadership development as a part of your growth and development.  You did a leadership plan or a life plan, and it was for three years.  And so I be, I became a Kellogg Fellow, which is at that time, was a highly sought after thing.  It was just like the MacArthur ["Genius Grant" Fellowship], except you did not--you had to commit to continue working where you were.  And I worked--I did that for two years went all around the world working on this Kellogg Fellowship.  China, Russia all of the Latin America, all over Europe.  And my--in my third year they asked me if I would come to the Kellogg Foundation and work.  And I was thinking--I didn't even ask my wife [Joy Ford]; I said yes, then I called and said "Would you like to move to Battle Creek [Michigan]?"  She said, "Sure, let's do it."  So they brought me there and made me a Program Director in Leadership, and I was just overjoyed.  It was a great experience.
Speaker 2: Now what year was it that you ended up in Battle Creek?
Speaker 1: You and these years (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Nineteen-eighty [1980]--it must been around '85 [1985] that I had went out there.  '84 [1984], '85 [1985].  And actually I'm a give you a background piece of information (laughter).  We can institute some of these dates.  I'm bad on numbers, dates, and names.
Speaker 2: Well that's good.
Speaker 1: But anyway.
Speaker 2: As long as you get as close to it as possible.
Speaker 1: I'm pretty close; it was in mid '80s [1980], somewhere along there.  And I went out there, stayed there for eight years and while I was there worked basic--in the leadership area and did grant-making in that area.  Did I think lots of good grant-making at that time.  I learned how to be a grant-maker, which was fun, and became very interested in African American men and boys because of a problem that developed with my son [Julian Austin].  This is something that I'm going to talk about, but I will warn you up front that my son and I don't agree on this.  And he does not like me to tell this story anymore, but it is why I got into this I can tell you.  We had just moved to Battle Creek, and my son had been there about two or three weeks when school started.  And he's very athletic, and my wife called me I was on the road one day, and she said, "Julian's acting strange.  Something is wrong; I can't get him to talk about it."  To make a long story short, when I finally got home and talked to him, he had been barred from all athletics in the school and was told--had been interrogated by a uniformed policeman and, you know a high school guard in the basement of the high, high school.  And--the junior high school sorry, junior high school.  And I asked him why, he said, "Well, they think I belong to a gang."   And I said, "Well Julian, why would they think you belong to a gang, you just got here."  He said, "Well, they told me that some guy pointed me out as a gang member and said I was a member."  And they barred him.  They did not ask us; they never called us, nothing.   Well I, I just went into a rage.
Story_ID: 120699
Speaker 1: Here my kid [Julian Austin] had grown up my children had grown up in Washington, D.C., and nothing had ever happened to them.  We moved to this little town [Battle Creek, Michigan], and my son is branded a gang member just by showing up.  And so the [Kellogg] Foundation was embarrassed; I was--it was just a mess.  And I said, you know, "I will bring everyone that I know in Washington [D.C.] down here, and we will just decimate this place.  I can't believe you have done this to my child."  Who was, you know, here he's a junior high school student, and he's petrified, you know.  Well, he claims he wasn't but he was, you know; you could tell.  Well, they told me that they were sorry, of course, and, you know, what can you do?  If someone says they're sorry, they're sorry.  And my son went on; he was gonna--played ball and all those things, but it was really awful for me.  I did not like it, and eventually one of the vice presidents I guess said to me, "Well Bobby, you know, you're in a place with a lot of money.  If you really believe that you can make a difference as to what happens to the African American men, why don't you do something here with all of the money that we have?"  That's exactly how he said it, well I was like okay (laughter) what do I do, you know?  You may have all this money, but you gotta have a plan.  You gotta, and that's what got me started with this road dealing with African American men.  They allowed me to bring everybody out there, you know, money was no expense.  No--
Speaker 2: Who were some of the people you brought out there?
Speaker 1: Aw man, everybody.
Speaker 2: So I know there are a lot of programs, there are Rites of Passage programs--
Speaker 1: I--most of those I funded.
Speaker 2: Yeah, or-
Speaker 1: I brought, first I brought all the, the activists and the intellectuals.  So we could, we went around the country so we can find out what should be done.  I had [HM] Haki [Madhubuti], [HM] Lerone Bennett, I had [HM] Ramona Edelin, I had the Urban League, I had NAACP.  I had everybody; we talked about that.
Speaker 2: Jawanza Kunjufu was a part of that?
Speaker 1: Kunjufu came; yes, I do believe he did come to one of those.  So there was just a massive group of people that we put together and came up with what we called an initiative.  And I put about $30 million at that period into funding the--what we consider the best of these programs.  There were about 35 of them.  About 200,000 boys were involved, and that included Rites of Passage programs, leadership program, funded Steadman Graham's Athletes Against Drugs program.  I funded the ancillary programs 'cause I--my, my belief was that this was not, I would not let people say it was violence 'cause they kept saying black boys are violent.  What I said is black boys need options; violence is a symptom of something gone wrong.  You're violent when you can't make the right choices--you don't know how to make the right choices.  So, if you learn leadership development skills, you learn how to lead yourself out of trouble.  And, therefore, all my grantmaking, all my funding, we insisted that they had to have the leadership component in it.  Not an anti-violence program but a leadership component.  And it changed really the complexion of how people begun, began to look at, you know, young men and what we had to do for them.  That was very successful.  It was so successful at one point that we had so many people calling the, the foundation from the U.S. and abroad, they, they eventually said this is too big.  You're going to have to move this outside, outside of the (laughter) foundation.   They then created a national task force which was headed by, or I created it and I was the head of the--I was the director of the task force--headed by [HM] Andrew Young.  And on that was a blue ribbon group of people who served on that--black-and-white who served on that task force.  And we came out with the report which is now a kind of a legendary report called Repairing the Breach.  And Repairing the Breach is used in many universities and colleges today.  As a textbook, Repairing the Breach is about how to repair civil society and how to bring boys and their families back into the life of these communities.  And it's just a blueprint, when, when it came out I--it was, you know, press releases were sent everywhere.  And [HM William] Bill Raspberry did a column and the--in the column it says this is the plan to save America.  And that kind of tag when you say this is the plan to save America people were calling in Battle Creek saying do you think you could live up to this?  I said no I can't live up to that but, you know.  I'm glad that, that he thinks that because means that it has hit a chord with a lot of people, and it did.
Story_ID: 120700
Speaker 1: From that report [Repairing the Breach, 1996], the Kellogg Foundation was gracious enough to work with me on setting up the Village Foundation, which was dedicated to the development of men and boys.  And, and a grant of about $20 million to work on.  And then that lasted for about five years.  We were to raise a hundred million dollars.  It's one of the few things that I ever failed at.  I did not raise the $100 million.  And because of the fundraising the way I was doing it, I was trying to build capacity through the economic development, and I trusted a woman and it was a bad choice.  And I eventually left the Village Foundation.  They wanted me to leave.  And I, I thought I should be 'cause I wanted it to live, but then it went into bankruptcy because there was really no one to carry on the vision once I, once I stepped out of it.  But the work that we did will go--is still living, still going, there are still about thirty-five or forty groups that are still there.  We put lots of money into these groups, and we worked very hard with the young men.  And the work that we still do still penetrates I think throughout the country.  The last book that I did at Village was called "Wake Up and Start to Live" based on the Gallup Poll.  And that, that poll that we did laid out a plan for how you could repair the breach between blacks and white and African American men.  And the book did so well it sold out its first printing, and I think they're gonna go into a second printing now.
Speaker 2: It's called wake up and--?
Speaker 1: "Wake Up and Start to Live."
Speaker 2: "Wake up and Start to Live," okay.
Speaker 1: Well what, what were some of the programs that you all funded that you think were effective?
Speaker 2: Well there's one called MAD DADS [Men Against Destruction-Defending Against Drugs and Social-Disorder] which came out of Omaha, Nebraska, and it's now down in Florida.  Eddie Staten runs that program about I think he has something like 70 chapters around the country.
Speaker 1: Yeah there's one is Chicago [Illinois] we know about.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I used I used to work with MAD DADS.
Speaker 2: That's part of my work (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Then there was as I said I funded Stedman's athlete construct, which is still going well.  I funded health, a health project in Ballston called the health club which is a wonderful program.  It teaches young, young men how to become health professionals, paraprofessionals, you know.  And then oh the work has been--I've, I've did a wonderful--I think I did a piece with a guy who was working in something called the [People's] Assemblies.  And the Assemblies were grassroots democracy organizations throughout the South.  And they are still going, still working.  They actually teach people leadership development and how to run their own communities and how to make democracy work for them.  That's--I think that is what social infrastructure is all about.  It's, it's teaching people how to make grassroots democracy work for them.  And, using these leadership skills, recreate their lives and I think that's gone be the work of all of us in the next century.  The new lens is how do we make our community work for us 'cause if we can't live in our communities; if we're afraid of each other.  If there's crime and turmoil and chaos then nobody wants to live with you.  We've got to have control of your emotions and your economics and your social life so that it is the inviting and wonderful place to be.  Or else you're a pariah not only to the society but to yourself.  But what the assemblies have done is, they've they, they teach people how to make citizenship work for them.  I'm very pleased with the work that they do and so that's, that's another one.  I could go on their many programs that we've did but the idea was always to help these young men and older men too.  We've worked in prisons.  Gary Mendez had a program I think its called Black Men's Development Center I believe, which work basically with the prisoners.  So we put computers-the, the guys got computers they could talk to their kids outside of the prison walls.  It was a very, very--has been very successful.  He still works in about three or four prisons around the country.  So that kind of work I help to stabilize those people I do believe and help them to get their work going.  And I will be back to them hopefully next year when this--a new piece that I'm working on get started.  And I can again help them to, to make sure that these young men get a chance at life.  And so I'm looking forward to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Village Foundation is as such it went under?
Speaker 2: Went under (nodding his head yes).
Speaker 1: But, but some of the, the (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh the program is still on (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: The program is still on still existing, existing.
Speaker 2: Yeah is existing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 120701
Speaker 1: I skipped one part of my life (laughter).  I knew I would do this.  Can I go back is that okay (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well I was doing all that, so I worked at my church, Peoples Congregational Church [in Washington, D.C.], to do two things: to help build the church and to build something called the National Youth Foundation and you'll see why want to go back.  And we created a magazine called "21st Century."  And "21st Century" was our way of looking at this new lens of common culture and social infrastructure.  And you can see in my career that it has progressed.  It went from that right into the Village Foundation.  Basically not the same but very similar concepts of how you work with young people and how you help young people to create new lives for themselves.  But that work at the church for that year and a half with the National Youth Foundation got me started in youth work.  And I wanted to sort of show you in a sense how I got started in youth work.  But then when I went to [the W.K.] Kellogg [Foundation], I was doing something in the policy and leadership area.  But it was very easy for me to move back into youth work.  And I think I did that pretty seamlessly when I had to do that, so I just wanted to get that in.
Story_ID: 120702
Speaker 1: So now the, the Village Foundation--you left it in what, what year?
Speaker 2: Well I left it three years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So this is '04 [2004] three, two, '01 [2001].
Speaker 1: Okay, so since that time you've been?
Speaker 2: Since that time I was vice president over at UDC [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.].  And now working on my, my book, two books.  One is "The Diversity in American Common Culture," which is done.  And the other book is called "The End of Race" and I'm working on that now.
Speaker 1: Now that's really a charged up--
Speaker 2: (laughter) trying to charge black people I guess (laughter).
Speaker 1: --title. "End of race" now, you know, and you know why the charges black people up 'cause it's similar to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, why does it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well similar to [William] Julius Wilson's "The Declining Significance of Race."
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: And there are, you know, mostly you hear a lot of the conservative, like Armstrong Williams--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and people say that race doesn't matter anymore.
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: And just to, you know, but, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I think he said that out of ignorance (laughter) I'm not, I'm not saying that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--no, race is a social construct.  It never existed any way.  And it was constructed so that we would be so that we would be slaves we would accept it the white people could accept it pretend that God wanted it, and they could proceed on with their lives.  I think it's time we help them understand that that won't work anymore.  It gives us a whole new lens on life because the new biology and I use a lot of biology a lot of science in this.  The new biology says that everybody in the world is descended from an African Eve.  So if all men are descended from an African Eve, we're all one family.  They're all Africans; we're all Africans.  There is no such thing as a race.  It really is a social construct constructed by certain European scientists, and it was used just like religion was used to as an ideology to, to move a society and a world to where we are today.  I mean, and some parts of it were good some parts of it were bad.  Now what we did was we did the best anybody in the world could do with it, I mean, we took it and we made is something that even they don't understand yet.  I don't think we understand what we've done.  We've--I mean, I've heard Jimmy [James] Baldwin, I mean, I got to meet him say, you know, we've created a culture that's known around the world in less than 200 years.  That's pretty doggone good we make the world move.  The world moves to our rhythms, to our songs no matter what they are. Even if you don't even like rap, it moves to that.  Even if you don't like the spirituals ones.  When they were introduced to the world, it changed how the world thought.  It changed how people did things.  I want us to see that we are change agents.  We are not bound by something called race which is a horrible construct that we worship.  It's a bad thing to worship because as [W.E.B] Du Bois said, I had nothing to do with my skin color.  I just got here, and whatever those genes were that were working on that day, I mean, I could've looked like pitch coal 'cause I really got some really black ancestors.  Or I could of been white with blue eyes.  Just depending on oh how those genes got mixed when I came out that's who I am and so I don't own my--I don't have any homage to my skin color.  What I have though is I understand why people do because the context the construct that we had to live under forged a culture that we had to create for ourselves.  But that creates, that culture was to help us overcome.  When those slaves came out of freedom they understood they had to create institutions to overcome.  So they did those schools, and they work with those missionaries to do that and that first group with, with when you look at those abolitionists and you look at the, the Fisk Jubilee Singers, they created a whole new world through intellect, I call it, 'cause certainly that's what Mr. [Frederick] Douglas was and through the spirituals to see ourselves differently in the world.  Then you come right down to [W.E.B.] Du Bois, who took intellect even further and set a blueprint for freedom.  And then you go right to [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.], who led us to that freedom.  Now, what do we do with that freedom now that we're there?  I think we have to say, "Thank you; this is great.  We stand on that.  Now world, let's talk about who we really are."  And that's what the book is about.
Story_ID: 120703
Speaker 1: If I understand you correctly, I'm just, just have to, you know, 'cause I'm not sure if I, if I really understand.  You're saying that there's no scientific basis for race?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And pretty much I know who could disagree with that these days because of all the research.  And being what it is saying you're right, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Pretty, pretty much about that less they discovered something else that we don't know anything about  but, but still within the definition.  I guess of, of who people are.  There it, it's, I mean, black people in this country or the people, people we know as our kinfolk and relatives and extended family as black folks we share a common--
Speaker 2: Bond.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a common history and to this at this juncture, it's hard to think that we will not share a common destiny, too, on some level.  Because we're identified and lumped together in spite of the fact we may be different as--two black people in America might be as different as night and day.  In terms how--what they actually do and what they like and, and, you know, how they behave so--
Speaker 2: Well what you described is an ethnic group.  That's not gonna go away ethnicity is, is your lineage.  And your, you know, you're, your group I'm a, I am a Kentucky person.  And from Bowling Green [Kentucky], Jonesville [Kentucky] I will, I will always be that I am not from Harlem [New York].  And therefore I don't do things like they do things in Harlem.  I don't understand; I don't see the world; my lens is totally different.  And I did my first work at the urban league after I did the, the population thing was something called "Black Ethnic Groups in America" you can go and you can looking it up.  And it's, it's considered a groundbreaking piece.  And where I looked at all these various black ethnic groups in the United States.  From the New Orleans [Louisiana]-type ethnic groups where the food is different where all the different cultures, the different cultures.  We have never learned to appreciate the individual ethnic cultures of the African American experience.  We want to lump everybody together and say if you don't eat greens and you don't eat chitterlings you ain't black.  Well that's not true it's not true at all it's a falsehood.  It's a folk lie (laughter).  So that's what I'm going to help us get through (laughter) everybody wasn't poor and everybody wasn't in rich.  But there, there are regional differences.  The wonderful book called Oh my God I think it's by Butcher, Dr. Butcher.
Speaker 1: Golden Butcher [ph.]?
Speaker 2: Not Golden let me see Butcher I can't think of, but it's called American something, something culture I think, but it's a great book.  And in that book she does the regions of black music.  Totally distinct.  From blues to the hill music from Kentucky of Frankie and Johnny, which is the hillbilly mix.  'Cause really country music hillbilly mix is a part of black music.  The banjo is a is a an black--is a African instrument which did not become a white instrument until after the minstrels had finished and so forth.  And then those our kids don't even know that banjo is a African instrument.  So these changeovers in culture have to be reformed and reformatted because what we are doing is allowing television to define who we are, and that's horrible.  'Cause it defines us as a ghetto people with a ghetto mentality and a ghetto ideal.  Totally, absolutely incorrect.  The, the literature and the language of the Negro spiritual is the most beautiful ever done.  And when you look at all these things, and you can see this ethnic--these various ethnicities, these various foods that come out of these various communities.  That's what we've got to learn to lift up again and understand.  If little boys in Chicago [Illinois] really knew why they're ancestors came from Mississippi to Chicago, they might have a different of opinion and approach to who they are.  They weren't just born on the streets, but no one tells them who they are really.  It's hard to think that you're a black American just because everybody is a black American.  You have to have something you pin yourself on.  The reason you started asking me about my ancestors, you wanted me to have a bedrock to pin myself on.  I didn't you didn't want me to say I'm just kin to every black person in the world.  That doesn't make any sense (laughter) you see.  And that's what we've done as a group.  Ethnicity yes but I'm--but when I say the end of the race, I mean the end of the race for everybody.
Story_ID: 120704
Speaker 1: Without black people there no white people.  Everybody knows that.  'Cause you can only be white in America.  White people are Europeans (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Now there is a move of, of the most (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Oh they're trying to do it too because they understand the coming world (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, who was that Noel Ignatiev is involved in it.
Speaker 1: Yes a lot of them (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Who--he's, he's the author of a book called "How the Irish Became White."  And, and there, there's a whole group of them on the--
Speaker 1: Because they understand the common (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Most were professors (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: See they understand the world and they will move to it.  Where we won't do it, we want to hold on to it as if it's sacred it is not sacred.  It is to be worshiped and look at almost as a museum piece and then move to the next level.  The next level is who is going to defined who the human being is in this century 100 years from now?  We have every right to do that because we are quintessential to that, and that is what I want to do.  I want to open up our young people so they can be freed from thinking they have to act black.  Because to speak like you and I are speaking is to act white.  How stupid.  We're just speaking a language--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we've got a two edge sword here. And I think what might cause some people some pause is that of course, we don't want to be identified with negative identifiers as a race.
Speaker 1: No, I don't.
Speaker 2: You're lazier, you only eat salty foods (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Oh yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: You know, or you not you gone end up in jail (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Pork and all that, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: You gone be in the streets.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: You know, you don't want to identify with that.  But at the same time for our own defense and protection, if we do not recognize that we're a people under strain and, and attack, on, on, you know.
Speaker 1: Well can we not change that?
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: Can an Obama [HM President Barack Obama] not change that?
Speaker 2: Well that's the, that's the goal, of course, to change all that but, but at the same time you have to, you know.  I think people, people feel that if you don't recognize where you are, the situation you are in, you know, are, are you gone be continually victimized.  Other people are calling you a nigger, and you're saying--
Speaker 1: You stop them.
Speaker 2: You're saying, you saying--
Speaker 1: That's when you stop them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: If you answer to it, you do it I must say I don't agree--
Speaker 2: Well we actually call each other--
Speaker 1: Yeah that what I'm saying, this why we got to stop.  You know, the rap people call each other nigger.  And they're--I hate that but then in a way it neutralizes 'cause it's so stupid now that, you know, who would say it anymore anyway.  I mean I get I'm offended by it, but really I'm not offended by it anymore.
Speaker 2: And not just the rap people, you know, there're a lot of people that were--
Speaker 1: Oh sure.
Speaker 2: --doing that before the rap generation came.
Speaker 1: Oh sure but what I'm saying is that is what it boils down to at--to its least common denominator. When you're calling your mother and your daughter a bitch and a ho, you know, that if that's black, I'm purple.  And I think we have reduced it to the least common denominator. We could only go up, out, and break the mold and start all over again with it, but that's my book so (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 120302
Speaker 1: So that's your, your book ["The End of Race"]--the intent is to erase the oppressive--
Speaker 2: The intent is to raise--
Speaker 1: The oppressive political content of (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: It's to give us a new lens to look through.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the lens of race may not be what we've, you know.  Just as [W.E.B.] Du Bois said, that the color line would be the thing that we're talking about in the 20th century.  But I think in this century it's going to be culture and the creation of that culture.
Speaker 1: What this means, what this means that I'm just trying to see how this plays out or play out on the ground. That black men like, like you or like many others we've interviewed would then be able to then focus on the development of people that are most like them in terms of class, status and income--
Speaker 2: They could focus on anything.
Speaker 1: --and other--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And other things would not necessarily be concerned about.
Speaker 2: Right.  They could focus on anything they want to focus on.
Speaker 1: Other, other black people.
Speaker 2: They don't have to.
Speaker 1: Specifically.
Speaker 2: They wouldn't have to.
Speaker 1: Because they--all right.
Speaker 2: They can focus on anything they wanted to.  Whites could focus on blacks or they could--well not whites. People can focus on anything they want to focus on when you are when you are stereotyped into one thing than you think that's all you can do.  And I don't think that it's healthy for anybody.  I think if you're a good teacher you should be able to, and you should rise above that you should be able to teach anyone.  But I think when you're stuck in racial stereotypes you can't do it.  If you go into schools where the whites don't like you and they think you're inferior because you are black, and that's the only reason.  They don't work very hard with you.  They have to--we have to restructure how we work and think and do in this country.  That's how I see it.
Story_ID: 120303
Speaker 1: I mean the Village Foundation and the initiatives around young black men; that's a racial-specific kind of focus.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And let's face it, we know if nobody--if black people don't help these young black men, very few others are gonna--
Speaker 2: Well, we had a lot of whites work with us.  And quite frankly we had both girls, and we had some whites and Hispanics in the programs because we would never turn people away.  And there were white mothers who were suffering; there were Hispanic mothers who were suffering.  Now we say black boys because that's who it was for basically but we, we've worked with all kinda kids 'cause all kinda kids are in trouble.  Even though I think, your African American boys at this time are probably in worse trouble.  We've got--the only way we can change that and lift that cloud is we focus their thinking about who they are on themselves.  A lot of their thinking has got to be negative because of what they see--how they see themselves projected, and, and how and how they are projected in this society and then what they have to go through to get out of the situations that there are in.  If you could somehow and this takes a long time believe me.  This is not going to take five minutes.  I'm talking about 100 years.  This is, the this is a cycle that you move through.  But somebody gotta start thinking about it, building this social infrastructure.
Story_ID: 120304
Speaker 1: Who knows what we will be like at the end of 100 years?  First, intermarriage is taking place very rapidly among blacks, Hispanics, and whites.  That melange is, is growing and developing it's going to continue.  The more you know each other, the more people find ways to move, you know, to people that they love not because of their color but because of who they are.  I just see this long term, that African Americans have an important--now you could always do with your heritage I don't mean that.  But many African Americans could just easily say your, you're Irish American; you weren't raised by Irish people but they're--it's their ethnicity that makes the difference.  If you're raised in Bowling Green, Kentucky you are raised in a particular kind of milieu.  But that milieu is not necessarily a universal black one either.  I mean, I can name you the things I had for dinner every day or and you would say I never heard of that.  You see what, I mean, it's, it's always very specific culturally to where you are geographically and how you grow up.  That's never gonna change, never gonna change.  But what has to change are these broad stereotyped straitjackets that you're placed under, and I know it's hard to imagine 'cause most people think their whole frame of reference is well I'm black.  But when you ask them to define what does that mean, it's hard for them to define it.
Speaker 2: Well I don't think it's that difficult but it's--
Speaker 1: Oh do it for me then.
Speaker 2: Well I just think that being black would meaning that you, you know, realize that you have a similar heritage and--
Speaker 1: But we don't.
Speaker 2: Well we do.
Speaker 1: No we don't (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well we do we have a similar history.
Speaker 1: We are very, very different (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, we are--
Speaker 1: Well in some, some contexts we do, some contexts we don't.
Speaker 2: --we are descend of Africans that were brought here in slavery.
Speaker 1: Do you know how many people who have passed in this country?  They think over 10, 20 million people (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, but everybody we call black are descendants of this group; that's what I'm saying that a--
Speaker 1: Well that's what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: --that is a heritage.
Speaker 1: That is the point that I'm making; we're all descended from Africans, all of us.
Speaker 2: Well not in that sense, though.
Speaker 1: Yes we are.
Speaker 2: But not in the sense of--
Speaker 1: According to the genetics we are.
Speaker 2: In the sense of you saying all humans come from Africa but in the sense that, that they were Ashantis and Yorubas.  And people from West Africa that had similar cultures that came over here during the slavery were not.
Speaker 1: Oh well in that sense no, but in the world.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The world over has a genetic connection to this African Eve.
Speaker 2: Well I wasn't arguing against that but I'm saying that we do have a similar heritage--
Speaker 1: But I have no connection to the Ashanti.
Speaker 2: --coming from those political--
Speaker 1: What do I know about the Ashanti (laughter)?
Speaker 2: You might not know anything about it, but you might know more than think about 'em (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: By virtual of (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: I know the Dogon only because I would like to be a Dogon (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah but you, you may actually know or have even practiced some African--some survivals and not even know--
Speaker 1: No I would know them.
Speaker 2: --that that's what they are, you know.
Speaker 1: That, I have studied.
Story_ID: 120305
Speaker 1: I'm not a great African survivalist person.  I don't think that, that much of that exists.  I think what we did is we created a new culture, and that's what's important.  This new thing that we've created is unbelievable.  As I say it, it has--it moves the world.  You just don't do advertisement without dealing with the African sensibility, whether it's Caribbean or whatever.  It's just the new world rhythm is this African base from West Africa without doubt.  So in, though, in that sense, you know, I'm completely on board with that but anyway we'll see what happens in the next 100 years (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, all right.  But yeah I just I think you can define, you know, who you are as being black and this why we, we're doing--
Speaker 1: But see some people won't do that they say, I'm an African American because black is such a political term that are you talking 'bout me being actually black skin (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well it is a political term.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It is the political term.
Speaker 1: Black skin color or--
Speaker 2: And it really has, has meaning in a political, organizational way.  Without, without that distinction there's no, there's no basis to organize black people around.  You know, it's nothing to organize them around in terms of their own condition, their own political position.
Speaker 1: Well that's not true but--
Speaker 2: And we're, we're in a political position where we're attacked because we're black or-
Speaker 1: Well I don't think so.  I think you're attacked--
Speaker 2: Yeah to get out of it.
Speaker 1: --because you're not white (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well it's a difference.
Speaker 1: Well it's a big difference 'cause I mean and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: White as I say--there are no Negroes (laughter).  There are no there's no unless whites band together.  And they've only have gotten together in the last couple of years because they were very spread out themselves till they saw how, you know, it would work for them.  And those who wanna, want that umbrage of that umbrella.  And I'm just saying I--you, you split that apart when you make people deal with the ethnicities.  And that's what I'm going to do; that's what I'd like to do.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, what would change if we were identified as ethnically--?
Speaker 1: Whatever you are, or you don't have to be any of it.
Speaker 2: Say if we just called each other dark people?
Speaker 1: Just people.
Speaker 2: From Ken, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Just people from Kentucky.
Speaker 2: Who did who had a certain--?
Speaker 1: A person from Kentucky (laughter); what's wrong with that?
Speaker 2: History, you know.
Speaker 1: And I have a great history, and you can always do that.  Museums are built for history and that you do.
Speaker 2: Most of our people in Kentucky are poorer than the other people in Kentucky.
Speaker 1: And to lift them out of that they have to have a new perspective on whether or not they can or they cannot do it.  And I think a lot of people have crutches around race.  And they can't move beyond it I think public policy was built to maintain that separateness after World Ward II.  Veterans were able to--white veterans were able to do certain things black veterans couldn't do.  And I'm saying I want to remove that in the next century as we go forward.  And I think I can do it I think I can work on that.
Speaker 2: I think everybody would agree with those kind of things (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Need to be removed.
Speaker 1: Yeah,
Speaker 2: So, yeah.
Speaker 1: We'll see.
Story_ID: 120306
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  We always ask this question, which may have been explicit in what you already said.  But what, what are some of your hopes and concerns--
Speaker 2: That's it (laughter).
Speaker 1: --for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well that's it, I mean, I think that I, I really do prefer to call myself an African American.  I do like the lineage part of it as opposed to the color part 'cause the color part doesn't make much sense to me.  Except that it is political I know that I was in the '60s [1960s], and I knew what that meant.  But I also know how, how unfortunate it could be when you use it a little too much.  I think that I am African American because I am a descendent of Africans.  But I'm also, and I'm beginning to claim this, I'm a descendant of an Irishman, who actually provided for us.  So that the reason I live the way I live today is because of him.  And a Native American on both sides so how can I claim one--maybe one-third of me.  I don't--I've never done this to see what my actual blood type line.  But how do I claim one part and not the other part?  Only because someone tells me that I can't so I'm not like the new kids who would call themselves multiracial and biracial, I don't believe that at all.  But what I do believe is that we're so caught up in it that we can't think about who we are at times.  And therefore we're afraid to break out of it because somebody might think "oh my God he acts like a white person."  I've had one of my kids say "oh she talks like a white person."  You know, what does a white person talk like?  My part of the country in Kentucky when I go back, and I talk with some of my, my uncles they talk just like all of the rest of the white people down there.  You know, they all have a little twang, and they all talk just alike.  They don't say "Yo baby," you know.  They don't do that, you know, I'm sorry, (laughter), and I honor that because that is who they are.  They don't have to say "Yo bro, boy you my dog; get down man."  They don't do that and why can't I let them be who they are as supposed to pretending there is some national massive culture which says that and that's just what I want to bring out.  I want that to be people can be who they want to be, and that's important to me.  So that's what I hope for, and I hope that we can really look at culture.  And see that this common culture envelops all of us, and it's a part of this whole new wave of people that are coming to America.  And I don't want us get--become a relic of the past I really don't.
Story_ID: 120307
Speaker 1: Okay, well when you look back at the things that you've done, you've done many things.  And you were involved in various number important projects so what would--is there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Oh yes I would not have trusted everybody that I trusted at village (laughter).  I would still have my foundation.  I, I'm very trusting, and I think that comes with my background.  And like I don't actually meet strangers a lot.  I would take you for my friend.  I don't even know you, but you seem like a nice person until I guess you stab me in the back (laughter).  Which's what happened to me (laughter), you know, and right, you know.  I, I was like--I just thought this particular person was a mentor and a friend.  And when we got in trouble I say well let this person help me I thought, and this person really was helping themselves in the end.
Speaker 1: Do you want to tell the story on this?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: Maybe you can do it without mentioning names but what I (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, we might get sued but, but it was the most painful thing that ever happened to me in my entire life 'cause I lost everything.  And that chair over there--I sat in that chair for six months by myself.  I didn't cry, but it's the most painful period of my life.  I couldn't get out of that chair; I could get up from my bed and stumbled down here so.  My wife [Joy Ford] was so wonderful to me and my children during that period 'cause I had lost my entire dream in this Village Foundation because that's what I wanted to do.  And I had made a mistake.  I, I agree the mistake that I made was in trusting this particular fundraising woman, who she didn't obscure, with the money. But she couldn't get it back.  And I, I thought we could have dealt with it a different way but my friend who was working as a chair took it in a way that became very investigative of me.  Nothing came of it.  But it was so ranching that, you know, I had to leave.  And, and they were--want to try to keep it going but it, you know, once you have a vision it's hard to and is sort of went bankrupt.  I had just never been betrayed before, and I didn't know just exactly how to deal with it.  It took me six months, but I got back my, you know, I got my legs back, and I got back on track and I'm working.  And the, and I'm working really with this--with a friend of mine named Buzz and Alice French-[HM William] Buzz [Palmer] and [HM] Alice Palmer on this whole new internationalism.  And that works with my common culture piece and is opening up a race that we are people of the world, and everybody gonna do, you know, the global, globalization means we gotta be universal.  And as we move out we've got to help African Americans to become internationalist.  And we're starting a group or we started it called the People's Assembly.  And in that assembly we're going to bring together all kind of people.  But we really want people who have been left out of this international process to understand how their futures are tied to the global world.  It's very important that during this century our young people be freed to take leadership in the world.  They have got to be able to do that for us as a country to survive but as--but these ethnic groups that are around that their stories need to be told for them to survive as well.  So that's one of the big things I want to see happen these next couple of decades If I'm still around.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're, of course, content--expect to continue to write and?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I'm going to try to get these two books out, the one on American common culture and "The End of Race," and sorta see what happens after that.
Story_ID: 120308
Speaker 1: And you said your, your father [Herschel Austin, Sr.] is still alive right?
Speaker 2: My father's in a nursing home he's still alive.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I didn't say anything about my family, my children and my wife.
Speaker 1: Well tell, well yeah you did say something but go head.
Speaker 2: My wife [Joy Ford] and I have been married thirty-one years. she is a museum specialist in Hansen DC Humanities Council here in town [Washington, D.C.].  My oldest daughter is a--all my children went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  They've graduated; I have one that's a senior there now.  My oldest daughter [Sushama Austin-Connor] is a filmmaker; she finished Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachussetts].  And my son [Julian Austin] finished Fisk, and he is in dental school at Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  And my third daughter [Leah Austin] went to school in Italy, fashion design--not fashion I'm sorry fashion styling, and she just finished her book and is a teacher here in the public school system in Washington [D.C.].  And my youngest daughter [Ariana Austin] is a senior at Fisk, and she went around the world this year on something called Semester on the Sea or Semester at Sea or something like that I think it's called.  And then she study for a semester at [University of] Oxford [Oxford, England] and will be a senior at Fisk coming up.  She wants to be a writer.  So I'm very proud of them; they've all done really well.
Story_ID: 120309
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back at the things you've done so far what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well I do think my legacy will be this work that we did with African American men and boys because it, it has legs.  It's long-term history; it has two or three books associated with them put together.  And that people are still living it and, and they're working in it, and they're creating it.  But I think that the thing that will probably people will remember for, for good or ill, would be the common cultures stuff because I do lecture a lot on American culture and people like that.  And I talk a little bit about this "End of Race" in there.  It's very controversial at times but in the end I think that will as I said for good or ill probably what people will refer to when they talk about me.
Story_ID: 120310
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything that, that we haven't asked you?
Speaker 2: Well I want to get my family in because I love them dearly. I've done that, no I don't think so.  I think you've drained me, drenched me, strained every muscle and brain that I thought I had.  I don't think I've done very well in this because I can't remember some of these dates are just too much for me.  I don't do things in sequence, but it's nice to have the big things out.  And, and I think I was trying to put, you know, it's one of those things where you are struggling to put your life in context.  And I kept saying mine is so ragged 'cause I have all these things what--if I were to contextualize its I guess.  It's really--I've wanted to be, you know, as an editor that's what I have been mostly editing putting together putting pieces together that an editor does.  And that's--I think that is who I am.  When you said what is your occupation?  I guess I should just say it, editor, because what I've done, and this whole infrastructure piece is about putting pieces together, and I think that's my, my legacy in this.  And somebody hast to put together the pieces whether we like it or not of our lives to make it work.  You have to construct the narrative and the script and the content.  And when you don't your--I think your life personally goes out of whack but as a group as an ethnic group.  As a group that has given so much to the world.  We have not constructed the narrative and the text for this century.  The way we did coming out of slavery when, when the introduction of spirituals and other things like that allowed people to see inside these people what a humanity they had.  What a grasp of theology they had, what a grasp of freedom they had because their songs were codes as well.  How clever they were.  A whole new appreciation for them I mean, and Du Bois came along and did that same thing with the intellect, you know, how creative these people are.  And I think we will do that in this next century.  How we come to this not me but lots of people building that script putting those pieces together.  I think will give us this vision it may not be the end of race.  But I bet you somewhere in there, there will be a piece that deals with unleashing a new energy among our people that is not racially tied.  But it's tied to, to going to the moon going I shouldn't say moon but going beyond the universe. Or discovering the next great--sometimes I think we can't discover the next cancer piece because we're so tied up with being black that it's, it's hard to break out of it. And I'm just saying I want to see every blossom bloom.  I really want to see that happen, and I think, I think this is our century I think this is our time to do that.  And so I'm hoping that I can be a part of that or else I can, I can put some pieces together that will help do that.
Story_ID: 120311
Speaker 1: Okay.  I hope this doesn't sound repetitive, but we always ask this question.  It's similar to legacy, but it's little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well I hadn't actually thought about being remembered (laughter) 'cause I guess I see my work as being so behind the scenes.  And I will--wouldn't think people know who you are but probably as someone who was this person who tried to fit the pieces together.  Connect the dots build a broader picture, build a text of who we are, a context of who we are as a people but who we are as a nation.  And how we are--how we fit into that cause the big thing that I know and working with young people they don't know how they fit into America.  And we got--they can't feel alienated from something that their parents created, and their grandparents created.  So I'd like my legacy at least to be left with these young people that they're free.  They're free to be who they want to be if you want to be a rap person whether I like it or not you ought to be free to do that as long as you not harming anybody.  That is my ultimate thing I want people, and I want it in, in a way that I can support it--that freedom becomes that which distinguishes us as citizens.  And that all of us can, can live that kind of life.  I think it's important.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 122013
Speaker 1: First to--well that's me on the left, and that's Kofi Annan and that's my wife standing beside him.
Speaker 2: Can't be moving too fast, Kofi Annan (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Uh-hum. (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: You have Secretary-General (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Secretary-General of the UN [United Nations].
Speaker 2: Yes, okay.
Speaker 1: And my wife [Joy Ford], who is the Executive Director of the D.C. Humanities.
Speaker 2: Right here?
Speaker 1: Uh-hah, D.C. Humanities Commission.
Speaker 2: The other people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Don't know the other people, I know them, but I can't think of their names.
Speaker 2: Okay, and this was shot about when?
Speaker 1: This was shot at the UN last year [2003] I believe or could be this year I'm not really sure at a gathering put together by [HM William] Buzz Palmer and [HM] Alice Palmer.  And it was a meeting of civil society leaders, and this is where we had been discussing the idea that I wanted to put together the People's Assembly.
Speaker 2: Okay, one more of the same thing.
Speaker 1: That's just me and Secretary Annan at the same meeting.
Speaker 2: Okay, now this one photo.
Speaker 1: Way back when, now that is a Tom Thumb wedding in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  And I think that's probably about 1949, 'cause I was about three or four years old.  And I'm a little fellow in the middle with the big, the big cutaway tuxedo.  And my bride is that big lady on the side her name is Maxine we're still good friends (laughter), and she lives in Bowling Green [Kentucky].
Speaker 2: Okay, let's try that we, we put it sideways 'cause it scans better.
Speaker 1: Okay, that is me I'm about ten or eleven there.  I'm on the, the one on the--well now I'm the only boy there in short pants playing the piano with my two cousins.  My one cousin Nancy is in the middle.  She became a, a nurse.  Went to Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  And then my other cousin is in banking in Troy, Ohio.  That's Valerie.  And that's me and my favorite aunt; that's my Aunt Bee.
Speaker 2: That glare (unclear) well that glare is on the photo.
Speaker 1: Is it actually you can see it I can see it.  That's my Aunt Bee and then that's me, and I'm about twelve there, on her front porch.  I don't know why we have that big elephant ear in front of us, but we do (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah that's what we grow down south.
Speaker 1: Now that's actually it was taken at my grandfather's [John Austin].
Speaker 2: Can we just move the left side the chair in, yeah that should do it?  Okay (off-camera discussion).
Speaker 1: That's at my grandfather's funeral really, and that's me down at the bottom, the little one with the--actually I had on a yellow vest that day; I know that vest.  And then that's my cousin next to me he is Dr., Reverend Dr. Porter Bailey now, he's the moderator of the Union, what is it.  I think it's called the Union District Association in Kentucky.  And then next to him is our cousin Nancy and then her brother, going around Sonny.  His name is James, and then my brother Skip.
Speaker 2: Okay, about what year?
Speaker 1: I don't know it be about 1954 probably maybe a little later '53 [1953] maybe.  That's me as a baby.  It's the only baby picture I have of me.  I'm in the middle and I'm about twelve, thirteen months old there, and that's my cousin Glenda, the girl and my brother Skip [Herschel Austin, Jr.] holding me.
Speaker 2: And that's Stallard's [ph.] Chicken Farm, that's where I used to answer the phone for my Uncle Vernon and my Aunt Bee, right there.  I just wanted to show that, that's me, and that's [HM] Andrew Young, who's the chair, lovely, lovely man of the de--of Village [Foundation].  And a good friend his daughter is a very good friend of mine and her husband.  And actually I knew her husband first; that's how I met them when he married.  And then that's Frances Hesselbein, who, on the other side, who is the legendary head of the Girl Scouts who was a dear friend.  I've worked with her off and on for many years.
Speaker 1: Okay, now who's this, I know that's you so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah that's me, and that's my wife [Joy Ford] and my daughter.  And I'm not even sure where that was what--oh I do.  That was when we first opened the Village Foundation and they, they were there as a part of that opening of the Village Foundation, and that was here, here in, here in Washington [D.C.].  Okay here's one I want to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My, when my son [Julian Austin] was thirteen years old I took him to the Amazon and that--we're in the middle of the Amazon.  Truly (laughter) in the middle of the Amazon (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Just you and your son?
Speaker 2: Me and my son, and, and another group another young man and his, his, his son went as well.  And this is us looking out of the lean-to into the, into the, into the forest there.  It was a unbelievable thing we stayed there for seven days and seven nights.  And actually it was, he said it was the most frightening thing he'd ever done.  But he didn't act like it at the time.  He didn't let--tell me that till we came back (laughter) till we came back home.  And then he told me that he had been scared to death the whole time because we were the out there by ourselves.  The guy went on and, and he went off and left us there and then came back a week later to pick us up in the middle of the, in the middle of the jungle so.  So that was, that was that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now of these here now these were pulled out.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well that's just me and my son.  I'm gonna need that.  That's a photograph taken here in the house of me and my son, he is now at, at Meharry [Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee].  And that's me with my daughter, me and my daughter, who just got married two years ago.  And this is a photograph where we're celebrating, we're celebrating Ellis Cose's book that was dedicated to me and they had a big thing here for Ellis.  Ellis is there in the blue suit.  And the book is called "The Envy of the World."  And it's a wonderful, wonderful book.  And I think, you know, something people might want to, want to see.   That's me with my friend; that's [HM] Nikki Giovanni.  Who I think is a great, great poet and a great person.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when you stand there you block the light in the window, which is good. Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is-I went up to do some work with Lloyd Richards.  And, and--
Speaker 2: The theater guy.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum the theater guy, and very important and I was very happy to go do that.  That was not at Yale [University in New Haven, Connecticut] that was up at--oh boy I forgot now.  It's a summer place where they go for writers and other people get their works out.
Speaker 2: Or you could go to the Northside (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Yeah that's the one I was gone try (unclear).  Now I guess, this one I didn't do.
Speaker 2: We did that one.
Speaker 1: Did we do this?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, with my son.  Yeah okay, right we did.  Okay.
Speaker 2: You got that one?
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now that's me--that's we're in, we're in Berlin, [Germany] actually.  And I think we were in East Berlin [Germany] at the time that was taken.  And I was with [HMs] Buzz and Alice Palmer.  And then there we are again in front of the European Union with Buzz and Alice.
Speaker 2: Can you zoom in maybe on the faces, the faces on that one?  Just wanna make sure we get 'em on there.  We've interviewed Buzz and Alice.
Speaker 1: Oh really okay, great!  That's us there, okay.  And I'll just show you this one, and then I think we can look at some places that I've been.  That's in Russia, and I met this wonderful Russian family that's Russian and Black.  In, in a sense that, that young lady sitting next to me is the granddaughter of a man who graduated from either Wilberforce [Univerisity, Wilberforce, Ohio] or Tuskegee [University, Tuskeegee, Alabama].  And he went to Russia and became the father of duck husbandry.  The whole duck industry based on these black men who came from these agriculture colleges in the United States.  They following [W.E.B.] Du Bois's idea of thinking about, you know, how the Soviet they--there about ten of them; they all married Russian women.  And these are their children and grandchildren.  And help to start many of the agricultural industries that are in Russia today.
Speaker 2: I see that I don't think anybody could ever have fabricated such a story (laughter).
Speaker 1: And then she and then she came to the United States forgot her name 'cause I had her come.  And went to the university for a while, I've lost contact with her I need to find her but I was in their apartment in, in Russia at that time.
Speaker 2: Are we ready to go to something else?
Speaker 1: Yeah we ready go to something else.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Here we go get this one.
Speaker 1: Okay this is me about ten years ago--no twelve years ago.  I was in Brazil, and I have a Brazilian hat on and we were out in the middle of a lake.  We were up just outside of the (unclear) or something.  And I have a little band tied around my hand that one of the arm that one of the little kids had given me for good luck (laughter).  Okay, this is a family photo which my family will die if they see.  They were all pretty young there.  My older, my youngest kid, must be Ariana.  She's about in the first grade there.  And the others are in junior high school (laughter).  This was the only formal portrait of my family that I have.  This is on my--this is in my home in Bowling Green.  And that's my mother and father in the middle.  And my sister-in-law in the greenish blue dress next to my mother her name was Ursa.  She's a schoolteacher.  And my brother Skip and my children all on the floor there and then Joy [Ford] sitting next to my dad holding Ariana.  And, then Leah is in the front and Sushama [Austin-Connor] and Julius [Austin] on the floor below me.  And that's our house in Bowling Green.  That was me when I was young it was my--it was 1974 (laughter).  Weighed all of about 125 pounds (laughter).  How life put stress upon you.  I only want that for sentimental reasons.  That was the opening of the Village Foundation.  And I know you can't see it yeah but that--not the Village Foundation, the Urban League Review.
Speaker 2: Okay, that make a difference.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And it was just the proudest day of my life, and I don't know how that photograph got so screwed up but boy was I a happy person on that day.  And that was a-[HM] Vernon [Jordan] was there; he came down to introduce the Urban League Review for us.  I'm very pleased with that.

And he also did a prayer breakfast.  His theme that year was "Repairing the Breach;" we don't know how that all happen, but it was very serendipitous.  So that was, and I don't know what year that is probably '90 [1990] I guess that was the election during that period.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Who is my great grandmother and she is the one who had the blue eyes and the gray dresses (laughter) and so forth.
Speaker 2: Can you repeat the name one more time?

Speaker 2: Bear with me a second--I take this one back.
Speaker 1: Oh I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry that is my grandmother, and her name was Annie Bell Hampton Moore Austin (laughter).  She had a lot of names and as you can see her--she looks like a part of her Cherokee background, high cheekbones and all.
Speaker 2: Yes you can due to her mother's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Oh all right here we go (laughter). No, you know, it's, it's we're too close (laughter) not to it's probably related, but that's her.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was her mother-in-law.
Speaker 2: About, about when do you think?
Speaker 1: Oh gosh she was a young girl at the time that was taken.
Speaker 2: Eighteen nineties [1890s] you think?
Speaker 1: Yeah probably, yeah 'cause oh my goodness how old would she had been?  Oh no probably further back than that because my grandfather [John Austin] was born the year slavery ended.
Speaker 2: Eighteen sixty-five [1865].
Speaker 1: Uh-hum, so that might be 1875 maybe somewhere alone there because that's his wife.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he wasn't that much older than she was maybe five, six years.  Now I have a picture (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: More.
Speaker 1: Probably do, then that's my, that's my great Aunt.  That's my grandmother that we've just saw.  This is her sister; they look very different as you can see.  That's how families were I guess.  Her name was Lena, Lena Moore.  She never married and she was the pianist as well, but that's my aunt, great Aunt Lena.
Speaker 2: All right.  Okay, is that it yet?
Speaker 1: That I think (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: Actually he was at the wedding 'cause her father was the Lord Mayor of Georgetown, Guyana.  His Excellency John Ford.  He was also the head of Wieting & Richter [Ltd.] cooperation.  He's now dead; her mother lives here, so that's us.
Speaker 2: All righty.
