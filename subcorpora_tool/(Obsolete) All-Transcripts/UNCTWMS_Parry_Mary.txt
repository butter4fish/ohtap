NICOLE WELSH: So my name is Nicole Welsh, and I’m here with Mary Koenig
and Mary Swann Parry in Chapel Hill Library on the 29th of July. And to start off do you
mind telling us when and where you were born?

MARY PARRY: Sure I was born in October, on October 11th 1972 in Kirksville,
Missouri [pause] a Midwestern girl.

NW: So how did you end up in North Carolina?

MP: That’s a long story. So Iwent to Texas to go to college, [at] Texas Christian
University, followed my brother that direction. I didn’t have a lot of thought going into
where to go to college other than where might be fun and the best place I could get into.
So I went down there and met my husband in undergrad, and then he came out to North
Carolina. We got married right after undergrad. He came out to Duke University to go to
law school. So I came with him, and we moved back to Texas to work, and then we really
missed North Carolina. So we came back once again and now are not leaving.

MK: What was it like growing up in Missouri?

MP: It was-- I enjoyed it. I had [not] an unusual childhood, especially by today’s
standards. My parents were divorced. So I did a lot of moving around to Visit my parents.
But Missouri in itself was a pretty quiet tame place to grow up, and it was probably your
basic childhood other than I didn’t have as many friends back then with

parents that were divorced. Now it seems to be more common, but it was a pretty boring

upbringing, normal.

NW: What did you learn from your family or your parents or friends about gender or
justice or what your ciVic duty means?

MP: I would say being raised by a single mother makes you automatically tend toward
feminism because you see how hard-- you see the situation that has brought your mother to
where she is and then see how hard she works to do everything and bring everything to you. But
as far as ciVic duty, my mom encouraged me to vote but was also very private about her voting,
which I would’ve in retrospect thought she would be pretty loud and proud about being
progressive. But whether that was, maybe she felt like she was already pushing the envelope by
being a single mother of three and keeping that all together, but she was pretty quiet about who
she voted for but was also not shy about being progressive in her Views.

NW: Cool. So would you say you’re a feminist?

MP: Yes.

NW: And when do you think you became a feminist?

MP: As far as thinking about being a feminist, I probably in the last few years maybe
with as far as thinking about being a part of the movement. But definitely in undergrad, I was
your typical focused on graduating classes, navigating life and not really thinking about the
bigger social picture. I have always followed politics broadly even as a kid. I really liked-- I
remember when Sandra Day O’Connor was the first woman on the Supreme Court, and I was
way proud of her. But I didn’t feel a pull toward a lot of activism until probably once my kids
were all born and a little bit older and just so happened to be when George Bush was finishing up

his second term and really when Sarah Palin signed on the ticket for the Vice presidency. Then I

said, “I've got to step in here. This can’t happen.” So that was really the highlight of the boom of
my more extreme feminism.

NW: Do you remember other women being involved in activism on campus?

MP: I was in Texas at a private school and probably surrounded by a lot of people who
grew up with a lot and didn’t have a lot to fight for. So no, I don’t remember that much activism
in college.

MK: Along those lines, what was it like being at a private university in Texas with
people who were coming from that background?

MP: Yeah, I didn’t know what to expect as far as that goes so my husband and I both had
help to start out at TCU. But we found quickly that by and large most of our friends there will
very well off and came from backgrounds where they didn’t want for much. So that was
different, and I felt like we were a learning tool for them. They were very surprised sometimes to
find out what they were given in a month for, say, an allowance was something that my husband
came for the whole school year with to make it on for his extra spending money. So it was
definitely an interesting experience, and we definitely left Texas thinking-- in search of more
progressive ideals in lifestyle.

NW: So when your husband was at Duke Law, what were you doing in North Carolina
around that time?

MP: I was working at the medical center at the in the neuro-oncology department, which
is now known as the brain tumor center at Duke. I was doing research.

MK: What was your research on?

MP: I was a clinical research associate so we were studying with Dr. Henry Friedman and

his counterpart is another Friedman, Dr. Friedman who does surgery is on-- draws folks from all

around the country and the world and researching different chemotherapies and ways to help
folks with the conditions.

MK: Cool. What was North Carolina like at that time?

MP: North Carolina was-- we felt was more progressive for us, coming from Texas. But
I do remember that those were the Jesse Helms days. So there was a lot of talk at work about
wondering how he was getting re-elected. Here we sat in the bubble in the Triangle of lots of
liberal ideas at these universities. But that was my first sense of North Carolina really getting my
bearings where I’m in [this] liberal oasis, so to speak, and that North Carolina may by and large
not be as progressive as that area.

NW: So were you-- you were talking about being inspired to take a bigger role in the
women’s movement by these conservative leaders that you, said, “I can’t let this happen
anymore”? But was there anything personally that you’ve experienced that raised your
consciousness to the idea that these oppressions exist?

MP: Oppressions against women nationally, like in America? My upbringing, had I been
more aware about it as a child, I really noticed a lot of, a lot of things you hear about now, things
women are going through or the social safety nets that we want to provide. I watched my mom
navigate those and watched how she was helped by places. She was also a survivor of domestic
Violence so I remember she left my father because she got help at a place that provided services
like that. So one of my first moves after I navigated having children and making it through those
little phases that’s usually a blur for women, the first place I started to get involved was at a
Women’s Center in Chapel Hill. Because they at the time didn’t provide those services, but they
helped with women who were trying to go out on their own leaving situations like that with

financial security and navigating budgets so that they can start new. So that meant a lot to me,

and it made me-- it was the first time probably as an adult that I looked back and said-- I looked
at how far she had come and what she had done, and then I looked at my situation was much
different and I could give back. And that’s when I really first wanted to do more and give back
so that women like her could also get out of [those] situations.

NW: That’s great and that was the Compass Center?

MP: Um hmm, now it’s called the Compass Center. When I first joined, it was called the
Chapel Hill-- it wasn’t called Chapel Hill it; was called the Women’s Center. It was located in
Chapel Hill commonly confused with the Women’s Center on campus. But now they have
merged with the Family Violence Prevention Center and they’re called the Compass Center.

NW: And what exactly did you do there?

MP: I was a volunteer and a board member, and I helped them organize their armual
fundraiser so that they could keep providing their services.

NW: Cool.

MK: How long did you volunteer there?

MP: I was on their board for two years, but I volunteered in that role for three as the
chair of that event.

NW: Are there any speciﬁc like moments that you remember there?

MP: I would say that my experiences at the Women’s Center while necessary to raise the
funds so they could do that great work were not really related. Mine were, it’s an art show that
they put on so I was doing a lot of interacting with artists, getting corporate sponsors so it really
felt more like a fun event versus me directly helping women in need. But also I've come to
realize that fundraising is something that hardly anyone feels comfortable doing or wants to do,

and if I was willing to do it that that was the highest and best use of my time.

NW: Very cool. So when did you get involved with Women AdvaNCe or the people that
would eventually start Women AdvaNCe?

MP: After the 2012 elections. I had finished up my second term as Women for Obama,
Women’s Vote director for Organizing for America [OFA] for Orange County, and after 2008 I
remembered someone-- we were building lists like you do in campaigns and getting as many
women on board so they would follow the issues and vote. And we built a pretty sizable list, and
after 2008 someone said to me-- my children were still pretty young at the time, and someone
said, “What’s next?” after President Obama was elected. And I thought to myself “You say
what’s next. I’m exhausted.” That was my first experience really involved in a campaign at that
level, and I thought okay, that was nice, we did it. Now I’m moving on.

But then 2010 happened, and we had the marriage amendment and I definitely saw what
they were saying to me before, I saw we really need to keep these women engaged and involved.
So after 2012 I decided to do that role again and then keep that list going. So the folks at
Lillian’s List had put together a wrap up like really one week after the election, which I was
impressed with. I was exhausted and I knew they probably were too and, but I went and I
mentioned to them at the time that we really needed to reach out to women across the state.

As the Orange County Women’s Vote director all I heard from women was I’ll help you,
but we’re speaking inside this vacuum. We really need to reach outside of Orange County where
women need to know what’s going on and make a difference in these elections. I was
brainstorming maybe an idea about, I didn’t really know but a blog or something, some intemet
way to reach women and share ideas. But Laura Edwards and Kim-Marie Sacciccio were already
going down that road, had already figured out this Women AdvaNCe role. And when they first

started talking about it, were talking more about raising up the voices of feminist scholars and

Parry 11

then decided “Hey, we really need to reach out to even broader, to women who need to be paying
attention who aren’t on the same page yet”. So that’s how I got involved. I said, “Well, my goal
in life now is this list and with whatever powers I have is to try to get women who are in the
middle who are in this phase that I’m coming out of; this raising your kids while they’re young
and navigating life is so busy.” It’s very hard to pay attention to what’s going on and you don’t
feel you have the bandwidth to enter that conversation so to help bring them on board. So I was
thrilled that they already had that going and that I could help out.

NW: Where do you see Women AdvaNCe going in the future?

MP: My hope is that it can become a go-to source for women almost like a [news] source
but with that social component where women feel connected as a group, as a voting base I guess
in a way, even though we’re non-partisan. Some place where they know they can come for issues
affecting them and feel like their voice matters. I heard a lot during the campaigns I was involved
with that I really like Women for Obama because I know that I’m doing this phone bank here in
Chapel Hill, but you’ve also got women in Asheville and Fayetteville, and we’re all making
these phone calls, and it feels like that we’re doing this together. So it makes them feel like the
impact of their one phone call is multiplied. So I feel like Women AdvaNCe is a way to do that
to connect these little groups, like book groups of women all over the state, but rather than
feeling like you’re spinning your wheels there are groups like this all over the state doing the
same thing.

MK: Do you feel like issues or oppressions facing women have changed [between] the
time you were in college and now in your organizing work?

MP: I feel like a lot of changes have taken place probably. I think a lot about how the

nineties were the good times financially, and people my age didn’t have as much trouble finding

Parry 12

a job. And so when times are better, people are paying less attention, and the recession probably
helps highlight other problems that have been existing the whole time, but especially now post-
recession and now in North Carolina with these really conservative legislative decisions
happening. I feel like all of a sudden we’ve taken a really sharp turn, and I’m not happy with
that. The great thing is that the folks I talk to who are engaged are not-- they don’t like one bit
what’s going on, but they’re not like closing off to it. They’re up for the challenge of we’re not
going to let this happen to our state, and there are actually a lot of folks in the middle who would
have normally tuned out to politics right now who have decided “I really need to pay attention or
this is going to happen.” So if there’s a silver lining, that’s it.

NW: What do you see happening with the changes in like how conservative our General
Assembly currently is?

MP: Probably for most folks in North Carolina this, even though it seems like it should
be a surprise, it probably snuck up on them because they have been, been voting blind. A lot of
people vote, they know who’s at the top of the ticket, but they’re not paying attention to the state
issues or the roles. A lot of us could go back to elementary school and learn some North Carolina
government and figure out how that works and how important those roles are. And that’s coming
to the forefront now. So we’re going to find a lot more people looking before they vote next
time, but looking to vote as well, really doing a little bit better research. And I hope Women
AdvaNCe can help put those-- help women with those issues and look at candidates based on
those issues so that they can vote and not vote against their own self-interests.

NW: Do you think Moral Mondays has raised some Visibility for those issues?

MP: Definitely. I've been very impressed by Moral Mondays. Besides raising the

conversation about those issues, one thing that folks today don’t know enough how to do,

Interview number U-1006 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern
Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.

Parry 13

because they don’t have experience with it, is to organize and rally. And maybe my
grandmother’s era they were better at that because they did more of it, and now we haven’t been
doing that for a while. So having those Moral Mondays each week so that people can see what
it’s like, see pictures online, see that it’s not a crazy liberals or whatever the conservative side
would like to paint that picture. But that, that gives people a chance to plan because people are I
would say a lot busier today. They keep themselves overbooked with things to do. So several
factors have made that how it’s repeating and social media have helped more people come to that
than would normally think of themselves as being activists or speak out on topics.

MK: To backtrack a little bit, how did you get involved with OFA?

MP: So I definitely have been always someone who pays attention to elections and votes.
But I, I was pretty fmstrated with George Bush, as a lot of people were, as president. So I was
really going to pay attention to who was going to vote next, and I was ready for whoever that
person was. And I had heard that Hilary Clinton was going to run, which made me proud that
there might be a first woman president, and then it became clear pretty early that Barack Obama
had this juggernaut feel where, that maybe he’s going to be the candidate. So I knew that I would
get involved. I had never though been involved in an election, other than-- in a campaign other
than voting. Ivoted, but I never made phone calls or knocked on doors or anything like that. But
when Sarah Palin was first chosen I was worried at first because she was a woman, and she
hadn’t spoken yet. And I thought well, “that’s a really good pick to balance out John McCain,
and I can’t have any more of this politics. I really need a liberal in the White House.” But then
she-- it was her very first appearance when she knocked it out of the park with a very negative,
nasty, conservative speak that was a huge turnoff to me, and very derogatory to who would be

the first African American president and no respect. And I thought this is a continuation of what

Interview number U-1006 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern
Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.

Parry 14

I really don’t want. And it was-- she was so polarizing that it drove me to, I’m going to get
involved. I will do-- I will not be somebody who sits in the sidelines. I’m going to make this not
happen. So I happened to know that my husband was working with someone who was taking a
leave of absence to work for the OFA campaign in North Carolina. So I said to him, “Email him
and tell him whatever they need me to do I’ll do.” And it turned out they needed a women’s vote
director in Orange County. I thought that was odd at first to target women even though now I
understand as such a large voting base I see why they were doing it, but it felt a little bit odd that
we would put ourselves in our own category to--. I didn’t know, I wouldn’t say I thought it was
sexist, but I thought “Why can’t we all vote, work for the vote.” But I quickly understood why
they were doing what they were doing, and I would say absolutely in 2008 that Sarah Palin
helped drive-- it was very easy for me to get women on that list and she was a big reason,
definitely.

NW: That’s interesting because having a woman in a position that might be a position of
power is in a way empowering, but she did the opposite for you it sounds like.

MP: Right. Yeah, most women that wouldn’t have been, wouldn’t have been that
polarizing, but it was the way she spoke and how negative in contrast with the hope and change
message of OFA. And then coming on the heels of the many, many blunders of the George Bush
presidency I said, “We cannot continue down this road.” And my kids happened to be getting
enough older, my youngest was in preschool so that I had that block of time that I could actually
devote to something. So it was a good marriage of time and opportunity.

NW: So what did you learn at OFA?

MP: I learned a lot about messaging and how to talk about issues especially with women,

not as if marketing to them but understanding where women are at with understanding politics

Interview number U-1006 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern
Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.

Parry 15

and how connected or disconnected they feel from it and how to use different messaging tools to
help break down those barriers and bring them on board.

MK: How do your children feel about your activism?

MP: They were very excited, especially my daughter because it’s women’s issues that I
tend to be working on and the boys were definitely-- they all made phone calls and registered
voters, and they had fun doing that and felt like a part of the process. So that was great. But my
daughter being ten, she liked-- what I was doing before I started doing OFA work was doing a
lot for volunteering in their schools, which they felt a part of. So then it was a nice transition that
they felt a part of what I did next. So my daughter was ten at the time, “So if you’re going to start
Women for Obama, I’m going to start Kids for Obama.” And I thought that’s perfect because
then I’m not going to find a babysitter, I’m going to bring you along, and she ended up actually
we would have these house parties to bring women together and talk about the campaign, and
she would present, which was a great experience for her. She talked about why she wanted the
president to win and why kids should care about the campaign. So it was a great avenue for her
to understand the activism and getting involved.

NW: That’s very cool. Do you feel like you’ve taught your kids a lot about politics and
how to participate?

MP: Absolutely. I sometimes wonder if my, our kids at night are thinking, “Oh if only
we could turn on The Voice” or whatever these singing shows that all their little friends -- not all
their friends -- are watching, but because we do a lot of talking about current events and keeping
them up. My daughter-- probably a lot of girls that are ten aren’t talking about things like
abortion with their mom yet. But I felt like this is something she needs to understand and it’s

nothing she needs to be afraid of so she understands, and plus she was going with me to all these

Parry 16

events. She was going to hear about these issues. So and it brought a certain maturity to her voice
on how she thinks about these topics and asks her own questions. She even said to me one day,
once she started listening about the two different sides of the argument about abortion or choice
for women. She said, “Oh now I understand why the people protest out in front of that Flamed
Parenthood in front of our house,” because, she never really understood where I’d mentioned that
when she said, “What are they doing?” But it wasn’t until the election that she really started
learning about the issue and the history of the issue and how divisive it is, and then she came all
full circle for her. So it’s a learning experience for sure that I don’t think I could’ve given her in
the way that we did without that volunteer role.

NW: Has she been to Moral Monday?

MP: Yes, she loves Moral Monday. She took photos one day and she likes seeing
different kids and the different ages of people that come out to Moral Monday. So and she feels
like she can do something. She, “I can’t vote, but I can come out to Moral Monday and hold a
sign that says my teachers deserve a better paycheck” or whatever her sign says that week. So
she’s enj oyed that platform for her to have a voice.

NW: That’s very cool.

MK: That’s so amazing that you give her those opportunities to make sure she has a
voice at such an early age because it’s so important.

MP: Yeah, I think about that. I never would blame my mom for “Oh what she should’ve
given me more of a feminist upbringing”, but I think she did in her own way through the things
that she went through. I definitely learned a lot more about being a woman and the different
pitfalls that you can find as a woman in society by watching her. But I definitely am proud that I

can serve it up for Emma and let her try on whatever she wants to try on and push her toward

Interview number U-1006 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern
Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.

Parry 17

whatever she wants to do. And I love it that she’s already talking about rumIing for office
because of course as a ten year old she sees nothing but the fun and joy of rumIing of ofﬁce,
which I’m sure is not always the case, but she thinks it would be fabulous to run for office and
can’t wait to.

One of the best things she said after the 2012 campaign when she was so involved was
“are we not going to call people anymore now?’ I said, “No, the campaign’s over. We don’t have
to make phone calls anymore.” She says, “But I really want to; I really like that.” And I said,
“Well, that’s great.” So I said, “Well, maybe you can work on, what’s the next campaign you can
work on?” So she’s decided she’s going to work for Kay Hagan’s re-election.

NW: So talking about, you feel, I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds
like you’re giving your daughter a feminist upbringing. And you said your mom did in her own
way and that got me wondering what changes you’ve seen in the perception of feminism across
your lifetime; because from what I've read and heard from other people, it seems like the word
has meant different things across time.

MP: Yeah [pause] I would say feminism--, I was growing up in the Midwest. That
probably as a child, that probably would’ve been a word that people would’ve been put off by,
I’m guessing. But we didn’t talk a lot about being a feminist back then. But I always felt like
one. If I think back in retrospect, I was always paying attention to the first women to the
Supreme Court justice or whatever role they might fill. So of course as you get older your
awareness grows and, but as far as people’s perception of feminism I still think there are certain
words and phrases that unfortunately give people the wrong feeling or they don’t warm up to
them. I worry that feminism is one of those words for women that they should be embracing, but

that they see as a really, like an extremist word. Now I don’t know that because I don’t, I’m not

Interview number U-1006 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern

Parry 18

talking about feminism with that word. And maybe if I-- it might be interesting if I [try to] start
bringing that up with women that I know are liberal, that I know are for women’s issues here in
North Carolina. What is the reaction? It’s very interesting because we talk a lot. We’re juggling
kids and sports or trying to go back to work and women’s issues and all talking about that. But it
is interesting to think about how we have to message and choose our words carefully because
everything has--. It may be in part because things have become so polarized in politics and the
folks in the middle are the ones that don’t respond well to the fear tactics on the right, but that
are turned off by that alarmist speak on either side and tend to tune out anyway. I wonder if they
don’t lump too many feelings and emotions into words like feminism. When I think about the
word feminism, of course I’m feminist. I’m a woman. I want women’s issues. I want progress.
So that’s interesting, and I might actually start bringing that up and seeing what people’s reaction
is.

MK: It’s interesting.

NW: Can you talk a little bit more about the work of Women AdvaNCe?

MP: Sure.

NW: Can we get the spiel?

MP: Yeah, definitely. So Women AdvaNCe is non-partisan but absolutely progressive,
women’s issues and our three focus areas are education, health care and jobs and the economy.
So we think those are the three issues that women can really get behind on the same page about
because we all want public education to succeed for reasons even beyond educating our own
kids, but drawing business to our state and all those reasons and support for our teachers.
Women’s-- choice for women is, I forgot the statistic, but I want to say it’s in the high eighties

percentile of women who are pro-choice and proud to be. So and then with the economy I know

Parry 19

there are so many women in our state who--, women are the most small business owners in our
state. We have the highest percentage of women business owners, and women are also the ones
who are most likely to be affected by things like our refusal to accept Medicaid and the
unemployment insurance. All these things that women can really get behind because they’re not
ultra-liberal, hot button issues, they’re normal issues that they want to get behind. So with
Women AdvaNCe, with our daily publication that’s in short easy-to-digest sound bytes, Women
can really start to understand the many, many nuances of what’s going on in our state on those
issues that when they get to an election and they haven’t been paying attention to-- it’s a lot of
information to digest. But in little bits and pieces along the way, Women AdvaNCe can help all
women stay up on these issues that are so important to their lives.

NW: Great.

MK: What would you say your proudest accomplishment is?

MP: My proudest accomplishment. Every mother would say it’s their success of their
children. My kids are doing really well, and they’re smart kids who are really taking part and
looking ahead at their life. But for me, every mother should get to answer that ﬁrst, but then as a
woman you could say, “What is my own personal proudest accomplishment?” That’s a good
question. My proudest accomplishment is probably [pause] it’s not a real tangible
accomplishment, but its success at building networks and communicating with women. I've done
a lot of different things in my life. I've had a lot of different roles, but talent for bringing people
together and it-- that has helped me in whatever I’m doing. And that it’s something that is
missing maybe for women that they’re starting to find ( ) [through] organizations like
Women AdvaNCe is the, they know something needs to be done but they feel caught up in too

busy to lead, but they will do. So we need more leaders to lead. So I've always been the type of

person to do whatever the job is that no one else wants to do because I know it’s important and
I’ll do it. And so it’s important to do that for everybody and help them get involved whether it’s
for the Women’s Center or OFA or Women AdvaNCe or for North Carolina. So I've enjoyed the
building networks of people over my life.

MK: What do you see yourself doing in the next five years?

MP: Well, I’m enjoying this new role at Women AdvaNCe as the director of advocacy,
and I-- I’m really hoping to build it and build a huge following here in North Carolina, which
will take a lot of work. And I haven’t really thought beyond that honestly because I feel like
[I’m] still a little bit with an eight year old and an eleven year old and an almost sixteen year old
that I’m about at capacity for juggling right now. But I fit in the work role, and it’s working so
far. But every da -- [for example], I’m on the way over to this interview I was stopping at the
high school to drop off the driver’s ed form, and I know that Ben has been waiting for me all day
to do something fun. So that I feel like a lot of balls in the air. IfI could still be working at
Women AdvaNCe and looking back at 2014 and saying, “Wow we made an impact and got a lot
of women to the polls in an educated fashion,” I would think of that as a huge success. And then
I’m sure we’d come up with some fabulous new idea too because I don’t sit still very [well].

NW: What struggles do you think women whether they’re mothers or activists or North
Carolinians will have to face in the future?

MP: What I’m worried about most right now having three kids is public education, but
there’s a lot to choose from right now. Education is more than opening a public school in a
neighborhood. I worry about the impact that it will have not only on our kids and these decisions
about teacher pay that are driving teachers away from education in North Carolina. I worry about

businesses not wanting to come to North Carolina because it’s unfriendly in that way. So if

businesses aren’t relocating here, then the economy is not as good. It’s such a domino effect that
that’s one of the biggest ones for me education. I feel like there’s a lot at stake there, and I feel
like even with the recession that school, I've watched the schools have to do more with less, and
that’s been hard. And now I feel like these latest decisions with the budget are really going to
cramp their style, and I hope that-- I don’t know. I hope we can see change on the, in the near
term so that it’s not as bad as I feel like it might be.

NW: What do you think about America as a larger—-, like women in America, do you
think that that’s different than the situation in North Carolina or--?

MP: From the articles I read it sounds like this is going on all over America, and some
states are better off than others. And by and large there’s a huge problem with, I hate to say voter
apathy, because I’m sure there are some who are deciding not to vote. But, women especially,
are so busy that--, but they’ve got to, they’re going to get to a point when these issues like
education and choice and impacts on the economy where they’re concerned are affected to this
degree. They’re going to have to say “I've got to prioritize this.” We’ve all got to be a little bit
more engaged ciVically and pay attention, and hopefully some of them would also run for office.

I definitely think about how different North Carolina’s legislative session would’ve been
in 2013 had that room been represented by as many women as we have in the electorate. With
that percentage, we wouldn’t have the cuts to education and the definitely the choice that
legislation on choice that we had if we had had women in that room-- more women, I should say.

NW: So thinking back on your experiences is there anything that you wish someone
would’ve told you about the work that you were going to do or something that you would like to

say to a young woman who’s or any woman who’s trying to get involved with activist work?

MP: I would say I wish I had come across groups in college that were doing activist
work. I would have really liked that. But I didn’t seek that out because I was definitely juggling
parent issues, who’s paying for college, all these different things, what am I going to study? But I
wish I had started even earlier because always in retrospect, especially when you’re doing with
legislature or even a nation where things aren’t going the way you think they should, that you
should’ve tried harder earlier and everyone else should have to. So starting earlier would’ve been
good and also I see a trend at least in North Carolina, which is great, of trying to help more
women look at rum1ing for office and what that involves. So that this “big brother, arms up into
politics” can become “big sister, arms up into politics” because it is something that no one is
going to-- you don’t take a college course in how to run for office typically. And you-- there’s so
much to it, and it is, it sounds like it’s a lot like rumIing a business. And women need to
understand earlier that more of them need to take turns and fill some of those roles and the
impact that they could have and if they started thinking about it earlier that they might plan for it,
like they do careers and children. That would be fabulous if we could have more women thinking
about as one of the roles they’ll play in their life. Women don’t typically have linear careers
anyway, for the most part. More like men who start in this career and stay in it their entire life.
Women tend to stop and have kids or change jobs to something that’s more, that’s easier to
juggle, and that could be one more arrow in their pocket. So that would be great.

NW: Is there anything that we haven’t asked you about that you thought we would ask or
anything else that you’d like to bring up or mention?

MP: Not really. This has been a great interview and it’s actually given me a lot to think
about too as far as asking women from my generation to consciously think about their feminism

and to talk about it more. And we’re a very reactionary society, it seems like. Instead of being

more proactive, which we need to be, and it’s really no fault of their own because they’re
juggling and so much is coming at them, but that doesn’t mean that I mean they can do whatever
they set their minds to. So that as a group if we start talking about it more and making it more of
a priority that could do nothing but good for feminism.

NW: Great. Well, thank you so much for meeting with us.

MP: Thanks.

MK: Thank you.
