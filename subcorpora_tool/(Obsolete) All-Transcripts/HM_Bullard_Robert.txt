Story_ID: 1780
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side; but we'll start with your mother's side first so we don't get them confused.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Myrtle Bullard, M-Y-R-T-L-E B-U-L-L-A-R-D.
Speaker 1: And what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Brundidge, B-R-U-N-D-I-D-G-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, goodness.  I don't know her date of birth.  I've forgotten.  She was born in Opp, Alabama, O-P-P, Alabama.
Speaker 1: You have any idea what year?
Speaker 2: I think it was 1910.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What do you know about your mother's side of the family; I mean, how far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew my mother's mother and her father.  I didn't know any of the relatives beyond my grandmother and grandfather on her side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you know of any--or what your great-grandparents were doing or visit--is there a family history coming out of the Civil War or slavery period that you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know--I assumed there was but I'm not familiar with it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what about your grandparents that were--what did they do for a living?
Speaker 2: They're both deceased, but they were--my grandfather was a laborer, and my grandmother [Savannah Brundidge], she didn't work as far as I know.  She was a housewife.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your grandfather do, like, farm labor (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No.  He did handiwork, odds and ends; construction, masonry, odd jobs; that kind of thing.  He was good with his hands.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: God, I'm showing up blank.
Speaker 1: Well, that's okay.  It was Brundidge (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And what was grandfather's name?  I can't even remember his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your grandmother?  You remember her name?
Speaker 2: Savannah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Savannah Brundidge.
Story_ID: 1781
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did they [Bullard's maternal grandparents] have any stories to tell about--were they from Opp, Alabama, too?
Speaker 2: Right.  They were born and raised in that part of Alabama, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And they--where is Opp in terms, I guess in relationship to--(unclear)
Speaker 2: It's southeast.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It would be Southeast Alabama.  It's toward Florida--the Florida line.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now are there any stories your grandparents shared with you about life in Opp; what it was like, what race relations were like, what your chances were there, whether they went to school or not?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, I'm trying to think.  On--I was much closer on my father's [Nehemiah Bullard] side of the family because they lived next to us.  I don't remember any stories that they told.
Speaker 1: Well, do you have any sense of what it was like based on--
Speaker 2: Well, in the neighborhood where they lived, I remember growing and visiting every Sunday.  We would go to my grandmother's house, and they lived in an all-black neighborhood when we were small, the streets were not paved.  There were no streetlights, and, as a matter of fact, at the end of the dirt road there was a landfill.  I recall vividly the trucks running back and forth, the dust.  And it was, you know, as I said before, it was an area where Jim Crow ruled, and blacks lived in that area and whites lived in another area.  As you would move closer toward downtown, in to streetlights and paved streets and all of that, that was basically the white area.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I noticed that, too, as a kid going to visit my father's home in Kentucky, the black area of town had no pavement.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And no running water, no sewers, and that came later.  You know, the paved streets would stop right at the edge of the black community.  As I said, that as a kid that I remember that pretty vividly.
Speaker 1: I mean, young people now may not realize that was the case in those days.  When you talk about discrimination in other towns, what it actually means in terms of services.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did it appear as a contradiction to you when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: Of course.  It was obvious that growing up--and I grew up in an all-black neighborhood, in an area where there were no paved streets, and no streetlights, and no sewer systems, and no swimming pools.  And when you would go toward downtown where the white area is, they had all of that.  It was--it was something that, that you couldn't miss.  And it was something that a lot of the people who were active, trying to get, you know, make change, this was in late '50s (1950s) or early '60s (1960s), it was obvious that they were, you know, trying to get things changed.  But it took almost a national movement to even trickle down to little small towns in Alabama, as opposed to Montgomery [Alabama] and Birmingham [Alabama]; places like that.
Story_ID: 1782
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, what did your mother [Myrtle Brundidge Bullard] have to say about growing up?  Did she talk about what it was like when she grew up in Opps [sic, Opp, Alabama])?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, my mother always had the sense that you could be whatever you want to be, no matter what the constraints, and no matter what the laws that were basically set up to maintain separate and unequal.  And it wasn't separate and equal, it was separate and unequal.  But she, you know, she was determined to make sure that all of us received a good education and had a good work ethic to overcome those things that were legal.  It was legal to discriminate against black people.  And, of course, she never liked it and my father never liked it, and never bucked, went under or succumbed to this whole idea that just because you're black, you were inferior and you can't do this much.  So, you know, it must have been tough for them because it was not a bed of roses for--during that time that I was growing up in the late '50s (1950s).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother have a chance to go to school, high school?
Speaker 2: My mother and father [Nehemiah Bullard] graduated from high school, and they were strong believers in education, even though neither one of them went to college.  They made sure that they instilled in us, my brothers and sisters, that education was the way to overcome a lot of the barriers that were placed in our path, and that--I was always taught, you know, if you get a good education and nobody can ever take that from you.  And that stuck with me and my siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know what aspirations your mother had coming out of high school?  Did she have a certain career in mind or what was she thinking?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think my mother always wanted to go to college, and, but I think the fact that there were--she came from a large family, and there were no resources.  And so, it was a matter of trying to do the best during the circumstances, and make sure that her children got something that she was not able to get.  She's always talked about she wished she could have gone to college.  She thought she would have been very good.  She was very smart.  My mother and father were very smart.  And so it wasn't because of the lack of ability or intelligence or motivation or drive.  It was resources.
Speaker 1: Why is this--did she--I guess if she had to--did the regular cycle if she was born around 1910, she would have graduated around 1928, '29 [1929] or so, or and that would be like on the eve of the Great Depression.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Which would have meant that poor people in the United States would be poorer than they were.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  My mother and father, they talked about the Depression, and to a large extent, that Depression, Great Depression instilled in them this idea of being frugal, not wasting, not being flamboyant in the kinds of things that they bought, and they believed in savings and not overspending, living on budget, making sure that you count all of your pennies, as my mother would say, "Count all your pennies, don't spend more than what you have, and make sure you always save, and save for that rainy day."  And I think that Depression thinking sunk in, and in some cases, she their worldview--their outlook.  And as I say, there was not a whole lot of opportunities for my mother growing up in that rural, southern part of Alabama.
Speaker 1: So, but you don't know if she had an idea of that she wanted to be a teacher or nurse or whatever, you know, as a  career or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: If she was even thinking about a career?  But some people know that a lot of women didn't think of a career; they thought about, you know, they should be at home as a homemaker.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, now, you know, we never talked about it.  She was definitely comfortable in her role as mother, as caretaker in terms of taking care of the family,  good with numbers,  And so, I, you know, I--but I do think that she probably, you know, if she'd had the opportunity, I think she probably would have gone to college and would have--probably would have become a teacher, because there were five children in my family, and four out of five are teachers.  So I think that there's something there.  So it's probably subliminal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Let me go to your father's side.  Now, do you know the school your mother went to?  I mean, what was the name of it?  Was there a school in Opp, per se, or did she have to go to another community--
Speaker 2: You know, I think there was a--I don't recall.  I don't remember the school.  But I do know that during that period of time, I think, you know, there was--you went to the sixth grade in one community, and then you went to another school, quote, to graduate (laughter).  And most of the, I guess, people during that time, black people during that time, didn't graduate from high school.  So it was, there was another school that she had to attend in order to finish high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 1783
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you about your father.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Nehemiah Bullard, N-E-H-E-M-I-A-H.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My father was a couple of years younger, so he must have been born in 1908 or somewhere around in there.
Speaker 1: Was he younger or older?
Speaker 2: He was--he was older.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a couple years older than my mother [Myrtle Brundidge Bullard].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Born in 1908.
Speaker 2: Yes, somewhere around in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was born in Elba, E-L-B-A [Alabama].
Speaker 1: All right.  Is that close to Opps [sic, Opp]?
Speaker 2: Eighteen miles.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, how far back can you trace your dad's family?
Speaker 2: Well, my dad's family I'm a little more familiar with that side of the family because there were much more records and much more talking about my great-grandmother and father were slaves.  And Peter and Lucinda Hammons (ph.), and they--those two were able to purchase more than five hundred acres of timberland in Elba in 1875, just ten years out of slavery.  And so, they were landowners, and so, my--and the land was passed down to my grandmother [Minnie] and, of course, on down to my parents--my father.  So I'm a little more familiar with that side of--with my father's side of the family because I grew up in Elba and my grandmother lived in the same city.  Even though we lived in one neighborhood, my grandmother lived downtown, near the downtown area where there were blacks--a black neighborhood downtown.  They were able--later on they were moved out through urban renewal, but then and when she moved out, she moved--they moved next to--next door to us.  So I saw my grandmother every day because she lived next door.
Story_ID: 1784
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She [Bullard's paternal grandmother, Minnie] had stories.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember some of the stories she told about slavery?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother would tell, you know, stories about her parents and that--and how difficult it was for them, and the fact that they were, my great-grandparents were--I never met them, of course--but they were entrepreneurial, in terms of Peter Hammons and Lucinda Hammons were able to get this property and hold it, you know, during the time--from 1875 and hold it for all those years during a period of time when, after Reconstruction, you know, the land was taken from black people, and stolen and tricked out of land, etcetera; they were able to hold on to it.  And my grandmother, basically, would talk about the fact that how people, white people, would come to her and try to, you know, have schemes to take the land.  And each, you know, every five or six, seven years or so, they would sell timber off the land and divide up the money, a substantial amount of money for black people to have.  And, of course, you know, when you sell timber you're not selling land.  And so, there were all kinds of schemes that would come up, and so, she had to be sharp.  My grandmother only had a sixth-grade education.  But in terms of numbers, in terms of thinking, she was unmatched.  I never met my grandfather on my father's side.  But, you know, from what I've been told, he was very tall, Jim Bullard.  And they called him "Big Jim," but he was one who did not knuckle under, and who was not the one to shy away from a fight or a struggle.  And I think the fact that my grandmother--my grandmother and grandfather had property and had means to be independent and not be dependent on working for somebody or not having to be beholden to, you know, somebody else for their livelihood, I think that made--that instilled in them, their kids, a sense of independence.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was, oh, God, let me see. God.
Speaker 1: Your great-grandmother is Lucinda, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Minnie (laugher).  Minnie.
Speaker 1: Minnie.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Minnie Bullard and her husband was Jim.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Minnie Bullard.
Speaker 1: So they had to constantly defend their land they had?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Story_ID: 1785
Speaker 1: Was there a story passed down about how your great-grandparents [paternal great-grandparents, Peter and Lucinda Hammons] got the land in the first place?
Speaker 2: Well, there's all kinds of stories, but we don't know.  I mean, just think of--what, ten years out of slavery.  How could you--where did they get the money?  They, you know, of course, you must, you know, understand that, you know, once out of slavery you could do odd jobs, you could, you know, acquire money, salary through whatever; but it was not forty acres, it was more than five hundred acres.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: There was no forty acres and a mule [a method of compensation for former slaves after the Civil War] given to them in--the deed basically, you know, was set that this was paid for; was not, you know, something given to them by the government.  They paid for it.
Speaker 1: When you said some timberland, I was thinking maybe 120 acres (unclear)--
Speaker 2: This is timberland.
Speaker 1: Five hundred acres.
Speaker 2: Five hundred acres.  Timberland that was, that was used to--as a matter of fact, when that timberland was sold, as I say, every, I guess five, six, seven years or so, and divided up among the siblings, when it got to my grandmother, and when she divided up the shares among her children, my father's share was large enough to send all of us to college.  We didn't have to--we didn't have no student loans.  We didn't know what no student loans--we didn't have no bank loans.  My--that timberland paid for all five of my father's children to go to college, and paid for--house paid for.  It was something that was renewable each year because, you know, we had to go out and replant trees.  And so, the fact that we had land that was useable and was income-producing, I think, gave us a bit of independence that a lot of, you know, black folks in that part of the country [near Elba, Alabama] did not have.  And so, my grandmother [Minnie] was very independent.  I mean, she--I mean, she had money in the bank.  And so, even though she didn't trust banks.  And she had her stash, you know, her strongbox where she kept money.  And if an emergency would arise, she would have the money to do whatever that's needed.  And so, that--I think, that kind of independence, and that kind of creativity, and that kind of having resources on my father's side meant that there was more opportunities for my father and his siblings to go to college than my--than on my mother's [Myrtle Brundidge Bullard] side.
Story_ID: 1786
Speaker 1: Oh, that's something.  I mean, that's something (unclear) 500 acres and trying to defend that [family land in Elba, Alabama] through all this turmoil in all the terror (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and even defending it--even up until the time that I was in Houston [Texas] back in the '80s (1980s), you know.  And when my last aunt, who was heir to the property, and she was getting up, in like, seventies, her late seventies, and I can recall we having to go back to Houston--from Houston back to Alabama to defend these folks who were trying--who're trying to say that we had sold the land.  They were knocking down trees and houses, you know, all the sheds had been put on it.  Yeah, and--because we were in Texas, you know, which is quite a distance from Alabama.  So watching something that stopped at--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this has been an ongoing protracted struggle to hang on to this.  And, this is not--this is--none of this is easy in Alabama, so that's probably (unclear)(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You know, you look at the fact that, you know, by 1910, black people had, you know, was owning millions and millions of acres of land.  I think twenty million acres in 1910.  And up--you know, right now we only--we don't own that much.  It's been stolen, it's been sold--well, you look at the plight of the black farmers, you know, having to sue the USDA [United States Department of Agriculture] because the USDA has discriminated against them in terms of giving them loans and whatever.  So it's continued even to this day in terms of black land loss and how it's difficult to hold on to land, particularly if the land is valuable, whether it's timberland or whether it's beachfront property, or whether it's in an area that's considered very productive.  It's difficult.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Considering nobody's making any more land, all land is going to be valuable sooner or later.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 1787
Speaker 1: So, anyway, so that's--so now, what did your father [Nehemiah Bullard]--so did he grow up fairly well-to-do, I guess, with this land, or what is that (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, my father was not well-to-do.  As I said, my grandmother [Minnie] was very frugal (laughter).  And so, she was able--he could have gone to college.  He finished high school, and I think he went one year.  But he was not--he was not the college person.  Again, he was more working with his hands.  He could do--he could fix anything.  You name it, he could fix it.  Like, you know, electrical, mechanical, he could build.  I mean, he was a jack-of-all-trades kind of a person.  His brother, he went to college, finished college.
Speaker 1: Did anybody go to Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee Inst., Alabama] of that group?
Speaker 2: No.  My uncle went to, let's see, where did he go.  Alabama A & M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama].  My sister [Betty Bullard] went to Tuskegee, but, in that--so there were resources for my aunt and my father and his brother to go to college if they, you know, if they so desired.  But, as I say, my father was, you know, he was good with his hands and so, he figured he could do it--make a living doing that.  And so, it was not that, you know, he needed or wanted to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So as far as you know, I mean, was that--did he end up doing what he wanted to do?  Was that what he wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Well, my father, as I said, he was very good with his hands, and in terms of working, you know, on electrical, he was--he eventually was licensed as an electrician, but getting that in Alabama was very difficult.  And so, he worked with a white person, a white electrician and did most of the wiring--he could wire houses and wire all kinds of buildings, etcetera; and, of course, the white electrician had the license, but my father did all the work under him.  And so, but as my--over the years as my father, I think, in maybe ten years out of retirement, he was able to get his own license, but there were barriers no matter what your skills were.  But, I think, you know, in terms of him doing what he wanted to do, I think for the most part he was able to do what he wanted to do and again--take care of his family and he provided pretty good--he provided, you know, pretty good for his family.  And, as I said, you know, in terms of--he was the person that my grandmother relied upon because he next door.  And so, he took care of a lot of the business, a lot of businesses and made sure that everything was right with the property.  And so, he was, you know, the go-to person.  So I think that's--that may be one reason why, you know, he stayed close with my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: I don't know it.  I don't know it.
Speaker 1: So the towns are eighteen miles apart.
Speaker 2: Just eighteen miles apart, yeah.  So it's like--
Speaker 1: Do the high schools play each other?  I mean, do they go to the--do the feed at the same high school or --
Speaker 2: No, it's two different school systems, two different districts.  And I really don't even know how they met.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we're going to pause here a second.  We have to make a notation here that (unclear)--every half-hour.
Story_ID: 1788
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your parents [Nehemiah and Myrtle Brundidge Bullard], now, about how old were they when they got married?
Speaker 2: I think they were probably in--in their early twenties.  Yeah.  They were young.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So now, when you think about--so this was around 1930 or so they get married.  And so, when you think about their talents, their dispositions, their looks; you know, who do you think that you take after het most?
Speaker 2: My father.  My father, you know, the more I--the older I get, the more I see my father in me in terms of disposition, in terms of looks; I look just like my father.  But also in terms of outlook.  My father loved to travel.  He was, you know, in terms of being on the road, he liked to, you know, go.  And he would have stories about when he worked with the CCC [Civilian Conservation Corps] during the Depression, and the places he got to travel to working on different projects, and the places that he visited, and what he saw outside of the little town of Elba, Alabama.  So he had traveled a lot.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So this is, like, the Civilian Conservation Corps, part of Roosevelt's New Deal [1933-1936]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --where people with--when there were no jobs for people, they made--the government created-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --infrastructure jobs and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, he would tell stories about in Houston [Texas] where he helped--he worked, I think on the Houston ship channel, and he worked in, you know, in Louisiana, all across, going as far as New Mexico, I think.
Speaker 1: Now, this is after he got married or before?
Speaker 2: Well, I think this is after, you know.  This is after.  And so it--so in terms of having this idea that you have to go where the jobs are, I think, was instilled in me.  For example, when I graduated from college, I got a job offer in Saint Louis, Missouri.  And I graduated from a school in Huntsville, Alabama A & M University [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University], and my mother said, "Oh, that's so far."  You know.  "Saint Louis is so far away."  And, of course, my father said, "You have to go where the jobs are," and so, I did.  But that was the difference between my mother and my father.  My mother was more of a homebody and wanted to stay close; whereas my father would say go.  Opportunity, if opportunity knocks and if it's five hundred miles, six hundred miles, a thousand miles away, you should take that opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Can you give us their ages and where you fall in the mix?
Speaker 1: I have three brothers.  My oldest brother is 75 [born 1936], I think.  And my sister is next and my--she's, I think, 67 or 68 [born ca. 1942], and my--another brother [born ca. 1943] that's older than me; he's like three years older than me, and I have a younger brother [born ca. 1954] who's eight years younger than me.  So there're five of us; there's four boys and a girl.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did you want to name them or (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  My oldest brother is Joe, my sister is Betty, my brother after her is Jimmy, and I'm next after Jimmy, and then Leon is my youngest brother.
Story_ID: 1789
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I can remember my first day in--my first grade, the first day in first grade [at Elba Colored Elementary School, Elba, Alabama] and what it was like, and my teacher, and my favorite, I mean, she was my--she was my first teacher and so she was my favorite teacher, Miss Cox (ph.).  And I remember my sister [Betty Bullard] taking me by the hand and walking me to the school, 'cause we walked to school, and leaving me there.  And so, it was--it was a good experience, and so school was great.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were raised in Elba, Alabama, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Born [1946] and raised there, and you were describing earlier that the--something about the town in terms of no--that the black community had no paved streets, and no streetlights, and no sewage system.  What was the name of the black community?  Did it have a name?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was--the name of the community that I grew up in was called Mulberry Heights.  Mulberry Heights.  And the area had--we had our own elementary school and which went from the first through the six grade, and then the other school went from the sixth to the twelfth.  And both were segregated.  And our library was--the black library was at the school.  And so, when the school closed at 3:00 o'clock [P.M.], the library closed.  And so, the schools--I can remember it having books that had names in them, and they were secondhand books, second edition, one-year old; but, pretty much the same books, it's just they were one year older.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, what did your community [Mulberry Heights in Elba, Alabama] look like?  You described it somewhat, but what did your house look like that you grew up in, and what did the community look like, and what was some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, my community was a community where people--almost everybody I knew growing owned their own homes.  Nobody rented.  It was not until later that they built some public housing projects, and some of the people moved into those, somewhat elderly.  But most of the people that I knew owned their homes.  They were not mansions, but they were their homes.  And my street, Lee Street, the houses were, you know, my parents' [Nehemiah and Myrtle Brundidge Bullard] house was, was a brick house and we had our own rooms.  It was--my grandmother [Minnie], when they--urban renewal came and they moved all the black people from downtown, my grandmother moved next door and my father built, you know, a nice brick house next door to us.  And so, we had a, you know, a nice house.  Houses on our street was nice, even though it was not paved at the time, later it was paved; the streetlights came later; the sewer system came later; and so, there was a lot of upgrades that were made later.  And so, it was a safe area where you could ride your bicycle to school.  There--sidewalks came later.  So many amenities came later.  So even during the times when there were no amenities, it was still a relatively quiet and safe area, neighborhood where you didn't have to, you know, lock your doors.  You weren't afraid that somebody was going out and rob you or stick you up or whatever.  And so, it was a neighborhood where if kids were doing something that was out of line and a neighbor saw it, they would pull you to the side and in some cases scold or call your mother or your parents, and in some cases take a switch to you.  And that was okay because people, everybody knew everybody.  And so, it was a very close-knit community where people cared about each other.
Story_ID: 1790
Speaker 1: Okay.  So people as you described, it seems that people took pride in their property, had ownership.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  The mere fact that, as I said, it was people who owned property and owned their homes.  And so, it was something that was really instilled in them in terms of having pride.  And my father in terms of having a well-manicured lawn, you know, and when he showed us how to, you know, edge the lawns and trim the shrubs and keep everything really manicured, you know, that stayed with me, you know, over the years.  And I, you know, I learned the names of plants and I learned how to do, you know, the work in the gardens.  And my mother loved to garden--loved vegetable gardens.  And so, I would help do the vegetable gardens.  So it was--so having stuff that's fresh and, you know, we didn't know anything about org--you know, something grown organically.  But, you know, we didn't know how to fix a, you know, compost, and having bottles, you know, Coke bottles that you'd recycle.  And my parents' had a clothesline that you'd hang--you know, she had a washing machine but no dryer.  Dryers came later.  And they would hang, you know, wash the clothes in the washing machine and hang clothes out to dry in the sun.  And so, that was--and nobody would steal people's clothes off the lines or do anything like that.  It was pretty, pretty safe and secure.  And people--my father came home for lunch and I came home for lunch from school every day, and we ate lunch together.  We ate breakfast as a family together at the table.  So it was three meals a day.  It was breakfast, dinner and supper.  I can never remember my father eating a sandwich.  We always had full meals, and we always sat down.  And there was no, you know, eating standing up, you know, running around.  It was sit down and you--and we had a family meal.  And that--that was from the very beginning, you know, from elementary school all the way to high school.  You know, I came home for lunch in high school.  And I thought I was deprived because I wanted to eat in the cafeteria, not thinking that "hey, I had a real home cooked meal."  (laughter.)
Speaker 1: Now, this is something that a lot of people in the North don't realize, but in the South you got like breakfast, dinner and supper.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  It wasn't lunch.  There was no such thing as lunch.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Because it wasn't more of a shortcut meal or something, you know what I'm saying, to a meal than what our people are used to.  They're used to sitting down and eating (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes.  They didn't know how to eat, and a lot of the food that was prepared came out of our garden.  And it was fresh.  You know, not shot up with chemicals and all kinds of pesticides.  It was fresh, and it was, as I said, a lot of it was--it was organic.  You know, now that I think back, and it was very healthy and it was tasty.  You know, a real tomato that comes out of your garden that you know, it's just, you know, twenty feet from you.  That's where it was growing, not three thousand miles away.  And so, it was very healthy.  And my parents, you know, I think they really enjoyed making sure that we had good food, and healthy food, and that was the kind of, I guess, they saw that as their responsibility making sure that we would eat right.  And, of course, we had, you know, desserts; but having, you know, a lot of sweets that was not, you know, that was a treat.  And having sodas, that was a treat.  Of course, we had Kool-Aid, and tea, iced tea.  But water, I mean, water was the main, you know, drink for--iced water.  (laughter).  That was the drink at the table.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So.  Now, you were born in '46 [1946], and you're like, go to school around 1952 (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (unclear) I still had graduated from high school in '64 [1964]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I went to college in 1964.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're not going to speed you that fast (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh.  (laughter).
Story_ID: 1791
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: It was Elba Colored Elementary [School].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Because that was different from the Elba Elementary.  Other schools, you know, they had the same name except the black schools were "Colored."  And except in--when they built a new school, the schools--the colored came off and then it became Mulberry Heights Elementary [now Mulberry Elementary School].  And then Mulberry Heights High School [now Mulberry High School].  Even though it was still segregated when they built the new school for us, they built the school in the same location as the "Colored" school.
Speaker 1: When you started it was Elba Colored Elementary School.
Speaker 2: Yes (unclear).
Speaker 1: And did they build a new one while you were going to school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you had Mulberry Heights.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Mulberry Heights.  So I graduated from Mulberry Heights High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were these two separate facilities, the elementary and high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They were on the same property, but maybe a hundred feet apart.  You know, when you graduate from elementary school, you went to the high school which was just, you know, on the same campus, but it was just maybe a hundred feet away.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  School was a pleasure.  And I liked everything about my school, you know, it was an experience that was very nurturing.  All my teachers were black, but they were very nurturing and they basically had this--they could motivate you to do almost anything that you wanted to.  Even though we had less, they would take that miniscule resources and turn it into something that you would just, you know, want to do more.  You know, I loved homework, I loved doing projects, I loved sports also.  But in terms of having--not having adequate resources--and my parents [Nehemiah Bullard and Myrtle Brundidge Bullard] supplemented that, I mean, we'd all have--we had all kinds of books, you know, magazines.  We had all kinds of materials that my parents would make available.  And there were kids who didn't have as much, they'd come over to our house and we'd read and play all kinds of games with stuff that my parents would buy.  But in some cases the teachers also would buy, use their own money to supplement, and because the schools, you know, segregated schools got less of everything, but I think the teachers and the parents working together made sure that, even though we had less, we had something that, I think, that's intangible, and that's making sure that the kids understand that they can do--they can do more than just get by, that they can excel.  And that's, I think, was something that you can't, as I said, you can't measure that; that's an intangible that goes with the fact that the teachers cared, and the parents and the teachers worked together.
Speaker 1: What's your estimation of how many of students were in the school or did you know how many?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My school was small.  About three hundred.  About three hundred students.
Speaker 1: Is that elementary?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the high school would--did it draw from any other schools?
Speaker 2: No.  It was only the--school--the schools were city schools, and only the school that within the general area was where it got its students from.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the high school would be potentially the same size as the elementary school, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as it goes--before, but did students drop out before they got to high school or do they pretty much stay?
Speaker 2: Well, there were some slippage.  There was some dropout, of course.  And, but I do think that in looking at the success rate of kids moving from elementary to high school and on to college, most of the students did graduate from high school.  It was no fifty-fifty--fifty percent dropout rate like it is now.  No, it was--students moving through, and there was--it was not a lot of young people going to college.  Most of the students who graduated from high school, for example, the men.  There is either the working at the factory, there was Dorsey Trailers (ph.); or working--going into the military, which was a big chunk.  I tell you--I tell you, sixty percent of the guys who graduated went into the [United States] Army.  And then there was college.  And that number, the college number was small.  And largely a resource was the issue as opposed to, were not the young people had the ability.
Story_ID: 1792
Speaker 1: Now did you have favorite teachers--or who were some of the better teachers in the school or did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I had some very good teachers.  I had--my favorite teacher was Miss Terrell, T-E-R-R-E-L-L.  Sylvia Terrell, and she was my history teacher, and she taught history and government.  She was a very good teacher.  And my biology--my science teacher was Mr. Hammond (ph.), he was very good.  My math teacher Mr. Waters, he was a very teacher also, and he also was the basketball coach.  And so, my--one of my--my favorite teacher in elementary school was my first-grade teacher, Ms. Cox, and then my sixth-grade teacher--oh, God.  She was tough but she was--I can't think of her name, but she was tough but it was tough love.  Oh, God.  I can't think of her name right now, but anyway, she was the one that would always say that, "Make sure that you do more and give more than what's asked."  And so, if you ask the right, you know, and they'll say, and you shouldn't just, you know, try to write the minimum words; try to make sure you write a little more and put more in it than what's asked.  But I had some very good--very good teachers.  And I tell you, 90 percent of the teachers from elementary school to high school at my school were dedicated teachers.  These were teachers who came out of a rigid segregated system, and who understood it, but also who understood how you--how you maneuver through this system to finish high school and to go on to college or go on to become a successful person.  And so they would tell you things as to--Mr. Dawson, oh, yeah; my shop teacher.  You know, he was my shop teacher, and of course, he was always emphasizing, "Go on and get another degree.  Go on and get another degree."  He was--he ended up getting a Ph.D., and he was one of my favorite teachers that, even when he was teaching high school he was working on a master's degree.  And by time I graduated from high school, he was working on a Ph.D., and he got his Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he was--you know, he was always saying, "Don't just stop with a bachelor's.  Go on and get another degree.  Another degree."  But then, so the teachers at the school all had different, I guess, different areas but they all were, I really, I guess, concerned about making sure that the students would explore and move beyond their very rigid confines.  And I think to a large extent a lot of us did.
Story_ID: 1793
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what did you like to do the most in--when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, I liked riding by bicycle.  I liked running.  I liked playing sports.  I liked reading, and I liked writing.  You know, I was a very good writer in terms of essays and papers, and that kind--terms papers, that kind of thing.  I was very good at it.  I never thought I, you know, never dreamed I would be, you know, doing this forty years, fifty years later.  But--and my mother would encourage to write.  See, I was writing stories and give them to my mother [Myrtle Brundidge Bullard], and she would always encourage me.
Speaker 1: Now, what were you reading in those days in terms of fiction and literature and stuff?
Speaker 2: Well, I would read, you know, it was--I trying to think of some of--no, I can't even think of any of the books that I read (laughter) back then, but it was--my parents bought encyclopedias and then they would bring books that would come, you know, when you buy the encyclopedias, they would get you on a list where you would--they would send a book to you every month, and it would be a different kind of book.  And so, as long as you subscribed to it, the books keep coming.  And so, my mother would still pay the--I don't know how much it was--but, there were different books that would come, and I would read, you know, the different books.  I wouldn't read them all, but there were some that would grab my attention.  Some were, you know, adventure books, and travel books, and that kind of stuff.  Some were mystery, some were historical, you know.  Some of the classic books that we would later on read in college.  So--and the books--and my dad [Nehemiah Bullard] would make the bookshelves that the books would pile up in (laughter).  But and, of course, magazines.  We got all kinds of magazines.  Not just the "Jet" and the "Ebony," but, of course, "Jet" and "Ebony" was mainstays, but other kinds of magazines, like, "Life" magazine and "Look" magazine.  So there was all kinds of things that we would read and, of course, you know, I loved reading.  I loved looking at pictures.   And my parents, at one point, bought me a little cheap camera, and I like taking pictures.  So, you know, it was exploring
Story_ID: 1794
Speaker 1: Did your family discuss, you know, the topics in the news in those days because you--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes indeed.
Speaker 1: --were growing up during the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: -- Civil Rights struggle and the Cold War.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, indeed.  My dad [Nehemiah Bullard] was the political animal in terms of keeping up with everything.  And he read.  He would read the newspaper, the "Montgomery Advertiser."  That was the paper.  The local paper was the "Elba Clipper," which was nothing but gossip.  But the "Montgomery Advertiser" was the newspaper, and he would read it from front to back, and he would discuss stuff.  You know he would dissect, analyze, critique.  And in terms of the news, you know, the morning, you know, the A.M. news, and the 6:00 o'clock news, the 5:00 o'clock, and the 6:00 o'clock, and the 10:00 o'clock news.  He would--he was a news hound.  And he would actually, you know, he would analyze it as the television was going on.  He'd say, "No, I read this in the paper, and so and so and so."  So he would compare, and so, when the--the things that were going on during the time in terms of the Civil Rights Movement, in terms of what was happening internationally; it was not just what's happening here in terms of, like, you know, in the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s], what was going on over in Africa.  He kept up all of that, you know.
Speaker 1: (unclear).  You know, the Congo Crisis in the '60s [1960s] was in the news (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --were you all talking about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  And with, you know, with the assassination of [Prime Minister Patrice] Lumumba, with what's going on with Malcolm X in terms of his trial was back and forth; I mean, no, my father was very political.  And, of course, at the barbershop, you know, that's where, you know, the folks got into the real politics of what--what's the real deal.  What's really happening, and not what you see on TV, but what's really--which deals have been cut, who's, you know, doing what in terms of who's getting paid; that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 1795
Speaker 1: What was the conversation like, say, you growing up in Alabama, you're in southern Alabama as opposed to northern Alabama where [Rev.] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] is for the most part, in Montgomery [Alabama] and Birmingham [Alabama]; but what was the view of Dr. King by, you know, rural black men in Elba, [Alabama] you know, at a barbershop?  You know, what did they think he would do?  Did they agree with him or did they think he was, you know, off the hook, or they hoped he would win, but they couldn't do--or did they want to join him, or what was it?
Speaker 2: Well, my father, my father was one who was not a non-violent person.  He was not for non-violence.  And, of course, we had lots of guns in our house.  And my grandmother [Minnie], having to fend off white people trying to steal the land, she had a pistol underneath her apron.  She carried a pistol.  She was only about five-foot-three [5'3"], five-foot-two [5'2"], something like that.  But she was one that if anybody comes her property not invited, they gonna get shot at.  And so, my father, having come out of that, having to defend your property and whatever.  Anybody's coming on the property illegally or trying to take it, they're not going, you know, non-violent. So--my--but my parents [Nehemiah and Myrtle Brundidge Bullard] did--they revered Doctor King.  I mean, they saw him taking, you know, all kinds of chances and risks, and etcetera.  And so, at the time that the marches, the Montgomery Bus Boycott [1955], my sister [Betty Bullard] was in college at Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee Inst., Alabama].  My father had to take her up to Tuskegee, drive her up.  And during that time, there was all kinds of, you know--Elba is like ninety-two miles from Tuskegee and about eighty-six miles from Montgomery.  And so, we were not far from the heat of the throes.  My county is only about, you know, twenty-five percent black.  So we're not in the majority.  So a lot of the places that were having a lot of those, you know, some of the most stringent anti-black and anti-civil rights, they were where you had blacks who had had tremendous numbers.  And so, you know, we just--we--you know, 25 percent is not small, but we couldn't elect anybody to an office by us, a hundred percent of us coming together.  So we were not as much as a threat as in Selma or Birmingham or in Montgomery or wherever.  And so, but that's not to say that the racism was not as potent, but we didn't have this--it was not as violent.  And so, to a large extent, my parents, basically, were supportive and they were involved; they contributed their resources in terms of money, and they went to meetings and rallies, and that kind of thing.  And so, we didn't have, you know, we didn't have the violence like in Montgomery and in Selma as in Elba.
Speaker 1: Was there a movement while you were still in Elba for civil rights?  Were there sit-ins and that sort of thing or had that reached there--?
Speaker 2: In Elba, when I graduated from high school [Mulberry Heights High School, Elba, Alabama] in '64 [1964], as I say, I remember the Montgomery Bus Boycott, I remember the Freedom Rides.  When I went to college in '64 [1964] [at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama], there were still signs "Colored" in the waiting rooms from taking the Greyhound Bus from Elba to Troy, Alabama; to Montgomery, to Birmingham, to Huntsville.  Elba is on the bottom of the state.  Huntsville is where I went to school; it's on the top of the state.  And from--at '64 [1964], the signs were still up even though that was ten years after the Brown versus Board of Education.  Couple of years after that, by '65 [1965], '66 [1966], the signs had come down.  But the waiting rooms were still segregated.  Black people went to the "Colored" waiting rooms and whites still went to the "White" waiting room, even though you could have gone to either one.  And so, the mid-sixties [1960s] was still a period of time when you would--when we get to Troy.  And Troy, Alabama was only twenty-nine miles from Elba.  Troy State University was still segregated.  You couldn't go to--we couldn't go to Troy.  So I passed up Troy University, Auburn University, University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama], and all the white schools, and then had to travel three hundred miles north to Alabama A & M [University].  This is during a time when, you know, George Wallace stood in the University of Alabama, I think it was '64' (1964), '65' (1965), somewhere around in there.  My father, who said that, "You can go to college and you can go wherever you want to go, but you're going to Alabama A & M."  (laughter)  And so, both my brother and I, we were there.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  We have to pause here.
Story_ID: 1796
Speaker 1: All right.  So, well let's get to that.  We didn't take you through high school [Mulberry Heights High School, Elba, Alabama].  So we've got to go back to the high school.  But, well, what was high school like?  Did you have a favorite subject or were you considered like one of the better students in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a very good student.  And one of my favorite studies was history, in government.  And so, I was very good at, you know, looking at history and looking at how government policies worked.  And so, that's--that was--and certainly my teacher was good at, Ms. [Sylvia] Terrell, was very good, the regular teacher.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a black history course at all taught as such at the high school there?
Speaker 2: No.  There was no black history course taught.  But every class, whether it was the government class or whether it was the class, you know, in social studies, world history; black history was integrated throughout all of that.  I mean even science.  Even the science classes, you know, the biology classes.  We taught--we learned about blacks in science in the class.  And so, even though our books may have been one year old in terms of the second edition or they may have been used by some of the white students at the other--at the white school, our teachers supplemented that with other materials.  So we learned about black history.  We didn't have--of course, we couldn't have a black history class, you know.  It would not have been allowed.  But--
Speaker 1: To be clear, I mean, for those who are watching this, this is a black school but it's a state school, right?  (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's a--
Speaker 1: --monitored by some--(unclear)
Speaker 2: --monitored by the--
Speaker 1: --the white supervision --
Speaker 2: --yes, yes.  And so, so it's a matter of making--of integrating the materials into the regular classes so that you did learn about Africa and African culture, and African civilization where your learn about African Americans; not just Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver, but also learned about other, you know, African-American leaders all the way up to the time, you know, contemporary.  So there was no course, per se, but it was--there were materials that was integrated in through those classes so that we did learn about our history.  And so, that--and to me that was very good.  It was something that was supplemented, and to some extent it subterfuged, but it was a good subterfuge, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because have you ever seen the short story or seen it dramatized on TV, "The Boy who Painted Christ Black"--(laughter)
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --by John Henrik Clarke?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where he talks about the state superintendent comes in--and I really didn't realize it set up like that until I saw it, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --I mean, people just don't have a sense of that.
Speaker 2: No, it was very--it was rigid, and the superintendent, basically, he would make these spot visits to the school.  And sometimes we'd hear, you know, we--they'd get an advance notice, and so, everything had to be in order, you know, very rigid and strict.  But I think the fact that even though the most controlled conditions, the fact that he couldn't be there all the--the white superintendent couldn't be there, you know, five days a week, you know, six hours a day.  And so, and he couldn't determine and dictate everything that was being taught in the schools.  As long as you're doing, you know, you're teaching the curriculum that's standard for the program, but also you're supplementing that with materials that's going to help you survive; mentally, spiritually and otherwise.  Now, you can't get that.  You can't get that into a program to get funded by a white school board.  They're not going to fund anything like that so that means--it means that teachers themselves have to supplement; and in many cases get the--buy the materials out of their own pockets, supplement and do the research and gather materials on their own time to make sure that their students are well-rounded and are--and have the best education.  Not just rote memory, not just, you know, sending you through a cookie cutter program; but making sure that you understand, you know, the workings of racism.  And we were given, you know, we were taught about institutionalized racism.  We were taught about Jim Crow.  We were taught--that wasn't, you know, that wasn't in the books--and so--the standard textbooks--so but we were supplemented, even though we lived it.
Story_ID: 1797
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, you give a pretty vivid description of something that a lot of people--not every black community had that kind of level of instruction, even from the black teachers, you know, so you--I think you got a, I don't know if it was unique for Elba, [Alabama] but it's a situation that very few of our HistoryMakers [individuals interviewed as part of The HistoryMakers archives] have described where the--
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: --teachers actually, you know, took an initiative to really explain things from a black point of view to the students.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, I, you know--and I really think that--that getting that, you know, that level of nurturing and moving beyond just what's required and taking that extra step to critique.  And that was a time when the social analysts and black leaders were critiquing the system.  And so, it meant that you were taking a chance if you brought that into the classroom or you could get fired.  You could get fired.  But--and so, they did take those chances, and the information was accurate, factual; but again, it was political.  And I see--I can see that the way that the materials were taught and the individuals that brought it to me and my classmates, I can see--I can see me doing that now and getting the materials to students so that they can understand how the world works, even though they may be given a standardized model or a cookie cutter so they can read between the lines.  You take a newspaper and then you say, "Read the newspaper, but also gather this ability to critique it and read between the lines.  Read to critique it to say, 'what's not there, what's not said.'"  So I think that was--that was a very good training ground at my school for that and I think it probably would not--it would not work in an integrated situation.
Story_ID: 1798
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did the principal there in Elba set the tone?  Who was the principal of the high school [Mulberry Heights High School, Elba, Albama]?
Speaker 2: Mr. Patton, William Patton was the principal.  And I think a lot of people saw him as having to accommodate a lot because he was the principal, and he was the only principal that I ever knew who was the principal.  He was the principal for my first grade all the way to my high school, and he later retired.  But he had to accommodate a lot of pressure from the school board and superintendent to operate even though--and he was a war veteran.  I think, in the [United States] army I think he was a captain in a segregated army.  But the fact that him having to accommodate meant--didn't mean that he was an Uncle Tom [an individual who is overly submissive] or anything like that, but it meant that he had to maneuver a system in order to get resources for us, there were some things that he had to do--acquiesce to.  And so, he did not come down hard on the teachers who took it to the next level in terms of advocating for our civil rights, and advocating for equal treatment, and advocating for those kinds of things even though it was--the tone of it in the classroom was not the same as out there in the streets.  So it meant that we--there are certain things that we were not going to get at that school period because of the nature of the racism that operated within that geographic confines.  We were not going to get a band.  We were not going to get a football team; we'd get a basketball, no football team.  We were not going to get a swimming pool. We were not going to get a full-fledged library.  We were not going to get certain things because those are things that were reserved for white schools.  The white people got those things.  And even we paid taxes, my parents paid taxes, everybody who owned homes in the neighborhood paid taxes, there were certain things because of the way the system was set up and the way that the power structure was arranged, it was just a matter of time; and those things came later on, but during the period of time when I was in school from '52 [1952] to '64 [1964], it just was not going to happen.
Story_ID: 1799
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you were in school [Mulberry Heights High School, Elba, Alabama] in--how would you characterize yourself as a student?  Were you involved in, you know, student recreational activities or sports and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I played basketball and I ran track.  I was very active.  And so, yeah, I loved sports.  I wish we could have had a football team.  I think I probably would have been, you know, pretty good at it.  But I was--I played basketball and I ran track, and I was pretty good at it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my parents emphasized that this is sports and--but your main job at school is academics.  So academics came first and sports came later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would your sports team play the other black towns around there?  Is that what they would do?
Speaker 2: Right.  We played only black schools from different towns, you know, within I'd say a fifty, sixty, seventy miles radius.  And that's how it was.  We didn't' play any white teams.  I think the school--the high school, my high school was closed in, I think in '74 [1974], something, '70s [1970s] and made into a middle school, and eventually it was closed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then the blacks went to the white school.
Story_ID: 1800
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you were on the verge of, say, graduating from high school [Mulberry Heights High School, Atlanta, Georgia, graduated in 1964], what were your, I guess, aspirations?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I always wanted to be a college professor and--because I always wanted to be a teacher, and I wanted to teach at a university, and so, you know, this is--teaching, my sister [Betty Bullard] was a teacher.  She graduated, you know, and she was, you know, she got summers off and got a chance to travel.  So teaching was great.
Speaker 1: Was she already teaching--was she teaching on the college level by the time you--
Speaker 2: No.  She taught in elementary school.
Speaker 1: Did you have any role models or college instructors that she knew?
Speaker 2: Well, no.  No, other than Mr. Dawson [Bullard's woodshop teacher], who was working on his Ph.D.  He stated that "College professors, they do 'X', 'Y', and 'Z'.  They make--you know, they get a chance to travel.  They get their summers off and they do a lot," and that's what he was aspiring to doing.  So it was like, "Okay."  And so, by time I graduated, he had gotten his Ph.D., and then he left and went on to Alabama A & M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama].  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, it was like, you know, the fact is that I felt that I could be a good professor, and that I was good at, you know, teaching.  I thought I could be a great teacher in terms of writing, in terms of I read a lot.  So I could--I figured that it would for a great teacher.  So it was not that I knew any college professors.  I didn't know any before I went to college [at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were not.  There were no black college professors in my community.  But I had read about, you know, some of them.  You know,[W.E.B.] DuBois, for example.  That was one of my heroes.  And he seemed like a great person that could do a whole lot of things and be well-known and whatever.  And so, that was--that was kind of like what got me, you know, hooked into not just getting a bachelor's degree, but also going on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I'm thinking--now, did you graduate with any honors or anything?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In high school I was salutatorian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had the best--the second best GPA and whatever rate number two.
Story_ID: 1801
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you knew you were going to Alabama A & M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that.  This is just about three hundred miles north of you?
Speaker 2: It's about three hundred miles north--
Speaker 1: In Huntsville [Alabama] (unclear)
Speaker 2: --in Huntsville.  And I--my brother [James "Jimmy" Bullard] was there.  He graduated two years before I did, so he was already there.  And so, my father [Nehemiah Bullard] said, "Okay.  Alabama A & M is it."  And so he had, you know, two of--the two of us were in school together.  And so, I majored in history and government and minored in sociology.  And, you know, those four years were very good, you know.  Very good experience, and, you know, I liked Alabama A & M.
Speaker 1: What was the leadership at Alabama A & M?  Who were the leaders?
Speaker 2: President Morrison.  I don't know his first name.
Speaker 1: Is it Richard Morrison?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Richard Morrison.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was the president throughout the four years that I was.  Was very strict.  Nice campus.  It was just so it seemed like it was far away.  My first choice was Florida A & M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], which is like ninety miles south.  But my dad said, "Oh, out-of-state fees, it was going to be a lot."  And so he said, "No."  I never thought about going to the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] or Auburn [University, Auburn, Alabama], none of those schools.  I never thought about them.  Never even crossed my mind.
Speaker 1: Now, University--now, you started in sixty--
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: --four?  Now this is the same year that--isn't that the year that [Alabama Governor George] Wallace stood in the doorway of the University of Alabama and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Vivian Malone.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And James--
Speaker 2: James--
Speaker 1: --Meredith [sic, James Hood, Malone and Hood tried to enroll at the University of Alabama, but the governor stood in the doorway to block their entry on June 11, 1963].
Speaker 2: No.  James Meredith was--
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: --at Ole Miss [The University of Mississippi, University, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Ole Miss, right.  Right, right.  Okay.  So Vivian Malone and (unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Vivian Malone was in Ala--because she transferred from Alabama A & M to go to the University of Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And see, all that was in my father's mind in terms of whatever he said, "No, we will pay for you to go to Alabama A & M."  My father hated the University of Alabama.  He hated Auburn.  You know, when they always had those football games and whatever, they would always root--
Speaker 1: They would always riot?
Speaker 2: --yeah.  They would always root.  You know, they would go to the barbershop--black people would root for the other team, no matter who they were.  They wanted to see Alabama get whipped.
Speaker 1: I think--
Speaker 2: See, Alabama had this thing where they would pay for black people to go to school out of the state.  They would pay for you.  If you wanted to go to graduate school, they would pay for it to keep you from going to the University of Alabama.  And so, my father instilled--you know, his thing was, you know, why are they so adamant about not allowing black people to go to these schools.  And so, his thing was, you know, (unclear), what's the point.  And his thing was, you know, go to Alabama A & M where they want you, and if you want to go somewhere else, go somewhere else and get an advanced degree, and if you want to go on, go wherever.  But his thing was no.
Speaker 1: You know, I think a lot of people felt, I mean, especially the Alabama football team and the Kentucky [Kentucky Wildcats, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky] basketball team.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Those two were both seen as icons of segregation--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and oppression on the sports scene--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and people were watching.  Adolph Rupp [coach of American college basketball, namely the University of Kentucky] and Bear Bryant [coach of American college football, namely the University of Alabama]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and root against them in every city in US [United States].
Speaker 2: Every city.  Every city.
Speaker 1: I don't know anybody in any city where they weren't (unclear)
Speaker 2: No.  And again, that was symbolism was not lost on the fact that, as I said before, I'm traveling three hundred miles north passing four to five white schools, where I could have actually--I could have actually, you know, twenty-nine miles, because you know, Troy State [University, Montgomery, Alabama] was twenty-nine miles.  That's very close.  It's close but it's worlds apart.  And so, my parents said, well, we'll pay.  And they paid for my sister--my sister [Betty Bullard], as I said, she went to Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee Inst., Alabama].
Speaker 1: So the black schools in Alabama just kind of go over with what you--you know, if you didn't go to Alabama A & M, you could have gone to Alabama State [University]--
Speaker 2: Alabama State's in Montgomery.
Speaker 1: --in Montgomery (unclear)--
Speaker 2: And then there's Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Tuskegee.
Speaker 2: That's the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So I had a choice, I had three.  And so, I could have picked, you know, either one of those three, as long as it was Alabama A & M.  (laughter).  My dad said.  That's what he said.  (laughter).  As I said, and it wasn't like no--it wasn't no scholarships that I knew of.  There wasn't any financial aid.  You know, as I said, financial aid; we didn't know anything about no financial aid; no loans and that, and that--grants and that kind of thing.  It was only years later that we found out about that.  So my parents paid.
Story_ID: 1802
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was it like for you there [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama]?  Did you have a good education there and a good experience?
Speaker 2: I had some very good teachers.  I had some very good teachers who always instilled in students, and it sunk in to me, is that one degree is not enough if you were black.  One degree is not enough.  You need to have, you know, at least a second degree behind your name.  It's not enough just to be equal.  I mean, these are teachers telling us this.  Why would you want to be equal because as long as you're black in this country, if you're equal and you have the equal credentials with a white person, you're going to come in second.  And they call that "the white boy's edge."  And so, my teachers were very upfront, and I had some white teachers.  I had a lot of white teachers at Alabama A & M and they were very good.  My history teacher was a white guy and was very good.  And but again, the teachers that we had, they seemed to be cut from the same cloth, instill in you, "You need to do this little extra.  You need to get little, you know, you need to have, you know, a little more.  You need to have something that sets you apart."  And I think that's, you know, that was the kind of education that I got at Alabama A & M.  And so, that's where I think I always knew that I was going to graduate school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was just a matter of time.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a mentor at Alabama A & M?  Anyone that really stands out as your favorite teacher or mentor?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  Mr. Moburg (ph.) was my--one of my history teachers.
Speaker 1: So did you major in history or sociology?
Speaker 2: It was history and government.  And my minor was sociology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My minor was sociology.  I majored in history because I was very good at history.  And I liked government.  I like, you know, the politics of stuff.  So it was history and government.  History and government was together.
Speaker 1: Was it more contemporary history or ancient history or what?
Speaker 2: No.  It was contemporary.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Contemporary history.  Yeah.  And government was more of looking how governments operate, the political structure.  That kind of thing.  And my minor was sociology.  And actually I was better at my minor.  I was, you know, I learned later on that--because I made all "A's" in my minor.  I graduated with honors.
Story_ID: 1803
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this though.  You were there in '65 [1965], and I know that '65 [1965] was, I guess, the biggest year for SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] organizing in Alabama.  I know they were organizing in Lowndes County [Alabama].  I don't what the proximity that is to Alabama A & M but--
Speaker 2: No, that's north--Alabama A & M (unclear) is almost as far as you can go, next stop Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Lowndes County is about 150 miles south.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: That's in the Black Belt.
Speaker 1: Did any--were there any students volunteering for SNCC or going to?
Speaker 2: I think there were some students from Birmingham [Alabama] that may have joined--may have gone.  There were some students that joined the Freedom Rides.  That was during that same time, between '64 [1964] and '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Was there any recruitment or pressure on students to participate in those activities when you were--
Speaker 2: No, no, there was not.  See, Huntsville--I think we were--Huntsville was somewhat insular or insulated from a lot of the student organizing because we were in Huntsville, and Huntsville was much more progressive.  This is when we had NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], and you had Redstone Arsenal [Huntsville, Alabama], and we were, in Huntsville we was--that whole area is very white.  And here we got this black school in the middle of North Alabama, which is--which you don't have a lot of, you know, a whole lot of black people.  And so, like in Montgomery [Alabama] you got--you got Alabama State [University], which is just thirty miles from Selma [Alabama].  And in--just thirty miles to the east of Montgomery you have Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee Inst., Alabama].  So Tuskegee and Alabama State are very close together, thirty miles apart.  So if you take U.S. 80 from Tuskegee, you can all the way across U.S. 80 to Selma.  Until--there was a lot of organizing in that whole corridor but if you got send students organizers all the way up 150 miles north to Huntsville; and of course, Birmingham [Alabama] is ninety miles, just ninety miles north of Montgomery.  And Birmingham is ninety miles from Huntsville.  So we're almost like 180 miles from the thick of things in Montgomery, and ninety miles--so we were kind of isolated.
Story_ID: 1804
Speaker 1: I was wondering if any of the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] activists spoke on campus because that--now '65 [1965] was when they had the march from Selma, Montgomery, and the Proclamation by Willie--
Speaker 2: Black Power?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You know.  I can't think of his last name; Willie--
Speaker 2: Carmichael.
Speaker 1: Not Carmichael, but it was Willie Ricks--
Speaker 2: Ricks.  Right.
Speaker 1: --who actually did it, I mean, first.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But it's Stokes, Stokely [Carmichael] built on.  But that's--so did any of those guy, you know, those activists, actually spoke on campus?
Speaker 2: I don't remember--I don't remember any of them coming to Alabama A & M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama].  I do recall--because we'd go to Birmingham and there was all kinds stuff we could do in Birmingham.  But Huntsville, as I say, Huntsville was not a hotbed for any of that stuff, except for--what's his name? [Dr.] John Cashin [founder of the National Democratic Party of Alabama, helped elect black leaders in Alabama, 1929-2011] was in Huntsville, he was a dentist in Huntsville, and he probably was the most well-known activist leader of civil rights in--during that period.  And of course, he was--he was a black dentist.  And fiery and whatever.  And so, when he would organize stuff we would go.  But there was no mass, you know, student (laughter)--not in Huntsville.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Poor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not like Birmingham [Alabama] and Montgomery [Alabama].
Speaker 1: So how did the students react to Black Power?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the students--the students on the campus were split.  They split like most campuses, you know. [Rev. Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was the icon and, of course, there were lots of students who were from Birmingham and from--the bulk of the students came out of Birmingham and, of course, other states.  But Birmingham had--tended to have the majority since Birmingham was the biggest city and ninety miles from Huntsville.  And so, there was another, you know, a group that basically endorsed and embraced, you know, the SNCC folks and the Black Power folks.  And, of course, Malcolm [X] was a big, you know, was big, you know.  You read the autobiography of Malcolm X--that was a--and (laughter) and you read, you know, all kinds of, you know, radical literature.
Speaker 1: Now did you read the autobiography in college?
Speaker 2: Let me think when I did read it.  I'm not sure if I read it when I was in Alabama A & M--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) in school--
Speaker 2: I think I read it when I was in regular school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.  He was killed in '65 [1965]--
Speaker 2: No, I read it when I was here in '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Now, I'm not sure if it was published before he was shot or not [published after Malcolm X's death in 1965].  I don't--
Speaker 2: I think it was '65 [1965] when it was--when it came out.
Speaker 1: Yeah, published.  I think it really started catching--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --steam later.
Speaker 2: You know, when King was killed in '64 [1964]--
Speaker 1: '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: '68 [1968]. I mean, April of '68 [1968], we were--I was getting ready to graduate in May.  I don't remember King coming to our [Alabama A&M University, Huntsville, Alabama] campus.  So a lot of the on-the-ground work that a lot of the students did I think it was more, "let's go down to--let's go to Birmingham," because we did it, you know, we would go down to Birmingham and do stuff as opposed to doing it in Huntsville.
Speaker 1: All right.  Let's pause here a second.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 1805
Speaker 1: All right.  Let me ask you about [Rev.] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]'s assassination and what happened on the campus [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama] on April 4, 1968?
Speaker 2: Oh, when we heard the news and, you know, it was very traumatic.  And students just--
Speaker 1: Do you remember where you were when you heard it?
Speaker 2: I think I was in the student center.  And then, you know, it got circulated around, and the next you know, we watched the television, and people started congregating.  Next thing you know, you know, thousands of people are out on the quad and--from then, you know, it was just sporadic.  People came together and we had a big march, demonstration.  And then we, you know, marched off the campus and then marched down Meridian [Street], which is the main thoroughfare.  And all the cars that would be--usually be on that street had to stop. And then the police came.  It was very orderly.  And then there was a motorcycle escort--that we marched down, and then we came back up on the campus.  I think it was a matter of people, you know, talking and venting.  But there were no arrests or nobody burned anything down or anything like that.  But people were just really hurt.  And so, it was a matter of, you know, what, you know, what's next?  What's next?  And as I said, that was in April and I was graduating in May [1968].
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Really toward the end of my college--
Speaker 1: So the expression of discontent, public discontent rather than anything else.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It was a sense of more of solidarity (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Solidarity, discontentment, disappointment.  Just anger.  Just frustration, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you think that people just felt a need to do something?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think that was it.  I think that was it.  And again, it was a matter of how can you--in an outburst, how can you show your emotions and at the same time, you know, want to honor the fact that this is a great man.  And so, you just, I mean, people said that what we need to show, you know, solidarity.  And what they did--what we did we just left the campus and marched down the main highway.  And I figured--anyway, I don't even recall where we went.  But wherever we marched to, we marched there and people, you know, vented and made speeches, and then we--we marched back up to the campus.  And I think there were some, you know, speeches and talking and eventually people dispersed.
Speaker 1: Now, where you involved in campus organizations at all when you were in college?
Speaker 2: No.  I was not active. No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you join a fraternity or anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay. (unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Remember this is--'64 [1964] to '68 [1968] was an era in my life where fraternities were not that--seen as not that great.  It was very bougie [bourgeois].  And so, the--I didn't see myself as a joiner in that sense.  It was also during the height--you know, Vietnam [War].  And so, the--that was a time when I, you know, it just didn't appeal to me during the journey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 1806
Speaker 1: Now, so on the verge of graduation [May 1968], your goal was still to become a professor, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, did you graduate with any honors at Alabama A & M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I graduated Cum Laude.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  With honors.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, what was your plan?  What was your goal?
Speaker 2: Well, my goal was to get a job and to teach for--teach high school for a couple years and then go back to college.  And so, I graduated in May, and I got a job offer in Saint Louis [Missouri], and I went to Saint Louis in August to start my new job as a high school history teacher.
Speaker 1: So did you teach in Saint Louis?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I taught from August until December.
Speaker 1: Where did you teach at in Saint Louis?
Speaker 2: Beaumont High School [Saint Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Beaumont.
Speaker 2: On Natural Bridge [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I got drafted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you foresee the draft as a, you know (laughter)--that was a specter that hung over a lot of people, being drafted.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was always an option--I mean always something that was--could happen.  And I just figured I would take my chances, you know.  And, as I said, it was--you know, I got a job as a high school and I was teaching there and I taught from August until December, and I got drafted in December.
Speaker 1: That's December of 1969?
Speaker 2: '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: '68 [1968]?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  '68 [1968].  Yeah.  And so, I was in--and so, I got drafted in by the [United States] Army, and I went back--I left Saint Louis and reported to Montgomery [Alabama] for the Induction Center.  And this was '68 [1968].  December of '68 [1968].  And there were nobody hardly joining--volunteering for the [United States] Marine Corps because of the--it was hot and heavy.  Tet Offensive [campaign during Vietnam War, 1968] it was, I think was in November of somewhere in '68.  And so, Marine Corps was drafting, and so, I was at the Induction Center in Montgomery, and the way I got drafted into the Marine Corps. was "eenie, meenie, miney, moe."  I was "moe."  And so, I didn't volunteer for the Marine Corps.  I thought I was going to the Army.  But as it turns out, I ended up going into the Marine Corps because of, as I say, "eenie, meenie, miney, moe," and I was "moe".
Story_ID: 1807
Speaker 1: Now, this is--so did you go to Vietnam.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't go to Vietnam.  But almost everybody that was--that was selected, you know, "eenie, meenie, miney, moe," in the case were when we reported to Montgomery [Alabama, location of the Induction Center], almost everybody who was "moe" in my unit was black.  So when I left Montgomery and went to Parris Island [Marine Corps Recruit Depot, South Carolina], my whole unit was black.  This was 1968.  Now, it wasn't 1948.
Speaker 1: This whole unit was black?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yes.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: So what is your--when you look back this as a doctor of sociology--
Speaker 2: I can compute the numbers and the probability of that happening randomly and let you know that that would not happen through random decision.  It was a matter of the fact that the person selecting who was going to the Marine Corps, it was a matter of someone deciding "you should go to the Marine Corps" because the Marine Corp was the part of the military that was sent to the frontline and was getting chewed up and chopped up in '68 [1968].  And so, and they were not getting any volunteers.  They couldn't meet their quota, and so, this is a way of doing it.  And what are you going to say, "I'm not going to the Marine Corps."  I'm not going?  My father [Nehemiah Bullard] always said, you know, "Go.  Do your time."  And I had no inkling of going to Canada, so my thing was, "I'm going in the Marine Corps."  So I spent two years in the Marine Corps.
Speaker 1: Now some people did run to Canada--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) and do other things; hide or whatever.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of them.
Speaker 1: Some went to jail, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, some people went to jail.
Speaker 1: And in those days, your analysis of it wasn't that you--that was something that you wouldn't want to do?
Speaker 2: No.  No. I was going.  If it was the [United States] Army, I was going to report.  And if it was the [United States] Marine Corps, I was going to report.  I was going to do my two years; if I was ordered to go to Vietnam, I was going.  But as it turns out, I did my basic training in Parris Island, South Carolina; then I went to Camp Lejeune [North Carolina] for my advanced infantry training.  Now, I had graduated from college [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University](laughter), but I was put in infantry in the Marine Corps, yeah.
Speaker 1: (unclear)(simultaneous) So you didn't have any R.O.T.C. [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] in college--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or anything?
Speaker 2: No.  I wanted to do my two years.  I didn't want no R.O.T.C.  I didn't want no four years--I just wanted to do my two years.  As it turns out, I did the two and walked out not having to go to Vietnam.  But and so, I did my two years mostly in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: What were your duties there basically in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Well, I was at the Marine Corps, MAC-5, Marine Air Control Squadron Five, where we had helicopters and we controlled flights--helicopters.  And basically, I was at an air control station and it was basically communications; working with radios and telecommunication.  I did that for the duration.  I stayed in New River--New River, North Carolina, at--at the Marine Air Control Station Five.  And actually, I got a three-month early--what do they call early out?  I got out early because I had--I went back to college.  I was going back to graduate school.  I came here at Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia] for my masters [degree], and so I got three months of early out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they were giving people--if you're going back to college, they would give you--they would reduce your stay by three months.  And, of course, I had an honorable discharge.
Story_ID: 1808
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you basically are back out again in 1970?
Speaker 2: Yep.  Back in 1970, and that's when I enrolled here at Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  I got a scholarship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So what was your major to be?
Speaker 2: Atlanta University was my--was my first choice for graduate school because they offered African American studies, concentration in sociology; and this was the place where W.E.B. Du Bois started a sociology department here, and he did most of his writings and research here.  And so, that's why I wanted to come here, and I got a scholarship.  I got a full Ford Foundation Scholarship to attend here, and I had my G.I. Bill.  And so, it was--this was a good place.  And so, my major was sociology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in Atlanta you--in 1970 was--you had like Vincent Harding [African American historian], you had Mack Jones [political scientist at Atlanta University]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had some top people.  We had top people.  And everybody, there were like twenty-seven--seventeen, eighteen, nineteen people in my cohort coming in for a masters [degrees].  All of us finished our masters and all us went on and got Ph.D.s.  The idea was--because it was, you could only get a master's in sociology here.  It didn't have a Ph.D.  We still don't have a Ph.D., but everybody who got that masters went on to get a Ph.D.  By time I got to Iowa [State University, Ames, Iowa], the program was easy.
Speaker 1: Well, who are some of the people here that you met?  I mean, I named a couple of them, but who is here and what do they mean to you at the time?  But did you know they were here when you enrolled?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I knew.  I knew a lot about this school.  My uncle  who graduated from college, my dad's brother; he lives in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, he would always talk about Atlanta University.  And "Come visit once.  You go over there."  And he would tell me about some of the people who were--who were the professors over here, who were well known and very prolific.  And, of course, I read, you know, because my--and my undergrad minor was sociology and I was--you know, I discovered that I was very good at sociology; as a matter of fact, better at sociology than I was at history, and I learned that later.  I decided that I wanted to do sociology, and I want to emphasize to deal with African Americans, deal with black people.  And the Ford Foundation evidently had given the department at the University monies to bring in students to work on--to work in various disciplines to do social sciences, political science, sociology, economics, etcetera.  And so, that's--I got one of those scholarships, those scholarships.  And that to me was the best of--best of both worlds to do what you want to do and have a fellowship to do it.  (laughter)
Story_ID: 1809
Speaker 1: So well, I know, just off the top, Institute of Black World was here; the ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: ITC, yeah.
Speaker 1: You had like, "The King Center for Non-Violent Social Change" was just starting--
Speaker 2: Just starting.
Speaker 1: --as a program more than just a--like a museum.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, it was actually a program and (unclear)
Speaker 2: No, there was a lot.  There was a lot that drew--that drew me to Atlanta.  And the folks up at ITC, in terms of the black theology--we would have lunch at ITC, and the students who were up and coming ministers, they would give a sermon--they have good food--Institute of Black World, they'd have all kinds of activities and events.   And so, there was a lot of--there was a lot of--the sociology department, the political science department; we took courses from various folks across, you know, across the programs, you know, the political science--Mack Jones, William Boone [political science professors at Clark-Atlanta University]--what's his name?  He's retired--Robert "Bob" Holmes [Director of Southern Center for Studies in Public Policy and political science professor at Clark Atlanta University].  All, I mean, these are all people that became my colleagues later (laughter), but they were here.  And so, it was a--the environment was a very academic environment; was very nurturing.  And it was--and it really brought out a lot of the black experience.  And, of course, Hubert Ross [linguistic anthropologist] was anthropology, and his work was African--was Africa.  And, of course, he would bring us all of the--all of the, you know, the artifacts and the cultural and historical, and talk about, you know, these ancient, you know, civilizations, and he'd bring it all the way up to now.  And so, we got a dose of the political science, the sociology, and the anthropology all wrapped up.  And then, you know, we had colleagues who were also in social work, who dealt with the human side, with families.  And that was Afrocentric also.  So it was a--so the Afrocentric infusion was everywhere.  And again  this was '70 [1970] to '72 [1972] that I was here.  So it was--it was a good foundation.
Speaker 1: I remember the newsletter of the Institute of the Black World, that was a really powerful piece, and everybody read it.  It was really serious about something.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  That was serious--that was some serious analysis and a serious critique about what's going on.
Speaker 1: Now, was Howard Dodson [African American historian] here when you were?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I thought he was (unclear)--Calvin Morris [Minister, historian and human rights advocate, interviewed by The HistoryMakers in 2003]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now we had some top people, you know, here for a while and it attracted a lot of the scholars who in some cases who had cut their teeth at the white universities and were now coming, you know, converging.  I don't if it was--they decided to do that or just, you know, the meeting of the "moon and the stars," or whatever.  And they all were here at some parts of the campus.  And there were all kinds of forums that you could go to--things on campus that were very enriching.  You know all these people that you--I mean, you see these people that you read about; somebody's in "Essence" magazine, not "Essence--"Ebony" magazine or somebody's, you know is--been written, you know, written up in some of the black newspapers and you read about them.
Speaker 1: But in those days there's like a "Black World"--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: "Black Books Bulletin," "The Black Scholar."
Speaker 2: "Black Scholar."  Yeah, we had all of that.  So it was--so this place was, you know, humming with that stuff.  And you got a chance to interact with it, so.  So Atlanta University was a good experience for me.  You know, I have no--
Story_ID: 1810
Speaker 1: Did you have any particular teachers that were, like, mentors to you or you were particularly close to [at Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia, for his graduate studies]?
Speaker 2: Well, John Reed was one of my good professors.  Hubert Ross was probably my favorite because he was very entertaining, and he had stories--and he had traveled over the world.  I think he may have gone to every country in Africa.  And his worldview critique was very good.  And so, he was one of my favorite teachers, even though he was anthropology.  Anthropology's--his Afrocentric analysis was to me was very useful.
Speaker 1: Now, you're telling me about a person I didn't know that much about, Hubert Ross.  So--
Speaker 2: He was anthropology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You're going to send me to "Google" tonight to figure out, you know? (laughter)
Speaker 2: (unclear)
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did he--
Speaker 2: Mack Jones was good.  He was one of my--yeah, he was political scientist (unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Mack Jones, you remember, yeah (unclear)(simultaneous)  Yeah, Mack Jones was very well-known, you know.  And, of course, Vincent Harding [African American historian]--(unclear)
Speaker 2: Yeah, Vincent Harding.  I didn't have any classes from Harding, but I knew him and I met him, and we were in--up into a lot of elections, and meetings and forums, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was John Reed the only sociology professor that--
Speaker 2: He was the chair of the department.
Speaker 1: Chair, okay.
Speaker 2: And, anthropology and sociology was together, if I'm not mistaken.  So--see who else.  I'm trying t think of some of my other professors.  God, 1970.  Whew, that's a lot.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was the--was it--Mattiwilda Dobbs' [African American soprano] sister who--John Wesley Dobbs' [civic rights activist in first half of Twentieth Century in Atlanta, Georgia]  daughter was the anthropologist  I think she was at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or Clark [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or one of these; she was around here somewhere.  She was coming back from Africa with things, too.  So I don't--I can't think of her name right now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, but I know she was an anthropologist, too; though I don't think she was trained in anthropology.  She was active as one.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so.  So this is a rich environment (unclear).
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: I remember being here in '74 [1974] for Walter Rodney [Guyanese historian and political activist].  We drove all the way down from Ohio for it, so.  Who was here when you came through that stands out?
Speaker 2: Goodness.  You know, I can't even--I never--I'm trying to think.  We got lots of people coming through.  It was almost like commonplace.  You know, Atlanta was a--almost like a stop.  You know, it's like a "must-stop" kind of thing.  Especially with the airlines, as the airlines, you know, do over the years--Delta [Air Lines] became more and more, I guess, the hub, and you could just fly and come in, they'd come in, pass through.
Speaker 1: Now, I think Lerone Bennett [African American executive editor for "Ebony Magazine"] and Hoyt Fuller [journalist, editor and educator] had roots in Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm trying think who else.  (pause)
Speaker 1: You know, they had roots at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I think the fact that the AU Center, Atlanta University Center [consortium of Clark College, Atlanta University, Spelman College and Morehouse College], because the way it functioned during that period of time, we would get people coming through and we wouldn't know if they were coming here as a Morehouse event, or Atlanta University event or whomever; it was just the event and it would track--it would attract the students from the various programs.  And I think that was very good.  It was very good that Atlanta University had, I guess, the longest history of connections, and a lot connections with Africa; going back, you know, all the way back with [W.E.B.] Du Bois.   I think Morehouse and Spelman had more resources--had resources that they could bring people in and pay them and have events sponsored there.  But Atlanta University had the name.  They had the horses that you could, you know, bring people in, and the name recognition, you know, during that period of time.
Story_ID: 1811
Speaker 1: Do you think really there's a legacy, I mean, like a tangible kind of legacy that [W.E.B.] Du Bois left behind with people he trained [at Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I think so.  I think so.  I think if you look at the people he left behind, and also the philosophy and the, I guess, the work ethic of what you should do as a sociologist--I'm just speaking as a sociologist--what you as a sociologist should do, and what you as a black sociologist, what you should do.  Now, for those black sociologists who came through Atlanta University, they are very distinct.  You know, you look at some of--you look at them and you see the kind of work that they do with a lot of emphasis on race; on looking at racial oppression; looking at--looking at institutionalized barriers; and looking at, you know, looking at, not just you, as but looking at Africa and the connection.  I mean, there's--I mean, there's a stamp that I think Dubois put on this school and some of the people that he trained and the people that they trained that you can almost say, "Okay.  Atlanta University."  And so, it's kind of like the legacy has shaped generations of black sociologists who don't stray from a lot of the work that he laid out; whether it's the scholarship, whether it's the political analysis, and also the activism.  I know that--I know for me that's where I get 99.9 percent of my inspiration in terms of what drives me to do, to write, to publish, to try to impact public policy, try to, you know, get more--recruit more students into the area to carry on this legacy, and the activism.  You know, you can be an activist scholar, you can get tenure, you can get more, you can generate new knowledge and impact whatever, as opposed to just theory.  Not to knock theory, but, say, it's more than that.  And that's Du Bois.
Story_ID: 1812
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in '72 [1972] when you graduate with your master's degree in sociology you go to Iowa [State University, Ames, Iowa].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, now, how does that come about?  Iowa?  You go from the natural path to Des Moines?  So--
Speaker 2: (laughter)  Well, there's a story.  My sister [Betty Bullard] and her--my sister was in Iowa, her husband was in the military.  He was in the [United States] Army, and he was stationed in the De Moines, Iowa.  And so, my sister--I had graduated from--I got my masters, and so, she said that, "Bob, why don't you come out to Iowa and they have some great schools."  And so, I went to Iowa.  I hadn't, you know, ever gone to Iowa.  I knew where--I knew was a state but I didn't know where it was.  You know, I said--she said, "Iowa."  I said, "Iowa, where's that."  I said, "That's where they grow potatoes, right?"  She said, "No, that's Idaho," said, "They grow corn."  (laughter).  So I went to Iowa and--
Speaker 1: Now, just for the sake of Iowa, and we got you going there in '71 [1971] instead of '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's right, '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Did you go there in '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: It was '71 [1971], see, because I hadn't finished.  I was--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --I needed to--I was writing--I was working on my thesis.  Yeah, that's right, it was '71 [1971] because I went there before I finished.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so I had to right my thesis and finish my thesis.  And I graduated in '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Now was your thesis on urban planning or--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 2: No. My thesis was on looking at looking at students--student involvement.  My thesis at Iowa State was on community economic development and urban planning.  Because I got a job at--when I went there I got a job at the City [Des Moines, Iowa], and I worked at the City for a while, and decided--I got accepted to school, and so--to Iowa State, and so, I was able to work part time at City Urban Planner and go to school.  And so, at the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you got that job before you finished your masters [degree]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and then finished the masters and went back to Iowa.
Speaker 2: Yes, and finished up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So I--the fact that--the fact is that I was--finished my masters and I decided it's, you know, it's time to get a Ph.D.   So my sister, "Say, come on, come on out," and so, I got--actually I got a job at the City, and I worked there, I forgot how long, but it wasn't long before I got accepted into Iowa State.  And so, I was able to work, you know, work--still work at the City.  So I think it was City Planning; Community Development and City Planning, and go to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So what--was urban planning a part of what you wanted to do or focus on?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was sociology, even though Iowa is ruled or Iowa State is ruled, my major professor was an urban sociologist.  My--what is it about Richards?  [Robert] "Bob" Richards.  Yeah.  He's an urban sociologist that was in Iowa.  And so, my emphasis was looking at urban, and so, I was able to shape an urban sociology emphasis at Iowa State.  And so, was able to take a number of urban planning courses and urban sociology courses, and of course, my job, my part-time job was at the City, City Urban Planning Department.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you also worked as an administrative assistant to the Office of Minority Affairs at Iowa State.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: Yes.  I worked in the office, you know, I had lots of jobs.  My thing was, I'm busy.  And so, there was the time when we worked to get more students, minority students recruited, and so, I worked in that office.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We have to pause here.
Story_ID: 1813
Speaker 1: Working on your Ph.D., and you're working at the--in the Office of Minority Affairs for Iowa State University [Ames, Iowa], and you got a lot of jobs going, you said [in the early 1970s].
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: And you finished your degree.  So, what was your dissertation?  Give us the gist of your dissertation?  What was it?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My dissertation was actually taken out the data that I gathered while on my job with the city of Des Moines [Iowa].  It was in community development program, and we looked at neighborhoods that--planning and community development and outreach, etcetera.  And so, it was mostly looking at strategies for trying to impact change in low-income communities in Des Moines.  And so, it was--it was basically a dissertation looking at how a government program can be successful in improving the lives of the residents moving from a model cities program to community development to an economic development program.  And I looked, I think it was four or five neighborhoods in Des Moines.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did the old model cities [Model Cities Program, 1966-1974, a federally-funded project to improve urban development as part of the War on Poverty] target area fair in Des Moines?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the model city area in Des Moines was, believe it or not it was not--relatively speaking it was not that bad.  It was the worst part of the city in terms of housing and poverty, etcetera; but relatively speaking, because De Moines had a small black population, and it had--so most of the people who were in the model city area that were poor were not black; they were mostly white.  And so, working with that understanding, as they expanded the model cities from one neighborhood to a dozen or so neighborhoods, that's when you started to see how poverty impacts families across the board, regardless of class.  When you look, you know, the impact of poverty on families in terms of family stability; looking at not having enough money for food in terms of looking at food nutrition issues, looking at use of drugs, all those things that in big cities, in the Midwest or the Northeast, you would associate it with quote minority problems.  But in Des Moines many of those problems were not problems with dealing with people's color; it was more whites.  So a lot of the programs that we worked with, planning for seniors, for example, planning for assisting low-income families who have--who need training.  But these are very good programs I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That don't exist now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So then again  was the gist of your research to, what did you--what were your basic statements coming from--(unclear)
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  What the research basically shows is that when programs are put in place and where there's active community participation as was on the model cities, the old model cities, you're most likely to get significant change and you're most likely to get change that can be institutionalized, not short-term but long-term change.  And change that will have a multiplier effect.  If you're dealing with housing and you're dealing with employment, those two things together will have a negative--will have a positive impact on reducing crime.  And in terms of providing more resources for schools in terms of lunch programs, in terms of providing more programs for before- and after-school care, you're likely to have an impact positive in terms of student achievement.  Those kinds of things that I was looking in terms of when you start putting resources in a community that you were trying to impact those indicators that we all know make for a quality neighborhood, and quality schools, and quality housing, and quality--you know, you start going across the board, as opposed to just one program.  But if you put them together and make it a package, then you're likely to have the greatest--you're likely to get the biggest bang for the buck so to speak.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this--what you just said to me is one of the most baffling things about, I think, sociology or politics in the United States as if--that seems--what you just stated seems that, I mean, even though you conducted a study, it seems self-evident, that everybody would know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And yet, we live--(unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: They don't do it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We--today we act like people trying to cut back on those kinds of programs--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then wonder why they--we still have the same problems.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's really--it's really common sense and it's almost like we all know this is the way we should do it, but what gets in the way is politics.  For example, Head Start [Program, a federal program designed to provide children with education and proper nutrition programs].  Every study that's been conducted on Head Start shows that for every dollar you put in, that you get a ten-fold return.  And the multiplier effect of getting young people early and staying with them; getting them nutrition early and staying with them, the facts are, you know, are just weighted so much in favor of let's do it.  But now we're talking about cutting Head Start.  Doesn't make any sense.  So a lot of times what drives policy has very little to do with facts.  And that's--that's the problem with public policy--that's driven by politics.
Story_ID: 1814
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So.  Okay, so when you earned your Ph.D. [degree in sociology from Iowa State University in 1976], where did you go next?  What happened next?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I earned my Ph.D., and then I--let me see.  My first job out of school was Texas Southern [University], in Houston, Texas.  And I was there in '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: This was a traditional black college.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Historical Black College, HBCU.  It's one of the largest in Houston.  Texas Southern was founded out of the fact that Heman [M.] Sweatt [1912-1982], University of Texas wouldn't let him into law school because he's black.  And so, the state created a law school for him.
Speaker 1: That's Texas--
Speaker 2: One person, at Texas Southern.  The law school now is called--it's called "Thurgood Marshall School of Law," ironically.  1947 [Texas State University for Negroes was established in 1947 by the Texas state legislature].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So that was my--and when I graduated in 1976 from Iowa State [University, Ames, Iowa], I said, my goal is to teach ten years at a historical black college and university, and then the next ten or so at a white, and then ultimately black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, my first job was at Texas Southern, I spent thirteen years (laughter).
Speaker 1: Instead of ten.  Okay.  What were some of the, I guess the benchmarks of your stay at Texas Southern?
Speaker 2: Well, when I came in, I got a position as--my appointment was 50 percent teaching and 50 percent research.  And I negotiated that knowing that I wanted to do research.  I just didn't want to just teach.  And so, they gave me a position of director of research at the Urban Resource Center.  And so, this is where I started to--I started to do research and started to understand how research was conducted, and how to write grants, and how to get funds, and that's where I--that's where I, you know, I really--that was my--that was the beginning of my academic career.
Story_ID: 1815
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know there's a book that came out of this experience [at Texas Southern University, 1976-1989], a book about Texas [Invisible Houston: the Black Experience in Boom and Bust, 1987], that you added to the--is that the one about sprawl?  Is that the one that came out--(unclear)
Speaker 2: No. I did a book--
Speaker 1: No, that's Atlanta.  The Atlanta (unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --in nineteen--1987, I think, "Invisible Houston."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  "Invisible Houston" was my first book that I wrote.  And that was Texas A & M University Press. I wrote that book to try to, you know, get a--capture the fact that Houston's [Texas]--Houston has the largest black community in the South.  You know, it's, you know--
Speaker 1: Houston's the largest in the South?
Speaker 2: It's the largest.  Houston's the fourth largest city in the country, and it has the largest black community in the South.  Over half a million black people.  There are more black people in Houston than there are people in Atlanta.  A lot of people don't know that.  So, and it has a large black middle class.  It has a large affluent business class.  So Houston is, you know--and so, it was--and when I got there in  '76 [1976] it was booming.  It was the petrochemical capital of the world, and it was--and the university was, you know, Texas Southern was one of the largest HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities], you know, it was thriving.  And so, I was, you know--
Speaker 1: So let me get this right, now.  There are more black folks in Houston than--
Speaker 2: There are people in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: --in Atlanta.  Okay.  And so, Houston; would that be the second largest black population in the country?
Speaker 2: No.  Houston had--no.  Well, probably Houston has--no.  New York City [New York] and--
Speaker 1: Harlem would be the biggest.
Speaker 2: Yes.  New York City has more black people, and Chicago [Illinois] has more black people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But in the South.
Speaker 1: In the South.
Speaker 2: In the South, yeah.
Story_ID: 1816
Speaker 1: (unclear)  Okay.  All right.  So the time now, I remember, I guess in the '70s [1970s], that reading an article about Houston [Texas] being an unplanned kind of a sprawling community.  That's why I got it mixed up with the sprawling (unclear) in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Because you say the same thing about Atlanta, and (unclear) huge influx of people into the Sun Belt, and they're just, you know, so the urban planners are challenged by--
Speaker 2: Well, Houston is the only--is the only major U.S. [United States] city that does not have zoning.  See, there's no zoning in Houston.  So that means it's unplanned.  It means that anything goes.  You know, it's 595 square miles.  It means that there's no zoning, and so, the only thing that regulates land use in Houston is renewable deed restrictions.  And for those neighborhoods that--where you don't have a high percentage of home ownership, where you have lots of renters where the deeds are--these restrictions are allowed to lapse, you have all kinds of usage.  So a deed restriction, if you have residential deed restrictions where you say only this can be placed in a certain area, those would be restrictions that are kept up by the owners, they can restrict what goes in.  But if the deed restrictions lapse, it means you can put anything in there.  So that--so that's--so in terms of the land use being crazy patchwork in Houston, it creates a problem for a lot of our neighborhoods, people of color neighborhoods; African American and Latino neighborhoods because you can get, you know, landfills, incinerators, garbage dumps, petrochemical plants located, fence line to a residential area, because there's no zoning.  So what's happening in--what I wrote about [in "Invisible Houston: the Black Experience in Boom and Bust," 1986], you know, early on in that late '70s [1970s], is that Houston has what's called "unofficial zoning."  And certain neighborhoods zoned for certain things unofficially.  Unofficially, not officially.  But unofficially.  Decisions are made by the city council of county commissioners that, these are the things that should go in certain areas, certain neighborhoods.   So it means that it's unofficially zoned, which is equivalent to have a zoning.
Speaker 1: I guess around late '80s [1980s] or early '90s [1990s], Houston sort of made national--got national attention from a rap song about--by the Geto Boys [originally "Ghetto Boys"], you know, about going "Fifth Ward" on somebody [first album, "5th Ward Chronicles: Making Trouble," 1984].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And people were--and there were a couple of movies actually that depicted the "Fifth Ward" of Houston, in just, you know, a very dramatic and kind of vulgar ways, you know.  What was your impression of the "Fifth Ward?"  Was that the worse place in Houston?
Speaker 2: No.  You know, I wrote--I wrote two books on Houston, as a matter of fact; "Invisible Houston" and the other one, "[Houston:] Growth and Decline in a Sunbelt Boomtown."  In "Invisible Houston," [1989] I researched all the neighborhoods in Houston, all the black neighborhoods in Houston.  That was part of a research project that I was doing for--on landfills and incinerators, and garbage dumps.  And "Fifth Ward" was one of the neighborhoods that had--early on had had solid waste facilities.  Fifth Ward--the early neighborhoods where black people were confined was basically the wards, and "Fourth Ward" was the oldest.  It was Freeman's Town.  "Fifth Ward" was the one northeast; "Third Ward" is--was middle-class black, where the [Texas Southern] university is located.  And so, the "Fifth Ward" was notorious for having anything goes; gambling, the crime rate was, you know, bloody, whatever; you know, with clubs and whatever.  So it got a reputation way back.  But in terms of it being the bloodiest or whatever, a lot of that was more reputation than reality.  But again, a lot of the problems, in terms of--urban problems, existed not just in "Fifth Ward," but in some of the neighborhoods as you move out from the wards.  And as blacks started moving out from the wards to other neighborhoods, that's when you start looking at some of the issues as it relates to urban problems.
Story_ID: 1817
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's the title, "Invisible Houston?"  ["Invisible Houston: the Black Experience in Boom and Bust," 1986] These are problems that exist that a lot of people don't--are not aware of?
Speaker 2: Well, the--
Speaker 1: Those were not in those (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, the point of "Invisible Houston" was that the fact that Houston's black population was invisible, even though it's the largest in the South.  when you look at the fact that--and again, when I wrote the book, it was using the issue of landfills and garbage dumps and incinerators; even though you had the largest black community in the South, it was invisible to the point where all of the city-owned landfills were located in black neighborhoods.  Six out of the city-owned incinerators were located in black neighborhoods.  And three out of four of the privately-owned landfills were located in black neighborhoods.  And even though blacks only made up 25 percent of the population.
Speaker 1: Now, I am going to ask you an obviously dumb question.  What's wrong with that?
Speaker 2: Well, that's what white people told us back in 1979.  "Isn't that where the garbage should go?"  Well, our point was, "Hey, everybody produces garbage, but everybody doesn't have to live next to the garbage dumps."  In a city that doesn't have zoning somebody decided that's where the garbage dumps are going.  And these are not all poor neighborhoods.  And so--so the point was even though you are five hundred thousand-plus strong, you're still invisible if you were black.  And even though you have, you know, one of the--you have a black middle-class that has--that's one of the largest and has, you know, one of the highest median income, you're still invisible.  Even though you have lots of black men there, you're still invisible.  And what makes them invisible, racism.
Speaker 1: Now, what does it mean to have a garbage dump in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, it means that if you're in a city that doesn't have zoning, it means that somebody's deciding you're compatible with garbage; therefore, you are garbage.  It means that, if the garbage has to go somewhere and that somewhere, 82 percent of the time is where black live.  82 percent of the garbage in Houston [Texas] was dumped in black neighborhoods, and blacks only made up 25 percent of the population.  That's saying something.  And what, you know, I discovered that in 1979 working on a lawsuit.  So the idea is that, before 1979--this had been going on forever.  But before 1979, nobody had done anything like that--any study like that.  Nobody had even filed a lawsuit like that.
Speaker 1: I mean, are there health risks?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Living next to a landfill where garbage is dumped is not something that people are clamoring to get.  You have all kinds of dust from trucks passing through, diesel trucks; you have the garbage that goes there that's dumped; birds; rodents; roaches; odors; you start naming gases; fires; explosions; all of that.  When you start naming all the work contamination, beaching, into the ground water; all those things.  So there's a reason why landfills have become very difficult to site, it's because of all of that.  Nobody wants to live next to a garbage dump.  And so, lowering your property values and impacting your health; esthetics.  And so, when you look at all those factors, historically they were placed in the path of least resistance.  There were no blacks on the City Council until 1972 in Houston.  And so the city council basically decided where the landfill is going.  Of course, when the first black city councilman in Houston [Judson W. Robinson, Jr.] was elected in 1972 [sic, 1971], the first decision that he had to make was to fight a landfill that was placed in his district, and he had to almost stop a riot that was--1972--that was over a landfill placed in a neighborhood called Kashmere Gardens [Houston, Texas, a historically African American neighborhood].  And so, it becomes a real issue in terms of how can you stop things from going into your neighborhood that other people don't want.  And planners call them "locally unwanted land uses," are LULUs stopping LULUs.  And in Houston, there was no zoning so, how can you stop a landfill if there's no zoning?
Story_ID: 1818
Speaker 1: Wow.  So did these--the placement of these landfills requires a collusion of politicians, right?  I mean, they have to agree with it to--or do they?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  These are decisions made by political officials, elected officials.  And in the case of one that was subject of the lawsuit, the Whispering Pine Landfill in Northeast Houston, it was collusion [secret agreement] with the city council member who represented the district, and he's black.  So the company that located the landfill were the--the sanitary landfill is the second largest waste fill company in the world.  Headquartered in Houston.  So collusion with the government, city government; collusion with county government; collusion with state representatives who helped get the permit, who represented the area; collusion with the private industry.  These are all things that money--what's called unrestrained capitalism in Houston, since you don't have zoning.  These are people who can buy permits, and get the land, and keep people quiet, and keep it so that people think that they're getting a new subdivision or shopping, strip shopping center; and then later they find out, "No, you're getting a landfill.  You're getting a garbage dump."  That's the kind of invisibility that makes for Houston that I wrote about in "Invisible Houston." ["Invisible Houston: the Black Experience in Boom and Bust," 1987]  And where the landfill that was subject of the lawsuit, "Bean v. Southwestern Waste [Corporation]" [1979] was the first lawsuit that was filed by my wife, my ex-wife [Linda McKeever Bullard], to challenge environmental racism.  And this was--the landfill was placed, not in a ghetto or low-income area; it was a black middle-class suburban neighborhood of homeowners.  85 percent of the people in that neighborhood owned homes.  There was nothing out in that area except trees and houses.  And so, they decided to put a landfill there.  And they could do that because there's no zoning.  So the idea is to say that, "well, this neighborhood is compatible with this middle-class suburban neighborhood is compatible-use with a garbage dump," is basically saying, "those black people who bought their houses and who live in those nice homes, they're garbage, because this is compatible."
Story_ID: 1819
Speaker 1: Now, how was your book ["Invisible Houston: the Black Experience in Boom and Bust," 1987] received?
Speaker 2: Well, you know (laughter) "Invisible Houston" was more about--was more than about the landfill.  It was about housing.  When we showed that residential segregation housing; we looked at the educational system, segregated; we looked at all of those areas.  And that was basically following the same pattern.  You know, it was used, maybe by a lot of schools; adopted as a reader.  It did well.  And it--to some extent, it erased some of the invisibility.
Speaker 1: Did it--what was the impact locally?  I know you talked about the land--I mean the lawsuit that your ex-wife Linda McKeever, right?
Speaker 2: (unclear) McKeever Bullard, yeah.
Speaker 1: Bullard filed.  And what was the result of the lawsuit?
Speaker 2: Well, the lawsuit was filed in '79 [1979] and went to trial in '85 [1985].  And there was a lot of, you know, things along the way that changed.  But, Houston [Texas] still doesn't have zoning.  It passed an ordinance to limit landfills, solid waste sites within a two mile radius of a school.  That's zoning.  But it passed an ordinance for that, but it would never say that--that it passed zoning.  You know, the landfill that was subject of the lawsuit that my wife filed, was thirteen hundred feet from a school.  Thirteen hundred feet from a school.  Across the street from a football stadium, within a mile radius of a half-dozen elementary schools.  This is in a black school district, in--a black suburban school district.  So what that lawsuit did and what my book did is basically show that there needs to be some lifting of this veil off of this invisibility the fact that black people are getting discriminated against in a number of ways, including the environment, health, housing, schools, employment, etcetera.  But the environmental case was the most dramatic.  And that case, basically set the tone for all of the environmental racism, environment discrimination lawsuits.  That was the first one.  And put on notice the fact that environmental discrimination is a civil rights issue.  That was the first one.  And so, that Houston lawsuit basically, you know, sent shockwaves around.  You know, people say, "Well, now, is this a civil rights issue?  You can file a lawsuit, you know, based on the fact that these facilities are located, you know, disproportioned to where people of color are?"  And then, "Was the rules set out, you know; were people deliberately deceived, and no notice was given; false notice was given?"  All of that is basically illegal.  So it's had a tremendous--you know, that Houston case and that study that I did in 1979 on Houston, "The Waste Site Study" that, you know, it basically remapped where these facilities are.  This was the first time that had been done.  There was GIS [Geographic Information Systems, a mapping system capable of showing other relevant data] mapping then; there was no Google map [an online searchable database for maps].  My ten students and I in my research methods class at Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas], we basically mapped where these facilities are.  That was part of our assignment, that we map and we worked on; nineteen students.
Speaker 1: So, now did the [United States] Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] have a position on environmental justice?
Speaker 2: Not in 1979.  It was not known.  1979 the EPA was missing in action.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, in 1979 the EPA was only nine years old.  And the EPA didn't have a position, none of the environmental groups, none of the civil rights groups had a position.  So it took twenty years before these folks realized that these are issues, real issues.  And some of the groups still don't realize it.
Story_ID: 1820
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are you like a tenured professor by this time when the book ["Invisible Houston: the Black Experience in Boom and Bust," 1987] comes out?
Speaker 2: When the book came out in '87 [1987], yes.  When I started it I was not tenured, I was only three years out of graduate school.  Well, when I started the research for the lawsuit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Book came out in '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Did--was there any local, I guess, backlash from you writing this book and stirring this up at this time?
Speaker 2: The backlash came in '79 [1979], '80 [1980] when I was doing the study; when, you know, I--when calls came in to the university [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] that I was doing a study on working with--investigating where landfills are located and the impact of landfills on property values.  And my dean was called, and I was called in.  And he asked me what was I doing, and I explained it to him.  And he asked me was that sociology, and I said yes.  And he said sounded like sociology to him.  "Go ahead and do it."  And so I did it.  I didn't have tenure.  I didn't get, you know, it was three years before I would get tenure.  You know, you get tenure after you come up after your fifth year, so--and, you know, I wrote it up.  You know, I wrote up this in '80 [1980].  As I said, I did the study in '79 [1979].  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the book came out in '87 [1987]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's almost ten years later almost.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I had written lots of articles before then.  "Invisible Houston" was--and the book only had one chapter to dealing with the lawsuit and the landfills.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The book dealt with housing.  As I said, there were all the forms of discrimination and how the black community was receiving less than its fair share of the goodies across the board; environmental, quality housing, education, employment; you name it, and pointed out the disparity.
Speaker 1: Now we have a note here that, "In '87 [1987], the United Church of Christ commissioned for racial justice does the first national study looking at toxic waste in race."
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  United Church in Christ did the national study.  And if you look at the reference section, you'll see a lot of my articles and reports that I have done starting in '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: Did they consult you about it?
Speaker 2: Well, actually I talked with the people, yeah.  Yeah.  I talked with the people.  When the--when the '87 [1987] study had come out, the Houston case ["Bean v. Southwestern Waste Corporation," 1979]  was '80 [1980]--'79 [1979], and the Warren County Protest was '82 [1982]-'83 [1983] [African American residents of Warren County protested the placement of a hazardous waste landfill in their community], and our case went to trial in '85 [1985].  And so, a lot of things were going on at this time.  By 1987, a lot of the emphasis on research and how you do the research was now getting more mature, and the need for looking at national data as opposed to case studies.  See, mine was a case study in Houston [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're going to pause here again for a second.
Story_ID: 1821
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in '88 [1988], you served as an associate professor, a visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley [Berkeley, California].  So how did that come about and what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, when I left Houston [Texas] in 1987, and I--my wife [Linda McKeever Bullard] and I were deciding that we wanted to--a change.  And so I went to the University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee] and I taught for a year.  She didn't like Tennessee, and so she didn't leave Houston.  And so, I left--we decided we were going to go to California.  She wanted to--she didn't want to practice law anymore.  So she wanted to write screenplays and novels, and so, she got accepted at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles].  And so, I got a position at UC Berkeley in the Energy and Resources Group as a visiting scholar.  And so, we moved to California.  And so, I was in northern California, she was in southern California.  And I stayed up in northern California for a year, and I was at Berkeley.  And so the first opening that came available after a year was at UC Riverside [University of California, Riverside].  And so, I ended up moving down to Southern California, and I stayed in, you know, with my family and drive out to Riverside [in 1989].  And I did that for a number of years, first--and then I would--a couple of times I would take a position, a visiting position at UCLA because that was close.  So once you get tenure within the UC [University of California] system, you can go any of those schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I got--I got promoted from an associate professor to full professor at University of California-Riverside.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 1822
Speaker 1: Now in '90 [1990], you published "Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Quality."  Tell us about that book.
Speaker 2: Well, what "Dumping in Dixie" did was, it expanded the work ["Invisible Houston: the Black Experience in Boom and Bust," 1987] that I had started in Houston, [Texas]  and expanded to include environmental dumping on black communities across the South.  And whether it was--and I looked at Houston's landfills and incinerators, and I looked at Dallas [Texas] with lead smelters.  All the lead smelters in Dallas are located in black communities.  I looked at cancer alley, Louisiana; looked at Alsen, [Louisiana], all the petrochemical plants.  I looked at West Virginia, the fact that the only place that manufactured methyl isocyanate [MIC, a product in the creation of carbamate pesticides], the same--this same chemical that killed all those people in Bhopal [the "Bhopal Gas Tragedy" of 1984, in Madhya Pradesh, India, in which over 3,500 were dead due to a gas release of methyl isocyanate].  The Institute of West Virginia [West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] is the place where they manufactured that MIC at Union Carbide plant located at Institute, across from West Virginia State College [sic, University].  And Institute gets its name from the fact that, West Virginia needed a place for its Jim Crow school back in the 1880s, and they put it in the black community and called it West Virginia Colored Institute.  The little town called Institute.  A lot of black--lot of people didn't know that black people in West Virginia and Union Carbide found them.  And so, I looked at--the largest hazardous waste landfill in the country is located in Sumter County, Alabama.  The county is 75 percent black.  No black elected officials when that facility was put in [1978].  Emelle, Alabama and Sumter County is like 90 percent black.  And so, when you start looking at the pattern across the region, "Dumping in Dixie," that's why I wrote "Dumping in Dixie."  "Dumping in Dixie" was the--in 1990 was the first environmental justice book, and it stayed the first for two years until the second book was a book by Bunyan Bryant at the University of Michigan ["Environmental Injustice: Weighing Race and Class as Factors in the Distribution of Environmental Hazards", 1992, coauthored by Paul Mohai].  So it was the only book and it was adopted as a textbook, and so--at universities across the country in the environmental programs, and planning, and whatever.  And so, it became, you know, pretty famous.
Story_ID: 1823
Speaker 1: Okay.  In 1990, you won the Conversation Achievement Award in Science from the National Wildlife Federation.  That sounds like an interesting thing.  So what happened?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, that was--the book ["Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Equality," 1990] had reached a lot of people, and it became well known.  And so, the National Wildlife Federation gave me that award and invited me to come to Washington [D.C.] for the summer.  And I went to Washington, and the purpose of that visiting scholar position at National Wildlife Federation was to work with the staff and work with their board members, to talk about diversity; to talk about how can you get more people of color into the environmental movement, and how can National Wildlife Federation expand.  Because there were a lot of black people and people of color who fish and hunt.  They call the "hook and bullet crowd."  And they wanted--they are for clean water, and they are for conservation and preservation of wildlife, etcetera.  And so, how can it get more folks into that.  And also, looking at the fact that National Wildlife Federation each year had produced a conservation directory, a directory of thousands of organizations in all fifty states, and none of the organizations that worked on environmental justice were ever included in that directory.  And so, I had produced a directory for our--when we were working on planning the summit--people call it summit [First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit].  And the summit was held in '91 [1991], but we had started planning it in '90 [1990].  And I had produced a directory which is the unofficial list of people who were working on this stuff.  And so, they wanted me to work with them to try to get some of the groups that we work with, that work on environmental justice, people of color groups, to get them in that new directory that they put together so that, by state because we did it by state, so that the conservation directory would not just be a directory of white groups.  And so, my summer there was spent doing that.  And I gave a couple of lectures, and working with some of the staff folks.  So it was, it was a nice summer.  Nice award.
Speaker 1: So in '91 [1991], you were one of the organizers of the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit.  Okay.  So that's--is that--does the organization still exist?
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't an organization; it was a summit that was called together.  It was the first summit that people of color organized to develop a strategy and an agenda to deal with issues, our issues, as it relates to environment and health.  And the summit was called by and planned by the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice.  And at the time, who was chairing that commission was [Benjamin] "Ben" Chavis [Muhammad, African American civil rights activist].  Ben Chavis was the executor director of the Commission for Racial Justice.  And he was the one that pulled together the planning committee that I served on that organized that four-day conference.  And the first two days were just people of color, African Americans, Native Americans, Asian and Pacific Islanders and Latinos, because we needed to get together to get to know each other.  And then the second, two days of the four days, we brought everybody in.  We brought whites in, everybody in.  And we planned it for five hundred people, and over a thousand people showed up.  And so, it was a--and we developed some principles, seventeen principles of environmental justice.  And we developed those principles in October, and by June of 2002, those seventeen principles had been translated into at least a dozen languages.  When we got to the Earth Summit in Rio [de Janeiro, Brazil] in June of 2002 [sic, 1992, United Nations Conference on Environment and Development or the "Earth Summit"], our principles were being circulated by all kinds of groups.  So we think, you know, when we developed those principles that it was very important that we expand lots of issues, not U.S. [United States], but also global.  And so, that's how, I think, that first summit was able to have legs, and grow, and expand, and get environmental justice to become, you know, a household word.  And to become something that resonates across the globe.
Story_ID: 1824
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm just thinking.  This is off the top (unclear) here.  There is in no study, but I just wonder, this movement [the environmental justice movement, early 1990s], people of color getting together; what was the typical black participant doing?  What was their--what were they--who were they?  Were they professors or were they community organizers?  What was the typical black participant?
Speaker 2: Well, the typical black participant was not a professor, even though there are a couple of professors that were part of it; myself, Doctor Beverly Wright [director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice in New Orleans] who's at Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana]; Doctor Bunyan Bryant who's at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  We're the black academics.  But most of the black people were small--who directed small community-based organizations, like Hazel Johnson [1935-2011, environmental activist in Chicago's South Side] in Chicago, who I went to her funeral back in January.  She had founded a community-based organization, People for Community Recovery, way back in eighty, eighty-nine or eighty-five, something like that.  They were small groups working on all kinds of issues; on childhood lead poisoning to trying to stop, you know, this landfill or trying to stop this incinerator or trying to get the school children relocated from this plan, or whatever.  They were working on all kinds of stuff.  Working with pesticides, etcetera.  There were grassroots groups that had never come together.  And just like the group in Houston [Texas] that we worked with who are fighting this landfill, they and no connection with any national group.  They could--we tried to get NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] involved in '79 [1979].  They said they didn't know what we were doing.  They didn't see anything wrong with it.  We tried to get environmental groups.  They said, "Well, they're lucky." You say, "Well, what's wrong with having all the landfills in black communities?"  "So?"  So what we did in the summer was connect those communities and those leaders who were struggling out there by themselves, connect them with a national organization like the Commission for Racial Justice and the United Church of Christ.  And [Benjamin] "Ben" Chavis [Muhammad, executive director of the Commission for Racial Justice] had the resources to pull it together.  And with the planning committee and what we did with the planning committee was to fund-raise with the foundations, and we were able to bring, you know, more than a thousand people to Washington, D.C., in 1991 to a four-day conference.  And we developed those principles, and the first principle was that people must speak for themselves.  We want to make sure that people of color on the ground who are struggling against these problems or environmental racism, that they don't need anybody speaking--they don't need these white environmental groups speaking for them.  Number one, these groups, when they do speak, they don't--they're not speaking with authenticity.  And cutting deals with the government, cutting deals with the industry, and not really speaking on behalf of communities that are the fence line.  And so, there was a level of trust that did not exist that exists today.
Story_ID: 1825
Speaker 1: Now, rather--it just seems like the tasks, you know, was such a--is really a tremendous educational task to try to get people involved in--first of all you got to convince them.  I think most black people, and correct me if I'm wrong, would probably, you know, once you--you could talk to them five minutes to convince them that a dump is not good for them, you know. It wouldn't take--it wouldn't take that.  They probably already know it.  But at the same time, with some many things were set in the communities, they, you know, the people, you know, chain smoke more in the black community than anyplace else.  We--there's more garbage thrown out of car windows in the black community.
Speaker 2: Well, it's not just--it's just not all of that.  It's all of--see, what we did, we brought people who were working on all kinds of issues.  Working on air quality issues, working on transit issues, working on the fact that all the bus barns in Harlem [New York, New York] are located--I mean all the bus barns in Manhattan [New York, New York] are located in Harlem.  Even though it's not just people who were riding the buses.  And looking at the fact that who lives in cities that have the worst air?  We do, people of color do.  So it's not just garbage.  Or who--who has paved streets?  And who doesn't?  Even though people are paying taxes, and you still looking at some of these places down south, and we're talking in 1991, where in Mississippi, parts of Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina; where, like when I grew up where the road stopped, the paved road stops at the black community.  There were places when we were working in South Carolina--in North Carolina where the road stops at the black community; or where the sewer line stops.  And so, we brought people like to the summit and say, this is an environmental justice issue; or the fact that your school is located next to this refinery, and everybody at that school's got asthma or got a respiratory problem.  That's an environmental issue.  And so, getting people to understand the connection between the environment, health, and their civil rights, and to get the civil rights organization to acknowledge it; to get the environmental groups to acknowledge it and put it on their agenda.  That's what about that--that's the diminished amount of education that we wanted--that was challenging us to do.  And to get publishers to publish books that deal with that.  When I published "Dumping in Dixie[: Race, Class, and Environmental Quality]," [1990] there was no book that dealt with that.  And I went to five or six publishers before I got Westview [Press] to deal with it.  I got letters back saying, "There's no--you can't make race an environment.  You can't put environment and justice in the same sentence.  The environment affects everybody the same."  And so, and there's some people who believe that right now, that if you have enough money, you can buy your way out of--but studies now show that African-Americans who make fifty to sixty thousand dollars a year; these are affluent African Americans, live in neighborhoods that are more polluted than whites who make ten thousand dollars a year.  So it's not just a poverty thing.  It's easier for poor whites to escape pollution than it is for middle-income black people.  Why?  Because of segregation and because of housing discrimination.  So race.  So trying to get policy in place to address this is very difficult.  Trying to get our elected officials to address when you got backlash of people who saying we need to cut out the EPA [United States Environmental Protection Agency], we need to dismantle OSHA, you know, Occupational Safety and Health Administration.  You look at the BP [British Petroleum] spill [Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, 2010], all the emphasis is on cleaning up, you know, stopping the well, capping the well, cleaning up the waste off the beaches.  There is no concern about where the waste is going.  When we asked the question where is the waste going, the government said, "Well, it's going to landfills."  We said, "Where are the landfills?"  They said, "We don't know."  That's when I came back to the office and generated a report showing that 60 percent of the BP waste that's cleaned up from that spill, from that disaster, is going into black neighborhoods where landfills are; 60 percent in those four Gulf Coast states, when black people only make up 26 percent of the population in the coastal counties in those four states.  You got 25 percent of the population, but you getting sixty-percent of the waste.  That's like Houston way back in 1979. We talking the BP spill.  We talking something that happened just a year ago.
Story_ID: 1826
Speaker 1: Is there--now.  Just listen to this, I mean, I'm convinced-- --you know, I don't you have to convince most people this is wrong.  But to most of these people they're not thinking about it.  But at the same time, those who are deciding where to dump this stuff, they don't want it in their neighborhood.  So, it's there--and you know, might kind of makes right in this country a lot of times.  So were you there--a negotiated compromise or some sort of a solution that you would propose for, you know, future dumps and landfills?  I mean, where should they go?
Speaker 2: Well, just like it used to.  When we filed that lawsuit in '79' (1979) ["Bean v. Southwestern Waste Corporation"], not a single landfill has been built in Houston.  What they've done, is gone through a very aggressive recycling program, waste minimization program, composting.  In other words, when you take black neighborhoods off the agenda because of that lawsuit, that means that white neighborhoods may be now considered.  Well, in Houston, white neighborhoods were not considered compatible with landfills.  And that means that we're going to go to something that everybody's going to have to share in the responsibility and share in the solution.  So you take off the pattern--path of least resistance and you do what needs to be done.  You do the right thing.  And so, when lawsuits are filed and when money is being spent and taken out of the bottom line for these companies, they will start doing the right thing.  Governments will start doing the right.  And so, because if it's left to the whims of "Well, let's put it over here because they don't have any power.  They can't hire no lawyers.  Nobody's going to care about all that over there."  Then it'll always get dumped over there.  So what you have--what we've been trying to do is basically say and do that no--there should be no throwaway communities.  There should be no sacrifice zones.  And there should be no areas that we can say it's okay just because they are poor; just because they are black or brown; or just because they are unemployed and need jobs and they can trade off their health for jobs.  Now that is unfair, unjust, and what we're saying it's immoral and it should be illegal.  Here as well as abroad.  It's not, you know--we say the same thing in terms of if--we are definitely opposed to sending our garbage--whether it be garbage from household or garbage from computers or garbage from batteries to the Philippines, to Taiwan, to Nigeria, wherever offshore, just because, you know, some corrupt government will take it, and dig a hole in the ground, and put it in the ground, and take the million.  That's pushing problems off onto another population, knowing that that particular country does not have any infrastructure to handle it when we don't even have it--handle it.
Story_ID: 1827
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--so.  Okay.  So in '91 [1991] also, you and six others go to the EPA [United States Environmental Protection Agency] administrator under the Bush Administration, William Reilly and ask what can be done to improve the situation, and was it is facing the many minority population--so you all formed a delegation as a result of the conference --to go to--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We formed a delegation after the Michigan Coalition--after meeting, there was a conference that was held at the University of Michigan, School of Natural Resources.  And after that conference, we went to--we wrote letters to a number of agencies, including EPA.  We met with the EPA administration, William Reilly, and sat down and negotiated, you know, a strategy to deal with environment disparities.  And we said that we wanted to meet with him every three months or so.  And so, he set up this working group on environment justice, and set up the Office of Environmental Equity.  And later in '92 [1992], they produced the first government report, EPA Report on Environmental Equity.  That's '92 [1992].  This is under William Reilly under the first Bush [President George H. W. Bush, 1989-1993].  And then after [President William J.] Clinton [1993-2001] came in we still met, and Clinton expanded what William Reilly--what Bush had done under William Reilly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So he expanded it and he changed the name from the Office of Environmental Equity to the Office of Environmental Justice.  Clinton in '94 [1994], he signed an executive order on Environmental Justice [Executive Order 12898], and set up the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council, NEJAC.  And so he did a lot--you know, they started to do a lot of things and put in place institutional infrastructure to start to get--address this stuff on the federal level.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'd just like to say that NEJAC sounds like an unfortunate name. (laughter)
Speaker 2: Yeah.   "Knee jerk."  We say "knee jack," not "knee jerk."  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, okay.  Were some of your colleagues in this quest Bunyan Bryant [University of Michigan] and Charles Lee [United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who else?  Anyone else?
Speaker 2: Bunyan Bryant, [Benjamin] "Ben" Chavis [Muhammad, United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice] was the--
Speaker 1: Ben Chavis?
Speaker 2: --at the Commission for Racial Justice was the sparkplug and Charles Lee actually worked for Ben Chavis.  He was Ben Chavis's staff person.  Dana Austin [Dana M Austin Environmental Consulting, Jacksonville, Florida] was very important in this struggle; she's now deceased.  Richard Moore from Albuquerque [New Mexico].  He was with the Southwest Network for Environmental Justice.  Tom Goldtooth was from Indigenous Environmental Network; he's from Minnesota.  So there were a number of leaders that worked on this planning committee.  Damu Smith [environmental activist, executive director of the National Black Environmental Justice Network], he's now deceased [2006].  Now a lot of people are now dead.  He was out of Washington [D.C.] and worked, you know, he's an organizer--organizer's organizer, out of D.C.  So, yeah.
Story_ID: 1828
Speaker 1: All right.  So now, in '94 [1994], you came here to Atlanta U [Clark-Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us how that came about?
Speaker 2: Well, I, you know, I was in California; I was at UC Riverside [University of California, Riverside].  I think my last year I was in California I was at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles], I forget.  But anyway, I wanted to set up a center and--because I was flying--taking red eyes [overnight flights] from LA [Los Angeles] to this side of the world, East Coast, and it was wearing me down.  So I wanted to set up a base here on this side of the country.  And I decided that well, you know, if I came to Atlanta, [Georgia] I could take Delta [Air Lines] direct anywhere, and I wanted to put the center--and I said, why not put the center at my alma mater.  And I worked, you know, I called a couple of people here at the University, Dr. Kofi Bota, who was vice president here at the time, and the present, [Dr.] Tom Cole.  And they'd said yes, and so I came in '94 [1994], and set up the center [Environmental Justice Resource Center] and have been here ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What have been some of the activities of the center [Environmental Justice Resource Center]?
Speaker 2: Well, we've--since I've been here, our center is designed for--to work with communities.  We use the community-based participatory research model, which basically says most of our research comes out of ideas and struggles that communities come to us with; and we do research; we testify at hearings.  You know, I've testified at dozens of environmental justice civil rights lawsuits as an expert witness; we do policy work; we write; we publish; we document.  We try to, you know, we're not just a think-tank; we like to do, we're a do-tank.  And so, we have forums, conferences, summits, symposia, lecture series; we do all of that.  And we get our students involved, our student interns.  Our university [Clark-Atlanta University], we work across the campuses in different programs where we have students now.  As a matter of fact, we have students that we're working with that are going down to New Orleans [Louisiana] this weekend to film communities that are part of those communities where those landfills are where BP waste is going [waste from the Deep Horizon Oil Spill, 2010], and they're going to be interviewing black fisherman and oysterman who have been impacted by the BP spill.  So we work with our communities, and we work with our students across--whether or not they're in sociology or political science or whatever.  And we collaborate with other HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities], other centers.  There are four centers like ours at HBCUs.  There's one at Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana] where Dr. Beverly Wright is director; there's another center at Florida A & M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] in the School of Public Health; and there's another center at Thurgood Marshall School of Law, it's a legal center [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  And we work in a collaborative way.  Our center also works with our colleagues at the University of Michigan because the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] is the only in the country that--where you can get a masters or a Ph.D. in environmental justice.  And so, we work with our colleagues there in getting our students and trying to get, you know, more of research done in collaborating with those researches.
Story_ID: 1829
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just a couple of things I want you to comment on.  If you can--well, one is '96 [1996], Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, Senior Policy Analyst EPA, files complaint against the United States which was mining vanadium in South Africa.  You know, did you know anything about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  We went to the mine.  We went to that mine in vanadium.  I don't know that much about that lawsuit.  I know she filed and I know she won it, if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--we all have heard recently about (unclear) in Kenya and her environmental crusade in Kenya
Speaker 2: (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: It's really--yeah, it's really grown, I mean, to include so many things.  When people get concerned about where they live, it kind of takes a--impacts other things.  you know, I don't know.  I think today--
Speaker 2: Well, you know--
Speaker 1: --because people think we live in a post-racism America.
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: It's--you know, when--if they would hear what you had to say about where they actually live, I mean, you know, this--I think people think as long as the white man doesn't smack them in the face or something, then they live in a post-racism America.  But it's a different--I mean there are a lot of ways that injustice can creep into your life or surround your life, engulf your life.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think when people realize the impact of environment on their health and the health of their community, and looking at the racial dynamics of it, even when you control for income and class, race is the most potent factor that determines where these facilities are and where the pollution gets dumped, and which communities get unequal protection.  As I said before, you know, affluent black people are more likely to live in neighborhoods with more pollution than poor whites.  And a lot of people wouldn't even believe that.  And that's not my study, that's the study done at the University of Colorado [Boulder, Colorado] by two white guys.  So when you talk about the impact on health rising asthma rates, elevated diabetes, and you talk about cancer rates, all these things; environmental factors.  You know, if you talk about lead, impact of lead poisoning in children, it impacts, you know, whether or not, you know, in terms of people's impact on health as it relates to kidney failures and showing--a lot of studies are now showing the fact that your physical environment impacts your health.  Something as simple as not having access to a full-service grocery store.  And now they're calling them "food deserts."  The fact is that black people have always--neighborhoods have always been redlined for banks, supermarkets, and other kinds of things that are considered amenities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's pause here a second.
Story_ID: 1830
Speaker 1: All right.  Is there a natural kind of a partnership with a white environmentalist on these issues?  Does it kind of naturally flow or is it something that has to be kind of, you know--how does it work?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, in '91 [1991], there was a letter that written to--from the environmental justice groups to the "Big Ten" environmental groups charging them with environmental racism, charging with elitism and paternalism.  And, of course, these were progressive groups; they see themselves as progressive.  But when you look at their boards--this is '91 [1991], their staffs, and their agendas, they were all white.  And so, they were caught off guard.  And so, what--over the last, you know, two decades, what we've tried to do is to educate on both sides.  And the fact that if we are to have an environmental movement that is national and that is global, then there has to be some changes in the way that things are done.  And once again, the environmental justice movement has forced this issue to the table; has basically said that the first principle of environmental justice is that people must speak for themselves.  When decisions are being made, when invitations are given to these White House meetings, and these congressional hearings, etcetera, we got to have people of color speaking for themselves as opposed to the "enviros" [environmental groups] speaking for them or speaking for us.  Because we're still a very segregated society along race and class lines.  And so, to have a white environmentalist speaking on behalf of somebody on the reservation won't work.  Or somebody from the bayou or somebody from, you know, the urban ghetto or the rural "polly pocket" or from Appalachia.  I mean, so that means that we have to have more diverse leaders, spokespersons, and individuals who are in decision-making positions.  And it has not been easy getting some of the environmentalists to say environmental justice and environmental racism, these are legitimate issues that need to be brought to the table, even though you just may deal with wildlife or you may just deal with wetlands or you may just deal with water quality issues.  We have to make sure that the environment is everything; where we live, work, play, worship, learn; as well as the physical and natural world.  So if you're going to be dealing with the environment, you need to understand that the environment does not affect everybody in the same way.  So they need to be aware, and they need to be understanding and not just say, "We don't deal with social issues.  We just deal with birds."  And we say, you know, we know birds are very important, whales are very important, wetlands are very important; but also children who live in houses that have lead or communities that are the fence line with petrochemical plants or people who don't have access to safe foods and healthy foods and supermarkets, or transits.  You know, those are things that--those are environmental issues also that it's taken twenty-five, thirty years for a lot of the groups to understand that these are their issues, even though they may not be their number one issue; we just want them on their agenda, and we want them as allies when we lead, and we go to the front and push for change and push for more resources to be put into equal protection.
Story_ID: 1831
Speaker 1: You have any comments about--I have a note here that in 2001, Christine Todd Whitman, who is the new administrative of the EPA [United States Environmental Protection Agency], made changes to the Executive Order 12898 [the executive order signed by President Clinton in 1994 that essentially defined, "environmental justice"].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We got lots--I got lots of comments on that.  It was weakened and it was--the charter was changed.  And there was an attempt to take race out of the Executive Order.  I mean, the Executive Order deals with low-income and minority communities and how they are impacted.  And so, there's this whole idea of running away from race and saying that you--saying that environmental justice was affirmative action.  All the data showing that low-income and minority communities are--suffer the burden and get more than their fair share of pollution.  So why is it that you can't, you know, start to target those communities where you need more enforcement or you need to have change?  They say, "We can't do that because if we do that, then we--it's race based and that's illegal."  I mean, that's the kind of thing that we were dealing with, you know, for ten years under the Bush Administration [2001-2009].  And so, we're saying under the Obama Administration, we need to make sure that the Executive Order is implemented, is enforced; this is low-income and minority communities.  These are the communities that get the most--got some of the burden and have the most risks, and therefore, we should make sure that that's eliminated.
Speaker 1: Well, you mentioned President [Barack] Obama, he appointed Lisa P. Jackson to serve as the first African American administrator of the EPA.  How has that impacted your work?  Do you see--are you encouraged?  Is she making changes?  Is she reinstating the original intent of the Executive Order we just cited?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the first two years of the Obama Administration under Lisa Jackson, more was done in those two years in advancing environmental justice, advancing equal protection, advancing ensuring that you have pollution prevention.  More was done in two years than in the last ten.  And I think getting environmental justice back on the radar, getting an inner-agency approach to it because it's not just EPA, it's HUD, Department of Housing and Urban Development; it's Department of Transportation; it's United States Department of Agriculture [USDA].  We deal with all these pesticides issues.  It's also dealing with mining and all of these things.  So it's an inner-agency approach.  And so, one thing that the administration did under Lisa Jackson is to reinvigorate the inter-agency working group.  Say, if we're to address a lot of these issues, we have to bring together the various federal agencies and use that approach, and not just say, "Well, that's not our job."  And if we were getting the idea of one agency pointing to another agency and saying, "Well, we don't do that.  That's over here."  EPA saying, 'We're not a health agency, you need to go to Health and Human Services'," or that kind of thing.  And it's like, people want--you know, people who are being poisoned don't want to be told which alphabet agency to go to.  They want help.  And so, if it's inter-agency, that means that you got housing, you got environment, you got health, you got transportation, you got, you know, various agencies there to address it.  And to be accountable for it, and to make the states accountable.  And see, that's been a problem.  We have ten regions of EPA, but all--and all these ten regions operate as if they are autonomist.  We have ten little EPAs; Region Six in the South is very different from Region Nine in the West, California.  And so, we say target resources and target enforcements to those areas that had been resistant to environment protection and equal protection.  And you find out, you know, you find a good, or you find a high correlation between those states that resisted civil rights with those same states that have the worst environmental protection as it relates to environmental justice.  And, you know, they resisted civil rights and now they resist, you know, equal protection environment; so they allow communities of color to get dumped on.  They allow dumping in Dixie [play on the title of Bullard's book, "Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Equality," 1990] pattern to operate.  It's not coincidental.  There's a direct correlation to exploitation of land and exploitation of people and the South is the worst; when it comes to civil rights, it's the worst; when it comes to environmental protection.
Story_ID: 1832
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you continue to publish.  I know, when I came in I looked at the shelf over there of at least ten books you edited or written.  I think the latest one was "Race, Place, and Environmental Justice After Hurricane Katrina" [2009]. Is that correct?
Speaker 2: Well, I just have one out that will be out in two weeks.  It's dealing with--it's "Environmental Health and Racial Equity in the United States"; it's looking at environmental health issues through a racial equity lens. It's from the American Public Health Association.  It's a Kellogg Foundation Book Project.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, it's--that will be the latest.  This is April 2011 that it will be out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In 2008 you were named one of "Newsweek Magazine's" thirteen environmental leaders of the century, you know, which is quite an honor, I think.
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: What is your future--what are your future plans, and how long are you going to do this, and what do you hope to achieve before you leave this program?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, what I want to do is basically continue to do what I'm doing, and that is writing, publishing, lecturing, teaching, educating, advocating.  And all of those things, I think, that's who I am.  And, you know, I have two books in the works right now.  And the fact that I think the, you know, [W.E.B.] Du Bois is in me, and that's the scholar; that's the person who wants to change policy; who wants to change the way that justice is meted out whether it's environmental justice, or whether it's health justice, or whatever.  That's, I think as long as I'm capable of doing that and can peck on a computer or laptop or whatever, and can--and have my faculties to deliver a coherent statement or paragraph or whatever, I think I'll be doing this after I retire, whatever.  I think mentoring and bringing along, you know, new generations of leaders to do this work.  And I have students that are all over doing all kinds of work beyond sociology that have brought this field to become an international field.  And so, that's what I enjoy.
Speaker 1: I don't want to get you in trouble, but can you name some of the promising young students of yours or young people that have taken up this cause?
Speaker 2: Well, some of my mentors are actually right here at the center.  You know, Glenn Johnson, who was my research assistant at University of Tennessee that year I was there; he's now my colleague.  He's Associate Professor here at the university.  We've written four books together.  Angel O. Torres, who was a student here, he's a GIS [Geographic Information System] specialist, and we've written three or four books together also.  I have some other students, who are--who I mentored were not students directly, but they are--I claim them as students and I knew them when they were, you know, undergrads, in graduate school; and David Pellow, for example, he's at the University of Minnesota [Twin Cities, Minnesota].  He has an endowed chair there, and I knew him when he was just a young kid at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] in--when I was working on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois] with Hazel Johnson [environmental activist in Chicago].  He would come, and when I would fly in he would pick me up at the airport.  So there--so mentoring young people and getting them on track and having them mentor others.  So we're into the third generation of environmental justice scholars and activists right now.
Story_ID: 1833
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you look back over everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you think you might want to--have wanted to do differently if you could go back and do it again?
Speaker 2: Wow.  You know what, I really can't think of anything I would do differently.  Probably if I could, could have written more grants and get more resources to graduate students, and help more--get more resources for outreach and community work, I think I would--I wish I could have helped more communities that are struggling; and for the lack resources, I think if I could go back and do that, I would definitely, you know, if I could put together a team of grant writers and that kind of thing, I think we could--we could definitely have done more in terms of impactful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, likewise, today if you look back at everything you've done, what would, today, would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think--I'd like to think my legacy is this whole idea that you can be a scholar, a teacher, a policy analyst, and an activist, and get tenured, and get promotions, and get recognition.  You just don't have to sit in your classroom or in your office and be this boring sociologist.  You can do more and still get the accolades that come with being a sociologist.  I think the fact that, by opening the door and showing that you can publish and you can negotiate a--appointments at historical black college universities [HBCUs] that don't just require you to teach, teach, teach.  Because our black schools, we put too much on our faculty in terms of teaching and don't provide incentives and resources for--to focus more on the research and the policy side.  So I think, you know, what I try to do for first job, as I said before, I negotiated 50 percent and 50 percent research.  I think keeping--you can--that was way back in 1976 [at Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas]; I think you can do that now.  And I think you can provide more in the classroom by having that research, having that publication background that gets your students to understand it's not just, "I'm just telling you, you know, what I read, but I'm also telling you what I wrote and what I know what I've done"; to have the students to see that, that you can do that.  And I think that's very powerful especially for our students of color.  And to have, you know, their professors to be very active in the academy, and with that scholarship and that publication list behind their names.  I think that's very important.
Story_ID: 1834
Speaker 1: Tell us, now, did your parents [Nehemiah and Myrtle Brundidge Bullard] get a chance to see you earn your Ph.D. [in 1976 from University of Iowa], and start your work in sociology?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  My parents did, and they were very proud.  And I'm not sure that my father ever understood what a sociologist did (laughter), but he liked it.  He always liked to brag about "my son, the sociologist with this Ph.," "my son the doctor," you know.  So they were very, very proud.  They were very proud parents.
Speaker 1: You kind of remind me of Dr. Harry Edwards [sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley] actually said the same thing about his father.
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: And I'm sure you know him from Berkeley.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know Harry.  Yeah, from Berkeley. right.
Speaker 1: Now, you have children, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what are your children doing?
Speaker 2: Well, I have three children.  My oldest daughter is in Los Angeles [California].  She's in music production.  My middle daughter is Ph.D. in epidemiologist, and my son, I have one son; he's in graduate school, and he does foreign languages, Latin--he speaks seven different languages.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He graduated from Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia] in--a masters from the University of Arizona [Tucson, Arizona].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, is there anything I haven't asked about that we need to address before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Wow.  We covered a lot (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Story_ID: 1835
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.  Well, I think I'd like to be remembered by the fact that I never--that I never accepted this idea that the environment was this--or this environment and this environmentalism was this white middle-class thing.  That I think my legacy will be that expanding environmentalism and this whole concept of environment beyond wilderness and wild lands, to include where we live, work, play, worship, learn, as well as the physical and natural world.  That's what we've been driving home.  This is the environment, so it's school ground, it's playground, it's houses, it's neighborhoods, it's shopping; you know, it's access to parks, green space, it's having access to supermarkets or having access to community gardens, having access to transit.  So if you look all of my books, you know, "Residential Apartheid [: The American Legacy]," [1994] it's dealing with housing, "Just Transportation [:Dismantling Race and Class Barriers to Mobility]," [1997] "Highway Robbery[: Transportation Racism and New Routes to Equity]," [2004] is dealing with, you know, with transportation.  You know, "Unequaled Protection [:Environmental Justice and Communities of Color]," [1997] "[Confronting] Environmental Racism [:Voices from the Grassroots]," [1999] these are civil rights--you know, we're talking civil rights, human rights.  So bringing all those things together in a holistic way, and not just, you know, stovepipe, you know, not just isolated but pulling together, connecting the dots.  You know, I'd like to be remember as this was a person who connected the dots.
Speaker 1: All right.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Oh, my pleasure.
Speaker 1: Good luck on your work.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Thank you.
