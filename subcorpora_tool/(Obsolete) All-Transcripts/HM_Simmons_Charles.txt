Story_ID: 475771
Speaker 1: All right, we're gonna start by talking about your mother [Estella Williams Simmons] and father [Charles Simmons, Sr.].  And, I wanna know, do you remember your grandparents on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: I remember both parents, both grandparents on my mother's side, yes.
Speaker 1: What was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Ella Williams [Ella Holmes Williams].
Speaker 1: Okay, and your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Julius Williams.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother--I call her Mom because my mother called her Mother so I guess that's why I called my grandmother, Mother.  And I called my grandfather Papa because my mother called him Papa and that's what I, that's what I called him.  And I'd been knowing them, you know, I knew them real well.  My grandpop- father was sort of a comical fellow, and he loved his grandchildren.  My grandmother would always (laughter)--when we did something wrong she would put us in the corner, put our hands between our legs and say we were in jail.  And my fa- grandfather he fished, you know, he was sort of a fisherman.  And we could hear him coming down the road by his boots, his boots made a noise and we would sit in the corner until we heard the boots coming and (laughter) then we'd jump up and meet him.  And then, you know, we were out of jail from then on (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where did your grandparents live?
Speaker 2: My grandparents lived in a place now that is called Broad Creek [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  That's a little plantation right across the road not far from here.
Speaker 1: And what--were they farmers, sharecroppers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were--they weren't sharecroppers, they had their own property and they farmed their own little farm.  And then during the off-farming season my grandfather would fish and, what we call, pick oysters to take to the oyster processing plant.  And there's a little history behind how I got to go to my grand- the first time I ever went to my grandparents' house by myself I rode a horse, and I had to bring the horse to the gate--to the porch then I got on the porch and then got on the horse.  And it was an old horse, you know, and she almost knew the way to my grandmother's house without me having to do anything because the path was just the one path so once you stayed in that path you got to the house.
Speaker 1: How old were you the first time you went there alone?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was about--I'd say it was before I even started school.  I'd say 'bout five, four or five years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know how your grandparents acquired the land that they owned?
Speaker 2: Yes, they bought the land off of sheriff's sale.  What they call land sale.  Her father owned the land, my grandmother's father owned the land and for some reason he couldn't pay the taxes, and they went up on the sheriff's sale and then my grandmother and grandfather bought it off of sheriff's sale.  Course it stayed in the family, they kept a part of it and they give the other part to the brother--to her brother.  'Cause the land was still in, you know, in the family.
Story_ID: 475772
Speaker 1: What do you remember most about your, your [maternal] grandmother [Ella Holmes Williams] and [maternal] grandfather [Julius Williams]?  What type of people were they?  Were they religious people, were--?  Tell me what type of people they were (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, my grandfather died, you know, before I got to know very much about his, his religious life but he was, he was a deacon in the church.  And, of course, my grandmother she was almost, almost a preacher.  She loved her religious activities, attended church regularly.  She took a part in all of the church activities, she was a member of some of the churches auxiliaries.  She was just--she was really a religious person.  She always was the delegate to the association from her church and that was something they looked forward to every year.  And the association is usually held in October, and that's just like they are going to some great big affair.  'Course it was a big affair for them then, you know.
Speaker 1: Did your mo- your grandmother--did she work outside the home?
Speaker 2: No, not that I can remember.
Speaker 1: Are there--I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: She sewed, she, she made dresses and things like that for the ladies.  She made my, my little adopted sister--she made just about all of her clothes and clothes for the people in the community.  And she had one of these old sewing machine that you mashed with your foot, you know, that had a little pedal (laughter).  And I don't know what finally happened to that machine, but you don't see them anymore.  Everything is electricity now, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, what was it like on the farm when you visit- visited there?
Speaker 2: Well, they planted corn mostly and sweet potato, and lima beans, that was--and peas.  Those were the biggest thing that they--and they planted the mostly corn because they used the corn to feed the horse.  That was feed for the horse.  And I don't remember if they had a cow but I know they had a horse--one or two horses.  And they plant mostly corn just to feed the horse and the chicken.  They had chickens so they'd plant their own feed for them.
Speaker 1: Okay, were there any stories about any of their parents or grandparents being in slavery?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't--I don't guess they talked too much about that back in those days.  But, now, my great-grandmother--my father's mother [Elsie Simmons (ph.)] and my grandfather's [Kato Simmons] father came from Charleston [South Carolina].  That's, that's what I was told.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there is a family tree of sort somewhere 'round here.  I don't know where it is, I don't know if I can find it or not (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 475773
Speaker 1: Tell me about your mother.  What was your mother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Estella, Estella Simmons [Estella Williams Simmons].
Speaker 1: Spell that for me, please (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, she was Williams.  E-S-T-E-L-L-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when was she born?
Speaker 2: When?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  That's okay if you can't remember.
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly when she was born.  I could've gotten that information but I can't figure it right offhand.
Speaker 1: That's fine, that's fine.  Where was she born?
Speaker 2: On Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: On Hilton Head, okay.  All right, tell me about your mother.  Tell me the type of--
Speaker 2: I'm an only child.
Speaker 1: Are you?
Speaker 2: So my mother was just--she was a mother and also a sister to me 'cause that's what I called her.  I called her Sister and I called my grandmother [Ella Holmes Williams], Mother.  And, of course, you know all the time I was in school and all the times that I went away I never wrote my dad [Charles Simmons, Sr.] but one time.  I think I wrote him one letter the whole time I was away.  It was always my mother and she would keep little change in my pocket.  You know, I didn't have to worry about being broke all the time.  She was just a sweet person, very sweet.  And all the neighbors, you know, came to her house--they had a little store.  And all the neighbors around they'd come down to the store, especially on Mondays.  They'd all come to the store and be with her, and they would have fun, do whatever they--
Speaker 1: What kind of store was it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Whatever (unclear)--just a little general store.  In fact, it was the only one in this area.
Speaker 1: On Hilton Head?
Speaker 2: On this end of Hilton Head, now, see this is known as Spanish Wells [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the other--they had some other stores but they were in a different, different communities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your mother share any information about, about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she did.
Speaker 1: Tell me some stories?
Speaker 2: She had a sister--it was just the two of them and then of course my grandmother adopted like a little girl, and my mother grew up right here on the island.  She got married to my dad and they had a thriving business, and she stayed here.  And, just like I say, she was just--she was my mother and my sister.  But I got more whipping from her.  My dad has never whipped me, maybe once or twice--maybe two or three times but my mother (laughter) she'd chop me every time, every time I'd turn around I was getting a licking.
Story_ID: 475774
Speaker 1: The last whipping I got, I mean a good one, my mother [Estella Williams Simmons] left home and told me to stay to the house until she got back.  You know, I got my strict instructions: "Don't leave the house until I get back," okay.  As soon as she left, I got on my bicycle and went down to the, to the oyster factory where the leaders, you know, we call them shuck oysters and stuff like that.  And when I got down to the oyster factory I went down on the dock, and when I put brakes on the bicycle it didn't stop and overboard I went.  And everybody in the oyster factory came out there, "Oh, Lord, Estella child drowned."  (Laughter) "Estella child got drowned."  And I, you know, I could swim so when I came up I had my bicycle and I came up right up on the hill and I went on home soaking wet.  And they couldn't get off from work early enough to stop by the store and tell my mother what happened (laughter).  That was the last whipping I got, I mean I got a good one.
Speaker 2: Your mother, when she was growing up though, did she tell you any stories about her time growing up, her and her sisters [Mary Williams and Genevese Williams] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no.  She didn't mention too much about that but I know she had a life, you know, before I can remember but (unclear)--
Speaker 2: How much education did your mother have?
Speaker 1: I think she went as far as the fifth grade I believe.  I think she went to the fifth grade, and my dad [Charles Simmons, Sr.] went to the third grade.
Speaker 2: All right.  And, so owning the store, tell me--it was after your mother and father married that they had the store?
Speaker 1: You know, I was told just the other day that, that my dad had a little store before he got married because--well, now that's gonna go on his side now if you gonna make me elaborate on that.  Now you want to stick with the mother (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's finish up with your mother.  Any other stories you'd like to share about your mother?
Speaker 1: Well, she was a hard worker.  Like I said, you know, they had the little general store, which she ran most of the time.  She took care of that, and she drove trucks.  You know, she could do anything; she worked hard, she didn't, you know, there wasn't anything too hard for her to do.  She--the wagon, she could hitch up the wagon and, you know, drive the wagon and all that.  She was just a hard worker.
Speaker 2: So she would hitch the horses (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She drove, yep, uh-huh.  She drove the bus that took the kids to school, the school bus.  And, at one time, it wasn't really a bus it was just a covered truck but, you know, my dad owned the truck and I guess the county must have contracted him, you know, to take the kids to school.  Because they didn't really have any buses at all, not over here.  Eventually they finally got some buses.  But my mother drove school buses, she drove trucks.  I guess she would have driven a tractor if they'd had one but they didn't have a tractor (laughter).
Story_ID: 475775
Speaker 1: So, now, tell me about your father.  What was your father's name?
Speaker 2: His name was Charles Simmons, Sr.
Speaker 1: Was that E. Simmons?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, the E came in because they all they all used to call him Charlie rather than Charles so that's where the E is Charles E. Simmons, Sr.
Speaker 1: And, okay, do you remember his birthday?
Speaker 2: He was born July the 15, 1905.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You couldn't remember your mother's [Estella Williams Simmons] birthday, could you?
Speaker 2: No, I couldn't--didn't remember hers.  I could get it for you.
Speaker 1: That's fine. Tell me (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I remember my dad's because he died just about a year or so ago, and he was a hundred years old when he died so that's how come I remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about--did you know your grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about your father's mother?  You knew her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Elsie [ph.].
Speaker 1: Elsie?
Speaker 2: I don't know how you'd spell it.  Elsie, E-L-S-I-E or E-L-S--
Speaker 1: Okay, Elsie Simmons. And you didn't know his father's name?
Speaker 2: Kato.
Speaker 1: Say again?
Speaker 2: Kato.
Speaker 1: Kato?
Speaker 2: K-A-T-O.
Speaker 1: Oh, Kato.  Okay, Kato Simmons and Elsie Simmons, all right.  And you say you don't know much about them?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know them at all.  I know--all I know is the names--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --remember the names.
Story_ID: 475776
Speaker 1: Tell me about your siblings?  You sa- oh, I'm sorry, you said you were an only child.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me what was life like growing up as an only child?  Tell me where you lived, what part of town?
Speaker 2: I lived on Spanish Wells [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Spanish Wells.
Speaker 2: Yep, right off of Spanish Wells Road.  And, in fact, it's just a little piece from where I am now.  The spot is still there; the house is not there anymore.
Speaker 1: What was the address, you remember?
Speaker 2: Didn't have any address (laughter).  You didn't have any addresses, you didn't have any paved streets, you didn't have no electricity, you didn't have anything back then.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so tell me what it was like growing up in Spanish Wells (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, growing up, it was an experience and I guess--my dad [Charles Simmons, Sr.] had a lot of cows and horses and hogs, and everything.  And I was the only one so I was very, very friendly to all of my neighbors because those are the fellows that I depended on to come help me, you know, look after the cows and look after the horses and what have you.  And I was telling somebody earlier how cold it got back then.  It was really cold and, of course, I was skinny.  The ditches would freeze over.  In fact, the house, the water and the bucket in the house would freeze so you know that must have been a pretty cold house.  (Laughter) And the water inside, you know, froze.  And we would play on--in the ditches.  The ditches would freeze over and we could play on the ice in the ditches.  And when I got to be school age, my mother [Estella Williams Simmons] wouldn't let me go to school the first year that I was old enough to go because she said I was too skinny, I was too little to go to school with them, with the bigger boys.  (Laughter) Boys'll beat me up.  So, I, I missed a year but--and I would sit on the porch every morning and see the kids going to school, and I wanted to go so bad.  But I finally, finally went, got to where she would let me go.
Story_ID: 475777
Speaker 1: How much land did your family own [on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Oh, back then, or--?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Back then I think we owned about, about thirty, thirty-five acres, maybe more, maybe forty acres.
Speaker 1: And how did they acquire that land?
Speaker 2: Okay, my dad bought quite a bit of it from people who wanted to sell.  And then he got some from sheriff's sale.  People would let their property go up for tax, tax sale and he would, he would--he never went over there to the tax sale.  He would send somebody, he would give them the money and send them over there and ask them to get on it.
Speaker 1: To somebody, like who?
Speaker 2: It might have been a neighbor or a friend that--one of the gentlemen I know that he would send, he passed several years ago, was Mr. James Frazier [ph.] went.  I know he went once.
Speaker 1: How come he didn't go himself?
Speaker 2: He was busy, he didn't have time.
Speaker 1: Oh, he was just busy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was--
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's at this point talk about your father because we have his name, he's Charles E. Sr. [Charles Simmons, Sr.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --tell me about your father?
Speaker 2: Well, my father was a hardworking man.  And I guess that's why I'm--and he accumulated in spite of the fact that he had--only had a third grade education I bet you right now you couldn't out-figure him with a adding machine.  He could sit down and tell you just exactly--I don't care how long the figures are or wide, he could tally it in his head as you, as you go along.  And he's always worked hard.  He ran--I said he had a little store.  They tell me he started off picking oysters for the oyster factory and he had a little store, he sold peanuts and candy and soft drinks and that's how he got started.  And then, 'course, by the time I got up to be some size he had a larger store and he used to take--he had provided transportation between here and Savannah [Georgia] by boat.  He must have had about--he told me about the first boat he had was the, the Lola.  Lola was the first boat.  Had one named the Elsie, he had one named the Jess Eyed [ph.], and the one that I remember that most people remember distinctly was the Edgar Hurst.  That was the boat that he acquired--he had some friends in Savannah I guess.  He knew everybody and everybody knew him, mostly.  And if somebody game him the--let him know that it was a boat that was confiscated--it was what they call a rum-runner, a boat hauls scrap or illegal booze and they confiscated the boat and the fellow told him that the boat was up for sale.  And somehow he made arrangement and he got the Edgar Hurst.  And Edgar Hurst was about a sixty-foot--it was a good size boat, had double twin engines.  And that's, that's when I remember.  And now they--he took--most of the people over here farmed and they plant mostly watermelon for market, watermelon, lima beans, and okra and that's what he would do.  He would take those things to Savannah to the farmers market and--for the people to, you know, to sell them.  And he would make special trips to carry watermelon for Tom Barnwell's [HistoryMaker Thomas Barnwell] granddaddy.  He was a big farmer, Mr. Ben White.  And all those fellows back in those days were big farmers.  And my dad provided the transportation to get their produce to the market.  And like I said, he's always a hard worker.  That's why he couldn't go to the tax sale.  When they were drafting for the [U.S.] military back there during the Second World War [World War II, WWII], he was exempted.  You know, he didn't have to go because he was providing such a valuable service to the, to the island.  And he lived to be a hundred years old.  Died last year, he died in March, April.  Died in April because he would have been--his birthday would have been in July.  I think he died about a month and a half, two months before his actual birthdate.  But he did live to be a hundred.
Story_ID: 475778
Speaker 1: Do you remember a time when there were--they had to have the boat go from Savannah [Georgia] to--from Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] to Savannah.  What about any of the other islands, like Daufuskie [Daufuskie Island, South Carolina] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, when they would leave here they would stop by Daufuskie.  In fact, the people on Daufuskie depended on, on him [Simmons' father, Charles Simmons, Sr.] taking them to Savannah just as much as the people here because they would go--they have to go by Daufuskie to go to Savannah unless you went around Daufuskie and that was not the most meaningful way of traveling.  It's best to just take the inner coastal water and go on to Savannah.  And Daufuskie really depended on him also.  And there were several, several things that he did.  He--there's an article written by--I don't know, Caroline [ph.] wrote that article or Johnny (Unclear), but it's entitled 'Mr. Transportation,' and when he passed, the other day, there was a movement to name this road, Spanish Wells Road, Charles Simmons, Sr. Road.  And that movement is still ongoing, and we probably would have made a little bit more headway or progress with that but the mayor is adamantly against it.  So, that sort of put a clog in the wheel but we haven't given up.  It's a possibility that Spanish Wells Road will still be named after Charles Simmons, Sr.
Story_ID: 475779
Speaker 1: Let's go back to you as a, as a child.  Tell me some of the things that you used to do to pass the time as a young boy.
Speaker 2: Well, now, that's a good question because most of my time was taken--spent working.  See, the old man [Simmons' father, Charles Simmons, Sr.] had accumulated a whole, a whole lot of things and, you know, when you have things you gotta, you gotta take care of them.  You gotta--it's hard work.  If you have anything at all its work.  And like I said, he had all these cows and horses and he farmed.  Where I am now, where I live now he used to farm this whole track, ten acres.  He used to farm it right from the highway--course it wasn't a highway then, it was just a dirt road, all the way back down to the marsh.  And we all used to come and we have to help hoe the field and we had to pull the grass and the weeds and all that stuff out of it.  But I grew up, I went to school here and I finished the sixth grade here on the island [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  And I went over to Penn School [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina] at--in the seventh grade.
Story_ID: 475780
Speaker 1: Before we talk about you going to school, you said that your dad [Charles Simmons, Sr.] had accumulated about forty acres.  What happened to the land?  Is this part of the land where we are now [on Spanish Wells Road, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is part of it, and we still have, we still have, quite a, you know, quite a few acres.  I think the biggest piece that we ever got rid of is the part that they used when they built the Cross Island expressway [Cross Island Parkway].  I think we gave up about--well, we didn't give it up but, yeah, in a sense we did (laughter) about--I forgot how many acres--almost ten acres.  You know the highway department [South Carolina Department of Transportation] gave us something for it but, you know, it wasn't all that.  Course ever since then the property value on Hilton Head has been going up and up and up.  But he, he accumulated quite a bit of property.  (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, how did you come to get this land?
Speaker 2: This was given to me.  This was given to me.  He gave me this.  And this used to be the pasture, farm--this where he did most of his farming right up here.
Speaker 1: And did you have the opportunity to pick the part of land--part of the land that you wanted?
Speaker 2: Yep, I, I chose this piece right here.  And it was another piece we had that we sold some lots to some neighbors.  This was at Broad Creek [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], not too far from where my [maternal] grandmother [Ella Holmes Williams] lived.  We had a piece over in there too.  Then we bought a piece--my dad and I bought some property from a family who had moved to New York and they wanted to sell it, and we had some property right next to it so they give us the first chance, you know, to buy it. There were some other people interested in it but they said they would rather sell it to us since we had some adjoining or adjacent property.  And they sold it to us, I think that was fifteen acres.  That was the last piece that we were able to afford.  Couldn't--(laughter) property went up so high he couldn't buy anymore after that.
Story_ID: 475781
Speaker 1: Now going to school finally your mother [Estella Williams Simmons] I guess got you a little fattened up so that you (laughter) you could go to school.  You were six when you went to school then, or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you went to--what was the name of the elementary school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It might have been seven.  I think back then you had to be six to--
Speaker 1: Oh, to go to school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it came down to five, you know, in recent years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because we didn't have any preschool, you know, back then.  I think I must have been about seven years old before I could get started to school.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the elementary school you went to?
Speaker 2: Spanish Wells Elementary School [ph.].  And it wasn't, you know, it was a prayer house.
Speaker 1: It was a what house?
Speaker 2: Prayer house.
Speaker 1: Prayer house?
Speaker 2: They didn't have a--they didn't build a school over here until--I don't know what year they built a school but I never did go to the school that they built.  We were always going to school either in a prayer house or some building that the public, you know, community building.  But they didn't, but they didn't have a school per se.
Speaker 1: Okay, and can you tell me about the teachers and--?
Speaker 2: Well, my teacher was a Campbell, lived right across the street, Emory's [HistoryMaker Emory Campbell] grandmother taught me in my early, my early days, Ms. Julia Campbell.  And, in fact, she taught me before I started school 'cause she would tell my mother to let me come to her house.  She didn't mind that because I was on the road by myself, there wasn't anybody there that she thought would beat me up or anything like that, but I would walk from, from her house or from our house to Ms. Campbell right across the street and she would, you know, teach me some things.  So when I actually started school I was in pretty good shape because she, in fact, she taught me after I started school.  So she was the teacher, and I was being taught, you know, I guess privately all the time.  But she, you know, she was a very good, very good teacher.  And she was instrumental in getting me over to Penn [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina] because she had some relatives that lived over on St. Helena [St. Helena Island, South Carolina], the Fripps and she was instrumental in getting me over at Penn.  I stayed here through the sixth grade and I started Penn in the seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was back in nineteen forty--'43 [1943].  I graduated from Penn in 1949, and that's where I met Rosa [Rosa Simmons].
Story_ID: 475782
Speaker 1: Now, as a elementary school child, did you have any idea or any dreams about what you would do when you would grow up?
Speaker 2: Maybe not as, in elementary but as time went on I probably decided that--I really wanted to be a doctor.  Okay, I said I was gonna be a doctor and then, of course--I did pretty good in high school [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina], then I got to college I did pretty good too.  But I changed my thought of being a doctor--they said being in school too long.  I thought I'd been in school long enough (laughter) I was ready to get out of there (laughter).  So I pursued a course in economics and business administration--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: South Carolina State [Colored Normal, Industrial, Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University]--
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) in Orangeburg [South Carolina].
Story_ID: 475783
Speaker 1: So, while you were going to high school, did you have any other jobs besides working on your father's [Charles Simmons, Sr.] farm?
Speaker 2: No, but, but at Penn [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina], Penn was, what, a normal, industrial and agricultural school.  And you had to work.  I don't care how much money you had, you know, or how wealthy your parents were, you had to work.  You either work on the farm, you work in the mechanic shop, your work in the carpenter shop, and if you're a lady you either work in the laundry or the better homes or someplace, you know, there was something for everybody to do.  And you worked.  So, in school, no I didn't do anything other than when they would let you come home, and you didn't come home that often from Penn.
Speaker 1: Oh, so it was a school that was away.  Where is Penn, where is it located?  Where was it located (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Across from Beaufort [South Carolina], right on St. Helena.
Speaker 1: It's on St. Helena's Island [St. Helena Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Same place I was telling you about Penn Center a while ago.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It's located on St. Helena.  And we went there in '43 [1943] it was no--we had to catch a boat to get over to the mainland, and I think the first time we went, we went on what they called the Beaufort-Savannah Line.  There was a boat that ran from Savannah [Georgia] to Beaufort, and it stopped at Daufuskie [Daufuskie Island, South Carolina] and it stopped here [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  And we caught that boat and went on to Beaufort, and someone from Penn met us at the boat when we got to Beaufort.  But four of us went together, it was a fellow by the name of Marion White [ph.], Henry Dreesen [ph.], Dogenie Singleton [ph.] and myself.  And out of the four, two of us are still alive the other two died so we make a joke out of that.  You don't know who's gonna be the next, who's gonna be the last one (laughter).  But the Penn School experience was a very, a very, very, very good experience.  Penn School was almost like a military when it comes to discipline and all of that because if you messed up they sent you home.  There was no question asked.
Story_ID: 475784
Speaker 1: What were some of the classes that you enjoyed while you were there?
Speaker 2: I think the best--English and math.  I enjoyed--we had a, we had a class in typing and shorthand I liked that pretty good too, but math and English were my cherished subjects.
Speaker 1: Okay, and was there a teacher or someone there who might have encouraged you or someone that you looked up to?
Speaker 2: Well, to be honest, the person that I really looked up to was Ms. Campbell [Julia Campbell], you know, she had formal training, and, you know, you look at the people and say well, I would like to go to school and be able to teach or be able to do something and just be, just be around and not knowing anything.  But in college, I mean, in, at Penn [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina], at Penn I think there was a math instructor and a science teacher, Mr. Lewis [ph.].  I think Mr. Lewis was the most person that influenced me to, you know, to continue and to not go to school and mess up.  Because if you messed up at Penn, you send you home and if they sent me home I couldn't come home.  If they sent me away from there, I couldn't come home (laughter).  I would have to go someplace else.
Speaker 1: What other activities did they have there?
Speaker 2: They had all kind have activities at Penn.  They had--you have vesper; you have study hall.
Speaker 1: Vesper?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's religious, like prayer meeting or things like that.  Just go and have your little religious service.  They called that vesper.  You had study hall and of course on the weekends you have your little weekends at home activities, social.  And that's when the boys--see, Penn was co-ed.  The girls and the boys then would get together, have a little dance.  Not much of a dance but at least it's something that (laughter), you know, it's something that we did.  But it was a lot of, lot of activities at Penn.  The had a basketball team, I didn't play basketball but I--those were some of the things that, you know, you could, you could do.
Speaker 1: Did you play any sports?
Speaker 2: I played baseball.
Story_ID: 475785
Speaker 1: What about music?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).  I didn't take any music, we had music lessons [at Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina], you know.  Ms. Wright [ph.] would, would teach us how to sing, especially during a certain time of the year like Christmas and Thanksgiving, and all like that.  You'd have these various programs and especially at Christmastime.  And they had a--what they called the--or really was it Christmas, something they had every, every year.  But mostly the adults did those, the teachers did most of those we just--we didn't.  We just--we sang, you know, but they did all the acting.
Speaker 1: What music did you listen to at this time?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll be honest with you, most of the music that we listened to was at night in the dormitory.  And there was a station [WLAC Radio] in Nashville, Tennessee that came on at about eight o'clock at night, called it the 'Randy Record Shop' ['Randy's Record Shop Show'], and that's what we would listen to because they would play all of the, you know, the latest and old time record by [HistoryMaker] B. B. King and (laughter) all them fellows way back there.  Most of those fellows are gone, not but a few of those old fellows left.
Speaker 1: Right, but what were some of the music?
Speaker 2: Now to name some, I don't know if I can
Speaker 1: You can't remember, but, no, but B. B. King, I mean, some of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, B. B. King and Bobby Bland, all those fellows were young fellows back then too.  All of them getting old (laughter).  But we, we mostly listened to radio, you know, it wasn't too much, you know, you didn't have any, any kind of activity.  And we couldn't afford to go down to the club.  There was a club down at the--down the street from the school but you couldn't go there.  You weren't allowed to go and then if you got caught there, then you would get demerits.  So, we had to depend on the radio.
Speaker 1: What other programs did you listen to on the radio?
Speaker 2: There was mostly music.
Speaker 1: Just music?
Speaker 2: Mostly music.
Story_ID: 475786
Speaker 1: So you graduated from Penn [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina] in 1949--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and before you graduated, had you changed your idea about being a doctor, and who helped you decide what college you would go to?
Speaker 2: Well, now, I don't know who actually persuaded me to go to South Carolina State [Colored Normal, Industrial, Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], but norm- basically South Carolina State was the only state school for blacks back then.  And we had--we used--the students that went to State practiced to teach, they did their practice work at Penn.  A group of teachers would come down to Penn ever so often, a group would come now and then a group would come later, you know, one--back and forth.  And, I guess the fact that they came there to do their practice work sort of influenced me to go to Penn too--I mean to go to South Carolina State too (background noise).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you had already had an idea of what it would be like to be away from home.  Tell me about your experience at South Carolina State?
Speaker 2: Well, like you said, going to South Carolina State and being on the campus wasn't anything new to me as far as living in an atmosphere, you know, a campus atmosphere because that's what I did from '43 [1943] to '49 [1949] at Penn.  And the one thing I've always been very careful about and that was to choose who I run around with, my friends.  And by doing that, I didn't get into trouble.  I did that in high school, I did that in college, and the few years I spent in the [U.S. military] service, I did the same thing there.  I sort of sat back and observed.  Now, in college I think we did, did a lot a little things in college we had no business doing but, you know, being (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like what?  You got to tell me--
Speaker 2: --being considered almost grown when you get to college, it's a different story altogether from high school.  You didn't have all the restrictions like they had at Penn.  But we had, we had a nice little group of fellows that we used to go down to the club and drink a few beers and dance and do whatever.  And we would--sometime we would--weekends we would go to Charleston [South Carolina] or we would come to Savannah [Georgia], you know, because after I started back to school I'm in '49 [1949], '50 [1950].  I went in the service in '50 [1950] and when I came back I had a little piece of car so we would, we'd do a lot of traveling.
Story_ID: 475787
Speaker 1: When you were at Penn [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina] and when you were at South Carolina State [Colored Normal, Industrial, Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] and you would come home [to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] what were the holidays like at your house?
Speaker 2: Holidays back then were real holidays.  Holidays now, they're not like back then, see, back then a lot of people were away from home.  And they came home for the holidays and it was almost like a reunion when, you know, somebody would come from New York, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], or wherever, Boston [Massachusetts]--most of our family was in Boston.  They would come home for the holidays.  I'd be coming home from school, you know, and it's like a big reunion.  Now, holidays you don't hardly see anybody come home unless those kids that're off in school.  But the people who are away from home, they don't hardly come home for holidays anymore.  Not like back then.  But, at--'course at Penn that's the only time you could come home.  You only came home Christmas.  Thanksgiving they wouldn't let you come home because that was harvest season and you had to stay there to help harvest the potatoes, and the corn, and whatever else they had to, to harvest (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So at the school they had, had fields?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 475788
Speaker 1: Penn [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina] had--
Speaker 2: Try and explain, explain what it really was like, what it looked like, what was--how did it look so that we can get the idea?
Speaker 1: Penn, as I said earlier, was an industrial, agricultural (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Agricultural. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and normal school.  Penn has hundreds of acres of property right now but they don't farm it like they did back then.  See, they had a boarding department and they grew just about all the food that they served in the boarding department.  The sweet potatoes, the white potato, and the beans, and even the syrup, you know, they'd grind the cane and made syrup.  And they just had a--they plant rice, you know, it was just--and the girls, what we called the harvest week, that's doing the Thanksgiving holiday, instead of letting you come home to spend the holidays at home, you'd stay at Penn and harvest the crops, you know, because come November is harvest, is usually harvest time.  And, you know, we'd get a kick out of that because the girls are in the field along with us so we had fun doing what we was supposed to do.  And the girls enjoyed it too because they get a chance to come out, you know, and be with the fellows.  So, we had, we had a nice time.  But the milk--they had their own dairy.  You know, we were almost like an Amish community I guess (laughter), you know, do our, did our own things.  And that's just like I said, everybody worked.  You had a job.  The fellows who work at the dairy, they had to get up out that bed early in the morning because the fellow who was director of the dairy, he milked the cows.  Very seldom a student milked the cow, then sometime they did.  But that student had to get up in the morning early enough to go down there and process that milk, bottle it and all that, and take it to the, to the dining room.
Speaker 2: What job did you have?
Speaker 1: I had two or three different jobs.  Mostly my job was on the farm, I worked with a fellow who was in charge of the farm.  I drove trucks and tractors, and things like that.  And go with him when he has to go to town to pick up anything from town.  He would take me with him so I could do the driving (laughter) because you know.
Story_ID: 475789
Speaker 1: But Penn [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina] is a, is a wonderful experience.  I'm just so sorry that Penn had to close, you know, because of lack of funds and also the state had to take the responsibility of educating the kids.  See, Penn was a private school, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How did you get selected, I know how you got selected but an average student, how would they get selected to go to Penn.  I mean, you didn't have to pay did you?
Speaker 1: They--have to pay?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Some, you paid some.  And the other, you worked.  That's why, you know, that little work you do, you do get a little credit for that but you sent in an application just like you applied to anyplace else.  And most cases you have to have someone who would recommend you, somebody in the family because we had students from as far away as Connecticut.  And, in fact, one of the students, he was here in October--he came to--November.  He was here to Heritage, Penn Heritage [Penn Heritage Days Celebration]--Monroe Buttle [ph.].  He was from Connecticut.  We had this student from New York, Connecticut, those were the two farthest and the rest, and the rest of course is just around Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] and Bluffton [South Carolina] and Ridgeland [South Carolina], Hardeeville [South Carolina].  We didn't have any student from Ridgeland, we talked about that the other day.  But we had some Hardeeville, Hilton Head, Sheldon [South Carolina], you know, Sheldon and Hardeeville had the more--had more than any other place except St. Helena [St. Helena Island, South Carolina] of course.  And you had to go in the boarding department in the eleventh grade.
Speaker 2: The what department?
Speaker 1: The boarding department.
Speaker 2: Boarding department?
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you lived on the island you can come to school and stay at home and come and catch the bus, and come to school.  But once you got in eleventh grade, you had to stay on campus.  You had to have two years on campus.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  All right, so the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Penn is like I said earlier, I'm so sorry Penn, you know, no longer in existence because some of these unruly people you have now--Penn would, Penn would mold them.  I think would make them better people.
Story_ID: 475790
Speaker 1: We're back to South Carolina State [Colored Normal, Industrial, Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] and so you only stayed there a year before you--
Speaker 2: Went in the service, yeah.
Speaker 1: --went in the service?
Speaker 2: Okay, so tell me about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I stayed there my freshman year and started my sophomore year and then I was drafted.  I could have gotten a deferment because I was taking ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], but I said I wasn't gonna make [U.S.] military a career so I may as well just go on and get this over with and come back and finish my education, and come on home.
Speaker 2: Well, tell me about your military stay (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Military stay was beautiful.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the--I went in the service in October of 1950, I took my training at--we were inducted in, in--at Fort Benning [Georgia]--not Fort Benning, Fort Jackson in Columbia [South Carolina].  And we transferred from there and went to Texas, and I spent the rest of my time at Fort Hood, Texas in an armored division [2nd Armored Division].  And I got to come home [to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] once before I went overseas.  And when we first got to Texas it was in the summertime--and it wasn't all that--'cause it was in October so it wasn't that much of a summer but it was a dry season, because we would see the fellows come off the field look like they had been working in the, in the flour mill or something or lime factory--I mean all white, the shoes were white, the hat white.  It was dry and dusty.  And we didn't know what was going on.  In fact--they were--that's the kind of soil they had.  And when it rained and that thing turned into like a dough, we'd be walking down the, down the street and it was (unclear) it'll stick to your shoes then next step you make that drop off and you (laughter) almost wanna fall.  And were lot of armadillos and skunk, and Texas jack rabbits that high.  But it was nice, I enjoyed it.  Then we went to Germany.  Now that's, that was the saddest day of my whole military career.  We left Galveston, Texas and we board a ship in Galveston, and we got in there that night on a train.  We slept on the train and that morning we got on the ship, and then around ten, eleven o'clock that morning, you know, everybody was on deck and the band was playing and all that stuff.  And when that ship said (making sound) (laughter) tears almost came into my eyes.  I said, oh, Lord, Estella's [Simmons' mother, Estella Williams Simmons] one boy going overseas, don't know whether they gonna make it back or not.  But I enjoyed it, Germany was, wasn't that bad at all.  I had a friend who went to Korea, and I went to Germany and we used to write each other and I wrote him, and I never did hear from him anymore.  I said, I be (unclear)--wonder what happened to Richard [ph.].  And months went by, and the letter finally came back to me and it was stamped on top of stamp.  They were trying to catch up with him, he had gotten hurt in the service.  I would write and tell him say I wanted to come to Korea where he was.  And he would say, "No you don't," (laughter), "you don't wanna come over here.  You better stay in Germany."  And he's home now, he's--he finally came home.  After he came out of the service, he went to New York and so he's home.  So we finally got back together.
Story_ID: 475791
Speaker 1: Well, how were you treated as a black man in the service, what, what arm of the service were you in?
Speaker 2: I was in the 2nd Armored Division, it was an armored division.  We didn't have any--we didn't do too much walking.  We had all vehicles and halftrack tanks.
Speaker 1: Was this the [U.S.] Air Force?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh--
Speaker 1: Army?
Speaker 2: --the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Army, okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, and--
Speaker 1: So how were you treated as a--?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, during that time the arm- the service was segregated.  We was all, all black outfit. And the integration started the same year that I got out.  They had what they call troop transfer--I forgot the term, but that's when Eisenhower [Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] was over the- over in Germany and he came back to run for president and in the meantime the Army was then integrating, you know, the services.  And the rotation--troop rotation is what they call it.  The black fellows would come home and then they would send a group of white troops to replace them in a--what was previous an all-black unit.  But as far as treatment is concerned, we were an armored, armored division so after we got through our basic training, it was all gravy after that.  But everybody go basically through the same basic training.  Then of course after your basic you start your specialize.
Story_ID: 475792
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, we were talking about your, your being in the [U.S.] Army and so in Germany you--I was gonna ask you, was there anything significant that happened while you were in the service?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I tried to learn to ski when I was in Germany and I never did--I could balance myself beautifully.  Where we lived, or where we were stationed was hilly, place called Baumholder, Germany and it was hilly and it snowed--it--cold, cold, cold, cold.  And we would go to the service club and check out these skis and stuff, you know, and, and I could do real good.  And I got a kick out of it but I couldn't stop, I could balance myself good and when time to stop I just sat down.  And before it was all over my fatigue seat was almost as white as that wall just from sliding in the snow and the snow bleached it I guess.  But that's, you know, Germany I think I enjoyed myself in Germany more so than in the states because it was different.  You know, it was, it was something different.
Speaker 1: It was different because it was cold (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was cold, cold, cold, cold.  When we go, when we'd go bivouacking we would have to take--they give each tent a half a bale of hay.  A bale of hay was divided between two tents and then you take half of the bale of hay and you put it on top of the snow and the other fellow gets the other, and you pitch your tent on, over, over the hay.  Of course, you slept fully dressed you couldn't afford to (laughter) undress.  But they would, they would suggest that you take off your socks and if you wanted to sleep on with the socks, you didn't sleep on with the one that you had on all day.  And they said because perspiration the sock might be moist and the moisture might freeze and you get frostbitten foot.  Your feet'll be too cold.  That was one of the safety features.  And I remember once we went to the place to shower, no hot water, temperature outside is almost zero (laughter).  That was another experience for me, so what you did you soap yourself down and rub and rinse yourself off and run back out (laughter).  And (Unclear) was cold, cold, cold.
Speaker 1: All right.  So what did you learn (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But overall I enjoyed the service, it was a good experience.
Speaker 1: Did you learn any other skills that you did not know before going into the service?
Speaker 2: Well, we were headquarters battery so we were charge, in charge of communication.  I learned how to operate the switchboard, the field, the field--what they call the field switchboard, all the communications, wires, ran back to headquarters.  All the other batteries had connects through the headquarters.  So I got to learn how to operate the switchboard.  And we had a field phone that you crank, I learned how to operate that.  And I also learned how to run the wires.  So it was, it was a good experience.
Story_ID: 475793
Speaker 1: So after Germany, what happens?
Speaker 2: Well, after Germany we came back home, we got--we came--we left from Galveston [Texas] and we came back in New York.  It took us fourteen days to go over to Germany and took us about seven days to get back, we came back on a fast ship.  And then we came to Fort Jackson [Columbia, South Carolina], got discharged, came home, and I start making preparation to go back to school.
Speaker 1: So, how old were you when you left to go to--into the [U.S. military] service?  All right, this was 1950.
Speaker 2: It was 1950 and I don't remember, about twenty-five or six somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: So, you come back what year, 19-?
Speaker 2: Fifty-two [1952].
Speaker 1: Fifty-two [1952], all right.  And, so tell me what happens now after you are discharged from the service (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, after I discharged I came home and made preparation to go back to school.  And I stayed here until it was time to go back to school and I couldn't get in a boarding apartment so the--
Speaker 1: This was South Carolina State [Colored Normal, Industrial, Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: South Carolina State--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  I couldn't back in the boarding department, I got--I don't know who recommended, but I got a--I got to stay with a family in town, the Williams [ph.].  And Mr. Williams was one of the instructors at, at State.  And I stayed there--think I stayed there one year.  And the next year I was able to get, get back on the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, at that time they had a quarter that they called it veterans' quarters so I was able to get in the veterans' quarters at State.
Story_ID: 475794
Speaker 1: So, what course of study at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] were you studying?
Speaker 2: Well, regular courses I guess, but I was majoring in--I said--and I changed my mind about the doctor before, before I actually went to State.  And I was just taking all the--took business administration courses, business math, business English, accounting.
Speaker 1: So your major was business administration (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Business administration--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and minor in economics.
Speaker 1: And what were your plans after college?
Speaker 2: Well, I had, I had--my plan was always to come back home [to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  That was always my plan.  When I left to go to college I said, well, when I finish college I was gonna come back home and just join the family because they had a, you know, pretty growing business, business that could afford, you know, to have a decent living.  So I'd just come and join back in, join, join back with family.
Speaker 1: So, tell me about--was there anything, any teachers or anyone in your college days that you, you know, might have looked up to or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Definitely.  There was Mr. Webber, Paul Webber [Paul Webber, Jr.].  He taught economics, and for some reason, you know, he was the person that I sort of looked up to because he owned the--what we call the Soda Shop [College Soda Shop, Orangeburg, South Carolina] down at the corner.  And he finally got a, a used car business.  And Webber was just a likable person.  He refereed the--is it referee, I guess--football game and all that so Webber was just a person that I looked up to.  And we got to know each other personally, you know.  I guess he--I don't know if he knew that I admired him, you know, for, for his activities on the campus or--well, he had two, two children in school there too, Paul, Jr. [sic. HistoryMaker Paul Webber] and I forgot what daughter's name [Carolyn Webber Thomson], but it was a boy and a girl.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any student activities?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was president of the--what they call a commercial club and that was, that was an offspring or offshoot of being a business major.  They had a commercial--what they call a commercial club and I pledged Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] but I never made it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know how it got around but I came back home, I don't know if I had on my little sphinx cap or what it was but just about all the fellows around here are Alphas.  My son [Palmer Simmons] is an Alpha, Emory's [HistoryMaker Emory Campbell] brother is an Alpha, Morris [Morris Campbell].  Quite a few of the neighbors are Alphas.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you graduate in 19-?
Speaker 2: I graduate from college in 1956.
Speaker 1: Okay, with a bachelor--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in business administration (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Business administration.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 475795
Speaker 1: And so now you come back home because your family business is, is thriving.  Tell me about what's going on in this area, Spanish Wells [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], and the Hilton Head Island [South Carolina] at this time.  This is 1956 and the Board of Education, Brown versus the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] has been ruled on and did you see any change in any of the segregation laws?
Speaker 2: Well, see, when they seg- when they started integrating I was getting out of the college atmosphere then so I really don't, you know, have any idea or any feeling, or any experience to say what really happened during that integrating period when they were integrating the schools now, talking about the schools.  But then, far as the community is concerned, when the Civil Right Movement [Civil Rights Movement] 'course that has nothing to do with Brown versus--that's two, two different things in a sense (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, no.  What I was saying these things have happened since you were in college [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] 'cause that happened in '54 [1954], '55 [1955].  You're getting out of college in '56 [1956] but I was just wondering if you saw a change in the community in the schools, but you said you really didn't have any knowledge (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Any connection, no, with the schools.
Speaker 1: --any connection with the schools on this island.
Speaker 2: No, unh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 2: I do know that, you know, when I came up--and this is a story I usually tell, maybe I should have told it earlier but the, the situation here on the island--we had one--and that was a school building for the white kids.  They had a schoolhouse, school building and they only had at one point during the latter years--'cause most of the other white people had already moved off the island or the kids had go- grown and left.  But they had one student, one teacher, one building.  The one building was for the one white student.  And I always make them laugh 'cause, see, Billy's name is Billy, Billy Tooma [ph.].  All his friends and buddies were black and I'd say society dealt him a bad deal.  He's in that classroom all by himself, he can't wait to get back home (laughter), out of school so he can go play with his buddies.  But see, that wasn't his doing, that's the society's, you know, society did that.  And Billy laughs about that thing today.  And I had a couple of interviews before and I usually--I make sure I, I said that before the interviews were over (laughter).  Yes, ma'am (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 475796
Speaker 1: So, now, tell me what's going on on the island when you come back home from college?
Speaker 2: Well, back then in 1956 the island was just beginning to--the first bridge [James F. Byrnes Bridge] opened in 1956.  That was the first bridge, you know, to connect the mainland.  And I remember that distinctly because I finished my courses in college during the first semester and I came home during that period from December or January until June when it was time to, to march with the rest of the class.  And the bridge--when I went back to South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] to get my degree.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: I remember distinctly because the question has been asked several times what year did the bridge to Hilton Head--the first bridge was built, or when it was opened.  And I can remember that it was in 1956, because when I left home to go back to Orangeburg [South Carolina] to get my degree I drove across, I drove across the bridge.  So '56 [1956] is when it was actually, actually opened.  But that was one of the main things that happened, you know, since I came, came home.  The island was--I think it wasn't incorporated then.  I forgot what year the island was incorporated, but I think it's been, what, twenty years since it was incorporated.  And that's when the, that's when the change really came.  Because those of us that lived here, we had our own way of doing things, you know, we didn't have to go get permit for this and license for that and all these other things.  And my dad [Charles Simmons, Sr.], that hurt him to his heart because he was a person that liked to do whatever he wanted to do (laughter).  When he learned that he couldn't do that anymore, you know, he couldn't understand that.  For some reason, he just couldn't understand that.  I said--I called him Bubba [ph.], I said, "Bubba, you can't do that, you have to go down to the town and get approval."  He'd say, "The town don't own my land," you know, and all this type thing.  But that, that was a big impact on the, on the native islanders, people who have been here all of their lives and then find out now that the things they are accustomed to doing, you know, they can't do anymore.
Speaker 1: You mean as--okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Like hunting, you know, people used to go hunting for rabbits and deer and all that stuff.  Right now--and I just learned that here not too long ago, that you can't use a shotgun on Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] anymore to go hunting.  If anybody hear you shooting a shotgun if they report you, the sheriff gonna come look for you.  So I, you know--'course I, I go back there and if I wanna shoot something I shoot it and by time they find out who did it and where he came from I'd be back home (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, even on your own property?
Speaker 2: Even on your own property (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) On your own property.
Speaker 2: And I know fellows used to come over here, some of these little hunting clubs, used to come and hunt bird.  And I haven't seen a quail since I don't know when.  They used to come and hunt quail and deer.  Used to be a lot of deer over here, and it still is.  Quite a few deer are still over here but not like before because if you weren't careful at night you go down the road you'd run in--they'll tear up your car.  But it's not quite that bad anymore.
Story_ID: 475797
Speaker 1: And the roads [on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], of course, they've started paving the roads.  We don't have too many dirt roads anymore but we used to have some awful roads, you know, the poor little cars could hardly make it.  The trucks could pretty good but--
Speaker 2: When did your family--when you were growing up they, they still used horses and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah for certain things they used horses but ever since I could remember my, my dad [Charles Simmons, Sr.] has always had a truck or a car, or a truck and a car, you know, he's always had motor vehicles.  Of course, certain things you have to use your horse and wagon.  For instance, coming on the farm to scatter the fertilizer, you have to put that in the wagon and horse drawn.  And, of course, the plow, they didn't have tractors they plowed with the horse.  And we have had mule, most people had mules but we, we never had--we had one mule and the rest we had were horses, you know, to do the farming with.  And he had a bunch of cows.  He bought cows and sold them, he's always had a bunch of stuff (unclear).
Speaker 2: So what else did you see change now or what began to change even after 1956?
Speaker 1: Well, everything changed.  Everything.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The--you have a town council now, you have a planning commission, you have your LMO [Land Management Ordinance] group and all that stuff, land management ordinance, all that stuff you have and back then you didn't.  You have street signs, you didn't have that before, you know.  I lived on Spanish Wells Road and I live on Spanish Wells Road you have to find out where I am on Spanish Wells Road.  I couldn't give you an address as to where, you know, I lived.  So all those, all those things have changed.  We have marinas wherein before you didn't have marinas, and we have docks just about all over the place.
Speaker 2: Well, you talked about that the white people had started leaving the island where there was only one white child and one teacher and one student, why were they leaving the island?
Speaker 1: Well, I wouldn't say the family, left but those students, the white students who attended that same school, I would say there were probably many as ten maybe at one time but as they finished the school here, they left.  The students now the family didn't leave.  The students left, okay, until they got just down to Billy [Billy Tooma (ph.)] and Billy was the youngest one I guess in the group so Billy was still here.  And the one teacher, you know, who taught those others, she was still there.  And, of course, the building was still there and, like I said, that was the only actually schoolhouse or school building.  The rest of 'em, you know, they had in, in community prayer house or community halls or something like that.  The county would put up some money to put in benches and, you know, things like that.
Story_ID: 475798
Speaker 1: Okay, now we're moving into the civil rights era, tell me about that time?
Speaker 2: You know, most of the civil right activities happened places other than Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  We were al- always integrated on Hilton Head except the school.  That's the only thing that proved to us that, that would give us, you know, a feeling that there was segregation, is the fact that Billy [Billy Tooma (ph.)] went to that one school and the bla- rest of the black kids went, you know, went to different schools.  But as far as getting along--'cause we had everything.  They didn't have anything, you know, they came to our store.  They didn't go to our churches, you know.  We did basically the same things.  And we really didn't--integration or segregation really didn't help us--I mean, didn't bother us I should say because we were in the majority.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the majority of the people that lived on Hilton Head were black--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --and so there were a few white families?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And you were basically like self-sufficient because you all grew your own--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --vegetables and food, and so they came to your stores.  Were there a lot of white farms?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: The only--they might have had their little, you know, private gardens and things but the Honey Horn Plantation [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] was the--they, they did a lot of farming but the only thing they did was plant oats and corn for the cows and the horses.  And, of course, Honey Horn was there from day one.  I remember them back from day one.  And the people who owned Honey Horn lived in New York, they were Thornes--some people called Thorne [Langdon K. Thorne] and Loomis [Alfred L. Loomis].  They owned the plantation, in fact, they owned most of Hilton Head back then.  That's how come when Hilton started growing, what happened some lumber people--timber people came here and bought the timber rights.  Fred Hack [Fred C. Hack] and General Fraser [Charles E. Fraser].  They bought the timber rights and they've had but two or three lumber mills.  And after they bought the timber rights and cut up all the pine trees and made lumber, then I guess they'd made enough money off of the, off of the timber to buy the rest of it.  And they bought what's now Sea Pines [Sea Pines Plantation, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] and all that area, you know, was owned by Thorne and Loomis.  Black people lived there at one time.  They tell me that when we came here that's where we landed 'cause we came from some part of Georgia.  I don't know exactly where but it was some part of Georgia where the black people landed on Hilton Head.  And, of course, that was the closest area to the ocean, so where the boat brought them, brought them in.  And Thorne and Loomis still owned this part of all that 'cause the black people eventually moved over here on this side of Broad Creek [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  Now you probably don't know what Broad Creek is, but on the other side of Broad Creek is where most of the black folks lived.  My grandparents, they all lived over there then eventually they came over here.  They bought property from somebody, I don't know who they bought it from, but there was a white person that had some property and he sold, sold us some property.  And that's when the black people started owning their own land.  They didn't own the land that they stayed on over there.
Speaker 1: In Sea Pines?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, all right.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, after they came over here, that's an interesting story because how did they get--accumulated all the land that they did, you know, have.  I don't know how they, how they really got it.  If they bought it, they had to have bought it from a white person and (shrugs shoulders)--
Speaker 1: And that's it, huh (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 475799
Speaker 1: When you say that you--the city or the island [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] was basically integrated, did you eat in the same restaurants, were you served (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were no restaurants.
Speaker 1: There were no restaurants?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter) everybody ate at home.
Speaker 2: Everybody ate at home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No restaurants, there were no, you know, nothing, just everybody did their own thing.  Of course, now, the blacks had little places that they gathered.  They had what they call a hall, and they would have little parties at the hall, fish fries and all that stuff.  But, it was no public place, like you went to Cracker Barrel [Cracker Barrel Old Country Store] or LongHorn [LongHorn Steakhouse] (laughter), place like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there was no public places that they had to have these signs up that wouldn't allow you to go into (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no.  We did not have a sign that says black or white or black and white.  You didn't--no such thing.  Now when we went to Savannah [Georgia] is where we saw, you know, those signs and things at the buses.
Speaker 1: Can you remember the first time you had any--have you ever had an experience of prejudice or blatant racism?  Can you remember any experience, your first maybe?
Speaker 2: Well, the first I guess would be the bus station in Savannah.  And, of course, even the doctor's office now that's a place where, you know, that they had a, a colored waiting room and a white waiting room.  And the bus station was the same, only thing at the bus station the restrooms at most of those bus stations for black, you know, was, was awful.  Don't seem like they cleaned that part of it at all.  And the other thing is there was a department store called Kresses [S.H. Kress and Company] 'cause I guess Kress (unclear) a chain, I don't know if it is.
Speaker 1: You said Kresslers?
Speaker 2: Kress--
Speaker 1: Oh, Kress.
Speaker 2: K-R-E-S-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they had a lunch counter in the, you know, in the building, in the store and black people were not served at the lunch counter.  You could go in and shop and buy anything you wanted to buy but you couldn't, you couldn't eat at the lunch counter.  Those were the two instances that I can recall.
Story_ID: 475800
Speaker 1: Was there a doctor's office here on the island [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: You had to go to Savannah [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Either Savannah or Beaufort [South Carolina], or Bluffton [South Carolina].  I think they had a doctor's office in Bluffton where he came there two, three times a week.  I think there was a regular office in Hardeeville [South Carolina]--was Savannah, Hardeeville or Beaufort.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't remember when the first doctor came here.  I can remember his name but I don't remember what year he came.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Name was Dr. Goddard [Chet Goddard].
Speaker 1: Spell that?
Speaker 2: Hm?  Goddard (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Goddard, G-O-D-D-A-R-D?
Speaker 2: That sounds close, Goddard.
Speaker 1: And he was--he was white?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any black doctors coming here?
Speaker 2: Not way back then.  We had a black doctor that lived in Savannah, had his office in Savannah.  But he had a place over here on the beach.  Now, I don't think he did any practicing over here per se, but if you knew he was coming, you know, you could go down there (laughter) go down there and see him.  Dr. Collier [Henry Collier, Jr.] 'cause I knew him personally.  We were friends.
Story_ID: 475801
Speaker 1: So we were talking about Dr. Collier was a black doctor that came to Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], but you said he practiced in Savannah [Georgia] but had a home here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah he practiced--yeah, in fact, his father--the Collier family was just about all--most of them were doctors.  One--there was one dentist and the father was a doctor, and Henry, Jr. [Henry Collier, Jr.] was a doctor and they had a son who was a doctor.  But, Henry, he had some property down here on the beach and he would come over periodically like on Wednesdays and weekends.  And like I said, if you had a problem, a medical problem, he would, you know, he would see you.  But even then most of the, the people from here when they did go to the doctor in Savannah, that's who they would go to, Dr. Collier.  And there was one white doctor, Dr. Reuben [ph.].  I remember him, had quite a few of the native islanders went to Dr. Reuben.  But Dr. Reuben, he was just like one of us, he was one of your regular Jew (laughter).  He was just a regular fellow.
Speaker 1: Since there weren't hospitals and doctors here, were there a lot of home remedies that were used.
Speaker 2: Oh, lot of home remedies.
Speaker 1: Can you remember any of them (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And some of the, some of the people use them today.  Yeah, one called life everlasting and the other was, was--can't remember--life everlasting was one.
Speaker 1: What was life everlasting?
Speaker 2: It's a, it's a reed and it grows about so tall and it's gray, when it's ripe it's gray.  An olive leaf, there was the olive leaf and there was, there was another one.  But there were, quite a, quite a few home remedies.
Speaker 1: What did they use life everlasting (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They boil it.
Speaker 1: Boil it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they boil it and it was something like tea I guess.  And they boil it and I guess you have to know when it's done, you know, when it's boiled enough.  And you'd drink it and it, it, I mean, it was good for what ailed you so I don't know (laughter).  And we had, we had a--distant relatives of mine, he died here not too long ago and, you know, he wasn't all together.  He was a little off, but he knew exactly where to find that life everlasting.  Every time you saw him, he had a bottle and he would either give it or sell it to, you know, people who wanted some.
Speaker 1: What were some of the other customs from the island people?
Speaker 2: You know, we didn't have too many customs, not really.  Not that I can remember, you know, not that I can remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had--it was another medicine that I can't think of--but I can't think of it right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because they had medicines that you took, you know, internally, and they had medicine that if your knee hurt you just take it and wrap it around the knee.  But I can't, I can't think of that one.
Story_ID: 475802
Speaker 1: We're in the 1960s here and what about politics on the island, what about voter registration, what's going on with that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the back p- from a political standpoint, we had--we didn't have election on the island.  Somebody would appoint somebody, you know, like the first black person that served on county council [Beaufort County Council] from Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] that I can remember now--I don't know--was David Jones.  I don't know, yeah--was David Jones serving county council and Mr. White [ph.] served on the board of education [Beaufort County Board of Education].  And these people were appointed, they weren't elected.  I don't know if that was because we couldn't vote and they just thought that one black person should be, should be on it.  But I know David was on county council, I think David--we voted for David I think.  But Mr. White was appointed for the county board of education.  And, of course, since voting and voter registration got to be, you know, popular and everybody was insisting that everybody register to vote then that's when the politics really, really came into it.  We had people who would run for various positions.  And even now, voter registration is top of the list.  We still have people who are not concerned, not interested, you know, my one vote is not gonna mean that much.  You know, we still have that mentality and that's bad because you get two or three hundred people saying the same thing that's two or three hundred votes that's not gonna be cast.  And then we have--now we have more black people running for these offices.  When town council [Hilton Head Island Town Council] was formed, the black person that was running, he had no problem getting on there because they had to have at least one black person on the council.  And, of course, until today they don't have but one.  And that one is almost guaranteed a seat because he's in a ward that's predominantly black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  What about the sheriff and the law here in Hilton Head? Was the sheriff appointed also?
Speaker 2: Sheriff, no.  Not now he's not--
Speaker 1: No, no, I'm talking about back then (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Back then?  I think he was, he was elected, although, we probably couldn't vote back then but he was elected or either he was appointed by a council or something like that.  But as far as I can remember, the first sheriff that I remember is Sheriff McTeer [J.E. McTeer] and I don't know if McTeer was elected or appointed, but I know after McTeer they, they, they were, they were elected.
Story_ID: 475803
Speaker 1: So you're working with the family business, tell me about that.  When you come back home and we're now in the '60s [1960s], you're working with your fam-, what business is it that's going on?
Speaker 2: Well, you know like I say, he [Simmons' father, Charles Simmons, Sr.] had the farm, bunch of cows and stuff, he did- we didn't plant too much crop--field crop back then.  The field crops were earlier but he still had the cows and he had the boat running from here to Savannah [Georgia], and he had this--by this time he had two stores.  He had one down here in Spanish Wells [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] and then he had one on 278 [U.S. Route 278].  And, you know, and I worked all of them (laughter), you know.  But most of the time I would--after they discontinued the boat run to Savannah [Georgia] then they started a ferry from what we call Jenkins Island [South Carolina] to Buckingham [Buckingham Landing, South Carolina], it was just a short boat trip.  But then you loaded up on the truck and you took it to Savannah, and I did most of the driving on the truck.  And we had a little bus business operating on the island after the hotels and things started being built and the plantations start being developed, people needed a way to get to and from work.  So we ran a, a bus from all over the island really down to the Sea Pines [Sea Pines Plantation, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] and to the William Hilton Inn [Marriott's Grande Ocean, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], which was the, the hotel down there.
Story_ID: 475804
Speaker 1: Tell me about how the hotels and, and the developers came in and began to, to just build business here and how it affected the natives?
Speaker 2: Well, in a sense it was good because they had a choice between going to work at the hotels or in some of the family homes and farming, so they had a choice whether they wanted to farm or whether--they could still keep their farm, you know, if they wanted to but the ladies, you know, mostly did the work down at the, at the inn [William Hilton Inn; Marriott's Grande Ocean, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] and the private homes.  And, of course, you know it was a choice.  (Unclear) of course that started bring about changes too, you know, from the normal way of doing things.  But it, it was, it was a whole lot better then than it is now because you didn't have all these rules and regulations and all this type thing.  People were more free to do whatever they, you know, felt was best for them than it is now.  'Course the jobs have gotten to be plentiful and right now of course the Mexicans that's the big thing that they're talking about.  Lot of Mexicans came and took all the jobs, which is not true, you know, I guess, that's a copout.  If I'm going to sit under the tree all day and not go try to find a job and the Mexicans come and go and find a job, you didn't take the job from me.  You didn't have one in the first place.  (Laughter) So, you know, but the overall development in some instances it's good and in some instances it's bad.  And it's not so much so the development as it is the government.  You know, the government is the one--is what's putting the burden on the native islanders.  It's not the development (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How is that?
Speaker 2: Because of all the rules and regulations that they've set forth.
Speaker 1: I mean, give me a specific, you know, rule that would be, would be a big burden on them?
Speaker 2: Okay, let me give you the most recent one.  Take for instance we have a family of five, we have a family and there are five members of that family.  Say, you have ten acres of land and you wanna divide that land among the five of you.  Before you can just go and do it, you know, you get your deed drawn up, each person sign the deed and give it to each person and that would be it.  Now, you have to come under what they call a subdivision rules and regulation.  That family would have to divide that property based on the rules and regulation of a subdivision.  You would have to have streets, you would have to set aside a certain amount of land for what they call open space and all that stuff.  And that's gonna cost you because you have to get an engineer to do that, you just can't do it yourself.  You have to have an engineer to plat it and divide it up and all of that, and a surveyor and all--so that's, that puts a burden on the family.  And you take for instance a family can't--they can't afford to do that then the land'll stay heirs' property forever, you know.  So that's one of the latest things that we are working on that now trying to get them to ease up on that.  Whether we will or not I don't know, but we are recommending what we term an overlay district.  And all the native islanders that have property will come under that, that heading of an overlay district.  In fact, we met with the town last week, Thursday I think it was.  Whether they gonna buy it or not now we don't know, but we're gonna insist that something be done other than having to do what they're recommending.
Story_ID: 475805
Speaker 1: What about the fact that some na- you know, some of the natives, natives that own property, once the businesses--the large businesses started coming in and building hotels and developing these plantations, could no longer afford the taxes on their property.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Lot of people have lost a lot of property for taxes and to me now, and I'm going to be honest with you, to me that's, that's negligence on their part.  You don't have to lose your property for taxes.  I don't care how much it is.  First of all, my taxes in the neighborhood of somewhere $10,000 a year, I have to pay for taxes.  I know I can't come up with $10,000 tomorrow if my taxes are due tomorrow, so what I do, I paid my taxes first of this month. And as soon as I get through paying my taxes first of this month I start putting money in the pot for next month.  And I know the taxes are not gonna be any less, so I start saving in advance.  And everybody don't have to pay $10,000 for taxes, you know.  I've known people lost their property for $300, so taxes and I'm sure--I don't know if it's pride or embarrassment or whatever it is but if you have a property tax for $300 and you can't pay, you can almost go to anybody, you know, and say look, I need some help to pay my taxes.  And I think somewhere in the community you'll find if everybody--if one person can't give you $300, one might give you fifty, you know.  But I'm sure you can come up with $300 rather than to see your property go up for sale.
Speaker 1: Well, what about earlier on when people were used to paying a $100, you know, a $130 for their taxes--like they had like twenty-three acres.  I remember watching something on '60 Minutes' where this--I think it was the Gardner [ph.] family who had, you know, this acreage and her taxes were like $130 and then the next year it was $2300 and she couldn't afford to pay that.  Was a lot of that going on where the taxes were actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.  In fact, I think I mentioned somewhere along the line earlier about the 15 acres that we had bought, my dad [Charles Simmons, Sr.] and I.  When we first bought that property the taxes on it were $35 for the whole 15 acres.  Right now that's about 23, 24, $2500 for the same piece of property. But it didn't jump from 35 to 23.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: You see, maybe the next year it was, say two, three hundred dollars then it kept going, kept going, and kept going.  And, and as fast, or as long as these developers come in and develop the property next to you, your property is gonna go up.  The value of it is gonna go up and the taxes are gonna go up on it.
Story_ID: 475806
Speaker 1: Were the people being forced really to, to sell their properties to these developers?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh, nope, nope.
Speaker 1: What about the living here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But the, the--let me tell you about the developers now.  Developers can come and make you an offer and I guess the average one of us are not accustomed to hearing that amount of money, you know.  I'll give you five hundred thousand dollars or I'll give you a million dollars or a million and a half dollars, you know.  Then I'm going to interject this while I remember.  I've done a lot of traveling and I've often wondered why everywhere you go the white man owns everything.  And you know a couple of years ago I found out.  We owned it at one time.  At one time, we owned a lot of these properties where you see the white man is.  278 [U.S. Route 278], Abe sold his [Abe's Native Shrimp House, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], Driessen [Henry Driessen, Jr.] sold his, Singleton sold his [Amoco station].  These people had prime property on 278.  And not just a lot, they had acres.  They sold it.  So now I got my answers three years ago as to what happened why we are not on--in the limelight, why we are not on the main drag.  And nobody took it from them, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So do you think they sold it too cheap or what do you think?  They should have kept it so that there'll be more presence of the natives here?
Speaker 2: Let me tell you one thing.  Most of the properties that, that people my age have now they inherited from their parents or their grandparents or their great-grandparents.  And to me, you know, that's something to cherish.  You just don't go and get rid of it and--because it didn't cost you anything in the first place.  Of course, it cost you the taxes on it for the few years that you been paying the taxes.  They paid the taxes on it--'course what little bit it was, at least they paid it.  And they were in less shape to pay it then even the $35 was hard to come by back then, wherein $3500 for us is not nearly as hard to come by as $35 for them back then.  And they kept it, but they kept it, you know.  So, that's, that's the thing I have--my dad [Charles Simmons, Sr.] struggled and, and accumulated all the property and I'm gonna just sell it because it was given to me or it was left to me.  You know, I wouldn't say that I wouldn't sell any.  You know, I sold--the fellow who sold his property on 278, I sold him a piece of property down there the other day, he bought a lot from me.  But he could afford to pay it because he sold all of his on 278 and got big bucks (laughter), you see.  But, no, I cherish property, I cherish property.  Especially when it was handed down to me from my parents.  If I'd have bought it and sold it, well, that's good.  I bought it and I sold it.  But I have a different feeling when, when it, when it comes the other way.
Story_ID: 475807
Speaker 1: Talking about 278 [U.S. Route 278] and the property on 278, which is like the main drag going right down the middle of the island (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: I remember Singleton Beach [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] that was, that used to be the, the black beach in--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --what used to go on at Singleton Beach?  It was where they had entertainment and clubs, right?  Back in the day (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: You wanna tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, entertainment clubs and of course there was the beach.  You know, you could go swimming and all of that.  And all at once, you know, somebody offered them some money and they sold it.  Now they have condominiums or something down there.  I know it's beautiful down there.  And they've put some expensive houses down there.  And the same thing happened to Burke Beach [Burkes Beach, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], Burke sold that.  He was the most recent one, he sold that.  Now, I think the Hilton--not Hilton, Marriott [Marriott International, Inc.] bought Burke's property and they got all these great big condos and whatever you call 'em down there.  And that's what happens, you know, in years to come all we gonna say is what we used to have, you know.  And it's not there anymore.  And nobody took it.  It used to be said in the papers when Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] first started that the white man came and took all the black people property.  He might--I wouldn't doubt that he didn't take a little bit now he probably took some but, see, 'cause our property weren't surveyed and recorded as it should be.  And when he starts surveying, he might have taken a couple of acres here and there, but the majority of it he did not take, we sold it to them.
Story_ID: 475808
Speaker 1: All right, so what happens now after you're working at home in your father's [Charles Simmons, Sr.], you know, different businesses?  What happens now?
Speaker 2: Well, after I finished--'course I got married before I finished college [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me your wife's name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I came, I came--Rosa [Rosa Simmons].
Speaker 1: And you actually met Rosa at Penn [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: At Penn, yeah.  I met her in the seventh grade in 1943.  And we were just friends as I said earlier, we weren't, you know, sweetheart or anything like that.  I had another girlfriend (laughter). But we were buddies, we were real tight.  I'll be honest, we were real tight.  A couple of girls, you know, we were real tight.  I even give them a trip to Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] when they had to come by boat.  And it was funny thing happened there, we came and the truck broke down and they had to spend the night (laughter), and we had no telephone to notify the parents, you know, that--what had happened.  But we knew the magistrate and we tol- went and told the magistrate what had happened and of course he had contact with the county sheriff department [Beaufort County Sheriff's Office], and he called the sheriff department and explained to them what happened and they sent one of the deputies out to the house to tell the parents what had happened.  But when I came home we got married, and married in '53 [1953].  And I used to live--we all lived, we all lived down with my parents, you know, because it was just the two of them in the house, so we had a fairly good size house so we stayed.  All my kids were born down in their house--had three children.  And we finally built this little place in '59 [1959] I think it was.  I think, yeah.  I think we moved in here in December of '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: In this same house here?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And, we went from there.  Rosa finished school and she started teaching. And she taught in the public schools for thirty years and she retired in '87 [1987].
Story_ID: 475809
Speaker 1: And I retired from the telephone company [Hargray Telephone Company, Inc., Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] in nineteen (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well when did you start working at the telephone company?
Speaker 1: In '78 [1978], '76 [1976], somewhere around there.
Speaker 2: Okay, and what did you do for the phone company?
Speaker 1: I worked in the, in the processing department--what did they call it, central office, called it the CO, central office.  And that's where we processed all the applications for telephone service.  You sent in a service order and we'd hook you up, the switchboard and the frame, and all of the switches in our department.  And before I went to the telephone company, I thought when the phone rang that it, it you know starts right in the phone that, that the process was right in the phone.  That's not true, that ring comes from the central office, from the switches.
Speaker 2: And you worked at the phone company for how long?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I don't even--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: --for thirty year- thirty-five years?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't work the telephone company but eighteen--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --about eighteen years.  But I had age when I got there 'cause I work, I worked couple other places before I went to telephone company.
Story_ID: 475810
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And at '65 [1965]--
Speaker 2: Well, tell me about where, where did you work before phone company [Hargray Telephone Company, Inc., Hilton Head Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 1: I worked for Beaufort-Jasper EOC [Beaufort-Jasper Economic Opportunity Commission].
Speaker 2: Tell me what that is.
Speaker 1: That was a--what they call a OEO [Office of Economic Opportunity] program, poverty program under the Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964], when they had all these community organizations. And they funded lot of programs to help with integration and all that stuff and it was a two-county program, Beaufort [Beaufort County, South Carolina] and Jasper [Jasper County, South Carolina].  And I was director of that for--I think it was six years.
Speaker 2: And what did you accomplish as director of that program?
Speaker 1: Oh, we did, we did a lot of things.  We did a lot of things.  We got community organized and we got people to go to the health department, we got people to go to the department of social services for whatever benefits that they might need.  We trained people to do things, you know, you had was called a mainstream program that trained carpenters.  Yeah, we did a lot of things.
Speaker 2: And so this is the Beaufort-Jasper (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Beaufort-Jasper EOC, Economic Opportunity Commission.
Story_ID: 475811
Speaker 1: And when you left there [Beaufort-Jasper Economic Opportunity Commission]?
Speaker 2: When I left there I went with Sea Pines [Sea Pines Company, Inc., Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] for a little while and I was assigned to Kiawah--you ever heard of Kiawah Island [South Carolina]?
Speaker 1: Kiawah?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: No sir--
Speaker 2: No?
Speaker 1: --how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Whew.  (Laughter) I don't know you just have to make abbreviation until you can find the name somewhere and correct it.  But I worked at Kiawah--I didn't work at Kiawah for about three months.  That's an island just like Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] that Sea Pines had--was instrumental in developing.  Okay, and they were n- Kiawah is close to Johns Island [South Carolina] and Johns Island, of course, is a predominantly black community.  And I think I was sort of a liaison between Johns Island and the Kiawah development.
Story_ID: 475812
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were, you were telling me that you were liaison between Sea Pines [Sea Pines Company, Inc., Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] and what was the name of that the island (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, Kiawah [Kiawah Island, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Kiawah.
Speaker 2: Kiawah, I was liaison between--yeah, well I guess you could say Sea Pines 'cause they were the one doing the developing but I was mainly liaison between the Kiawah people who were there and the community of Johns Island [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: And that was to give them information?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so what, what they were doing, what, what the developers were doing on Kiawah and the opportunities that they would have as far as employment and all this type thing, and I guess I was sort of informing them because eventually what they would want is for someone from Johns Island, you know, to be the liaison between Kiawah and Johns Island.  So I was getting that person prepared to do that.  I only worked there about three months.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: And that was the first time I ever worked away from home.  Kiawah is right next to Charleston [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  And before that Kiawah was just a underdeveloped island--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) something like how Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] was before it was developed?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Let's talk just a little bit about--
Speaker 2: I don't think--I don't know if anybody lived on Kiawah.
Speaker 1: Nobody lived there?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, I don't know for sure.  But if they did, it weren't that many (background noise).
Story_ID: 475813
Speaker 1: Can you let me--give me a little background information on Sea Pines [Sea Pines Plantation, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  I know that it's a private residential community, but these were the people who actually were developing--they helped develop Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] and now Kiawah [Kiawah Island, South Carolina].  Who were some of the people who were a part of this development team?
Speaker 2: Well, it started with Charles Fraser [Charles E. Fraser] and like--it started way back, they were the lumber people, you know, when I told you that they came with the lumber.  They bought the timber right and they cut the timber, and they sold it and I guess they must have made enough money off the timber to, to really buy that part of the island that was undeveloped.  And Charles Fraser--Charles was still in school then too, 'cause Charles and I finished school about the same time.  And he got this idea of developing the part of the island that--what happened there were two sections.  Charles Fraser and his family got Sea Pines [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], that area, that part of the island and Fred Hack [Fred C. Hack] and his family got the north end of the island.  Sea Pines [Sea Pines Company, Inc., Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] and Hilton Head Company [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], this end of the island was known as Hilton Head Company.  And out of Hilton Head Company came Port Royal Plantation [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] and Palmetto Hall [Palmetto Hall Plantation, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] and now it's, it's Main Street and Indigo Run.  But Charles, Charles was the one that really started it the development.  Sea Pines was developed long before the Hilton Head Company and the other areas.  Because what Charles did while he was in school, he recruited some of his schoolmates to come down and join him in doing the development, and just like they do now.  When they start a project they have everybody in place.  They have their attorney, they have their engineer, they have their architect, you know, and everybody give their time and whatever.  And where it would cost me out of my pocket, they have all the expertise right there.  And that's how Sea Pines got developed.  And, of course, he had to sell the idea of selling lots and stuff, you know, he traveled quite a bit and got people committed to buy property in Sea Pines.  And, and that's what--that's how he got started.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the land--they just pur- he purchased the land.  It was underdeveloped but these were just--this was still land that black people owned?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: These were lands that they cut the timber off when they bought the timber right from, from Thorne [Langdon K. Thorne] and Loomis [Alfred L. Loomis], the people that owned the bulk of the island.  And they, they usually--basically used the island just for hunting those people that really owned the bulk of the property.  They would come down during the hunting season and they stayed at Honey Horn [Honey Horn Plantation, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], you hear me mention Honey Horn.  They would stay at Honey Horn, that's where they stayed when they came, you know, to do their hunting and that's all they did, so the land wasn't all that to them because they lived in New York.  But they came here during the hunting season to go hunting.  They hunt deer and birds and things like that, and then of course they bought the timber right and after they bought the timber right and they cut all the timber then they bought the land--
Speaker 1: I gotcha, okay.
Speaker 2: --then they started developing it.
Story_ID: 475814
Speaker 1: So when you leave Kiawah [Kiawah Island, South Carolina] what happens next for you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I came--I started the telephone company [Hargray Telephone Company, Inc., Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay, that's when you went to the telephone company, and you stayed there for eighteen years?
Speaker 2: Until I retired in 1993.
Speaker 1: All right, and now--and tell me now about the, the community activities that you are involved with since your retirement?
Speaker 2: Well, too many.  I'm being honest, in fact, I'm ready to give up some of these things so I can, you know--'cause I've been involved in these things now all just about all my adult life.
Speaker 1: What about Gullah, the Gullah festival and the--all the things that go on in February, the Hilton Head Island Gullah Celebration?
Speaker 2: I'd much rather that Tom [HistoryMaker Thomas Barnwell] or Emory [HistoryMaker Emory Campbell] talk about that, about the Gullah celebration (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Talk about that, okay, that's fine.  Well then tell me about the organizations that you work with?
Speaker 2: Okay, I work with NIBCAA that sponsors the Gullah celebration.
Speaker 1: Tell me what NIBCAA means?
Speaker 2: NIBCAA is Native Island Business and Community Affairs Association.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what does that organization do?
Speaker 2: I don't have a brochure of the Gullah--you have a brochure of the Gullah celebration?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, good.  That's the organization that sponsors the Gullah celebration and they have a whole month of activities, and the activities are usually held on the weekends so that you can get better participation.  And those people who, who take a part, you know, can be off from work and all that.  But it's a very--it has grown over the years and it starts the first of February.  The first program they have--if I'm correct--is the national--like I said, I better let them other fellows talk about that (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, yeah, I mean no that, that's fine, but why did this organization think that the Gullah festival was important?
Speaker 2: You know--I'm sure you know that in recent years Gullah has been talked about extensively.  And, in fact, [U.S.] Congress just passed a bill here about a month ago, month or two ago for the Gullah overlay district, I think it starts North Carolina and go down to Florida or Georgia.  I don't know if it goes all the way to Florida or not but I know--and, of course, Representative Clyburn [HistoryMaker James Clyburn] introduced that bill and it was passed. And some monies are being made available to--for certain areas and certain organizations to sort of (unclear) or direct that project in each--each area is gonna have a, an organization that's gonna be responsible to carry out a program in that Gullah overlay district.
Story_ID: 475815
Speaker 1: And like I said, Gullah has gotten to be popular you know in the last four or five years.
Speaker 2: What does Gullah mean to you?
Speaker 1: Well, Gullah means people who speak like me (laughter), you know, before--and I'll be honest--before the Gullah came into being or came to be, you know, prominent, Geechee was, you know, we were called Geechees.  I don't know if they would call you Geechee up in Ridgeland [South Carolina] or not, but I know everybody down in the Sea Islands, Beaufort [South Carolina], St. Helena [St. Helena Island, South Carolina], Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], Daufuskie [Daufuskie Island, South Carolina] and, of course back up Charleston [South Carolina] way, yeah.  We were all known as Geechees, but then Geechee was not a culture.  Seem like Gullah is really the culture so now to sort of tie it in sometime it's referred to as Gullah-Geechee and other times it's just referred to as Gullah.  So I, you know, that's as much as I know about it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.  Now--
Speaker 1: And of course, you know, I think it came all the way from Africa from what I gather, the Gullah culture or Gullah language came, came from Africa.
Story_ID: 475816
Speaker 1: What other organizations are you involved in?
Speaker 2: I mentioned NIBCAA [Native Island Business and Community Affairs Association], I'm on the board at NIBCAA, I am president of the Spanish Wells-Jonesville Property Owners Association.  Spanish Wells-Jonesville you're in Spanish Wells [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] now, Jonesville [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] is further up the road.
Speaker 1: Property Owners Association?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Native I- Native I- Native Island Property Owners Association.
Speaker 1: Native Island, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause all of us, you know, we were just--all the members are native islanders.  And I am on the board of directors at Penn Center [St. Helena Island, South Carolina], I'm a member of the Penn Club [Penn Club, Inc.], I'm a deacon in the church.
Speaker 1: And what church is that?
Speaker 2: First African Baptist Church [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: How long have you been attending your church?
Speaker 2: Ever since I can remember (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Well, let me put it like this, I don't know if that gonna give you an idea or not.  I went to Penn School [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina] in '43 [1943] and I was already--I was a big boy then.  'Cause I had my driver's license and all in '43 [1943] and I was already baptized so it was back in the early '40s [1940s] or late '30s [1930s] that I baptized, joined the church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Any other organizations (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm president and manager of the Simmons Family Holding, LLC.
Speaker 1: And that's for, for property that you own?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 475817
Speaker 1: What are your concerns for the African American community at large?
Speaker 2: Our young men, you know, I wish I knew.  If I had a form- a formula, you know, to deal with that problem 'cause it's, it's a problem.  It's a serious problem, you know, especially if you listen to the news in Savannah [Georgia].  Every morning we are killing each others, every morning you listen to the news somebody got shot, somebody got killed, sometime two or three.  In Savannah.  'Course it's not as bad as it used to be, used to be worse than that, but my concern right now is our young black male.  And the thing about it, I don't see where it's getting any better, you know, we're a happy-go-lucky people, we don't care what happens.  You know, some of 'em probably don't even know that Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] incorporated.  They don't even know that we have a mayor, you know, and a county council--I mean a town council [Hilton Head Island Town Council].  All these things, you know, that tells me what about the future.  What's gonna happen, you know, when the few of us who are here and concerned and trying, you know, make things better for everybody--and you have a meeting, you can't get them to attend.  It's, it's bad.  But, you know, I have a thing about that too, you know, that didn't just happen.  That happened way back here, if you didn't train that child down here, don't wait 'til he gets up here it's just too late.  We are not parenting like we should and that's--maybe need to have a parent workshop or something.  And, of course, that's my biggest concern right now.  That and black property, black landowners.  Are we getting rid--selling our land and some of 'em are even moving off the island going to Bluffton [South Carolina] and Ridgeland [South Carolina] and Hardeeville [South Carolina], you know.  It's just a matter of time really, you not gonna be too many black property owners on Hilton Head, few of us.  Then when I'm gone I have a son, he gonna mortgage everything and not gonna be able to pay for it.  They gonna take his (unclear) (laughter).  I shouldn't say that on the record (laughter).  I really shouldn't but anyway.  I'm afraid, you know, that's, that's what gonna happen--
Story_ID: 475818
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, what one thing stands out the most for you?
Speaker 2: The one thing that stands out most for me is the accomplishment of my family, and I'm talking about the accomplishment of my mother [Estella Williams Simmons] and father [Charles Simmons, Sr.] not so much me, because they worked hard with what little education they had.  They, they accomplished quite a bit.  And, of course, I look back and see that I could've been, you know, a drug addict, I could've been out in the streets, and I give the good Lord thanks for that.  And most of the time when you find a, a child that, you know, come of through the ranks not wanting for anything, have everything at hand and all that mostly they go astray, you know.  And I thank the good Lord that I didn't go astray that far.  I give the good Lord thanks for that and my parents because I respected them and I loved them.  Like I said earlier, when I was in school if they sent me away from Penn School [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina], I couldn't come home [to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] because it would have been an embarrassment to them.  You know, so you have something that's inside that sort of make you do halfway right.
Story_ID: 475819
Speaker 1: How do you wanna be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).  I don't know.  Most people--no, not now, back then they used to--most people called me Little Charlie [HistoryMaker Charles E. Simmons] because my dad [Charles Simmons, Sr.] was Big Charlie.  He wasn't a big fellow by a longshot (laughter) but he was Charlie, you know.  And I just--remember me, remember me as Little Charlie.
Story_ID: 475820
Speaker 1: This information about your life is going to be housed in an archive where people of future generations will be able to see, what message would you send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: I don't know, that's a good question.  That's a very good question, and I don't know if I have an answer but I would like to see the future generation change their attitude toward life and try to make something of themselves rather than just go be a happy-go-lucky, you know, get a decent job, good education.  'Course good education gonna come first.  If you don't get the good education, you not gonna get a decent job and--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would just like to see our young people get a little bit more serious about life, more serious about their surroundings, more serious about their families and things like that, and the community as a whole.  Because if you don't--first of all if you don't get an education, you're not gonna be able to afford a lifestyle that you could probably be pleased with then that leads to other things.  If you don't get a decent job, it's gonna lead to something else, you know.  And that's--maybe that's our big problem now because most of the kids or the young people that get involved in crimes and all that, these are mostly the ones that drop out of school--don't want a, don't want a job and then they're not satisfied so they just do anything that come to their mind.
Story_ID: 475821
Speaker 1: Well, speaking about the future generation, you told me that you had three children?

Speaker 1: All right, want tell me their names and date--
Speaker 2: Charlesetta [Charlesetta Simmons Aiken].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Charlesetta?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, she's the oldest one, that's why she's named Charlesetta (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there's Palmer [Palmer Simmons].
Speaker 1: What does Charlesetta do?
