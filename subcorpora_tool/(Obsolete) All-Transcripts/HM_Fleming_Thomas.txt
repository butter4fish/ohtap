Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Favorite what?
Speaker 1: Time of year?
Speaker 2: Well, here, here in, in San Francisco [California], look like the, the changes aren't so pronounced as they are in other parts of the world because it never gets real cold here in San Francisco, and I've become, I guess, conditioned to the, the fog here and the wind.  And I don't like to leave San Francisco in the summer time because I, I think it's a tourist--it's one of the favorite places for tourist in the United States because it's cool here because of the fog.
Speaker 1: Do you like spring, summer or fall or winter?
Speaker 2: I don't care much about that snow because when I was kid, I lived in Harlem [New York].  And my, although I would ride, riding the sleighs and everything, but my feet always stayed cold all the time.  I'd much rather be here in San Francisco where you don't get any snow (laughs).

Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, no?  As a newspaper man, you don't have one?
Speaker 2: I'm just curious about the news.
Story_ID: 7075
Speaker 1: Give your mother's name and if you know, what--about her background?
Speaker 2: My mother's name, maiden name was Mary Golee Jackson.  She was born in Montgomery, Alabama, I think 1887.  She apparently came to Florida cause that's where she met my father [Thomas Courtney Fleming, Sr.] 'cause they were married in Jacksonville, Florida.  And she came to California in 1912.  There was a divorce, and my mother came to California and brought my sister [Kate Fleming], who was just two years old, with her.  And, of course, I was, I think I was about five and it wasn't quite clear to me what happened.  But I, I think my grandmother [Phoebe Fleming] hid me, my father's mother because I was the first, her first grandchild, and a boy--she didn't have much use for girl babies.  And so Granny died about five years later, and my father took me up to New York City.  How he got--took me up to New York City is unusual.  I was a stowaway at the age of seven.  At that time, the--the main ways that people traveled in the United States then was on water or on rail.  There wasn't any airlines, you know, or no buses either.  There were, a steamship company operated, operating out of New York that came to Jacksonville, Florida called the Clyde Line [Clyde Steamship Co.].  My father knew a lot of members of the, of the steward department on all of those ships, and he arranged for them to bring me up, up to New York, because when my grandmother died, my mother's oldest brother was in Jacksonville.  So I went to live with him for a while.  So my father had my uncle to bring me down there to meet one of those ships one day.  A porter met us out there and told us, then took in, into the crew's headquarters, said, "You stay in here and don't come out until the ship clears the harbor."  Well, I did what I was told.  So I went on up to New York.  Well, I think it was overnight from New York--the ship stopped at Charleston also, Charleston, South Carolina.  And that's the first time and last time I, I met our cousin there, Sam Fleming, cause my father let him knew the day I was coming through there.  So Sam came down to the ship to see me.  So we cleared Charleston and got in New York the next afternoon, and my father met me there.  And, of course, I wasn't expecting to see all what I saw 'cause it was quite a contrast to Jacksonville (laughs).  They were riding the Els [elevated trains] still, the elevator still in, in New York, but, of course, the subways was there, and then that's where I first saw those buses where, where the, where the passengers rode up on top.
Speaker 1: (break in tape)
Speaker 2: You were saying New York was different, and it was a surprise.
Speaker 1: Well, it was (laughs).  I'd never seen anything like that before because you couldn't--there was nothing in Jacksonville like, like New York because it was all these little brownstones and, and other houses--the architecture, you know is all together different, because I didn't see any, any places in New York, when I got there where you had front yards and back yards in.  And I know when I got up to Harlem [New York] where I live, you could run across the rooftops a whole block (laughs) and come, come when it run, it run out on the street and come on right upstairs, and go across the rooftops and come out next to--and come downstairs at the next corner.  And when my father enrolled me in school, though, he, he placed me in--women with homes up there where people like him had children.  And he paid them weekly to keep me there.  And, of course, they enrolled me in school, and I enrolled at P.S. 89 [New York City Public School #89].  Now, that was, that school was located at 135th [Street] and Lenox Avenue, that school was located there.  And that's where I went to school.  And you know who was going to school there then?  Thomas 'Fats' Waller (laughs).  He was enrolled at P.S. 89 'cause, why I remember it so well, between classes everybody followed Fats around the hallways there, yeah, asking him questions and everything.  And that, that memory never left cause he was very wisecracking then.  Well, he was eleven or twelve years old then.  And, and I thought--we all always thought he was remarkable.  Well, I guess it was pretty remarkable because he was playing the pipe organ in every--every weekend at the old Lincoln Theater on 135th Street.  And I was in New York all through World War I.  My father got a job as a cook on a small ship that operated between New Haven, Connecticut and New York City.  And that ship went to New Haven, up there just to load on ammunition and bring it down there.  And they would put it on the transports going over to France, to Europe.  And I saw--there were so many things that you saw in New York then 'cause I--they had parades quite frequently.  You'd see contingents of French troops marching in those parades, British troops and French troops from, from Africa.  They brought them over, over there when they had their Liberty Bond drives.  And then another thing, I used to see in parade there on 7th Avenue was Marcus Garvey.  He'd be riding in, in a car with a soft top.  They'd fold the top back, and he always had that, remember he always had that admiral's hat on his head.  And I didn't understand what it was all, what, what it was all about then, but also they would parade down 7th Avenue 'cause we also saw--I saw the 369th [Infantry regiment, also known as the 'Harlem Hellfighters'] when they marched down 5th Avenue going to France.  And I remember my dad took me to a meeting one, one night there--one evening there on a hundred and thirty-fifth street, where [President Theodore] 'Teddy' Roosevelt spoke.  And I saw--I didn't quite understand what it was all about then 'cause I was around nine or ten years old.  But I, I knew I went there to hear him talk.  So I stayed in New York all through the war, and my father got married again, and, of course, me and my stepmother didn't get along because she wanted to strap me, and I knew that she wasn't my mother.  So she and I used to have contests there in the house.  So she would talk to my father, and my father got tired of being bothered, and, of course, my mother--he corresponded all the time with my mother.  And he agreed that they would--he would send me back to Jacksonville.  Then my mother would send a ticket to Jacksonville for me to come to California.  That was in 1919.
Story_ID: 7076
Speaker 1: I came back to Florida the same way I went up there [to Harlem, New York in 1915], as a stowaway.  And my uncle [William 'Bud' Jackson] met me down there in Jacksonville [Florida].  I stayed there about a month, and my mother [Mary Golee Jackson] sent a ticket for me to come to California.  When my father [Thomas Courtney Fleming, Sr.] came down there from New York cause he and my mother corresponded, and he gave me a five dollar bill and they gave me one of those wicker baskets with sandwiches in it.  And, of course, I started buying candy and stuff right away from the butcher on train.  And overnight, from Jacksonville, we landed in New Orleans [Louisiana] the next day.  Well, when--by the next day those, those sandwiches was hard, and I had spent about two dollars of that five dollars buying soda water and candy on the, from the butcher on the train.  So the conductor took me to the big depot in New Orleans, and they pinned my ticket on the lapel of my jacket.  And they told me to sit there all day, told me they were Travelers Aid [International].  They fed me, and then saw that I got on the train at night.  It, it was a train to California.  And so they loaded me on that evening and took off, and it looked to me--I was eleven then, it looked like to me the train was never gonna get out of Texas (laughs).  And I didn't realize what Texas was even then.  So I think it, it was, it was two nights anyway cause we left New Orleans in the evening, then all day all through Texas and then all night the next night.  And then we got in Los Angeles [California] I think the, the aft--next morning.  And so that's as far as that train went.  So they put, took me off in Los Angeles, and Travelers Aid took over again and took me to the station in Los Angeles.  And I took a train out that evening.  It was headed for Portland, Oregon, and that's why they put me on it cause Chico [California] is north of Sacramento [California].  It's about a hundred miles north of Sacramento in the Sacramento Valley.  And that's where my mother was.  And when it got to Sacramento, that train left in the evening and got to Sacramento the next, next day, they took me off there cause that train didn't go through Chico.  It went on the west side of the Sacramento River, through Willows [California] going north to Portland.  Chico was on the east side of the Sacramento River.  So same procedure, when I was--Travelers Aid took over and took me to the depot in Sacramento.  So Travelers Aid asked me if my mother had a phone number in, in Chico.  And I said, "I don't know."  She, she says, "What's the address?"  When I gave her the address, she looked in the phone book because Chico, Marysville [California], and all those towns was in the Sacramento phone directory in that.  They didn't have their own directories.  So she looked and found my mother's name, then called and told her I'd be in Chico at 11:30 that night.  So a train came--that train used to leave Oakland [California] every evening, it was called the Senator, and the end of the line was Chico.  That train came through and I, they put me on there.  And it got in Chico at 11:30 that night.  My mother was there at the depot.  And so the conductor said, "Sonny, you've come a long ways," says, "This is the end of the line for you."  And so the conductor helped me to get to the, to the door, and down on the ground my mother was waiting.  I hadn't--I had forgotten what she looked like cause I hadn't seen her since I was five years--I was eleven years old then.  And so she says, "Thomas?"  I said, "Yes."  She says--she grabbed me and hugged me, and I tried to pull away.  So she says, she slapped me up, on the side of my head and said, "I'm your mother boy, what's wrong with you" (laughs).  I'm--it's okay now.  So I went home, and, and she didn't bring my sister down to the depot, but Katie didn't, didn't go to sleep.  So Mama brought me home.  I met my sister for the first time.  I'm--there're eighteen months difference between--I'm the oldest of two, but at last her brother.  She saw her brother then.
Speaker 2: So what did she think when she saw you?
Speaker 1: Well, I think we started arguing first about who, who was the boss (laughs).  She was testing me I think, but I didn't want to be bothered with her 'cause she was a girl, at that age, and she pestered me all the time.  But we got along fine.  She's the finest person I've--well, she and my mother were the two best friends I ever had in my life.
Speaker 2: So you were, so this is--you came to San Francisco [California] then, and that's where you stayed?
Speaker 1: I stayed in Chico, and I finished high school up there cause that's the first thing my mother did the next day is take and enroll me in school.  And I, I finished high school in 1926.  That's when I first came to the [San Francisco] Bay Area because there wasn't very much to do up there in, for blacks up there in the Sacramento Valley.  Most of the men, they were either janitors or boot--they had boot blacks there, and the women were domestics naturally.  And then, of course, you could harvest the crops.  You know, that's one of the, one of the rich agricultural areas in California.  While I was growing up, I helped to harvest prunes, peaches, almonds, oranges, and olives.  And in the summertime, you could make enough, enough money so Mama could buy, you know, buy my school clothes and everything, which helped out a lot.  And then I did odd jobs up there, washing windows and, and when I was a teenager, washing windows in small shops up there, polishing people's--in their homes, their hardwood floors.  And it was a man named Hadwick Thompson, lived over in, in Willows, California.  That's about twenty-seven miles west of Chico.  They grew nothing but rice down there in that area.  And he was one of the only rice farmers.  He had a hundred of his own acres up there that he grew rice up there.  And they used to shop in Chico, Chico because his wife's oldest sister lived in Chico.  There wasn't no big store in, in Willows, California, but there was one in Chico 'cause Chico is a much larger town.  So Hadwick Thompson told me when I was about sixteen, he says, "You ought to get ready to leave here," says "There's nothing up here for you to do," 'cause, see, Hadwick could, could talk that way.  He had gone to Davis.  That was, that was what they called the University of California College of Agriculture then.  But it's the University of California at Davis [California] now.  But he had gone to school there.  So when I, when I reached, when I finished high school, I decided I would come down here because my mother and sister wanted to get away from there too.  So we all--they came before I did that summer.  I came a little later, got a job when I came down here as a bellhop on the Admiral Line [Southern Pacific Railroad], as a bellhop.
Story_ID: 7077
Speaker 1: I want to go back and ask you more about your father.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about him?  And also, I, you know, his growing up and what you know of him.  I'm specifically interested in your grandmother, Phoebe [Fleming].
Speaker 2: Well, Phoebe ruled the house.  I can tell you that 'cause I, I remember that my father's sister lived there also.  She had a daughter named Lillian.  I think Lillian and I were about the same age.  And the reason, one of the reasons I said earlier that my mother [Mary Golee Jackson] didn't like girl babies, I could hit Lillian and Grandma wouldn't do anything.  But if Lillian hit me, Grandma would spank her.  And that was wrong, but I didn't realize that then.  And, and my father and, and his sister, Aunt Catherine, they didn't get along well cause Catherine had Lillian out of wedlock and, and that was a disgrace to my father, and he never did get over that.  And he used to bully my aunt a lot.  I realized that later on 'cause--and my father wasn't such a nice person anyway.  When he put me on the train there in Jacksonville [Florida] to come out to California, he wrote one letter after I got out here, with ten dollars and addressed the letter to me.  So my mother said, "This ten dollars is for Katie [Fleming] too."  And I didn't hear from my father anymore until I was thirty-three years old.  I didn't know whether he was living or dead.  And he showed up when I was thirty-three, came out of--I always that he probably thought that we were doing well out here in California, and he wanted to see.  We, he knew we were grown then anyway.  And he showed up.  And there isn't very much I can tell you about him.
Speaker 1: Well, sir, can you give me his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Thomas Courtney Fleming, but he always used Courtney.  But my mother said, I was, she always told me I was Thomas Fleming Courtney, Jr., [Thomas Courtney Fleming, Jr.] but he always used Courtney.
Speaker 1: And what kind of person do you think he was, sir?  You said he wasn't a very nice person, but what kind of person was he?
Speaker 2: That's the only thing I could say.  He shrank his duties as a father.  He married again.  He had a daughter.  And that, when he showed, he sent for, sent for our half sister.  She was eighteen years then.  Well, that's what infuriated my whole sister so much.  He kept in touch with her.  He ignored us, at all.
Speaker 1: Now, the other is, you said that, in something I read that Phoebe was born a slave, your grandmother, you think was born a slave?
Speaker 2: She could have been.  I think she was born in, in Georgia cause I knew she took me to Thomasville, Georgia once when I was small by train.  And that's where--my great grandmother was still alive when she, she took me there.  And, and the rest of my grandmother's family was still living on a big farm in Thomasville, Georgia.  So my father was, he wasn't around to give me all this information when I was growing up, I just have to assume that's where she came from.
Speaker 1: Now, do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No.  I--apparently, my mother came from Montgomery [Alabama] because Uncle 'Bud' [Jackson], that's her oldest brother, lived there.  Her youngest brother, Joe lived there, her two sisters Sarah and Katie lived there also, although Katie and Sarah went up to Detroit [Michigan].  They lived up there.  They didn't stay in Jacksonville [Florida] too long.
Story_ID: 7078
Speaker 1: When you go back, sir, and it either can be in Jacksonville [Florida] or it can be in Harlem [New York] or it could be here.  I mean it can be in Chico [California].  But I'd like to ask you a question about what sights, smells or sounds remind you of your childhood?  And I was wondering if you could describe?
Speaker 2: I think New York City influenced more than any place else because of all of those people there and people from--well, at that time, in East Harlem there were a lot of Jews living over there too and quite a few Italians.  And the--just, just New York City made such an impression on me, I never did forget it.  And even today, I think it's the most impressive city I've ever been in.  There's only one other city that I, I think I would like as well as I did, do New York, and that's Paris [France].  It remind me more of New York, more than London [England] does, more than Berlin [Germany], more than Moscow [Russia].
Story_ID: 7079
Speaker 1: In New York, you were talking about your school.  What, it was PS, what three--?
Speaker 2: P.S. 89 [New York City Public School # 89].
Speaker 1: 89, okay.  And you talk about, you know, that [Thomas] 'Fats' Waller was there, and he was sort of an, you know--and, well, he was a, you said, he was a loud mouth or you, he--?
Speaker 2: Wisecrack.
Speaker 1: Wisecracker, that's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right,  wisecracker.
Story_ID: 7080
Speaker 1: Was there anything that in--you know, that influenced you during that time at school and, 'cause you're, you went there when you were five and you left when you were eleven or twelve?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So I'm just wondering during that period, what other things happened, do you have memories of?
Speaker 2: Well, we used to be up there in the [Morningside] Heights [New York, New York] with sleds up above the Morningside--Riverside Drive sleigh down, and, and I, I remember when we'd--well, I, I started reading, I think--when I learned to read cause my father [Thomas Courtney Fleming, Sr.] came down one night.  And we were still in Jacksonville [Florida], and he used to buy those paperback books he read.  It was a series called 'Nick Carter' about a detective.  He came home one night, and I was reading it.  And he says, "You read that?"  I said, "Yes."  And so when I--I learned that I could go and get books out of the library when I got up to New York.  I didn't hear of anything like that in Florida.  I went and got a card at the, at that branch library on 135th Street.  I used to draw books out of there, and if they didn't have them, I'd go downtown on Fifth, on Fifth Avenue to the main library and get the book.  And I guess I've always been a--every since I learned to read, I've always read a great, a lot because I, I bought a, a set of ['Encyclopedia] Britannicas' once, when I was--become an adult.  And I, and I joined a little history, joined a history book club, and I, I was with that, oh, for about, about eight years.  And I, I, I got a big library at home.  That, that's one of the reasons why I can't get anybody in there cause I, (laughs) I got all those book stands in there.  And, and then I subscribed 'Atlantic [Monthly'], 'Harper's [Magazine'], natural history, well--the 'National Geographic' for a while, over about eight years.  And, and I got a lot of little films that I, I put on, on my video, particularly, animals.  I, I, I'm very much interested in wild life, all forms of animal life.  And, and, and then I read 'The New York Times' everyday, the 'Oakland Tribune' every day and the 'San Francisco Chronicle' and the ['San Francisco] Examiner' before the 'Examiner' changed hands.  But the state of newspapers throughout the nation, I think it's in bad shape 'cause I think television is killing, gradually killing all the newspapers.  That's my opinion.
Speaker 1: Now, when you--was there anything else--well, let me ask you.  When you first start reading, do you remember when that was and how?  Was that in school or was it outside of school?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: When did you did you first start reading?  What age were you?
Speaker 2: I must have been about, about six years old.  I was in Jacksonville.  I was reading those, those books that my father read.
Speaker 1: And, okay, what--did you have any favorite books that you read?
Speaker 2: I think my trend was towards history, whether it was fiction or not because you learned a lot more.  People that do fictional history, they do a lot of research work, and they find a lot of things that you don't get in the history books.  And, and most, most of the books I got at home is not fiction.  It's all about social affairs.  That's what it is.  All of them are.
Story_ID: 7081
Speaker 1: Why didn't you ever get married, oh, oh?
Speaker 2: Nobody wanted me.
Speaker 1: Oh, I can't believe that.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) I was always on the move.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then for a long time, 'til my mother [Mary Golee Jackson] died, I was her chief support too.  That, that--Mama came first with me.
Story_ID: 7082
Speaker 1: Jacksonville, Florida, I had read something about, you know, Jacksonville and Vaudeville and black entertainers.  Do you have any background or knowledge of that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I know that James Weldon Johnson came from Jacksonville and A. Philip Randolph came from Jacksonville, and I heard that later on.  And I didn't know anything about them when I was a child living there.
Speaker 1: Now, when you get to, you know, when you first see your--oh, no, I want to ask a couple of more questions before I get back, to Chico [California].  What kind of child would you say you were, sir?
Speaker 2: What sort of child I was? I guess just ordinary.  I--of course, you know, when I came to Chico, there was only about sixty-five blacks in a town that about 12,000 people in it.  And most of the kids I ran around with were white and Chinese 'cause--there's something I want to remind you.  Every little town in California then, when I came here in 1919 had a Chinatown.  Chico had one, one block long, and that's all.  But it was a Chinatown, 'cause they were segregated.  I didn't quite understand that really well then at that time, the reason why.  And, and they did, and, and there was one woman there.  She's named Mrs. Chung Hai.  She was the biggest bootlegger in Chico (laughs).  She was always being arrested, and she had six sons.  And two of those sons ran around with me, and there was one black kid that I went with all the time, Henry Heriford.  And there were about four white kids that went.  That was our crowd.  And, 'cause I remember Mrs. Chung Hai, she would jump on me and Henry too (laughs), if we were caught doing something with her boys.  She would, she would jump on us, and then she'd tell our mothers about it.  And I, and I've always--I guess I became accustomed to not recognizing, I guess you could say not recognizing race because I, I look at all people as just being people.  That's all.  I, I, I think that term race--well, it causes a lot of, a lot of, I think, unnecessary social unrest.
Story_ID: 7083
Speaker 1: I've never been a religious person cause I look at that mess over there now.  Both the Jews and Arabs are Semites according to what the anthropologist said, it's just one religion.  You go in Ireland.  The Catholics don't like the Protestants.  None of that makes sense to me, and they all say they worship one God.  So I have never bothered about joining any church.  There's only one man I, I admire--there're two, in religion, that was Howard Thurman and Cecil Williams here with Glide Memorial Church [San Francisco, California].  They're the only two.  I think that act--what I think, in the way of Christ that I haven't seen in any others.
Story_ID: 7084
Speaker 1: When you arrived to Chico [California], can you talk about--you've talked some about the community, but what was that community like, sort of, Chico?  What was the--?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, largely, sort of agricultural center.  You could say that.  That was the principal industry around there because you there were large rice fields outside of town too, where they grew a lot of rice.  One of the, the principal ranches up there was the, the Phelan Ranch.  He had ten thousand acres.  It was named after a man named James Phelan.  He was a one-time mayor of San Francisco [California] and a United States senator from here.  There's an office building here [San Francisco], a tall office building, built, oh, I guess prior to 1910, it's named after him.  And it's still down on Market Street.  What reminds--why I remembered him so well, when Langston Hughes came out here--he came out here and stayed for a while.  And that was the first time I heard who [Fulgencio] Batista was 'cause at that time the big bands didn't play on this side.  They played over in Oakland [California] at Sweet's Ballroom, one night for whites, one night for blacks.  Well, the Jimmie Lunceford [Orchestra] band was playing over this night and Mason Robeson came over, over there, and I, I ran into him, had this little short guy with him.  So he said, "Have you met Lang?"  I said, "Lang who?"  He said, "Langston, Langston Hughes."  I said, "Oh."  So shook hands with him.  He'd just came from Cuba.  And we started talking.  That's the first time I heard that Batista was a black man, the man that [Fidel] Castro chased out of Cuba.  Langston told me then, and I found him to be an interesting fellow 'cause in--at that time, blacks couldn't stay in the big hotels here in San Francisco.  San Francisco hasn't always been this way.  Noel Sullivan and his sister inherited all of Senator Phelan's estate 'cause he never did marry.  Well, in that, that estate, not only this big mansion here on Telegraph Hill [San Francisco], but a big mansion out at Carmel [By-The-Sea, California], plus the Phelan Building here, the 10,000 acre ranch right out of Chico, another 10,000 ranch south of Chico down in Gridley [California], both along the Sacramento River.  Well, Sullivan wanted to an artist, a singer.  He had no voice, but he had a lot of money, and he liked to be around talented people.  When Marian Anderson came here, Paul Robeson and--what was the black male singer in that time? Famous.
Speaker 1: I don't know. What year was this?
Speaker 2: I can't remember, but it, they used to come out here, promoters would bring them here, bring them out here for concerts.  Where they stayed up there was at Noel Sullivan's house.  They couldn't stay in the big hotels here.  Sullivan had that big mansion up there.  And when Langston was here, I went up there 'cause Langston was having parties up there (laughs).  And I met Sullivan up there, and he said--I said, "I used to hunt and fish on your property up there at Chico."  He said, "You did?"  He said, I said, "Yeah."  He says, "My man, Murphy is a good"--I said, "I know Murphy."  I said, "That's how I was able to get over there to hunt and fish on that property."  Well, as I said, San Francisco has never been the city like it is now because these people couldn't stay--and, you know, these are artists; they couldn't stay in the hotels here in San Francisco.  And, and if a black came here as a traveler, if he was male, he, he could stay at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  Woman, I don't know what she did.  But if you didn't have friends here where you could rent a room in, you were out of luck.
Story_ID: 7085
Speaker 1: Now, I go back--I want to go back to Chico [California].  You said Chico was mainly a farming community?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. And now, you lived there from, you said, twelve--eleven or twelve--?
Speaker 2: I came there in 1919, and I left there in 1926.
Speaker 1: During that time, you said, you know, you met, you know, your friends--there were four, four or five of you that were, you know, were--Chinese--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --another black.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah.  One other black and the rest were white boys.
Speaker 1: Okay, and there was no, no racial issue between--?
Speaker 2: It was, there, there were places up there where you couldn't eat, soda fountains.  I just didn't go in there.  And I didn't let it bother me, bother me too much.  I went in places where you, you could be served.  But they, they--it was all over the state then.
Speaker 1: And did--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) There, there wasn't a black teacher in San Francisco [California], at the time I'm talking about.  Oakland [California] had one.
Speaker 1: Did your Chinese friends, are there things that you learned about their culture at that time--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Hum?
Speaker 1: Your Chinese friends.
Speaker 2: A little, a little.  I--I noticed they, they ate differently than we did.  And they're different 'cause I know at their funerals, I remember an old man, Chung Hai died, they used to call him the Mayor of Chinatown 'cause I guess he had more money than the rest of the Chinese up there.  So when they had the funeral for him, it was a big thing.  I remember Mrs. Chung Hai put a twenty dollar bill on there, to pay his way up to heaven.  So Henry [Heriford] and I went out there with, with the two sons.  So we snatched that twenty dollars (laughs), and it wasn't far from what they called the, the jungles, where the cemetery was there.  The hobos where they--them hobos came over and ate all that food.  And every Memorial Day after that, when Hong would go out there, we'd go out there with him, he'd put that money in there, and take it up and put it back in his pocket 'cause he knew we were gonna take it.  That's one thing I learned, and, and a lot of their customs--well, they were, they weren't--well, they isolated themselves there, and maybe they were discriminated against 'cause they knew they weren't welcome.  And, and as I said, you found a small Chinatown in every town in every town in California.  They're much larger in Oakland [California], San Francisco and Los Angeles [California], much larger; the bigger the town, the more Chinese you found.
Story_ID: 7086
Speaker 1: This was a nice time for you and sort of, you--this was the first time you're getting to know your mother [Mary Golee Jackson], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what did you find out about her, since you had not really known her?
Speaker 2: Well, I tell you this.  I found I was home at last.  I felt very comfortable (laughs).  It didn't take me long to learn, I knew I was with mama.
Speaker 1: And what did--did she call you Tom or did she have a nickname for you?
Speaker 2: She called me Tom or called Thomas.  And she said, son, sometimes, but I know she was very quick with her hands coming up along side of my head.  And if I got fresh saying something, I'd pick my spot.  I wasn't close to her 'cause she was only four feet, eleven inches tall (laughs), but she was a mighty little woman.  And she worked all of her life to educate me and my sister because I remember when I finished grammar school, my stepfather said, it's time for me to go to work.  She said, "He's going to high school."
Speaker 1: Now, did you--what other things can you talk about, just a few things about you and your sister [Kate Fleming] growing up with your mother, you know, Chico, any other stories you want to share?
Speaker 2: Well, I learned--she did let me know that she was my equal.  I wasn't gonna boss her around.  I respected that from the time that I first tried them pools, that I'm the oldest, and you got to, you got to do what I say.  I never tried that again.  I learned to respect it.  If she would find out that--I found out she was the best friend outside my mother, I ever had in my life.
Story_ID: 7087
Speaker 1: So in school, were there things--what school did you--what high school did you go to, sir?
Speaker 2: Chico High [School, Chico, California], there was only one high school there then.  I think there're two or three up there now though.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how many blacks did you say were in the school?
Speaker 2: My sister [Kate Fleming] and I and Ted Johnson were the only ones in high school, and Cornelia Edwards came in later.  That was all.  The rest of them dropped out, and I--they dropped out before they finished high school even.
Speaker 1: And what was the black community in Chico like?  What was it like?
Speaker 2: It wasn't much of a community.  There were only about, about sixty blacks there of all ages and, and sexes.
Story_ID: 7088
Speaker 1: Now, when you finished, you say you got a job on the--is it railroad?
Speaker 2: The first summer on the boats.
Speaker 1: Okay, on the boats, but what summer was that?  Was that the summer--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Summer of '26 [1926].
Speaker 1: After graduation?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, you get a job on the boats.  Where are the boats taking you?
Speaker 2: It was coastwide steaming.  As I explained to you, the way, traveled, traveled mostly then, was either on the water or on the rails because you the same sort of shipping on the Atlantic [Ocean] coast.  So those coastwide steamers, they didn't go over to Europe or Asia.  Along the Pacific [Ocean] was the same thing, big ships, just like those ships that went to, to Europe and Asia, big passenger ships.  They got, they got the same service of those who went on a trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific ships then.
Speaker 1: And what did you think of working on the ship?  What was that like?
Speaker 2: Well, to me it was a job then.  And, and it was interesting.  As I said, we bought, always bought booze when we stopped in Victoria [British Columbia, Canada].  We didn't make a stop in Vancouver [British Columbia, Canada].  We stopped in Victoria, when you first come to Puget Sound, and we--the waiters and, and, and the porters and the bellhops bought, 'cause you could buy liquor in Canada.  You couldn't buy it here in the United States.  And we sold it to the, to the passengers.
Speaker 1: Now, after--how long did you do that, and how long were--?
Speaker 2: Just one summer I worked on the boat.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) One summer. And then you went to work for--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Went to work for the railroads the next summer.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so you decide to move to San Francisco [California], and your whole family--your mother and--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I didn't move over there until '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Oh, '45 [1945].  Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: That's when my mother [Mary Golee Jackson] died.  That's when I moved over on that side.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  So, but you're still living in Chico [California] and you decide to work for the railroad?
Speaker 2: No, living in Oakland [California].
Speaker 1: Oakland! You know what?
Speaker 2: 'Cause the commissaries are in Oakland.
Speaker 1: I keep thinking--you know, I know Oakland and San Francisco are different--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but you know, outside, sometimes you refer to them as the same.  I'm sorry, sir.  So you move to Oakland, all of you, right?
Speaker 2: We originally moved to Oakland, when all of us came down here.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Right. So what street were you living on in Oakland?
Speaker 2: Well, it was then--Oakland first, down on Eighth Street, then, then to Berkeley [California] afterwards.
Speaker 1: And, now, how did Oakland differ from, from Chico?
Speaker 2: Bigger city, a lot of blacks there.  The black population was really in Oakland.  It wasn't over here [San Francisco].  There was about 12,000 blacks living in Oakland and Berkeley together.  As a matter of fact, there were more blacks living in Berkeley than there were in San Francisco until World War II.
Speaker 1: Now, when you start working on the train, what route were you going?  Were you working--?
Speaker 2: The first, the first train that I worked on was the San Joaquin Flyer.  That ran down through the [San Joaquin] Valley from Oakland to Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: And then where did you work after that?
Speaker 2: The next, next line, line I worked, I think, it was on the Cascades.  That was from Oakland to Portland, Oregon.  Then the next one I got, line I got on, was the Overland Limited.  That was from Oakland to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: And what did you like about--did you like--that was just a job or did you like things about it.  Like you were talking about, I think with Scott [Stearns, videographer], that you had been, you were--were you cooking on this?
Speaker 2: I got to, I got up to be second cook before I left.  I started out as a dishwasher first.  But the chef cook liked me, and he knew that, that the fourth--the third cook was, was gonna get promoted soon to second cook.  So after about three trips as fourth--as dishwasher, I became third cook.  And--.
Speaker 1: And so what did you like about that experience, about working on the train and?
Speaker 2: Well, at first I was young and excited I was traveling.  But then I started wondering to myself, do I want to do this the rest of my life too?  And I had a cousin who had graduated from high school over here [San Francisco].  I didn't mention that to you.  One of my mother's brothers enlisted in the Army in the Spanish-American War.  They shipped him to the Philippines.  He went in that army that went to the Philippines, my Uncle Tom.  When the war was over, he came back here.  And he was demobilized in San Francisco, and he decided he didn't want to go back to Montgomery, Alabama so he stayed here.  Well, his son was--he went back down there later on, Uncle, after work, and married his wife, to Montgomery and brought her out here.  His son was born here, I think the next year after I came in the world.  My cousin, Tom, he graduated from Lick-Wilmerding High School [San Francisco, California] and entered Cal [University of California at Berkeley] in, in '26 [1926], the year he graduated high school.  Well, I started, I started thinking about, I'd like to do that also.
Speaker 1: Do what he was he was doing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 7089
Speaker 1: I thought it was better to go to college than just drop out of school altogether then because I worked for six years before I went back to school.
Speaker 2: Now, what did your mother [Mary Golee Jackson] think of that, you going back to school?
Speaker 1: Well, she and Katie [Fleming], started first, well, well, who's gonna take care of you?  And I told them, I says, "I'm gonna work my way through.  I don't expect you all to do anything for me."  'Cause see, her, her stepmother lived in Chico [California].  And that's how my mother happened to come to Chico.  That uncle [Uncle Tom] I told you about in San Francisco, Granny came out here with a wealthy white family.  She was the maid, with them from Montgomery [Alabama].  They took her up to New York first, then to Honolulu [Hawaii].  Well, Uncle Tom was living here.  She knew that her stepson was living here so she called him.  And he persuaded her then not to go back down to Montgomery with these people.  So she stayed.  So she went up to Sacramento [California].  My, my step-grandmother got a job cooking for the governor of California, George Pardee was the governor of California then.  So she lived in Sacramento.  And an old man named Peter Powers came down to Sacramento, black, owned a lot of property up there.  He came down to Sacramento looking for a wife.  He married her.  That's how she went up to Chico.  So she kept in touch with, with Mama all the time.  That's how Mama happened to come to Chico.  Granny sent for her to come to Chico.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that's how she got there in the first place?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: But she had a--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Granny, but Granny--not Granny your paternal grandmother?
Speaker 1: She, no, she was my mother's stepmother.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, that's how--because I was wondering how she got out here, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so did you mother work as a domestic too?
Speaker 1: Whatever she else could do?  She was black in a little town like Chico. And she had no, no trade or profession.
Speaker 2: Right, so when you tell your mother and your sister you want to go to college, they were--what were they saying?
Speaker 1: Well, I overheard them one night.  My room was next to door to theirs.  They were just talking loud enough, maybe they wanted me to hear.  How's he gonna take care of himself?  Now, I got out there, I said, "Listen, I said, you all don't have to do anything.  You just wish me well."  I said, "I know what I have to do."  I said, "I don't expect you to help me at all."  And I knew that I had a bed to sleep in, in Chico and that's one of the main reasons, there was a four-year school up there then [Chico State College, now California State University, Chico].  Granny was still living.  I knew I had a place where I would sleep.  And I felt that I--enough people knew, that still, still knew me there, I could go find odd jobs, which is the way it turned out to be.
Story_ID: 7090
Speaker 1: Where do you go to school?
Speaker 2: In '32 [1932].
Speaker 1: But where?
Speaker 2: Chico [California], Chico State [College, now California State University, Chico].
Speaker 1: Chico State, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it was--and that's with the time, how long had California started to have the state, state school system policy?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I told you before there were seven of them, and they were called state normal schools, teachers training, that's all.  But you got--you know, there's about twenty-five of them now.  And I think I told you, incidentally, that [University of California at] Santa Barbara was one of those seven too.
Speaker 1: Now, why did they establish that?  Was it because there were a lot of people--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Population was growing.
Speaker 1: And so are you thinking that you want to be a teacher at that point?
Speaker 2: I didn't really know what I wanted to be (laughs).  But I knew I liked to write because I used to write for the high school paper at Chico High [School, Chico, California].  And how I met Billy [Senator William] Knowland, my mother and sister worked Billy--Bill Knowland.  He hired them both in 1930 for fifty dollars a months for the two of them, and they stayed on the place, twenty-five dollars apiece a month.  That's how I happened to meet him.  I used to go out there some time to see them.  They lived over in Alameda [California] because he had a lot of good booze out there, and I used to sneak some drinks.  And I could always get a meal back there in the kitchen with them too.  And I met him.
Speaker 1: And what did you think of him when you met him?
Speaker 2: He was an honest man just like Senator [Robert] Taft of Ohio.  But they were both out of steps with the times.  They were both arch conservatives, but he was a decent man.  He was honest.  That's all I could say about him.  And they thought that they were being good to blacks because that paper, the 'Oakland Tribune' is still over there.  That was the only daily paper out on the West Coast that hired a black on the editorial staff.  That was--what was her name now?  She wrote a weekly column that they called "Activities Among Negroes".  I don't know how she got that job, but old Joe [Joseph] Knowland, the old man, liked her.  That's how she got that job.  But all she wrote about is about what black women clubs did over there and the black church did.  But I had, you know, I was out--when she died, I was out of school then--I had to drop out.  And I knew the, the Senator, and I asked him, "I'd like to have that job", you know, get more writing experience, because I had not only wrote for the high school paper in Chico, I wrote for the college paper at Chico State ['The Collegian'] also.  And so he gave it to me, but the black women over there thought it should go to a black woman, so they kept bothering the, the Knowlands so they just discontinued it all together.  I had it for about, about two months.  And that's the only time I ever wrote for a white daily paper.
Speaker 1: Sir, I want to go back to when you went, went to Chico.  So you leave, you leave Oakland--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with your mother and sister, and you move to Chico to go to school?
Speaker 2: No, my--I went up there alone.  My mother and sister didn't go up there when I went up there.  Grandmother--Granny was still in Chico.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh, so you went back and stayed with Granny?
Speaker 2: Alone, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, with Granny, okay, that's what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I took a couple of guys up there with me.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you like--what, did you like the college experience?  Were you happy with it?
Speaker 2: Oh, I liked it very much.  The prof in economics, his, his uncle was the one-time president of Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut].  And, and this is the first time any black males had gone to school when I came up there and brought these two guys with me.  And then there's a black girl that I knew, came from Oroville [California] then, and she entered then.  So there were four blacks--we were the, we weren't the first blacks that went there 'cause one woman came there when I was going to grammar school from Red Bluff [California] when it was a state normal school and went to school there.
Speaker 1: And how long was the schooling, was it two or four years?
Speaker 2: It was four years--now it was two years when Irma Williams was going there, two years, just, just teachers training.  You know the state normal schools.
Speaker 1: So now, you, so you finish.  What do you, what do you do at that point in time, sir?
Speaker 2: What did I do?
Speaker 1: Yeah, after you graduated?
Speaker 2: I didn't graduate.  I went, I went--I never did get a diploma.
Speaker 1: Now, but, you know, you were saying you were working on the Chico--I mean Chico State, the college, the newspaper?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wasn't--well, there were other students.  We were on a staff there.  There wasn't no pay there.
Speaker 1: No, I know that.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: But did you--what did you learn about at that time?  Did you like it?  Was it different from the paper you had worked with at, worked at in high school?
Speaker 2: About the same thing.  All I was writing was a humor column in both papers, that's all.
Speaker 1: You were writing the humor column, huh?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what, the jokes or things like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I was poking fun at the--some members of the faculty and some of the students about the things that they were doing around there.  And everybody, it looked like everybody was looking forward to it.
Speaker 1: And you were good at--'cause that takes a special talent to be able to do that, right?
Speaker 2: I don't know whether it did or not.  I just started doing it.  The editor of the high school paper, the 'Red and Gold' at Chico [High School], asked me to write a column one time.  So I did, so he liked it.  He was a student like I was, so I just continued doing it.
Story_ID: 7091
Speaker 1: When Ruth [Love]--when the announcement came out that she was gonna take that job [superintendent of Oakland, California Public Schools], he says, "If you can stop her," he says, "The people don't want her here."
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: "They have somebody else they want here." But I couldn't do anything about it. But Ishmael [Flory] called me at the paper office, because he knew me, you know.
Speaker 2: But you know, she became a celebrity in Chicago [Illinois] for a while.
Speaker 1: Well, she became a celebrity here. Number one, she was black. And she was superintendent of schools over there in Oakland. Oakland isn't a small town--it's a middle-sized town. And she's full of baloney. She knows--she knows how to talk about Ruth.
Speaker 2: (laughs) Okay so, sir, let me go back. Can we go back a little?
Speaker 1: 'Cause--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously)What do you want to say?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Go on, do you want to say something else?
Speaker 1: I know when she that job teaching as superintendent [of Oakland, California schools] back there, I know [Carlton] Goodlett was sending her money every week, 'cause I was signing the damn checks that was going back to her. I know that. And she tried to steal the paper ['San Francisco Sun-Reporter'], which they--Goodlett would've sold it to her. And Goodlett's son came out there and saw that she had signed Goodlett's paper or some phony contract. He went downtown, called--he got a lawyer and the lawyer told--called up and said, "Get out of the paper office immediately." She didn't say another word, 'cause she knew she'd been caught. She doesn't speak to me when she sees me. 'Cause Gary Goodlett had got a lawyer to come there and put her out, and she knows I know that. And when I asked Goodlett about her, you know, she'd grate on us, Dr. Love, still--I said, "Where'd she get her doctorate?" He says, "American International" [sic, United States International University, now Alliant International University, San Diego, California]. I said, "Where the hell is that?" He says, "In San Diego." I said, "Well, that's one of them damn correspondence schools, isn't it?" (Laughs).
Speaker 2: (Laughs) So, we're gonna go back, okay. You're not a fan of Ruth Love is what, right?
Speaker 1: Nope!
Speaker 2: No (laughs).
Speaker 1: Because she told Goodlett when she got here to cut my pay! And I started the damn paper!
Story_ID: 7092
Speaker 1: Tell the story about how you became a political science major.
Speaker 2: Well, I liked to read newspapers for one thing, and I liked to talk politics.  And I always try to keep myself well informed cause as I told you that first morning I got in Chicago [Illinois], the first thing I did was bought the ['Chicago] Tribune' and read it, bought it in the Northwestern station.  And I saw in there that Duke Ellington was playing at the Oriental Theater.  So I said, this I must see cause he had never been up here to Northern California yet.  And I went there and sat through three shows that day.  And, well, I enjoyed the writing I was doing in school because it looked like newspaper people are a little bit ahead of everybody else about what's, what's going on around them.  And I found that to be true because I, I covered all beats here, just with the weekly paper because I went by the, the pressroom everywhere, in the public buildings where they had pressrooms here in the [San Francisco] Bay Area, and I became well acquainted with all the members of the press.  And, and, and newspapermen, most of them always seemed so well informed about what was going on around them.  And I, I wanted to be well informed too.  'Cause as I told you about the all the reading I've done.  So I think that did it more than anything else, just a curious mind, I suppose.  I, I would have to say that.  I like to read about what people are doing and why did they do it in many instances.
Speaker 1: Now, but that's what I--so how did you get started in the--and how did you take on political science?  You said your mother [Mary Golee Jackson] was working, and your sister--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Well--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Your mother and--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I liked that better than I did econ or sociology. I liked to study about government I, I guess more than anything--maybe that had more to do with it than anything else. Because I used to--I heard a man named Oscar McFarland started a, a store on Seventh Street over there in Oakland [California].  And he sold all of the, like 'The Crisis' and 'Opportunities' and all those different, and all--everyone of the black daily papers that came--was shipped out here, then he had them out on his newsstand on Seventh Street.  And I used to go in there and buy, them, the Westerns story magazines, from him.  That was my--so he told me one day, he said, "Tom, you got too good a mind to be reading that trash."  So he talked me into, into--I started, I started buying 'The American Mercury' and I found out I loved H. L. Mencken.  He used to have me roaring, laughing out loud.  And there was another one called 'Common Sense' (unclear), put, edited by George Seldes and then I started reading the 'Atlantic [Monthly'] and 'Harpers [Magazine'] too at that time. And, and I think that had a do with--it was the, the type of reading I was doing also.  So I wanted to be better informed about what people were doing.  I guess that's the reason why.  And so that's, that's the course I took.
Story_ID: 7093
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite journalist that you, you know, paid attention to or newspapers of the time?
Speaker 2: I used to read Arthur Brisbane every day.  He and Willie [William Randolph] Hearst used to go around plotting the future of America.  I remember Brisbane was editor-in-chief of all the Hearst papers, you know.  And he had a column on the front page of, I think the 'Chicago American', the ['San Francisco] Examiner' here [San Francisco, California] and the ['Los Angeles] Examiner' in the Los Angeles [California] and the 'New York American'.  And he and Willie Hearst used to travel around--I call him Willie cause he was born here (laughs).  And he was always was a spoiled brat all of his life.  So I remember that, Hearst--Brisbane used to fascinate me about how he predicted, predicted that one day California would have a population of 30 million.  I thought he was loony for saying those things.  And, and he's--all the other predictions he was making, what's gonna happen to America.  And, and I--well, Brisbane liked the money that Hearst was paying him.  I, I don't think he thought like Hearst, but he liked that bill--big salary he was getting.  And that's what I've heard other journal--newspapermen say about him.  He liked the money.  They said that he knew better to be write, writing a lot of that rubbish, but Hearst was paying him more than any other, anyone else was paying editors, anywhere in the United States then, just because Hearst inherited a lot of money.
Speaker 1: In fact, will you talk a little bit about Hearst and what importance he had.  He was like a kingpin, right.  It was a different time, Hearst owned a lot.
Speaker 2: His father [George Hearst] made it in the gold fields out here.  He married a woman named--her family name was Randolph from Virginia [sic, Phoebe Apperson Hearst, from Missouri].  She was one of them kind of people at that time from Virginia, you know what I mean, I think, a white woman.  That was the only child they had 'cause I think he was born here in the city.  And they got him everything he wanted.  When he went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], he didn't go to class.  They sent him back to Harvard cause he had a tutor at home, sent him to Harvard, he thought he didn't have to go to class.  So he had offered to give all the professors money back there to give him a passing grade.  They said "We don't do things like that here."  So he was kicked out of Harvard and came back home where his father owned the 'Examiner'.  So he said, "I'd like to run the paper."  He was successful doing it because Phoebe always gave him everything he wanted.  Because they owned a lot of land here because at one time they had a hundred thousand acre ranch in Mexico when [Alvaro] Obregon became, one of his revolutions down there, took over and, as president down there, they took all that land away from the Hearst family, said it belongs to the Mexican people.
Speaker 1: So, sir, when you, so you are, you're studying, you're reading a lot of papers?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 7094
Speaker 1: Your mother [Mary Golee Jackson] is working--your mother and your Granny, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --are working for Mr., what's?
Speaker 2: They don't--they didn't work together.  They were domestics in Chico [California].
Speaker 1: Okay, but didn't they--who was his name?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Grandmother was in Chico--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) My mother and sister [Kate Fleming] worked for, for Willie [Senator William] Knowland.
Speaker 2: Willie Knowland, I'm sorry.  Okay, and Mr. Knowland, can you talk about him and his importance?  He was, he owned, right?
Speaker 1: (Nods for yes)
Speaker 2: What did he, talk about what he owned?
Speaker 1: 'Oakland Tribune'.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And so was there anything else that you learned from him or from them, you know, with your mother and sister working for him?
Speaker 1: Well, I, I know that his father [Joseph Knowland] and George Cameron over here with the ['San Francisco] Chronicle', and the family that owned the 'Los Angeles Times' ran the Republican Party in California, and if you wanted to be elected governor or senator, you had to go see them.  They ran California, the Republican Party.  I knew that 'cause I used to hear it over there all the time on the other side of the [San Francisco] Bay 'cause his old man Hearst had made Earl Warren what he was.  The ol' man, ol' man Knowland over there 'cause Earl went to the University of California [Berkeley, California].  And the old the man saw that he was elected district attorney over there in Alameda County [California], and the old man saw to it with, with his colleagues in San Francisco [California] and Los Angeles [California], he was elected governor here from this state.
Speaker 2: Now, he told you, you were saying that he told you that you should major in political science?
Speaker 1: Not political, one of the social sciences.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: One of the social sciences.
Speaker 2: And why did he--can you just remember that instance where you go and you talk to him?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, and can you just retell that story?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, my sister was working with him as maid.  My mother is cook, and I told him I was gonna go back to school.  I saw him out there at his house.  And, and he said--he, he expressed his delight that I was gonna back to school.  And I told him I'd like to, like to be a, you know, for a newspaper.  And so he says, "Major in one of the social sciences."  That was his, his direct answer, major in one of the social sciences.  So I liked political science, political science the best 'cause in political science, all you do, you get a lot of history.  That's what you get in there, and I like history.  I think that was my strongest thing, is writing or reading about what people did, did in bygone days, politically and socially both--I, I liked that.
Speaker 2: So now, when--and why did you like that?  Why did you like--?
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) I don't know why (laughs).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was just curious.  I, I--you could put it that way, I guess.  I was curious.
Story_ID: 7095
Speaker 1: Was there anyone when you were at Chico [State] College [now California State University, Chico], was there anyone who influenced you at all--anyone else that influenced you or you came in contact with, a teacher, another student, someone else?
Speaker 2: I think one of the reasons why I liked it, as I said, I started reading newspapers very young.  And I'd be reading about events because all through the world, World War I, I was reading about what was happening over there.  And most of--these were things that I, I became well acquainted with and I could talk about a lot too.
Speaker 1: Now, would you have a lot of discussions with fellow students about events?
Speaker 2: Not too many up at Chico, maybe, maybe, maybe a couple up at Chico.  I encountered more in [University of California at] Berkeley cause I, I'd--at Berkeley, I went to two inter-sessions over there and two summer sessions.  And I met a lot of students over there then.  And then I used to hang around, when money ran out, I used to hang around up there on the campus of Berkeley 'cause my cousin was going there, and I had a lot of friends going up there also.  And if you want to see anyone at Berkeley in those days, you stood between Wheeler Hall and the library and they'd come along soon.  You'd run into them there.  And, and, and, and I was going with people who were going to school too.  I think that helped out a great deal.  I was pledged by the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity], and I, I learned a lot about fraternities then in those days.  And, and later when the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity]--'cause I dropped out.  I didn't think I wanted to be a frat man when the Kappas came up here and tried to form a chapter--they didn't have a chapter up here then cause, only the Omegas [Omega Psi Phi fraternity] and the Alphas were here at Berkeley and just the, just the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority] and, and the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta sorority] up here.  And all, both, all those chapters were on the Berkeley campus.  There weren't many over here or anywheres else, and Berkeley is where they were because at that time, very few of us was going to Stanford [University, Stanford, California], very few were going to Stanford then.  And a lot of us used to have the feeling that, that there's a lot of prejudice down at Stanford, which we were wrong.  But then I also thought Stanford was too expensive, because you know, what you went to for Berkeley until, until 1940?  Ten dollars a semester--no, it was twenty-five dollars a semester.  That's what it was.  And if you got a student body card, it cost you ten dollars--thirty-five dollars.  That's what it cost to go to the University of Berkeley--California at Berkeley then; same thing at UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles].
Speaker 1: So you start taking classes at Berkeley even though, you, you did some of that, right?
Speaker 2: I did.  I, I went to two inter-sessions up there which was between summer session and the regular session.  I went to two inter- sessions and I went to two summer sessions up there.  So I became well acquainted up there on the--with the Berkeley campus too.
Story_ID: 7096
Speaker 1: Now, why didn't you finish school, sir?
Speaker 2: Ran out of money (laughs).
Speaker 1: And so where were you working?  Were you still working on the trains?
Speaker 2: Some of the classes I took up to [University of California at] Berkeley and the WP, WPA [Works Progress Administration] came along.  I got on the Federal Writers' Project, and we worked on the Bancroft Library on the campus of the University of California [at Berkeley].  Then I was taking in some--what do you call those, that part of the university, extension.  I was taking some extension classes right up there on the campus and working in the library up there.  I got the, you know, got with the director.  And he was sympathetic, he let me do that.
Speaker 1: So what was--what did you do on the Federal Writers' Project?
Speaker 2: (laughs) We, I don't know what, what they were doing up there.  I know, I know there were a lot of graduated students in, in the bunch 'cause there was a couple from--a couple just got their Ph.D.s from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] up there.  And they were from all over the country.  And, and the most rebellious group of people I've ever ran into.  We formed a union up there, against the union--against the government and demanded a raise in pay.  All it, all we did look like was raising Cain all the time.  And, and, and the director, he gave us assignments, what we'd do then, get out the certain books we had and get information.  We'd carry that information on--I don't know what ever happened to it.  But it was quite a time up there.
Speaker 1: Well you don't know what particular part of the Federal Writers' Project you were working on?  You don't know that?
Speaker 2: What, the writers, Federal Writers' Project?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, you--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: We were supposed to be something--doing something on the history of California (laughs).  And where else could go?  'Cause that, that Bancroft Library, that's where the entire history of California is, is housed there.
Story_ID: 7097
Speaker 1: How did you get involved in writing for newspapers, in the newspaper business?  How did you get involved with that?
Speaker 2: Well, I tell you it started in high school.
Speaker 1: Right, I know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then college afterwards.
Speaker 1: Right, so what's your first job?
Speaker 2: The first job where I got any money was at the 'Oakland Tribune' 'cause I, I worked for another paper over here called 'The Spokesman'.  And they called us--you know what they used to call us, the little 'People's World' over here.  There was a friend of mine named John Pittman came out here from Atlanta U [now Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], entered grad school over at [University of California at] Berkeley, he started a paper over here.  His mother was a, was a high school teacher down in Atlanta.  So we were roommates for a while over there at Berkeley together.  And he fascinated me because he was a Communist.  He didn't try to hide it.  So he started a paper over here called 'The Spokesman'.  Well, immediately the conservative people over here called it the little 'People's World'.  You know, that was a Communist--they had the 'Daily Worker' in New York and, and, and the 'People's [Weekly] World' out here [San Francisco, California].  So we had an office here at 'The Spokesman' then at the corner of Baker and Sutter Street, had one Linotype machine, and set the type and everything.  We, we had to take--after we put it all together, we had to take it to a printer 'cause we didn't have any press of our own.  So when Harry Bridges called that general strike in 1934, you know, we were right there, the two of us, supporting the strikers.  Some vigilante committees formed around here in the area, they were going around beating up people on the streets that were supporting, you know, the striking workers.  They came by our office.  We had this Linotype machine in there.  We had this, a, a glass, storefront building.  They broke that glass, that plate glass and came in here and smashed up the keyboard on the Linotype machine and wrote a note and left there where we could see it, "You niggers, go back to Africa" (laughs).  We don't know who did it, but we thought it was some of those vigilantes doing it because we're, editorially, we were supporting the strikers.
Speaker 1: Sir, was there much, much racial strife around that time?
Speaker 2: I don't know whether it was--if it has ever ended 'cause every once in a while somebody, somebody writes--does something around here.  And I've seen the [Ku Klux] Klan marching Chico [California] with them god damn robes on, saw them marching in Stockton [California], over in Richmond [California] too.  I've seen them marching.  So you don't know.  But I, I think they're still here.
Speaker 1: And so, you, during that time--what was the newspaper you said, the name of it?
Speaker 2: 'Spokesman'.
Speaker 1: 'Spokesman', and it was, you said it was sort of left--it was a Communist paper?
Speaker 2: No, I said the 'People's World' was, John was a Communist, the editor and publisher was a Communist.
Speaker 1: Did you work with 'People's World' before you worked with the 'Spokesman'?
Speaker 2: No, no, with the 'Spokesman'.  I never did work with the 'People's World'.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I knew all the staff.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'The Spokesman', was it servicing Oakland?
Speaker 2: Printed over here [San Francisco, California].  They had a woman wrote a gossip column, and not only about people over here, but people over there at Berkeley too, at Oakland.
Speaker 1: And, and what--how are--what year is this, sir?
Speaker 2: I think 'The Spokesman' started, it must have been--probably around about 1932, maybe.
Speaker 1: And, and with 'The Spokesman', who started--who owned the paper, sir?
Speaker 2: John Pittman.  He was the publisher and editor.
Speaker 1: And what was his background?
Speaker 2: Well, he graduated from, from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], I think, and he went to grad school over at [University of California at] Berkeley.  I think, I think his major was economics or political science, one of them.
Speaker 1: And was it a good paper, do you think, or was it a typical--was it--?
Speaker 2: I thought it was a good paper.
Speaker 1: And when you--what, and you were handling what types of stories then?
Speaker 2: Anything that they assigned me, see, I was, I was so, so anxious to become a part of it, 'cause they, they--and they sent me--I was trying to get subscribers and, and picking up items in other cities 'cause I still had a pass I could get with railroad.  I could go up there in the Sacramento Valley and place it for them.  And I did that 'cause I could get a pass from the Southern Pacific [Railroad].  And when the general strike came out, I think we lasted for a little while after that, but I--John had no money.  He couldn't pay you, and I was so anxious to become a part of it so I, whatever I did, I didn't get anything for it.
Speaker 1: And then you were there from, you said, 1930--you said--what year was that?  Thirty?
Speaker 2: Hum?
Speaker 1: What, what year did you start with 'The Spokesman'?
Speaker 2: It was during the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: '30s [1930s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you worked--?
Speaker 2: It was slightly, I know it was slightly before, when the, when the general strike was called.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you worked there for a couple of years?
Speaker 2: Not, not even a full year, I don't think.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Not even a full year and then is that when you went with the ['San Francisco] Examiner'?
Speaker 2: No, I went, I went, went with the ['Oakland] Tribune'.
Speaker 1: Oh, Tribune, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in '34 [1934].
Speaker 1: And what, what's--the San Francisco Tribune?
Speaker 2: No, the 'Oakland Tribune'.  That was the paper owned by the Knowland family.
Story_ID: 7098
Speaker 1: So can you talk about that paper ['Oakland Tribune'] a little bit too?
Speaker 2: Well, it was the first daily paper on the West Coast to hire a black on the editorial staff.  That was--Delilah Beasley was her name.  And she had a weekly column in there called Activities Among Negroes.  And I think it was sort of a patronizing attitude 'Little Joe' [Joseph] Knowland had probably done so many wrong things in his life till Mrs., Ms. Beasley probably convinced him to hire her 'cause I know she was writing in--writing for the paper in '26 [1926] when I first came down here [San Francisco Bay Area].  How long before that, I never did try to, bother how, how long she'd been there before I first came there.  But she was writing for the paper when I came here in '26 [1926].  And there wasn't any other paper on the West Coast that hired a black on the editorial staff.  The other blacks I knew that worked for any papers all worked as janitors.
Speaker 1: So this was a big deal?
Speaker 2: It was very big.  I don't think too many of us recognized it, for what it was then, but I thought it was a very big deal.  It might have been paternalistic or patronizing what, what old man [Joseph] Knowland did, but he did do it.
Speaker 1: And, and how long did you work there, sir?
Speaker 2: I kept for about, about two months.  And as I told you, the black women really thought since Delilah was a woman that it should go to another black woman.  And they kept bothering the Knowlands about that.  So they discontinued it all together.
Story_ID: 7099
Speaker 1: After that [working for the 'Oakland Tribune'], what do you do after--?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I--whatever I could find to do then.
Speaker 1: When did you start working--wait a minute.  At that time, when you were working at the, both the 'The Spokesman' and the 'Oakland Tribune', can you talk about, you know, the--'cause that's the time when there's some other very important black newspapers in the country, you know, that are sort of in their heyday?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I was aware of that because, as I said, old man--Mr. [Oscar] McFarland used to get those papers down there on Seventh Street in Oakland [California].
Speaker 1: And were you, because the papers like the 'Pittsburgh Courier' and--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah, I loved it.  I didn't really know--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously)--the 'Chicago Defender'.  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: What was that, that guy that wrote--'cause I met him later on.  He used to write the gossip column in there.  I can't think of his name, but he wrote about all, all the celebrities in, in the 'Courier' every week.  And he lived in New York cause most of that stuff was paramountly about night life in Harlem [New York].  Oh, then before that, I met Dan Burley when Dan was writing for the 'Defender'.  You know, he left New--Chicago [Illinois] and went, went to the New York--.
Speaker 1: The ['New York] Amsterdam News', no?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: 'Amsterdam News'?
Speaker 2: 'Amsterdam News'.  Then he came back afterwards to the, to the 'Defender', but I met Dan the first time I went to Chicago.  I told you, the time I told you I came there on the train as a cook.  'Cause there was one of the guys, one of the waiters on there took me around 'cause he took me by Supreme Life [Building], and I saw the building they had that--and I was so surprised and pleased to see that.  And he took me by other places.  He took me by the 'Defender'.  I mean that's where I met Dan Burley, and I told him about what I had--writing I'd done in high school.  And he says, "Well, if you find any items out there, send them in."  And I sent him a couple of things.  He, he published them too.  And, and--where was I now?
Speaker 1: You were talking about--I was asking you about the, you know, both the 'Defender' and the 'Pittsburgh Courier'.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, but I tell you where I saw, saw a 'Defender' one time.  Somebody must have brought it up there.  I saw a 'Defender' up there in Chico [California] one time. That was in the 1920s. Someone must have brought it up there, I saw it there in Chico.
Story_ID: 7100
Speaker 1: I was asking you what paper you liked, you know, the best, and you were talking about the Murphys [John Henry Murphy and Carl Murphy].
Speaker 2: Locally or nationally?
Speaker 1: Nationally.
Speaker 2: I like the 'Amsterdam News'.  I always have.  I--primarily 'cause it's from Harlem [New York].  I lived in Harlem when I was a kid, a small kid.  I like the Afro papers.  I liked what the Murphys did there [the 'Afro-American'].  I liked, I liked the 'Michigan Defender' too.  I thought that's a good paper.  And, and that family [Scott family] who had those papers down there in Atlanta [Georgia] and somewhere, what was their name now?  One of them was the 'Atlanta [Daily] World', I think, and they had a paper, I think, in, in Birmingham [Alabama] too, didn't they?  Didn't they have a chain of papers down there?
Speaker 1: I think you're right.
Speaker 2: I like those, the, the--their editor, 'cause I saw him, you know, at the publishers conventions.  I used to--I went to a number of the publishers conventions with [Carlton] Goodlett, although I didn't look forward to going to them as much as he did because I didn't see where they were doing too much but arguing all the time.  And--but, you know, Goodlett liked that side sort of the business much better than I did 'cause he liked to argue.  But he did some very good things for them there.  What is it called the NNPA or what is they call it?
Speaker 1: NPAA.
Speaker 2: NPA [sic, NNPA, National Newspaper Publishers Association] .  Goodlett got a lot of--national advertisement for them because what he did, he bought some stocks in a lot of these big corporations here.  So when they had a stockholders' meeting, he would go there.  He tried to sell all of them that, that idea, but not too many of them followed.  When he got the ads, he got it for all of them, 'cause he served as president of them for, I think, two years.  And, but as I said, he and [John H.] Sengstacke didn't like one another.  For the exact reason, I don't know.  And so I guess he was too full of ideas for them because he thought faster than all the rest of them did.  He had a different background than they had, and he attended all the international conferences.  None of the rest of them went 'cause that's how I happened to go 'cause he was going also.  None of the rest of them went.
Story_ID: 7101
Speaker 1: I want to go back and just ask you about one thing I forgot to ask you about and that was the, the radio show you had, 'Negroes in the News'?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: The radio show, 'Negroes in the News'?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that just a little bit?
Speaker 2: It came into being, I think I told you about, when John W. Davis and John Davis called that National Negro Congress in Chicago, the one of 1934. Ishmael Flory I think you probably met him in Chicago [Illinois], he was living here then.  He joined right away because, you know, in '34 [1934] that, it was one of the worst winters in the [Great] Depression for blacks all over the country.  And something had to be done.  So when they first called it, I think, I think [A. Philip] Randolph and, and, and Tarea Hall Pittman, they all responded.  I think they went to his meetings until they found out what John W. Davis, John Davis were, actually Communists, and they wanted no parts of them when they found out.  Well Ishmael was his big man out here because [C. L.] Dellums was working with him.  You probably heard of him.  He was a third vice president--a second vice president of the brotherhood, Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.  Well, he was the head man down--I think Ishmael was, but, but Tarea Hall Pittman worked closely with him.  So did, so did Dellums and so did Wilma--Francis Albrier, over there across the [San Francisco] Bay.  And we all worked with him, the churches also.  So Ishmael went out and started getting money from some of the small merchants over there, white merchants to start that program, 'Negroes in the News' on [radio] station KWB, KWB, Warner Brothers, with the K in front, KWB was the name--the, the call letters.  And so we were at Tarea's house, I think before the, before the convention actually happened one, one--cause we all used to meet at Tarea Hall's house out, in the kitchen every week and talk about the problems.  And I think you know what the problems were, the race relations here in the United States.  So Ishmael told, told me, says, "Tom," said, "You got to go on the radio tomorrow--Sunday"; it was a Friday evening, he says "'Cause I got to go to Chicago."  I said, "What do I know about being, being, doing anything on radio?"  I said, "I didn't, I didn't even take public speech in school."  He said, "Well, we don't have anybody else."  I looked Tarea and I says, "Why don't go--why don't you take it?"  She said, "I can't."  So I said, "Okay, I'll try it."  And I had never been inside of a studio before.  I didn't know what you were supposed to do in there.  I know I had to get some news from somewhere, so I promptly went down on [Oscar] McFarland's stand down there and I bought the ['Chicago] Defender', the, the ['Pittsburgh] Courier' and the Pittsburgh--and, and whatever black papers I could find down there, and I couldn't--I, I didn't know how to time myself for anything like that.  So I went, and I came on.  Well, I--a lot of my friends saw me later on that day, and said, "What the hell were you doing on there?"  I said, "Well, Ishmael left town."  So I ran out of there.  I didn't, I didn't, I didn't know how much, how much news I was supposed to do, and I had, I stopped, and I still had about three minutes left, said, "Well, that's all" (laughs).  And so, the next week, I did a little bit better.  And then I, I think I did it for two more weeks, and we were all over Tarea's house as usual, and I told Tarea, I says, "I don't want to do it any more".  I said, "I have to buy the papers," and I said, "I don't have any money for one thing."  And I said--'cause Ishmael had arranged with the radio that they would collect the money to pay for that, that fifteen minutes on the air.  And so Olga Jane Lewis was there, and she said, "Would you mind"--I said, "You can have it if you want it."  So she took it.  And she kept it for a while, and eventually, Tarea Hall Pittman had to take it over herself.
Story_ID: 7102
Speaker 1: I want you to talk about 1944 when you, you know, you met--with Frank Logan?
Speaker 2: With who?
Speaker 1: You and Frank Logan?
Speaker 2: Frank Logan?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in 1944.
Speaker 2: He had a--we had some enterprises going on.  You know, 1944 was at the height of the black migration coming in here, into California too, because I think I told you earlier, in 1940, there wasn't five thousand blacks living in San Francisco [California].  That's what the census said, and all you had to was walk around San Francisco then.  If you'd walk on Market Street though, the only black you'd see down was looking in them plate glass windows and seeing your own reflection.  So they were pouring in.  Frank was one of those who came in here because there--I think there was a--Bethlehem [Steel Corporation] had the shipyard working full blast in--in San Francisco.  Then they opened up a shipyard over there in Marin County too, 'cause of Marinship [Corporation].  And, of course, we had one in Oakland [California], and then [Henry J.] Kaiser had all of, all of Richmond [California], had--he had about six shipyards going out there at that time.  So Logan had come in here.  He was a, he was a professional gambler.  He had some gambling places going here.  And he decided he wanted to go into something legit.  And he had talked this over with a friend of his from Texas named Albert White. (Pause).  I had met White, so White took me, and I met Frank.  And I said, "I'd like be in on it with you."  He says, "I can't pay you anything."  I said, "Well, I'm working in the shipyards," and I said, "I don't go to work till three o'clock every afternoon."  I said, "I can handle it, I think."  So we started.  White only stayed with him one edition.  The only thing Frank could do was pay the printer.  Another guy came in when I did named--he could sell advertising.  He said, he could get his off--the cut, he got off, you know, where advertising sold.  So it fell on me.  Well, Frank didn't know anything about it.  All he could do is give me the money to pay the printer.  So that's how we got, got started with the 'Reporter'.  There wasn't any 'Sun' here then at all.  So they--this was in June 19--no, May, 1944 when we started the 'Reporter'.  As I told you, I, I was corresponding with [Carlton] Goodlett all the time.  I wrote and told Goodlett about what we--what I was doing out here.  I didn't never knew then that he wanted to come back to California, 'cause when he was a graduate student out here, he always said this was the last frontier.  And I used to look at him with, with--I had my mouth wide open.  He thought this was the last frontier, and I said--he came Omaha [Nebraska] so how in the hell could he call this the last frontier out here?  He's just from Omaha himself.  So--but there were so few blacks out here.  He'd gone to school at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], and he was used to that.  So I wrote and told, 'cause all the time he's gone here, he wrote to me every week, and I wrote to him every week.  And he knew everything I was doing, and I know everything--I knew I told him what chicks I was chasing.  He told me which one he's chasing 'cause when he got married, he wrote and told me--he was still a, a student at Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] then.  And he'd met a chick who could fix the meals and take care of his, his ulcers.  So I wrote back and told him, you the one who gonna live with her, not me.  So in the meantime, the Army, after we started the paper, the Army grabbed me in, in, in February of 1945.  And Bill Hambrick had came in the paper then.  He was gonna try his luck at being a publisher 'cause he was giving me the money to keep it going.  So I left it there in his hands.  So I stayed in the Army six months, and then in the meantime, Goodlett had finished his, his residency back there in Tennessee so he could come to California.  He was going down to Columbus, Tennessee or Columbia [Tennessee], whatever the name is.  And he came back to Omaha--now I was stationed at Fort Francis Warren, you know, that's right out of Cheyenne [Wyoming].  So he told me he was gonna come through there en route to California.  I had just got out of the hospital that day 'cause I'd been in there shirkin' duty.  And they, they kicked me out of the hospital.  I was trying to get out of the Army, that's what I was trying to do.  There was nothing wrong.  So he came through there on a Monday morning--I was expecting him to leave Omaha on a Sunday night.  He came through there on Monday morning.  I'm hiding to keep from doing any duty all day that Monday.  And I came back over there to the quarters at, at four o'clock to see if I'd gotten any mail.  And, and I got my mail.  I'd gone over to the Post Office and wrote a letter and dropped it in, and I saw this Chevrolet coming along there, and somebody leaning out the window shaking their finger.  And it was Goodlett.  He had his wife with him.  And he started yelling, "Why in the hell don't you stay right where somebody can find you?"  I said, "Man, you told me you would be--wouldn't be here until tomorrow."  He said, "Come on over here and shake hands.  I haven't seen you in seven years."  He was en route to California then.  And when I got out about two months later, he was attending my mother [Mary Golee Jackson].  My mother was sick.  And so he came over, and he started lending us money to keep the paper going.  And we couldn't pay him back.  That's how, that's how he became the publisher--.
Speaker 1: So Logan--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) He didn't have nothing, and so the 'Sun' started while I was away in the Army.  I want to tell you the story.  It was started by a white man named Frank Laurent.  He went down to Los Angeles [California] and got two black guys, Wendell Green to be their editor and publisher, and A. B. Robertson.  They, two, when I, 'cause when I came back, the 'Sun' was here.  This white man owned it.  So Goodlett never did like the idea of whites owning a black paper.  So Frank [Laurent] liked us immediately.  He used to be around us all the time.  So they got in a big poker game one weekend over at Goodlett's house.  Frank--at the end of the night, they played all night long, Frank owed Goodlett $3,500.  So Frank said, "Give me $1,500 and you can have the 'Sun'."  That was in '47 [1947].  That's how we got the 'Sun'--in a poker game (laughs), you could say.
Speaker 1: So at this point, then--you, you're--you have the 'Sun' and you have the--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) The 'Reporter', the 'Reporter' is the oldest of the two.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there were two.  Then it became a--and what were the coverage areas, sir?
Speaker 2: What was the coverage?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was--was one focused on Oakland and one San Francisco?
Speaker 2: No, we tried to focus on the [San Francisco] Bay Area, both of the--(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Bay Area, both of--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But what was the difference between them then?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: None, okay (laughs).
Speaker 2: None, we were more liberal than, we, we could say, than, than, than the 'Sun' was, far more liberal cause you know how, how Goodlett was.  There're some people over here tried to say he was a Communist.
Story_ID: 7103
Speaker 1: How had you met [Carlton] Goodlett?
Speaker 2: Met him on the campus over in [University of California at] Berkeley in '35 [1935].  He came out here as a graduate student from Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: And that's before he went to Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] for, for medical school?
Speaker 2: He'd just graduated from Howard when he came out here.  And he came out here, to show you the type of guy he is, he came out here to get a masters degree.  When he got out here, he decided to take the comprehensive for the Ph.D. after he got out here.  He took it and passed, and did it in three years.
Speaker 1: So you, the two of you are, are running this.  He's, he's the--?
Speaker 2: He's the publisher 'cause he's putting up the money.
Speaker 1: Right, and you--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) At first, it was not only him.  There was Dan Collins who was a dentist here.  Dan had met Goodlett when they were both to Meharry.  So Dan came out here before Dan did--before Goodlett did because the University of California Dental School brought him out here for a lecture in the dental school.
Speaker 1: These are very bright men, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Very bright.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and he recognized in you, he also recognized something in you too.  He knew that you were the right person to run the paper, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I was running it.
Speaker 1: Right.  That's right.  You were running it under Frank [Logan]?
Speaker 2: When he came here.  He wasn't there, I told you, he wasn't here.
Speaker 1: That's right, okay.  Okay, so what were you wanting to do with the paper, sir?  What were you wanting to do?
Speaker 2: I wanted a black newspaper here [San Francisco, California].  There was one in Oakland, the ['California] Voice'.  We later acquired the 'Voice' too.  You knew that, didn't you?  We acquired that because old man [E. A.] Daly had that when I first came down here in '26 [1926].  He knew what I was doing over here because Tom [Thomas L.] Berkley, when he started at the ['Oakland] Post' over there, Tom tried to buy the 'Voice'.  Old man Daly, when he got ready to retire, he called me at the paper office.  He said, "Tom", he says, "Tom Berkley wants to buy my paper," and he said, "I want to get out."  He said, "I don't want him to have it."  He says, "Do you guys want it?"  I said, "Let me talk to Goodlett."  I talked to Goodlett, and Goodlett said, "Sure we'd like to have it."  We went over there and talked to him.  That's how we got the 'Voice'.  He wouldn't sell it to Tom 'cause he'd been knowing me for years.  And when I met Tom, you know where Tom was?  He was on the track team at UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles].  That's when I first met him, cause he was at UCLA the same time that Jackie Robinson was there.  And the girl that Tom married, that year I told you I spent over in San Francisco State [University], Etta Jordan, she was a student there.  I knew her too.
Speaker 1: So these are some, really, you know, when I think about it, these are different types of black people in some respects, sir?
Speaker 2: I don't think, it doesn't follow the liberal cause because, see, 'cause Goodlet and I, so we didn't care if they Communists or not.  If they were working for the same goal we were working for, we worked with them.  And, and, and the others would, they backed away from that, but that never did bother me at all.  And I don't think it bothered him either.  And, 'cause Goodlett's wife at one time--the first thing Goodlett did was become elected president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And I know one night at board meeting there, Goodlett's wife went up and said, "Anybody call my husband a Communist," says, "I'm gonna sue them."  Because there was a lot of talk going around there because Goodlett taught then at the California Labor School [San Francisco, California], because, you know, he got his Ph.D. in psychology.  He taught at the California Labor School, which was organized and operated by the International Longshoreman's [Association] union 'cause you know they used to try to say Harry Bridges was a Communist too.  And--that didn't bother Goodlett at all, because as Goodlett said one time, he told some of them, he said, "I make a good living."  He says, "I don't need any appointments from anybody."  He said, "I can do what I want to do.  I don't have to ask anybody for anything."  He said, "What my primary goal is try to get blacks in the art--every phase of activity in this city."  And that was his goal, 'cause it was through us that a lot of them got apartments here, through this paper here.  That's how [Judge] Cecil Poole moved up.  Well, we got him appointed as deputy district attorney, the first black deputy district attorney appointed here in San Francisco County.  We worked very well with, with [William] Byron Rumford.  He, he was the first black elected to the state legislature from up here in Northern California.  We worked very hard with him, because we regarded Oakland and San Francisco as being just one big city.  And we worked hard over there with the people over on that side too 'cause nobody else had ever done it.
Story_ID: 7104
Speaker 1: And what are you proud of that you, the two [Thomas Fleming and Carlton Goodlett] of you accomplished together?  What are you proud of?  Well, what things sort of stand out cause you said--let's even start with you said, we got a lot of people apartments here in--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well, one of the things I'm proud I can say the 'Sun-Reporter' it started in, I mean the 'Reporter' started in 1944 and it's still in existence--that I'm one of the people who started it, and I'm proud of that.  And no one can take that away from me.  I'm still doing this at the age of ninety-four.  I still write the editorials for them, and I write that opinion column every week.  I still do it.  And I'm proud to see some of the improvements improve.  We got a black mayor [Willie Brown] here [San Francisco, California] because--we worked hard to get Willie Brown elected to the state legislature.  He might not--may not say that now, but he, he knows it's true.  We not only backed him editorially, Goodlett put money in his campaign, his first, and out of his pocket.  And we helped him to raise other money.  And he can't deny that.  We worked the same way for people in, in Oakland [California] too 'cause as I told you, we look at this as being one community.
Speaker 1: Now, you said that you also helped people get housing, you know, that--you said, you said, look at the times that, you know, that the 'Reporter' got started, you said that, you know, a lot of blacks were coming from the South--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a lot of black people.  And those people had to go where?  And I'm just trying to understand the role that the newspaper, the 'Reporter' played in helping people find housing.  Was it a voice to--was it basically, and these are, you know, where you can rent or was it more in that, you know, commenting on--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) How we helped with people came by the paper office and made complaints, we went out there and looked to see what they were talking about, 'cause some of the people--some of the places that was rented to people in those days, I wouldn't put a dog to live in them.  And publicizing what happened, and we never did fail to go down to city hall and let them know that we were here in this city.  I feel that we helped a lot of people.
Story_ID: 7105
Speaker 1: What other issues of the day were you commenting on [in the 'Sun-Reporter'].
Speaker 2: Well, they came by to see us for so many different things.  This is one agency I think they knew where they could come by and somebody would try to do something because most of the time, they didn't know where to go themselves.  We would give them information--even to go with them.  And, and you had to do it 'cause one of the times, we couldn't pay--the paper for a long time, couldn't pay me no decent salary.  I got a job working in the D.A.'s [district attorney] office at night when, when [Edmund G.] 'Pat' Brown was governor.  I was one of the first students--I mean one of the first guys to get, to get that Coro Foundation Scholarship.  I was in the first class, the class of '47 [1947], '48 [1948], and that's how I met Brown because we went in different city--different parts in city government--the interns did, did, to see how the government operated, organized labor and big business.  And I met Pat, and I guess we liked one another, and he says, "When your internship is up, come by and if I got a job, I'll give you a job."  But I wasn't no lawyer.  But I went by, and I let him know.  About two months after that, he called me at home and said he had an opening for me.  And I went down there, and at that time, San Francisco County was the only county in the State of California where the district attorney's office took the bail--not the courts.  See, that mean that Pat had to keep the complaint office and the office open around the clock.  Well, the, the attorneys left at five [p.m.] so they left civilians in there, clerks.  I was one of three.

Speaker 1: Do you remember where you were when A. Philip Randolph won, you know, won with the sleeping car--when the trial ended for the [Brotherhood of] Sleeping Car Porters [the BSCP won a collective bargaining agreement in 1937]?  Do you remember where you were?
Speaker 2: I was working for the [Southern Pacific] Railroad.  I, I--let me put this in also, when I started working the railroads, the dining car cooks and waiters were trying to get a union also.  Randolph was trying to get a union.  Now, I heard this.  I don't know whether you ever heard it, that the Pullman Company wrote a, a blank check to Randolph, told him to put whatever he wanted in there to forget this nonsense. This is what they told him.  I know that a lot of the porters did not join with the union, but they were working.  And I know what the pay conditions were 'cause I was working.  I think standard pay for Pullman porters then was about twenty-five dollars a month.  The Pullman Company took the attitude that the public was gonna give them tips, so this is all they need.  This is the way it was.  When the dining car cooks and waiters was formed, they would work you as many hours as they wanted.  We couldn't get a charter like--Randolph did get a charter from the AF of L [American Federation of Labor].  We couldn't get a charter, the dining car cooks and waiters.  We had to come as an auxiliary of the bartenders union.  That's how we got in.  We didn't have an auxiliary--I mean didn't have an international, but, we were auxiliary. But at least we got that eight-hour clause in there--a day--and an hourly wage.  We got that, didn't have it before then.  That's why as soon as I, I, the SP [Southern Pacific] hired, I joined the union.  I saw the value of it then, that quick.  And I've always been a--a strong union man.  So I know the problems they had, that, that Randolph had.  One of the things I was surprised was over there Oakland [California] when they had that, they named  that, that train depot over there, [C. L.] Dellums, I said, "Dellums didn't really work for the railroad company."  I said, "He worked the"--I mean the porters.  I said, "He worked for the Pullman Company."  See, people don't understand that the railroads paid their employees.  The Pullman Company paid all, all the people who worked for the Pullman Company.  And I tell people that, and they're surprised.  I said, "But that's the way it was."

Speaker 1: Where were you when Joe Louis won against [Max] Schmeling?  Do you remember where you were?
Speaker 2: I think I was coming out of the, the [Bancroft] Library up on the campus [University of California at Berkeley] (laughs).  And I think a Ph.D. from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] asked me, said, "I guess you feel pretty proud."  I said, "It's just another prize fight to me, that's all."  I said, "Why should I feel any different than you do?"  And that struck for him to come to me with that, that stuff like that.  I've always--I've never recognized a such thing as race to me, 'cause I think we're all people, 'cause I tell everybody--people can mate.  And other people can say they belong to a different ethnic group, but I say when they mate, a baby is coming and it won't be an ape or a gorilla, it'll be a human being.  And I says, that's--I said, that's why that race stuff is a lot of baloney to me.  And I don't, and, and I don't like, I don't like that term that Ron Karenga came up with, African American.  I don't use it in my writings at all, I say black people.  And, and, and Ron attracted attention.  A lot of young blacks who are going to college here, they use it now.  I don't like the term.  And I don't use it at all.  And I, I thought Ron attracted a lot of attention then.  And, and I've never met the man, but I never use that term.  And, and I think whites are delighted that blacks want to accept this term.
Story_ID: 7108
Speaker 1: I didn't agree with, with Ward Connerly when he came out here, wanting to kill affirmative action, and I wrote a lot of editorials about it because the way I look at, at Connerly--he came to California, I think, when he was about fourteen years old.  He came from Louisiana, in a country town, so there was still a lot of segregation down there.  And he found out when he got out here there wasn't any segregation in Sacramento [California], and he was able to marry a white woman.  Well, apparently, she's brighter than he is.  He probably met her when he was going to college, went to Sacramento State [California State University, Sacramento].  When he first appeared in, you know, attacking the system over there at [University of California at] Berkeley, I said, "This cat probably tried to get in Berkeley and couldn't get in.  His grades wasn't good enough."  And I found out later that he went to Sacramento State.  And I found out about that, that interracial marriage.  So I says, "He's the worse type you could find."  I says, "He got his through, through affirmative action, but he don't want anybody else to do it."  And I said, "This man must be out of senses completely."  And I see probably, the way I figure, it seems like he became very well off, getting those contracts from the State of California as a minority-owned business.  I said, "He's made his, but he don't want anybody else to make it."  So I wrote editorials about him.  And so he, he--and, and I said--and then I when I saw that he graduated from Sacramento State, I says, "Well, he did go to school long enough to know better than what he's saying--what he's doing."  But I said, "When he earned money," I said, "He probably let [Governor] Pete Wilson know that he contributed a lot to, to the Republican Party," and I said, "Pete want to reward him."  So I said, "That's the worse thing he could do is put him on the Board of Regents with the University of California."  And he wants to change--come talking about affirmative action is discrimination against white males.  That's one of the most stupid remarks I've ever heard made in my life.  How in the hell a white male's gonna be discriminated against when they control the damn country.  For him to make a statement like that.  So, but he goes along his merry way.  He went out of California and went down to Florida, and went up to the State of Washington, campaigning with the same thing.  And I don't know how, how that guy sleeps well at night, myself.
Speaker 2: When you think about people like Ward Connerly and [U.S. Supreme Court Justice] Clarence Thomas and, you know, those, what do you think?
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Don't forget [Secretary of State] Condoleezza Rice too.
Speaker 2: Okay, (laughs), and Condoleezza Rice, what do you--okay, what do you think?
Speaker 1: I call them all Uncle Toms.  I think [former Secretary of State] Colin Powell knows better.  He's a military man, and, and, and there's something about military people that sets them apart from the civilian population.  And, it's just loyalty, but he's been taught. That's all  He's lived that way all of his life.  But at least he doesn't disavow affirmative action, does he?  He lets everybody know where he came from.  And then, and that's remarkable for him when you look his background, because I know the people from Jamaica, they think they're superior to American-born blacks.  I know all of that.  And, and, and then I have to laugh 'cause one of them lived over there on a--he loaned money to--outside their, their yards, at the (unclear) Pier over there, Hubert Hilton.  He's from Jamaica.  So he didn't think much of people from Jamaica.  He says, "Tom, they don't even have running water in their houses.  And they come over here and act like they're the king's subjects."  He says, he said, "They're stupid."  He was born there.  And I knew where he was coming from when he said that.  And, and then I, I--Colin's parents were probably that same way, that's what I think.  But I think he understands what it's all about.  I don't think Condoleezza Rice really understands.  I look at her from what I've learned about it, she went to--she was in that school in Birmingham [Alabama] where those girls was bombed  those girls lost their lives [September 15, 1963].  She was going to that church [Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama].  That's when her father left Birmingham and came to Denver [Colorado].  Oh, I look at this also.  All of her academic training was the University of Denver.  That isn't one of the top schools in the country.  That's the way I look at it now.  I could be prejudiced.  She's quite a prodigy playing the piano, and I think she sold herself while, while the family resided in, in Denver, then getting that doctorate when she was twenty-four.  The white world likes this.  You've got a bright, a bright young woman, and they've been searching--ever since Jackie Robinson, I mean ever since Paul Robeson made that remark, you know what I'm talking about, they've been trying to find somebody to offset what, what Paul Robeson said at that time.  She fit it well, black, twenty-four, Ph.D.  She got in Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  I have a friend who was working down there before she was.  And I asked him about her once when her name started appearing in the paper.  He says, "Tom, if you black and you're having problems down there with the students," he said, "Don't go to her."  I said, "You don't have to say anymore to me."  I understood where he's coming from.  And that's what she is.  And I think myself she's trying to get Colin Powell's job [Secretary of State].  And I don't think that would bother him too much 'cause he's still gonna get that big pension from the government.  And, and see, she stays right in the White House [Washington, D.C.] with [President George W.] Bush.  Colin Powell is over in the State [Department] Building.  Her office is right there in the White House.  And anyplace the President goes, she goes.  And, and, and she just has made herself known to the white world, anti-Communist.  They've been looking for somebody like that ever since Robeson made the remark.  Well, Jackie Robinson let them use him to bring him up there.  You remember what I'm talking about.
Speaker 2: Well, talk about the Jackie Robinson?
Speaker 1: When Paul Robeson made that remark, they went and got Jack--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well, talk about the remark, sir, even too.
Speaker 1: The remark to Jackie?
Speaker 2: No, the remark that Paul Robeson made?
Speaker 1: Paul said that there was a lot talk going around, 'cause one of the, the generals, the, the, [General George] Patton made the remark, "We ought to attack the Soviet Union right now."  And there were some, some feelings throughout the country about, why not go and, and attack the Russians right now.  Paul said that he thought that if we went to war, war against the Soviet Union at that time, that he didn't think American blacks would support it.  He said that because there's no racial discrimination in Russia 'cause, you know, he sent young Paul [Robeson II] to school over there.  They were upset, with a man like, like Robeson making that statement.  They run down to New York and getting Jackie and brought him before that House Un-American Activities [Committee, HUAC] and he said, in his opinion, that if the United States got involved in a war against the Soviet Union, blacks would serve.  What they didn't realize that Jackie had a honorable discharge [sic, dishonorable discharge] from the Army, did you know that?  And because a white lieutenant called him a nigger, (laughs) and he beat him up.  And they threw him out of the Army.  Nelson Rockefeller managed for him to get that, that dishonorable discharge erased.  And I, and I always--every time, I can't, couldn't understand how Jackie would let them use him that way.  I couldn't understand that 'cause, you know, Jackie's wife, you know where she went to nursing school, right here at the University of California Medical School.  That's when I met Rachel [Robinson], when she was going to school here.
Story_ID: 7109
Speaker 1: I met Ralph Bunche here in the [San Francisco] Bay Area [California] 'cause the first summer I worked as, as a, as a bellhop on that ship, Ralph was working on a sister ship as a waiter.  He was a graduate student at UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles] then.
Speaker 2: What did you think of Ralph Bunche, sir?
Speaker 1: Who, Ralph Bunche?  I thought he was a very bright guy.  He used to come up here quite often visiting, you know, when he was going to school down there.  Back in the '20s [1920s] and through the '30s [1930s], most of the blacks who were going to school here or down in Los Angeles, knew one another pretty well.  One of the things that drew them together, every time [University of] Southern California [USC, Los Angeles, California] played [University of] California [at Berkeley] up here, all the black Los Angeles from USC and UCLA, came up here for a weekend of partying.  When California played either one of them USC or UCLA here, everybody from up here went down South.  That's how I was able to meet Bunche.  A lawyer over there who actually is a, is a brother to me, but he was older than I was--I met Charlie [Charles H.] Houston at his place 'cause he and Charlie Houston went to war--they were serving in the Army together as officers.  Just like Earl [B.] Dickerson was a--Earl, Earl knew them.  He was, he was an officer then too, in that same division over there, cause when Earl's daughter graduated from med school, he invited [Carlton] Goodlett and I over there at the commencement at Mills College [Oakland, California].  I don't know where they are--I haven't seen Earl's daughter since then.  And Earl always planned on moving out here, do you know that.  He wanted to move over in Sausalito [California].  But it didn't happen cause he used to come out here quite often.  And he, like Goodlett, went to Moscow [Russia] a number of times (laughs), because we used to talk about those things, what we encountered over there.
Story_ID: 7110
Speaker 1: I'm wondering if you remember where you were when the 'Brown v. Board of Education [of Topeka, Kansas', 1954] decision was handed down?
Speaker 2: I was living here in the [San Francisco] Bay Area [California].
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember how you felt when that happened?
Speaker 2: I always wondered why they hadn't done it sooner.  'Cause to me, the country never did follow what the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments said, they never did.  They used it to protect big corporations, in my opinion, big corporations became people.  Clever lawyers did that, you know, in the, in the judicial system here 'cause there shouldn't, it shouldn't have ever been any need of, of, of affirmative action or anything else.  The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment forbade those things.  But we always got to go before the Congress to have something done that should, that, that's, that's been illegal for so long because discrimination based on color is illegal.  The Constitution says that.  If people would read it real through, the Thirteen, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment says that to me.  And the only thing we've ever asked for is equality of opportunity.  We've never asked for any more.  Now, they know that they never gave us the opportunities.
Story_ID: 7111
Speaker 1: What did you also think of [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and the Civil Rights Movement, and, you know, also had interviewed him?
Speaker 2: Well, I look at Martin Luther King, he was created by television.  I think [W. E. B.] DuBois and [Paul] Robeson did far more, as much as he did, myself, but the world saw him on television.  And I can't stand that family of his.  They think they're the American black aristocrats in this country and that the world, the country owes them everything.  The country don't owe them a god damn more than they do you or me.  And I can't stand them brats of his.  And you know what [Carlton] Goodlett and I used to call her [Coretta Scott King], the Mother Hen, 'cause she thinks that Washington [D.C.] has to consult her on everything concerning black people.  And what does she do?  She was just his wife, that's all.  Goodlett talked to that man when he first came in the limelight, says "Why don't you oppose the war in Vietnam then?  You know what was happening then, don't you?"  He was afraid because he thought they would call him a Communist.  And you're not being--to me, being an anti-Communist if you oppose the war over there.
Speaker 1: So, now, why would you say--say why, you know, you said that you thought--that's, I've heard that statement before too about Rev. King recently, in fact, but why would say that, you said, W. E. B. DuBois and who else--Paul Robeson, did much more for black people.  And I'd like you to comment on that?
Speaker 2: Well, I think they had been out there in the trenches much longer than he had.  And, and publicity gave him the publicity that they didn't get because they'd been working long before television, you know that.  And showing those dogs that [T. Eugene] 'Bull' Connor had out there, and him out there, that--that excited the whole nation, black and white, what was happening then.  I think the students [at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical University, Greesnboro, North Carolina] started that actually before he did, when they sat down at that lunch counter down there in--where was it, in North Carolina?  And I don't think he deliberately did what he did, but he did what, what was necessary.  And, and along like, what you might have been doing that or I was doing it.  I don't think he did any more, but he got the publicity--one thing because he's a reverend. Because a lot of the people in white America thought that Robeson was a, was a Communist.  I think, I think if Paul was a Communist, I think he would admit it.  I don't think that DuBois was any more honorable than Robeson.  DuBois admitted it, didn't he?  Robeson didn't.  He didn't have to 'cause he wasn't one.  But they didn't like him for taking the positions that he did.  And he was well known.

Speaker 1: The [Senator Joseph] McCarthy Era [Second Red Scare], what did you think of that as a journalist?
Speaker 2: A period of nonsense that, who went through from time to time.  I think Joe McCarthy was scoundrel, and he proved it himself later on.  I think he was a scoundrel because I never saw any, any chances of Communism come to lifestyle in this country.  I know when I, when I went to Moscow [Russia] in '69 [1969], and I also heard this in East Berlin [Germany], that there was gonna be a revolution in this country.  And I said, "Why would you say that," 'cause they came to me with it.  They said, "Well, the Black Panthers."  I said, "The Black Panthers can't get no revolution started."  I said, "Let me tell you one thing, I said the black middle class love those mortgages as much as the white middle class does."  And I said, "It ain't gonna happen in the United States."  I said, "Take my word."  I said "The black middle class want the same thing the white middle class does."  And I said, "It ain't gonna happen."  'Cause I went over there--I used to go, you know, I told you I used to tour, I used go by the press rooms on both sides of the [San Francisco] Bay all the time.  About three times every week, Huey [Newton] would call a press conference, out at the Panther office there in Oakland [California].  I would go out with, with--'cause there, there were two papers in Oakland then and four over here [San Francisco, California].  We would all jump in the cars and rush out there on Grove Street.  It's called Martin Luther Way--Martin Luther King Way now.  Bobby [Seale] would be walking around with a jug of wine drinking all the time, and Huey was out, out there expounding.  I don't think he knew what he was expounding about.  So I, I managed to get Huey to one side, I says, "I think you're making mistakes calling these press conferences all the time," I said, "'Cause all the press conference is gonna do is build you up," and I said, "In the process it's gonna destroy you."  I said, "One of the first mistakes you made, when you went up to Sacramento [California] with all them god damn guns.  Those little guns don't mean anything to the white world."  I said, "If the cops can't handle you out in the streets," I said, "The National Guard's gonna come in."  So, he told me that, "We'll retreat to the hills and fight guerilla warfare."  I said, "You wouldn't, couldn't feed yourselves."  I said, "You cats wouldn't know what plants to eat up there," I said, "'Cause you lived--raised here in town all your damn life," said, "What the hell would you eat?" I said, "You know what they could do?  They could shut off the water that comes in the black district, and the electricity and leave you over there."  I said, "What the hell would you do then?"  And I said, "And just surround you and see you don't come out the black districts."  I said, "What you ought to be doing is do like Joe [Joseph] Stalin and them did, hold up some banks so you'll have some money so you, you could work with."  I said, "But you guys"--I said, "I know why you like to hold these press conferences."  I said, "You like to see your names and your pictures in the newspapers."  I said, "I know the reason why you do it."  I said, "But all you're doing is fooling yourselves, that's all."  And later on, the one that wrote the book ['This Side of Glory: The Story of the Black Panther Party'], [David] Hilliard came to me, says, "Mr. Fleming, you were right what--" I said, I can, I said, I understood.  I said, "You, you guys were just kids."  And I said, "You enjoyed that publicity."

Speaker 1: What do you think, when you look back at the '60s [1960s], you know, the whole period of the--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --well, '50's [1950s], '60's [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What do you think that period had in terms of the black, black life in the United States?
Speaker 2: You know what I thought when they first started, when all those white students were going down South, I said, maybe it's really gonna happen.  That's what I thought then.  Of course, you know a lot of white, some lost their lives down there.  And I thought maybe we're gonna have some real changes.  But it never happened the way I thought or maybe you thought either.  It never happened that way.
Speaker 1: What were you hoping for, sir, at the time?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I thought, at last we're gonna all be equal.  That's what I thought, was hoping that would happen.  But I was too optimistic.
Speaker 1: And when you look at the period of like the '70s [1970s], '80s, [1980s] and '90s [1990s], the '70s [1970s], '80s [1980s], and, you know, where black people are today, what do you think?  What are your--what do you think, you know, cause you've lived a long life, and you've seen a lot of things.  And, and some people think that life for black people began in the '60s [1960s], you know, some people think that.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: But I'm just saying, from that period, the '50s [1950s], '60s [1960s] on, what do you--when you look at today and you look at the state of black people, what are you, what do you think?
Speaker 2: At one time, as I told you, when those white kids was going down South and joining the black kids, and fighting segregation where it was so deeply embedded, I thought maybe a change was gonna happen.  But that wore off, and I think our biggest problem now, and I hear it from, you know, working-class blacks, it's about, they see, you know, some of these entertainers, the big salaries they--you know, the athletes and other entertainers making big salaries, they think that we got a lot of money.  I said, "We don't even have a big bank in this country, not a single one."  I said, "We don't have a bank in this country who has assets of a half billion dollars even."  I said, "They have the big banks yet."  I said, "They control the economy."  And it seem like they can't understand what I'm trying to say.  It's "Oh well, we can get it."  Well, I don't think our people understand well enough.

Speaker 1: Adopting this term African American, 'cause when I look at Africa, I don't see anything over there that I want to be a part of.  There's nothing over there.  They're still fighting one another.  They're still killing one another and, and I always thought South America [sic, South Africa] was the most advanced country down there.  The president down there [Thabo Mbeki] denies that, that, that AIDS is a problem, serious problem down there.  And I can't--[Nelson] Mandela wouldn't do that, but this, this character who's in there now, they're in there looking--and where [Robert] Mugabe is president [of Zimbabwe].  They want to be president for life.  I don't understand that.  If you're gonna have a democracy, have a democracy.  In the [Democratic Republic of the] Congo, they're still killing one another.  And I sometimes wonder about some of the things that they say about history in Africa years ago.  And I have many doubts about that, because a lot of people thought when, when Alex Haley wrote that book ['Roots'], this was true.  I said, "How in the hell is it going to be the truth," I said, "He don't know any more about what was going down there than I did, do."  I said, "Because one thing, there's no written language in Africa."  I said, "This to come down from word to mouth, from generation to generation."  And I said--there's a lot of deviation when it's coming down from, you know, by word of mouth.  And, and, and, and I wonder sometimes, particularly, when I, when I see the things that's going on over there.  I, I've asked them, I said, "Would you want to go over there?"  I've only been to Africa once and that was in, in Cairo [Egypt].  And, and the appalling poverty I saw over there.  I wouldn't want to live in Cairo.  It's a big city too.  You know, they have a population around seventeen million, but I saw all those people sleeping in the, in the terminal building in the airport there, and all the beggars out there on the streets, I saw then.  I, I wouldn't want to live over there.  For historical reasons, I enjoyed that I saw the Nile River in person.  I enjoyed that. And, and this is something I can remember to talk to people about.  And, and, and, and Shirley, you know, Shirley DuBois was still living over there then.  And I called her when I got there.  And she says, "Tom, what are you doing here?"  I said, "I'm over here"--remember when Adam Clayton Powell went to Jakarta [sic, Bandung, Indonesia] and they formed that Asia-African people unity conference [Bandung Conference]?  They had the convention in Cairo that winter.  That's why I went there, 'cause we were invited.
Story_ID: 7115
Speaker 1: [Carlton] Goodlet and I used to go to a lot of international conventions.  I think we were the only black people that did that in the country.  We went to all of those things like that because you learn things that way.  And I would--and, and I can always say I've been to Africa because of this little paper here ['Sun-Reporter'] that I work with.  I've been to, I've been to Asia.  I was in Tashkent [Uzbekistan] 'cause the Russians circumstance--the Russians wanted to take me to Vladivostok [Russia], you know, that camp in Siberia .  And I promised my lady friend I'd be back on the Fourth of July 'cause she always rented a cabin up there on a Russian river every summer, and I wanted to get back there by the fourth so I could join her for--but I didn't.  The Russians had--wouldn't, wouldn't give me my passport (laughs).  They had it--they, they were mixed up because they had the--I asked for Thomas Fleming.  They had Fleming Thomas, and they said, "Well, we got Fleming Thomas."  I said, "That's my name."  And they held me over, and I missed my plane.  I had to stay over there another day.

Speaker 1: Jazz, and you were starting to talk about one of your favorites?
Speaker 2: [Duke] Ellington.  He had the best group of musicians that ever been assembled.  He was a great composer.  The first time I saw him, I saw him in your town [Chicago, Illinois].  He had never been up here in Northern California, and he'd been down in Southern California in--you know, made pictures down there.  But he hadn't been up here in 1930 yet.  And when I came into Chicago for the first time on the Overland Limited [rail line], and I got the ['Chicago] Tribune' at the Northwestern station, Duke Ellington is at the Oriental Theater [Chicago, Illinois].  I went down there, and sat through three shows.  One of the--'cause, you know, we used to listen to him out here at night when he was playing, from the Cotton Club [Harlem, New York], you know, we all liked what we heard.  And we all remembered he made the movies before he came up, but he still hadn't been up here yet.  So I saw him in Chicago, and I wrote Kate [Fleming] a card right away 'cause she liked him as well as I did.  I said, "I saw the great man at last."  And one of the other reasons why I liked him because Ivie Anderson grew up around here, you knew that didn't you?  She was born down there in Gilroy, California, and she used to hang out up here before she moved to Los Angeles [California].  Lawrence Brown on the trombone went to high school in Oakland [California], and I knew Lawrence, and I knew his brother.  He had two brothers that was out here still.  But I just think the man was the greatest composer that America's ever, ever produced, I think.  He had the greatest band--everybody has to acknowledge that.  And to me, just, there wasn't anyone like him.

Speaker 1: What do you think black people's the--what are our contributions to the United States?  What contributions do you think we've made?
Speaker 2: We helped to build the country (laughs).  They, they brought us over here for cheap, for free labor.  We did as much as anybody did in building this country.  And yet they want to, want to cast us aside.  One of the things I tell some of the people I out here, I say don't become too upset.  You hear some of them say, make derogatory remarks about the Mexicans.  I said, "The white man found the Mexican here."  I says, "If you know your history, the white settlers took California away from Mexico."  This was part of Mexico.  I said, "As they did it in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas."  I said, "It's always been a big Mexican population coming."  When I came here in 1919, there were a lot of Mexicans living in Chico [California], far more than there were blacks, every little town in California 'cause the SP [Southern Pacific Railroad] used them as section hands.  Then you had, you know--the biggest business in California is agriculture.  They brought, constantly brought them in here from Mexico to work, work the fields.  And, and, and I was aware of this from the first time I'd been in--there were more Mexicans in Los Angeles [California] than there were blacks.  Yet, Los Angeles had more blacks than any city on the West Coast.  But the Mexicans have been there all the time, and they didn't start becoming politically active, the way I see it, until we did.  They saw what we was doing.  So they became politically active.  And I have a feeling that, that it's gonna be--soon there'll be a, a Mexican--a person of Mexican descent elected governor of the state, I think.  That's the way it looks to me right now.  I don't think Oakland [California] will get another black mayor cause the Mexicans are asserting themselves in, in politics over there.  So what I say to people over there, they form alliances with organized labor--if such a thing is still around--and with the Mexicans, form alliances.  You support me, I support you.  Well, one of the big things I've seen out here in California, we don't have money to put in the political campaigns.  The Mexicans---some of them, can write to Mexico and get financing, you know.  But where in the world can we write anywheres and with any kind of financing if we don't get it right here?

Speaker 1: You have a great love for the [San Francisco] Bay Area, don't you?
Speaker 2: I don't know if it's a great love, but I give--think I was too lazy to move (laughs).  I stayed because I, I didn't see any reason to leave.  And I like the climate around here, particularly in San Francisco [California].  It doesn't become too hot in the summertime.  If it does, it doesn't last long.  It doesn't become too cold because we don't see any snow here.  You might see it over there in the hills around here, but not, not here in San Francisco.  And, and I think I'm too lazy and don't want to move now.  I've been here so long.
Speaker 1: What do you think is unique about this part of the country?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't say anything is unique.  I'd say--unique, maybe I was just too lazy to move on.
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughs), when you look at the black community--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously)  'Cause I, you know, I, I could never forget New York City.  There's nothing out here that looks like New York because I went there at an early age, and I've been back there quite a few times since I've become an adult, just like I've been to Chicago [Illinois] quite a few times too.  And, and, and then the climate is one of the things I liked out here.  And, and then having worked in the, in harvesting the crops, that, that might have had something to do with it, because in the little towns like Chico [California], everybody had fruit trees in their yards.  Some had almonds, some had apricots, some had peaches, apples or pears and vines, blackberries, grapes, figs, everybody.  And you found all the produce that come out of California, you find them there in Chico, in most of the yards up there.  The, the city, I don't know whether the city did it, but all through the city streets there, they had big black walnut trees there and fig trees, everybody had them in the front, they'd be dropping on the sidewalk.  And I got used to it, eating a, a lot of fruit, and, you know, picking it from the trees, is one of the things I like.  We had two orange trees in our yard in Chico, and we had one peach tree, and we had an almond tree.  I didn't have to go anywhere to get any food.  I could get it right out there in the yard.  And, and I--that's one of the things I still like, they grow a lot of produce here in this state.  And I helped to harvest a lot of it 'cause, you know, not only working in the fruit, but I worked in the, out there in the rice fields also, cause, you know, we--a lot of rice ranchers around Chico and all through that area also.  So I did that all, you know.  So, you know, coming from a big city to a little town like that, was quite a change, and becoming adjusted the way I did, and, and seeing the difference.  Now, had I, I, I--maybe I would have gone to New York and, and been able to earn a living, but I just didn't ever go because I was--one thing, my mother [Mary Golee Jackson] and my sister [Kate Fleming] was still out here.  And they weren't, they weren't real young when they died, although my mother died young in '57 [1957], but I enjoyed being with them.
Story_ID: 7119
Speaker 1: You had a profound love for your mother [Mary Golee Jackson], your mother and, and sister [Kate Fleming], and you guys were very close.  And I want--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) We lived together.  Katie didn't ever marry either, and we stayed with Mama till she died.  We took care of her after we became adults and started working.  We supported her because we knew what she had done, done for us.  We knew our father [Henry Courtney Fleming, Sr.] didn't do it--although when he came out here when I was thirty-three, he stayed out here, and sent for his daughter by his second wife.  And you know where he brought her?  To our house, and Katie told him, said, "This is your child.  You find a place for her to live," 'cause she was eighteen then.  She said, told him, "You find a place for your daughter to live."  Well, Katie said, 'cause Thelma come in there, she was--it was nice, she knew she had a older sister and brother.  And it wasn't put on.  She was glad to see us, but we didn't warm up to her the way she did to us.  She's always been anxious to see us, I guess.  I thought about it, you know, afterwards, and, and--but, but Katie never did get too warm to her 'cause she told my father, "That's your daughter.  You find a place for her to live."  Well, one thing, he brought here, and she stayed with us a few days.  She started calling Mama, 'Mama', and you know that infuriated my sister (laughs).  It didn't bother me like it did her.
Story_ID: 7120
Speaker 1: What are your comments about the black press?
Speaker 2: I think it's necessary.  I think we need an editorial opinion because the white press has never treated us like the black press does.  The black press--white press, daily press, let's put it that way--they give us the most attention in criminal matters.  And we cover the, the cultural aspects of, of black life in this country.  Some of them are trying to do it now, but they don't do it the same way we do it.  I don't think they do.  They haven't yet, and I don't think they intend to, because they don't get no advertising revenue by being nice to us, you know.  And they still gonna get that revenue, whether they do it or not.  So I don't think we've really been considered that important by the daily papers.  The staffs now are integrated, but I can remember a time when you would find blacks working only in Boston [Massachusetts] and New York.  You remember, what's his name, Gordon up there on the 'Boston Globe', and I think Ted Poston was working for the, for the 'New York Post'.  Well, then, that was all.  I don't think Chicago [Illinois] had any of them.  And but they, they've made some good advances because I think the, I think the managing editor of the ['New York] Times' now is black, I think he is.
Story_ID: 7121
Speaker 1: But the number of newspapers are going down gradually every day.  I think in time, it'll only be the 'New York Times' and the 'Chicago Tribune' and the 'Los Angeles Times'.  They'll be the leading papers in the country 'cause T.V. is knocking them out. 'Cause I remember when, I think, when there were six daily papers in Chicago [Illinois], and there was about twelve or fourteen in New York.  Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] had four, Boston [Massachusetts] had four.  Detroit [Michigan] had at least two papers, they're down to one now, just like San Francisco [California].  And newspapers are gonna become a dead thing in time, I think, in the United States.  I think the, the boob tube has taken over.  And the--people want to see the action, I think, and maybe they don't want to read anymore, I don't know.  But I didn't think the, the family who owned the ['San Francisco] Chronicle' would sell out to William Randolph Hearst here, although Hearst started his empire here in San Francisco, but the, the 'Chronicle' was always the most--more influential paper here, more than the ['San Francisco] Examiner' was, because maybe a lot of it is due to William Randolph Hearst's lifestyle too, you know.  He was a spoiled brat.  He bought everything he wanted.  I guess you heard about that, that, that mansion that, he got down there at San Simeon [California].  He has a castle up there on Mount Shasta [California].  That castle on that Mount Shasta, and that big thing down there in San Simeon, you know, he saw castles along the Rhine River that he liked, he had them all taken down piece by piece and shipped over here and put them up again.  One of the guys--and he's still with--he's with the 'Chronicle' now since the 'Examiner' bought out the 'Chronicle', Malcolm Glover.  He was born up there near Dunsmuir, California.  That isn't far from where the castle--the Hearst's castle is up there in Mount Shasta.  His father was the caretaker for the castle.  Malcolm, when he graduated from high school, his father took him down to San Simeon.  That's where he met the old man.  The old man got on the telephone and called up Hearst, said give this boy a job, and he's still there.  He's one of my, the friends I met when I was working.
Story_ID: 7122
Speaker 1: Sir, what was one of the best experiences you had while you were, you know, editor [of the 'Sun-Reporter']?
Speaker 2: I think the best experience is being with a paper, meeting all the people I met, and it's been, it's been quite a life to me.  I've, I've, I've seen a lot of things probably I never would have done had I not become affiliated with a newspaper.  And I was on the board of directors of the San Francisco Press Club for two years, and was on the board, 'cause [Carlton] Goodlett and I tried to get into everything where we thought blacks should be.  Before we applied, there wasn't any blacks in the members of the San Francisco Press Club, but we went after them, charged them with racial discrimination.  They put a man on there named Walter Stafford, Jr. to say that they weren't prejudiced.  Then they took me in.  And then they took Goodlett in afterwards.  Well, that young man they took in, he never did attend--never did come by the club even.  But I, I was on the board so I had to go for two years.  But it was nice to go there.  And I--if it was still like it was and I was still a member, this is where I'd take you for lunch.  That's where we would eat lunch there, as a club member.  I used to go there and, and buy my booze and put it on the tab, and, and it was nice.  And then, then we tried to get into everything where we thought people should go, regardless of color, 'cause one of the first things Goodlett did when he came here, he after the [San Francisco] County Medical Association, and that's a doctor's--there weren't any black doctors in it because there hadn't been many here before the war [World War II].  He went after them.  They took in about five other doctors before they did him, but he was the one that went after them.

Speaker 1: Now sir, I'm going  to ask you about three African Americans, well, leaders, one is [Rev.] Jesse Jackson?  What are your thoughts about him, Reverend Jackson?
Speaker 2: I've always wondered about Jesse ever since he appeared on the scene.  I wondered whether he was selfish, or looking for advancement for himself or whether he was working to bring about changes.  And I still haven't settled my mind just what his purpose is in life.  Jesse has done very well financially, because he doesn't go anywhere the people call him unless they pay him.  And, and I'm not surprised by some of the things he does because he's, he's a black Baptist minister, and I know they're scoundrels, so many of them are.  And he's just another scoundrel to me and some of the, the claims he makes, like he was so close to [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  I don't think that's true.  But he goes--I think his son [Jesse Jackson, Jr.] is making a good Congressman from your, from your city [Chicago, Illinois], and I think his, his son's objectives might be different than his father's too.  I, I have a lot of admiration for his son.  I'm, but I'm not saying--I've never been too sure about just what--what Jesse wants.  And he's known, each time that he sought that presidency there was no chance in the world that he was gonna made--get that nomination to be President of the United States.  And the unfortunate part of it, there are so many blacks, unlike you and I knew, it never was a chance in hell that he was gonna be elected President of the United States.
Story_ID: 7124
Speaker 1: Another loud mouth that I don't care too much for, I think he's completely dishonest, is [Rev.] Al Sharpton.  Sharpton is a rabble rouser to me, 'cause he could, he can pickets out in the streets very quickly.  But outside, outside of his, his, his world, they're not sure about how many blacks he can get into action.  I don't think he can get very many at all besides those street followers out there, because the man has no education, no formal education that I've, I've been able to discover.  He's called himself a preacher ever since he was a kid.  And the, and, and, and to me, he's not genuine, the way he styles his hair 'cause he, to me, he's wearing a conk, you've heard that term (laughs), and you know what I'm talking about.  And no real minister is gonna do--dress, dress that way. I don't think there's any sincerity in him.  And, and, and how he fell into that trap up there about that [Tawana] Brawley girl up there in, in Upstate New York, but that doesn't seem to bother him that this girl was caught in a lie.  He's still seeking the presidency.  There's no way in the world that he's gonna be elected to any public office because I think the, the world, outside of the few people there in Harlem [New York], see that he's nothing but a street hustler, that's all.  I don't--that's the highest I can, I can, I can place him, being a street hustler, because he can speak the language of the streets.  And, and it's regrettable that the press gives him all, all of that publicity he gets with every time he opens his mouth.  But I think the, the press deliberately does that, 'cause they want to present these type of people as being the best that they've got.

Speaker 2: Same thing.  He's doing, He's doing a lot of good things that, that [Rev.] Jesse [Jackson]--I mean [Rev.] Al Sharpton isn't doing.  I, I would say that.  I personally wouldn't become--ever become Muslim, but I like what they're doing with their people.  I, I like that.  I--and, and they're, they're teaching people to clean themselves up.  If they, if they're indulging in, in things that I don't think are good social performances, they--they're teaching them to do that.  I, I, I know--but like I said earlier to you, I don't think too much of any religion.  I liked Elijah Muhammad because he taught those people how to clean up.  And one of the things that always mystified me, how they sold that paper, 'Elijah Speaks', they sold it nationwide.  They had no, no advertising in there, but it they sold that paper.  And, and, and I had a lot of admiration for Malcolm X, as a person, right, because he saw through a lot of that, that, that crap, better to me, better than anyone else did, 'cause when he went over to Mecca [Saudi Arabia] and made that trip over there, you know, what Elijah was preaching that only colored people are Muslims.  And when, when Malcolm went over to Mecca, he came--when he came back, he said, I, he said, "I saw blond, blue-eyed Muslims over there."  And he saw that the Muslim religion is the same as the Christian religion.  It includes everybody, regardless of race.  And, of course, they didn't like him.  And, and I think it was the [Black] Muslims who killed him.  I talked with, with him.  That's the only one I ever spend any the time talking, I talked to him in the office that he came by there.  And I liked him because he understood the language of the street also because he'd been a street hustler.  And he was honest.  And I think that's the reason why they got--now, Farrakhan, I don't, I don't know much about him.  I don't know whether the Islamic world is using him or he's using the Islamic world.  Maybe I'm behind time in a lot of things because there might be more American-born blacks who are members of the Islamic faith also, more than I think that there are.  But I put that as just another form of religion to me.  I don't think I need them at all.  And I have respect for them.

Speaker 1: I think that we're getting in--what's gonna turn out eventually, to be a, a religious war.  And that's the worst kind of war we can become involved in.  I, I remember when the, the history teaches me that Islam came out of the Arabian peninsula first, the Arabs did, 'cause the Jews had been in Palestine much longer than the Arabs have.  But for, for reasons of being persecuted, a lot of them left there.  They went Europe and other places.  But there was enough of them stayed there.  And they were there before the Arabs were, 'cause I know, when Palestine was a part of, of Turkey, the Arabs and the Jews weren't fighting anywhere because the Turks kept order.  They didn't, they, they wouldn't let that stuff happen while they were running that, that part of the world.  And I think it should, could still be that way.  I don't, I don't know why it's the way it is now, because as I said, I don't have much use for any religion.  I, I watched the Irish over in Ireland, the Catholics and the Protestants don't hate--they hate one another.  And you know from history, the Hundred Years' War, that was between the Catholics and the Protestants.  Then there was another one, they called the Seven Years' War, that was between the Catholics and the Protestants.  Why?  They're all talking about they worship one God.  So I don't think God tells them, tells them to fight one another like that.  And, and, and I think if, if this, it degenerates into a, a religious war because I think Indonesia is coming in.  You know, that's a big Islam country--Islamic country too, they have a population over a hundred million there.  And there are a lot of Muslims live in China.  Out of two million people there, there could be a half billion over there, who are Chinese, I mean Islam, you know.  They, they found the Islamic therapy.  And, and, and there are a lot of them there in what used to be the Soviet Union.  So I think we'd get into an awful mess right now that, that could get out of hand because, in time, some of these people could get some nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons.
Story_ID: 7127
Speaker 1: I just hope that people learn to live together in peace and forget this, this phony stuff of race and religion.  That's what I would like to see happen, although I have grave doubts it'll ever happen because you got so--mankind is such a complex person himself, because we don't all think alike, on any given subject.  But all I can do is hope for the best for humanity, just hope that they don't destroy one another, 'cause that could happen, 'cause nobody has eliminated their nuclear weapons arsenal, nobody has, the old Soviet Union hasn't, neither have we, neither have the Chinese, and whoever else has them.  We know the Israelis ain't gonna eliminate them.  They've got them.

Speaker 1: And what do you want people to say about Tom Fleming?  What do you want them to say?
Speaker 2: That he was a pretty good guy (laughs).  I think that would be sufficient, 'cause I've never looked for any, any--but people have praised me, and I never sought anything like that.  I just like to live, you know, quietly and treat people the way I want people to treat me.  I think that's the, the best way to live on this earth--get along with one another.

Speaker 1: They're [black people] just beautiful people, that's all (laughs), just beauty, you get any color you want.  I was so glad to see that girl [Halle Berry] get that Best Actress Award [at the Academy Awards], and she never has denied that she's black, although her mother's white, but she has never denied it, has she?  I like that about her.  Some will do it, and try to hide it, but she never did it.  I, I think our people are wonderful people, for one thing to survive all, this--survive in the United States.  That survival began when they put them in those slave ships, you know, chained to the floor and in a hole.  And there they stayed all the time.  I think we're very strong people because that showed the world what sort of people we were.  But they took away so many things from, from us.  They took away our names, our language, and we were just thrown out here into another world, and not permitted to be treated as other people here in this country, when we came here.
