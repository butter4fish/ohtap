Story_ID: 571275
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask as kind of a warm up.  And the first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food, well I have recipes in the Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] recipe book and I gave them the--a lemon-filling cake, and the other one was grits, au gratin grits, which they liked so well, which I served at breakfast or lunch.  And then I used to make my lemon-filling cake for the church when we had social meetings.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Well, I like white and I like red.  So those happen to be the Delta colors also (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I like Chicago [Illinois] because it has three or four seasons.  I like the fall, the winter and the spring.  So I guess maybe, the fall when the trees are so beautiful that I like it probably best of all.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: A favorite?
Speaker 1: Vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, do you mean a place that I like?  I think we--my husband [General Lamar Harrison] liked to travel a lot and ever--during the summer time mostly we went someplace.  And of all our travels, I think the Far East and the Malaysia area were the most interesting ones that we had.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite?
Speaker 1: Phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No, I don't--I don't remember, you know, saying something all the time that I just happen to say.  I really can't say that I have a special phrase that I say all the time.
Story_ID: 571276
Speaker 1: So, I'm gonna ask about your family history now.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Victor Penman] side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we'll start with your mother's side.  And, can you give us first your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Annabelle Layne.  A-N-A-B-E-L-L-E [sic.], L-A-Y-N-E [Annabelle Layne Penman].
Speaker 1: All right.  And, what--what was her place of birth and date of birth?
Speaker 2: I really can't say.  She--her, her father had a large farm outside of Portsmouth, Ohio.  And she died when she was forty-eight years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you don't--so she died when she was forty-eight, how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was nineteen years old.  I had just finished two years at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, well, how much do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I know more about her sisters and she had a brother that came and visited us at one time.  She had a sister, Carrie [ph.], in Huntington, West Virginia.  And she had a sister, Armina [ph.], in Portsmouth, Ohio where she lived.
Story_ID: 571277
Speaker 1: She [Harrison's mother, Annabelle Layne Penman] had--the brother later on, he passed for white.  He was very fair.  He worked at the Selby Shoe Factory [Portsmouth, Ohio] and then he found--someone found--he stayed with us and the right--two doors below us was a white family and the man worked also at the Selby Shoe Factory.  And he noticed that Oscar--Uncle Oscar [ph.] was staying with us.  So he reported it and my Uncle Oscar was dismissed from his job.  So he went some--to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and from that time on, he passed for white.  He came back one other time that I remember.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, how did the other family members feel about that?  Do they talk about that at all?
Speaker 1: Well, they felt that if he wanted to work and he was discriminated against because of his color, they felt that that--it was all right for him to do what he felt that he had to do.  So we accepted it.  I only remember him coming back once again, and he stayed just a short time.  So after that, we never heard from him anymore.
Speaker 2: Do you know if he used the same name?
Speaker 1: I really--he used, as far as we knew, he did.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, he would be named Oscar Layne?  Is that--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was Oscar.
Story_ID: 571278
Speaker 1: Are there any stories from your grandparents on that side of the family?  Do you know much about your grandparents and where they came from?  Were they always from Ohio or?
Speaker 2: Yes, as far--then my--my grandfather on--on my mother's [Annabelle Layne Penman] side had started another family and a younger family.  I met some of the younger family, but I didn't know too much about them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it was right there in Portsmouth [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I remember going over to visit them, you know, one time, but I didn't particularly like the country life very--you didn't see anything at nighttime, it was all dark.  So I'm not--I'm not much on country life (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so where your mother was raised it was light--there was more of a town, it was in a town (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  I--and I think she used to teach because she was able, at that time they could teach if they just had an eighth grade education, as long as they could pass the test.  Because she was able to help me in my math when I would run into difficult problems.
Story_ID: 571279
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Annabelle Layne Penman] talk about growing up to you at all, about what life was like when she grew up?
Speaker 2: Not too much.  I don't reme- at least I don't remember if she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she have any stories that she shared with you that you can share with us?
Speaker 2: Well, one time her sister from Huntington [West Virginia] came down to visit us and brought her daughter.  When my Aunt Carrie [ph.] went over to visit with my Aunt Minnie [ph.], Inez [ph.] stayed with us for that--for a while.  And so, Inez, this was about 1921 I guess.  Inez pulled out a cigarette and started to--to--started to smoke.  So my mother said, "Her mother doesn't know that she's smoking and she got that up at West Virginia State College [West Virginia Collegiate Institute; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia]."  I had picked out West Virginia College to go to school, to high- to college.  And when Inez started smoking, she said her mother doesn't know that she learning that up at the West Virginia and you are not going to West Virginia State College.  So that killed West Virginia for--as far as my mother was concerned.  So my brother [Russel Penman] said, "Well mother, let her go to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]."  My brother, at that time, was at Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], which was in the same city.  And he said, "I will watch out for her and at Fisk, they are very strict on the girls."  So that is the--one of the reason why I was able to go to Fisk for two years.
Story_ID: 571280
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's--?
Speaker 1: Full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father was--name Victor Logan Penman [Victor Penman].  V-I-C-T-O-R, L-O-G-A-N, P-E-N-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: Now, what was his birthday?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  He died when he was fifty-seven with a heart attack.  And I was just nineteen, my mother [Annabelle Layne Penman] and father died two months apart.  So I knew I wasn't going to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] then.  So I--there was a vacancy in the school system, in the elementary grade so I went over to the superintendent and applied for the job.  And three days later, it came out in the paper that I had received the appointment.  So I--well, my mother was still sick.  I went up to Ohio State for summer school and enrolled in two classes teaching of elementary math--mathematics and also reading so I would be prepared to teach that fall in September at this elementary school.  So I taught the third grade for four and a half years.  Dur- in that time, I went up to Ohio State for summer school, and on the weekends I took extension classes from Ohio University [Athens, Ohio] and Miami University [Oxford, Ohio].  I was determined to get my degree from Ohio State.  And then one summer, I said to my friend that taught with me, "Let's go up to West Virginia State [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] for summer school because nothing but old married men go to summer school in the summertime at Ohio State."  So we had--we had bought a A Model Ford [Ford Model A] and we drove it up to West Virginia State College that summer, and that is where I met the man [General Lamar Harrison] who was a professor of education at West Virginia State that I later married two years later.
Story_ID: 571281
Speaker 1: Okay. Now I wanna stop here.  We--we need to go back to childhood.  We're--we're gonna get to that, we're gonna get to that.  But that's, okay, so that--that's the summary version of it, but we're gonna get into the details.  What do you know about your father's [Victor Penman] side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?  Can they--do they have any--any history that goes back to the 19th century that they talk about?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  I can--my grandfather [Russel Penman] was born in Danville, Kentucky.  He had three sisters.  His father was white and his mother was black.
Speaker 1: Now was he born into slavery?
Speaker 2: He was not a slave because the owner did not want his children to be slave.  So they were free blacks in there.  And my grandfather had a trade, he was a barber by trade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So grandfather was a barber and he was born in Kentucky, but he was--he was born during slavery days though right?
Speaker 2: He was born during the slavery days, right.  And he was a free black man at that time.  And he was a barber and he had three sisters.  So they were also free people.  So when the--when slav- when Civil War was over, he and his wife went to Meadville, Pennsylvania and there he set up his barbershop in downtown area.  He had five children.  He had three--three boys and two--and two girls.
Story_ID: 571282
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We--we used to go, my mother [Annabelle Layne Penman] and father [Victor Penman] and the child- my brother and sisters [sic. sister] used to go for homecoming of family reunion to Meadville, Pennsylvania.  And I was--the, the picture we have of all the family get together reunion was about 1909 that I have the picture of us all in front of the house.  I might also say later the site became a landmark for the city.
Speaker 1: This is the site that the homestead--
Speaker 2: Where the homestead was.  Yes.  It was a story and a half I remember when we went to visit, a large frame house, almost two stories.
Speaker 1: Why did they make it a landmark?  I mean, what was the historical significance of it?
Speaker 2: I really--I'm not quite sure.  Someone else told me that--who lived there at one time that that site had been made a landmark.  I don't know whether because he was one of the early blacks to move after the Civil War, moved there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you don't know if it has anything to do with him [Harrison's paternal grandfather, Russel Penman] or something that the building was involved in before he moved into it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause I sa- in the photograph, which we'll show later on, it's a very ornate old-style building.
Speaker 2: Yes it was.  I think it was built, I'm not sure--that he--you know, was built during his lifetime, I'm--I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right--
Speaker 2: I know it was there when we went in 1909, when I was almost two years old.
Speaker 1: Right.  There's a ni- nice picture of you on the porch there (laughter) at two years old, yeah.
Speaker 2: And all of the ladies had on long black dresses, which I guess was their Sunday best during that time.
Story_ID: 571283
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that you heard from your [paternal] grandfather [Russel Penman] about growing up in Kentucky or any--any?
Speaker 2: No.  Now my brother [Russel Penman] would've know because he went--when he finished high school, that Allegheny College was located there in Meadville [Pennsylvania].  So his first year in high s- in college was there in Meadville at Allegheny College.  And so some of the things that I have learned and some of the pictures he had and I had copies made for them when I started my book tracing the roots of a family.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, was your brother one of the first black students at Allegheny or was there a history of?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm sure he was, yes.  He was one of the first to finish high school because in, in Portsmouth, Ohio because most of the family, my family, when their children finished the eighth grade, that was their--they thought they had completed their education.  In fact, when my brother thought that too at one time when he was teasing my sister [Beatrice Penman] about having to go to school the next day and my father [Victor Penman] said to him, "Boy you get your books and you are going to high school."  So he was one of the early ones to go to high school there in the small town.
Speaker 1: That's a good story.  That's interesting.  He--he thought he was finished (laughter).
Speaker 2: And then he became finished and became a dentist, you know.  That was really interesting to see what happened because of my father insisted that he go to high school.  And he was probably one of the first.  And then my sister was probably the only one to finish, you know, at that time too when she finished high school.  She finished with cum laude.  She was a very bright student and person.  And so of course, I just knew that I would be going to high school and I knew I would be going to college, because my brother and sister before me had gone to college.  And--and in that class, senior class, there was only one black boy and myself.  And we both went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] for c- for our college.
Story_ID: 571284
Speaker 1: Now did your father [Victor Penman] have any stories about growing up in Meadville [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about going to school and how--how they were treated as black people in the community or?
Speaker 2: No and he--he didn't really.  He didn't talk much about that.  You know, after he got about fourteen years old, he ran away from home and he worked on a--he became a chef on a railroad and he worked at that for a long time.
Speaker 1: Why did your father run away from home?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: He never told you why?
Speaker 2: No he didn't.
Speaker 1: He was fourteen but he ran away from home?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And he had--I mean, from what you describe, he had a pretty good ec- he was economically well off for a black family in Meadville, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: That's--that's--
Speaker 1: They had a big house--
Speaker 2: Well, he was the oldest child and then later on in Portsmouth [Ohio], he was a chef at a Hawaiian restaurant in the downtown area.
Speaker 1: So, okay, now you say he ran away first, and then what happened after he ran away?
Speaker 2: I guess he worked.  He--I know he worked on the railroad at one time.  He was a chef on--he learned to cook, I guess.
Speaker 1: On the railroad?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, how long was he away?
Speaker 2: Oh until they--I don't think he went back until, I'm not sure--I'm not sure.  I know he always went, when we went--when the family--when he was married he went back, I know that.  But u- up, up until that time I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, all right.  So, I'm thinking--I was thinking he's probably born in 1870s I'm thinking and that when he was fourteen, we're talking about the late 1880s.
Speaker 2: He was fifty-seven when he died.
Speaker 1: And that was in 1920--
Speaker 2: The same time I was started--when my mother [Annabelle Layne Penman] and father died, I knew I was going to college right then and I got the--a job teaching at nineteen.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that--that's like 1926, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, yeah.  We--yes because I was at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] from 1924 to 1926.  Then I taught until I was almost twenty-five.  And that's when I married.  So I really never was able to teach after that because when I married, we went to Prairie View [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] and two in the family could not teach there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna get to that now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --but I just wanted to talk about your family first--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --before we get you that far.
Story_ID: 571285
Speaker 1: Just wanna make sure we--there were some stories about your father [Victor Penman] that you knew that you told those before we move on.  Are there--so, he didn- he never talked about growing up except--he didn't talk about what he did when he ran away or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I--at least--I just done remember.  You know, he may have talked with my brother are older.  My sister [Beatrice Penman], there was two--five years between our ages.  And two years between my sister and the oldest brother, Da- Russel [Russel Penman] and then Fred [Frederich Penman] was a half-brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell me, how did your parents meet?  Now he was in Meadville [Pennsylvania] and she's [Harrison's mother, Annabelle Layne Penman] in Portsmouth [Ohio].  So, so how--how did they meet?
Speaker 2: They met--they met in Ports- in Washington Court House [Ohio].  That was a city there in--near Dayton, Ohio.
Speaker 1: That's right, I know it, I know that city.  Yes, right.
Speaker 2: You know? Well that's and that's where my brother and sister were born.  I was born in Ports- Portsmouth.
Speaker 1: Washington Court House.  Now what were they doing in Washington Court House?  That's pretty far away from Portsmouth or Meadville.
Speaker 2: Well, he was running on the railroad at that time when they married.  And he was a chef on the railroad.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she accompanied him to Washington Court House?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: But--but they met in Portsmouth, but got married in Washington Court House?
Speaker 2: Right.  Yes, right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 571286
Speaker 1: What were their personalities like?  What was your mother's [Annabelle Layne Penman] personality like?
Speaker 2: Where what?
Speaker 1: Your mother's personality, what kind of person was she, what was she like?
Speaker 2: Well, she was a wonderful mother because we never were whipped corporally at all.  We ta- she'd talk to us about what was right and what was wrong.  And she had a very pleasant disposition.  She was a lady in my eyes--to decide--that would describe her.  She was a lovely person.  And when you look at her picture you see she was a lady.  And that is--she never punished, you know, any of our children.  She never punished, you know, she would talk, she would, you know, describe what she expected us to do and we just followed--did what she expected of us.
Story_ID: 571287
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your father [Victor Penman] now.  Wha- what was your father's personality like?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't--he was very nice.  He--I never had any problems with him.  He was easy to talk to.  I was one of his favorite, I think, children because if they needed some money and they would send me over to talk to him, you know.  And before my mother [Annabelle Layne Penman] died he said--well, I went over to get some money and he said, "Well it doesn't look like we're going to have your mother with us much longer, you never know."  That was a lesson to me.  To know, you don't know when you are going, because he died two months before.  He had been to a lodge meeting and he came back by the restaurant.  My brother [Russel Penman] had been pulling some of his teeth and so forth and he came home and he said to mother, "Well," he said, "I have--I don't feel so well."  He says, "I have some medicine I'm going to take in the morning."  He never got to take that medicine.  During--I got up early and--to look after mother and then I went in the dining room and I saw his coat on the chair.  So I said to--I ran and said to mother, "Father's coat is still on the dining room chair."  She says, "You go in and wake him up, Dorothy [HistoryMaker Dorothy Harrison]."  And so when I went in to shake him, I saw he was dead.  And so I ran in to where my sister [Beatrice Penman] was sleeping and I said, "Bea come, daddy is dead."  She said, "Shut your mouth you don't know what you're talking about."  And she ran in and so then she called my brother.  He was working on a night shift, both my two brothers worked on the night shift at the restaurant and she called and told Russel to come home, father is dead.  He said, "Shut your mouth you don't know what you're talking about."  They just didn't believe they--because people had said saw him alive the ni- night before.  And so when it came out around the, the, the Rev- Mr. Penman was dead, they said, "Oh no you mean Mrs. Penman" because we knew that she was going.  And they said, "No, it was Mr. Penman," and that was really a surprise for everybody, his death.  He died with a heart attack during the night.
Speaker 1: You were nineteen years old?
Speaker 2: I was nineteen.  I had just come home from Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  My sister got there before--my brother and I came home together from Fi- from Nashville [Tennessee].  And my sister, when she got home early, she saw that my mother did not have intestinal flu and changed the doctor.  And so that was when she realized that my mother had tuberculosis and died with TB.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's pretty tough at nineteen to have them both pass (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was.  I lost both my mother and father two months apart.
Story_ID: 571288
Speaker 1: Well, let me go back.  I wanna go back to when you were growing up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And now you--you were born and raised in Portsmouth [Ohio], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.  What were or do you have an earliest memory, an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have--when, you know, Portsmouth was a flood town.  It was between the Ohio [Ohio River] and the Scioto River.  And so one morning my father [Victor Penman] had gone off to work and then he turned and came back 'cause he'd heard about the flood.  Was--water was coming and so we lived in a one-story home.  So they put the st- the, the furniture up on blocks or something as high as they could.  And then we went to stay with a family of--that had a grocery store and they had the--a second story, they lived above it on 11th Street.  So we went to stay there and I can remember looking out the window and seeing the water rushing up the street, you know.  And then right across the street was a doctor and his fa- and his wife.  Then, they were up a little high and they thought they could stay there.  And--but the water kept going higher and higher and then they had to send a skiff, a boat across to pick them up and bring them over to--to where we were.  So there were several of us staying up there on that second floor.  But I can still see that water rushing up the street, the flood.
Story_ID: 571289
Speaker 1: Later on, my brother who lived--Fred [Frederich Penman]--who lived there finally he lost everything after he had been there a long time after we had all left, he stayed there.  He was a very gifted man.  He had--I guess a natural for--he could learn to play the piano and he had a little combo, and he also did carpentry work and he was employed to fix buildings.  You know, dilapidated and so forth.  So he was very, very gifted.  He didn't have much--he didn't go to high school, but he was a gifted man.  All much more than the rest of us, he had gifts.  I could--he liked to paint.  He would have hangings on the wall that he had painted and I admired him so much.  I think I was closer to him than anyone else in the family as we grew older.
Speaker 2: His name was Fr- Fred Penman, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, anyway that is the flood--
Speaker 2: Fred Penman is your brother?
Story_ID: 571290
Speaker 1: I have one other.  I remember when I was in the first grade [at Eleventh Street School, Portsmouth, Ohio] and this teacher had taken us over to the high school [Portsmouth High School, Portsmouth, Ohio] to do som- to do a program or something.  They--and instead of keeping us together, I ran and so I ran--I got lost.  And when I--mother [Annabelle Layne Penman] was out looking for me, you know, because she--
Speaker 2: Did you get lost in between the grade school and the high school trying to get from between--
Speaker 1: I'd gotten lost between--when I was in the first or second grade and I remember rushing trying to find my home again.
Speaker 2: Okay so, okay so, you--you got lost en route to the--
Speaker 1: Trying to le- after I left the high school, you see.  We didn't keep us together and so we all just ran.  And I lost my way home from the high school and I said to my mother, "Oh I lost my little home," (laughter).  So, she tried to--to comfort me.  And she really went down and told that teacher how she felt about letting me get lost too (laughter).
Story_ID: 571291
Speaker 1: And those are real two distinct things that I remember as a child of getting lost, having lost my little home, and the other is that water rushing up the street [in Portsmouth, Ohio] as we were, I guess--I must've been a very young child, about six or seven years old then, you know.  And--but I rem- and we ate.  They had stored chocolate drops, you know, you know, a large closet.  And my brother and I went in there and ate those chocolate drops (laughter) until our stomach hurt.  I remember getting a stomach ache from eating those chocolate drops.  You know, chocolate over this and white on the inside.  They were delicious, I still remember that delicious taste and I love chocolate to the right--to this--to this day, I must have one little piece of chocolate each day somewhere (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay. What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 1: What was that?
Speaker 2: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 1: I, I told you about the sounds, the water rushing up.  The tas- and the taste of chocolate; I still have that taste for chocolate.
Story_ID: 571292
Speaker 1: Sounds, you know, I've had this hearing problem since I was a for- since I went--I remember the first year in high school [Portsmouth High School, Portsmouth, Ohio].  I would always sit in the first or second seat because I had a problem hearing.  And so I think it was genetic because my father [Victor Penman] had a problem and my--both my brothers [Frederich Penman and Russel Penman] had problems of hearing.  And so, I--my mother [Annabelle Layne Penman] took me to a specialist and he was teach- trying to correct it by--up through my nose.  I remember he went up and I think I, I don't have much smell right now, you know, I probably would start burning something up and I wouldn't even sm- I wouldn't smell it.  I just don't have much smell, and it's a sinus problem that I still have.  And I take pills for sinus.  And--and so I don't have much of a smell right now even.  But--that--so, I really can't say much about--I have to when I cook, I cook by my timer.  If I don't turn on my timer, I will bill--burn up my food, you know.

Speaker 1: What was your neighborhood like?  Can you describe the house you grew up in and what your neighborhood was like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right.  On one side--it was a small house, I would guess probably five rooms.  And there was a white family on this side and there was a black family on this, on the next side.  And then next was a white family and another white.  It was a mixed neighborhood, right.  Now, but all the black children went to the one elementary school [Eleventh Street School, Portsmouth, Ohio] now, but if they lived up on what we called the hill, there was a family, a black family lived up on what we called the hill.  They went to a white school and there twins that lived down near the river on 3rd Street and they went to a white school.  They were supposed to go to the school in their neighborhood, but the black--white family, their children didn't go to the school, they went out of the neighborhood.  So it was--it was a racist city to some extent.  And when--and when I finished the high school [Portsmouth High School, Portsmouth, Ohio], I wasn't supposed to go in--in any social activities and so forth.  Oh, after about twenty-five years, they were having a homecoming for the high school and I got this letter asking me to come back to the ho- homecoming.  I wrote and told the man, he was a lawyer, who was chairing it.  I said, "No I'm not coming back.  I don't have any fond memories of the school.  I was not expected to attend any social activities, be in any of the clubs, Latin club, French club," and so it was a racist area school, and the whole town was that way.  And so he wrote me back and said--I think he must've been a Jew because he said, "I was discriminated against too."  And I could only think that he was the white fella that--and he said, "I am going to read your letter to the homecoming group," and he did.  And I had a letter from two of the girls that were my classmates.  And they--one said, in the letter, "I wanted to say something to you, but I just didn't know what to do."  She said, "You were so well dressed all the time."  And then there were these two twins and one of them wrote me too and said, you know, that she wanted to say something, she just didn't know what to do.  So they never, you know, made any effort to carry on a conversation with me.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So they read your letter at the reunion?
Speaker 1: They read--they read the letter to the students that came back to the school for the homecoming.  And then they--two of them wrote me a letter.  You know, and how--what they thought about me and all.  So that was the end.  You bringing out all those things that I had thought of, you know, when I wouldn't normally think about.
Story_ID: 571294
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)Now, what was the name of the--of the colored school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I'd said, but the thing that I appreciate from the school was that I got the basic foundation so that when I went other--to college I was able to succeed.  So I said the thing that I appreciated was that I got a good basic foundation, you know, and.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was the name of your grade school, first of all, what was the name, it was a colored grade school that--did they call it--did they call it that?
Speaker 2: Just, let's see, Eleventh Street School [Portsmouth, Ohio], it was just named for the--the Eleventh Street School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were your teachers there black?  Did you have black teachers in grade school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, oh yes.  That's where I taught back there in the--when me--and we had a principal that was black.  And the boy that finished high school [Portsmouth High School, Portsmouth, Ohio] with me that went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], he finished all four years and he came back and taught there at the school.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the principal, do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: Gentry [E.M. Gentry].  I don't remember names very well, but I remember him.  J-E-N-T-R-Y [sic.], Gentry.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.  And that's--that's where you went to grade school and you--you went to the--was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and then I went back and taught at the same place that I went to finish the eighth grade, did--went from first to the eighth grade in.  I went back and taught there.
Speaker 1: Now were there--
Speaker 2: From 1926 to about 1931.  When I went back to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] in January of the year, you know, and I finish--and I finished in '32 [1932].
Story_ID: 571295
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I didn't wanna get too far ahead 'cause I still got you in grade school [at Eleventh Street School, Portsmouth, Ohio].  I'm trying to follow a chronology.  So I'm--I'm trying to get you through grade school first, then get you to high school [Portsmouth High School, Portsmouth, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was seventeen when I went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, now we're still too far ahead (laughter).  I wanna go back to grade school.
Speaker 2: Okay, I was--I was--wasn't quite six years old when I went to the first grade.  See my birthday was in December and the school, when I went in September I was five years old, I was still five.  And I finished the high school when I was seventeen and I we--went to Fisk for the first, well I entered at seventeen (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. All right.  Now I wanted to stay with grade school for a minute (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Do you--did you have a favorite subject in grade school?
Speaker 2: I can say I did.  I--I liked history, you know, and that's what I majored in when I went to college.  I majored in history and minored in English and a second minor was in physical education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now we're gonna get you there in a minute (laughter), but I just.  What did you like to do when you were little girl, did you like music or did you like?
Speaker 2: I liked to read most of the time.  I begged--tried to get me piano lessons, but it didn't take.  I didn't do much good at piano.  We had a piano at home and, and so I just didn't.  I took piano lessons when I was a child, a young child.
Speaker 1: I think that--well they--wasn't it expected that--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: --wasn't it expected that young girls of--of character would play the piano or something like that at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  Uh-huh.  So they--they to- they gave--I took piano lessons for several years I remember.  But I didn't--I--I read--I just for--I read now, you know.  I read all the time.  If I'm sitting and looking at a T.V. I'm reading something.  I just--I love to read.  And my people, Stephanie [Stephanie Smith], would come and see me, bring me a book.  She would say, "What would you like to read?"  She'd come in for lunch and bring me a book.  And my people said, my grandnieces in Los Angeles [California], they send me four or five books at Christmastime.  Because I--they sent me Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] last book, you know.  And I was so happy to get the book and read, and that's what I'm reading now.  And then I'm--I'm reading also--sometimes I read novels and sometimes I read, I like James Patterson's novels.  I read quite, almost of them that I--that are published.  And then I read, you know, history things.  And I'm reading also the-'The Senator and the Socialite' ['The Senator and the Socialite: The True Story of America's First Black Dynasty,' Lawrence Otis Graham].  That was one of the early black senators from Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Oh Bruce, Blanche K. Bruce?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  I got his book over there and I'm not quite finished with it, about--I got about that--like much.  So, I--I still--I guess my mother [Annabelle Layne Penman] instilled reading to me.  That was one of the main things I could do was read, to go to the library and get the books.  So I'm--I am grateful for my mother for instilling reading into me, you know, that I--that I could go and get books when I was very young.
Story_ID: 571296
Speaker 1: It would be of great interest to people today to know your opinion of what it was like to grow up, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --for you to--to compare what it was like to grow up then to what it's like now?  This is a hundred years later, all right.  So, what was the difference, I guess, in then and now as far as you can tell us?
Speaker 2: Well, I can't say that all the parents were like my parents [Annabelle Layne Penman and Victor Penman].  We were different--my parents were different in what they expected us.  And even the people in the town [Portsmouth, Ohio], they'd--well like the boy that finished with me, we would walk home, walk toward--down the street and I would have to co- go another way at a certain corner and if I was--stand there and talk to him, somebody would come and went to tell my father I was standing on a corner talking with a boy, you know.  They just expected my family to be just so with their daughters.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--you were watched pretty carefully then?
Speaker 2: Yes, right, right.
Story_ID: 571297
Speaker 1: I guess my sister [Beatrice Penman] was a little different than me.  She never had much interest, she never married.  But that was one of the reason--is that when she was teaching in Kansas City, Kansas, you couldn't teach and be married.  You couldn't teach and be married.
Speaker 2: Now that was a rule in quite a number of school dis- districts in those days that you couldn't?
Speaker 1: Ye- I understand that so.  Yes, I understand that so.  I never got to teach because two in the family couldn't teach.  When we went to Prairie View State College [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas], the wives would go off and teach in some little town nearby and come home on the weekend.  But my husband [General Lamar Harrison] was not like that nor didn't want me to do that.  And then, when we--he became president of Langston University [Langston, Oklahoma] they would let two teach, but they wouldn't let the president's wife teach.  I taught two weeks when one of the teachers didn't come back because I had a master's [degree] then and a year on a doctorate.  They--I taught two weeks, and when he went to the board of regents and told them that I was teaching, they said we will not pay her.  Do you--I didn't get to--so I didn't get to teach the twenty years we lived in Langston [Oklahoma].  So when we came here [Chicago, Illinois] in '60 [1960] I decided I would go down and get a--teach part time.  So I went down and applied to teach part time.  So when my husband said when I came back and told him, he said, "What were they going to pay you?" when I told him.  I never had a problem with money between me and my husband though I wasn't working.  I had so much to run the house and what a--he would give me I bought my clothes and everything else out of it.  I had my own checking account and my own saving account, so I was never worried about money as to what I've spent or what at all.  So that was one of the difference between me and a lot of married women.
Story_ID: 571298
Speaker 1: Let me ask you a--well we still got you in school here (laughter), you know we keep--
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: We're covering a lot of ground, but I'm still trying to get you through school.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: What--who were some of your favorite teachers or did you have any mentors in town other than the teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I liked that tu- first teacher I had in the first grade [at Eleventh Street School, Portsmouth, Ohio].  I--I was--I liked her very much.
Speaker 1: Do you remember her name?
Speaker 2: Seemed like to me was Anderson [Louise Parker Anderson].  You know, seemed like to me it was Anderson.  Then I had the teacher in--in history, A.A. Taylor in Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], I liked very much, I liked very much.
Story_ID: 571299
Speaker 1: What about church, was church a big part of growing up, going to church?
Speaker 2: When I was growing up we were A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal].  You either--in that town, you were either AME or you were Baptist or the lady I stayed with was--when I was teaching was--I don't know what to call them, Holy, you know, we used to call them Holy Rollers (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: Or Pentecostal or I don't know, Sanctified, different things like.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She was a very nice person and the minister also stayed at the same house where we--where my friend and I stayed in those four years.  Well they were really three and a half because my brother [Russel Penman] stayed there one year before he went to Dayton, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your church in Portsmouth [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: A.M.E. Allen [Allen Chapel A.M.E. Church, Portsmouth, Ohio]--seem like to me was A--A.M.E.--Allen, A-L-L-E-N.
Speaker 1: Yeah that makes sense, yeah.
Speaker 2: This--this would--
Speaker 1: Named after Richard Allen.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.
Story_ID: 571300
Speaker 1: So you went to Allen A.M.E. [Allen Chapel A.M.E. Church, Portsmouth, Ohio], we were talking about church and was your family real active in church or just kind of, you know?
Speaker 2: My father [Victor Penman] didn't go to church much.  My mother [Annabelle Layne Penman] was a churchgoer.  She-and, and we would go to that--in the evening time on Sunday, but they called--I forget what they call.  Anyway, we were--we'd attend that for--at six o'clock, you know.  But my mother was a very active church member.  Then, you--you know, the years I was on a college campus for thirty years we had a nondenominational service on Sunday for about one hour.  So when I came here [Chicago, Illinois] in '60 [1960], well I did join a church.  I went to Quinn Chapel A.M.E. [Quinn Chapel A.M.E. Church, Chicago, Illinois].  But that was not the church for me after being on a college campus and listening for one hour on Sundays.  Their service was too long and they took up too many collections.  So I decided I had to find another church.  So the church--the man that was over--Grace Church [Grace Presbyterian Church, Chicago, Illinois] which is Presbyterian, he lived here and his wife, I liked him.  And then my friend, Beulah [Beulah Rolle (ph.)], who lives here in the building has--was always a Presbyterian in Newport News [Virginia] and so we became friends, and so I joined the Presbyterian church.  Later on it combined with Sixth [Sixth Grace Presbyterian Church, Chicago, Illinois], so I was active in the Sixth Grace Presbyterian Church at 35th [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue].
Story_ID: 571301
Speaker 1: So now what--what was--when you were in high school, I know you--you went to, was it Portsmouth High School [Portsmouth, Ohio] or what was it called (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)Yeah, right.  It was Portsmouth High School.
Speaker 1: And what--what year did you graduate?
Speaker 2: Pardon us what?
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate?
Speaker 2: Let me see, I graduated in '24 [1924], uh-huh, and went to college at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] in the former.
Speaker 1: What was the--what were teenagers doing in--in the early '20s [1920s], I mean what--what was the popular music, what was going on in the early '20s [1920s] when you were in high school?  'Cause I know at your high school you couldn't participate much in the activities--
Speaker 2: No. no.
Speaker 1: --but what were the kids doing in a black community, you know, did they?
Speaker 2: No.  What were they doing?
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause radio was new.  Radio had just come out about four years before.
Speaker 2: Right, right, that's right.
Speaker 1: What did they do, did they go to see live performances or was music popular or?
Speaker 2: I, well they would have social and they had something when they had the graduation.  And they had clubs like French club or those.  They had different clubs in the school, but I don't know what else, what they did out there.  I'm sure they had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But--but what did you do, what did you, what--what did you and your friends do?
Speaker 2: --they had sport activity, you know, they had football and--and basketball I guess.
Speaker 1: But ma'am, what did you and your friends do for recreation when you were a teenager?
Speaker 2: I told you, I read and I--we had a swing in the yard and I would sit in the swing and read, read, read.  And once on Saturday my younger brother [Oscar Penman] and I could go to see a show, matinee and that was it.  That was it.  I didn't do anything else except going to church with my mother [Annabelle Layne Penman] and going to that evening service for teenagers, you know, at the church [Allen Chapel A.M.E. Church, Portsmouth, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now yo--
Speaker 2: So that was it.
Story_ID: 571302
Speaker 1: So you said your mother [Annabelle Layne Penman] wanted you to go to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] like your sister [Beatrice Penman] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: You didn't wanna go?
Speaker 2: I wanted--because I would walk down the street and if there were someone coming on the same side I would cross over.  I was--I was not a social type of person 'cause I never had an opportunity to be a, you know, do social things or go belong to clubs or any--I--I didn't go visit even the friends that lived, you know, there in the city [Portsmouth, Ohio].  I--I just--I wasn't able to do--go--my mother didn't want me to visit the other girls.  So I was by myself most of the time and played marbles with my brother, you know.  I would--I would run and we had a sled and I would run when we had snow and run on that sled and my mother would look out the window and see me belly flopping on the snow--on the sled.  She stopped--knocked on the window and I was supposed to stop.  So I just played marbles with my brother and that was it.  We just--just didn't have much social life.  So that's the reason I wanted to go to a black college [HBCU].  There, I was--played on the baseball team and the basketball team.  I became more social, you know.
Speaker 1: So, there's a picture of you where you really look like you're really happy at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 1: So you were--you were glad to get away I guess, have a little freedom?
Speaker 2: And the same thing when I started teaching.  There wasn't much for me to do because I had--I, I, I was determined to get my degree and that's what did most of the time, studied, went to, went to, went to on the weekend I would take extension classes and in the summer time, I went to summer school.  And I was determined to get that degree from Ohio State because I had promised my mother I would graduate from--she felt that if I graduated from big school I would have a better chance of getting employed, a job.
Story_ID: 571303
Speaker 1: So well, tell us about Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] though before we move on.  What was life like at Fisk?  There was more freedom at Fisk, but black colleges [HBCU] then were different from what they--way they are now?  What are some of the differences?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.  Oh yes they were different.  You know, if you walked to the movie you walked just, you know, and you had--even if you have a date, a fella to come to see you, you know, you were supposed to do--it was very--it still is very tight, you know, socially.  You know, you didn't mingle too much with the men and just occasionally you would walk, someone would come and take me to the movie we would see and then you walked all--each of you walked down that sidewalk to the movie and then you all walked down that sidewalk, you know, back to your building.  And you--it was--it was start- you didn't go, you know, I--I didn't go out into the city [Nashville, Tennessee].  I maybe, right across the street there was a drugstore that would sell candy and things so I could go over there.  Then you sign out.  You know, if you went any pla- you went into the city, you had to sign in and you signed out, you know.  So they were still strict as far as the girls and boys together.
Story_ID: 571304
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned A.A. Taylor as one of your outstanding teachers [at Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there was another one that later became over the United States Department of Education and I'm just trying to think, he was a tall, (unclear) tall man.  He came back and--and stayed at my house and gave a lecture to the students--talked to the students.  I was trying--we had a mixed faculty, you know.  Most--the dean of women was a white woman.  You see, I think they had just turned--a black president before that, before they--I think the president was white before I got there and they just had elected and I can't remember his name, but they had elected a black one.  Then my English teacher was white.  I guess most of my teachers were white.  I had just maybe two or three that were black.
Speaker 1: Was Sterling Brown there?
Speaker 2: No, he came afterwards.  He came afterwards.
Speaker 1: What about Charles Spurgeon Johnson, was he there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh, yes he was there.  Wasn't he president?
Speaker 1: He became president.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was president the year I think when I went there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He's a famous sociologist.  Charles S. Johnson.
Speaker 2: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So he was pres- okay, so you--yeah, so I guess that would be the time.  Yeah, he was president then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  I think it was--he had just become president.
Speaker 1: What about a--was Arna Bontemps there?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Arna Bontemps, in the library, if I'm pronouncing his name right?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: He was a friend of Langston Hughes, he was a librarian at one point I know.  He may--may have come after you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, uh-huh.  Because the history teacher that the--Hope--[HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin had--he--he talked about A.A. Taylor, but A.A. Taylor was teaching but another man that he wanted to be his history teacher that, he specialized too in history.  And it was another fella--I--when I read John Hope Franklin's book, he--he discussed A.A. Taylor.  He didn't think too much of him.  And was another fella that taught history that he liked and took most of his work.  Yeah, I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, why did you like Taylor so much?  I mean, what was--what did you like about him?
Speaker 2: Well, he taught--he--he was very good in teaching in history.  He would ask you questions and well just history was a subject that I liked so well.  And I never had to take a final exam under him when I took history.  Du- he--during this course he would give tests and my record was always an A, so he would tell me you don't need to come for the final.  And I always got an A under his courses.
Speaker 1: Now, did he teach--were they teaching black history at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, see--yeah, right, uh-huh.  I--I thought he was a good teacher.
Speaker 1: Did--did you ever have like special guest speakers on campus when you were there?  Did people come to speak, some of the black leaders?
Speaker 2: I, I'm, I'm trying to remember.  You know, in dancing we talk about you didn't--you marched, you didn't, you know, you did hug the fella or he didn't, but you didn't dance close together.  You just had marches.  They played music and you marched around.  And you know, that was--you just didn't dance close together (laughter).  So they had pretty strict rules too, you know.  They asked me when I got ready, they found out the dean of women called me and wanted to know why I wasn't coming back.  She says, "I heard that you were not coming back for your junior year."  And I said, "I had agreed with my mother [Annabelle Layne Penman] that if I came for two years I would finish and get my degree from Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio]."  And so I--she called me, you know, to know why I wasn't coming back.
Story_ID: 571305
Speaker 1: Now what was Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] like?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, I--I stayed at a private home, the same home where my sister [Beatrice Penman] had stayed.
Speaker 1: In Columbus [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: In Columbus.
Speaker 1: It was on the East Side of Columbus or?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: On the East Side of Columbus or?
Speaker 2: It was on 1398 Hawthorne Avenue.  I can even remember the address.  So I would take, you know, a streetcar--a bus.  Well I guess maybe--did they have streetcars then?  Yeah, I would take a streetcar to the school, you know.  And I was able to--I was able to swim in the pool.  My sister couldn't even swim in the pool.
Speaker 1: So things have changed a bit (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  And so the--no, but it was--you didn't have much social life there, you know.  You just went to school too and back.  But I made, you know, pretty good sk- and when I wanted to finish because, you know, I didn't stay on the campus most of the time, the whole time I was there.  I stayed with this lady and would g- go.
Story_ID: 571306
Speaker 1: When I went back the fella that I met in--professor--at Oh- at West Virginia [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia], went back too because I wasn't getting married until I had my degree.  That was another thing, I wasn't going to get married until I had a degree in case that marriage didn't work out.  I would still have a degree to go and teach.  So he went back and got his, did all of his study work for his Ph.D.  He got a Ph.D. in 1936, which was early.  You know, not many people, black people had Ph.D.s back then.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, yeah, he was--that is some- something.  So he got his--this is G. Lamar Harrison [General Lamar Harrison], right?
Speaker 1: Yes, he got a Ph.D. in 1936.  So when he was going to school at the same time I was going to school to get my bachelor's [degree], a B.S. in education, he was working to get his doctorate in school amin--college administration [at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].
Story_ID: 571307
Speaker 1: Was it tough being a black student at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, you mean as far as class work is concerned?
Speaker 1: Well as far as I guess--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: --is how you're treated, I guess.  I'm thinking that you--there weren't many black students so?
Speaker 2: Oh I was--no, there wasn't many black students going, you know, to school then.  I was treated all right in my classes and all.  I remem- (laughter) I remember it--taking a history class and I wasn't getting what I thought I should be getting, the grade.  So I went to my professor and said, "I am not a C student, I'm at least a B or B plus."  So I got, and they told me because I wanted to take eight hours in summer school to finish because I went in January, went back, I got a leave of absence from my job and went back in January and did--January to June and I needed eight hours to finish summer school to get my degree.  And they told me if I made that quarter before I'd be average.  They would let me take eight hours in that six weeks' time.  So I made three A's that quarter and so I was able to take the hours I needed to graduate.  So I really did stayed--they had sent me my degree after to--to Prairie View State College [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas].

Speaker 1: Now you got married in what year did you get married?
Speaker 2: We me--got married the same year that I finished--we finished because I got my degree in Penman--in Penman, though we were married about oh--he [General Lamar Harrison] decided he wasn't going back to West Virginia State [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] because they, at that time, started cutting salaries there in, you know.  And so he applied for a job as superintendent in Wilberforce [Ohio], but they wanted the man to be married.  So we went and got married.  I didn't announce it, you know, only to my brother that I had married.  But that summer we married so that he could say he was--he was eligible because he was married.  And we went over to Indianapolis [Indiana] and his sister came and they--and the minister came and married us in another minister's church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were married in Indianapolis, this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ind- Indianapolis, Indianapolis.
Speaker 1: --so this is 1932.  Was this in '32 [1932] after you graduated from Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: And then I did--my brother knew we were married and his sister knew we were married, but I didn't tell my sister [Beatrice Penman] that I was married until later on.
Story_ID: 571309
Speaker 1: Then did he [Harrison's husband, General Lamar Harrison] take the job at Wilberforce [Combined Normal and Industrial Department at Wilberforce University; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?  Did he work at Wilberforce (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, went--we went over to Wilberforce.  But--and I met, let see what was his name, Anna Julian's [ph.] sister was married to the man, who was--it wasn't Percy Julian.  Well I was trying to think of the name because later on my husband was appointed a trustee of Wilberforce on the state's stri- side by the governor.  So when we went to Prairie View [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas], he didn't give up his Ohio residency because he was--was a trustee on the state's side of Wilberforce (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: And we would make trips every year back to the trustee meeting, you know.  And we went back.  I'm trying to think of the man's name that was president of--of Wilberforce.  He stayed, he was a doctor.
Speaker 1: Not Wesley?
Speaker 2: Wesley.
Speaker 1: Yes, Charles Wesley [Charles H. Wesley].
Speaker 2: He's right.  Yeah, he was--he--he became president and he combined them, you know, afterwards.  He combined the state and the church side so we would get more money in there.
Speaker 1: I--I think just, if you forgive me for correcting, they--they actually separated them, separated the--the state side from Central State.  Central State became a separate school and Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] a separate school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You're right, you're right, you're right.  Right.  That's right.  It's not--it's not to--
Speaker 1: They were together at one time.
Speaker 2: --it was not from Dayton, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Yes, sixteen miles away.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  So he stayed a trustee of Wilberforce for five years.  And we would drive from Prairie View up to Wilberforce and I would stay with my brother [Russel Penman] why he attended meetings at Wilberforce.
Story_ID: 571310
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And your brother [Russel Penman] became a dentist in Dayton [Ohio], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, right, yeah, yeah.  But as soon as he took the board he went to Dayton and set up his office there at Dayton.  And I would visit them during the summertime when I didn't--wasn't in school.  After I would go to summer school they'd po- in Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] and I would go over and spend a couple weeks or so with him in Dayton.
Speaker 1: So you were describing before we started the interview this house that your brother lived in in Dayton on Mt Clair Avenue where you could overlook--it overlooked the city.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was beautiful, it was really beautiful, yeah.  Mt Clair Avenue, uh-huh.  And that's where that picture was taken up there on his house on the grounds.  When--all of--that's the only picture I have of all of us together.  Of all of us together.
Story_ID: 571311
Speaker 1: Well it wasn't too long after your husband [General Lamar Harrison] graduated from Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] and got his Ph.D. in education that you all moved to Wil- to Prairie View [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] right, which is in Texas?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we went to Prairie View, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, well tell us about that--that experience.  You're going out to Texas for the first time, did you like Texas?
Speaker 2: Well, I never--when we deal in the stores near--in Prairie View [Texas] we'd dr- I never gave my first name to anybody, any of those white stores.  I was always Mrs. Harrison [HistoryMaker Dorothy Harrison], you know.  Because they believe if they know your name, they would call you Dorothy and I'd--I resent to this day sometimes people on the telephone will say, "Well now Dorothy."  I wanna tell them I was not Dorothy to them, I was Mrs. Harrison, you know.  I still resent someone, a white man on the phone calling me Dorothy by my name.  So you had to be careful when you went into the stores to shop.  I was always Mrs. Harrison.  I never gave my first name to them.
Story_ID: 571312
Speaker 1: So it was a close-knit family because the people lived there lived on--who taught there, lived on the campus, most of them, you know.  And they had cottages for the families and we lived in a co- first we had just had three rooms and then we were able to get one of the houses with five rooms.  So we were there [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] almost eight years, seven and a half years when my husband [General Lamar Harrison] was elected to be president [of Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma].  See his home was Oklahoma and used to be at--that first the man that was elected president, he went out of office every four years.  When the governor when out, the governor appointed the black man that supported him and campaigned for him, he became president of the school.  So my hu- husband when he went up for an interview he told them that he was not interested in, in cha- you know, being there for just four years.  And he didn't want it, and he told the governor that the school could not get accredited by North Central Association [North Central Association of Colleges and Schools] when they had the other president and were changing, and the staff did not have doctor [doctorate] degrees, you know.  And so he was there to get the school accredited by North Central Association.  So he had to--the library, they didn't have a separate library, you know.  And so it took my husband several years to get enough money.  When they first--he went to the legislature, you presented your budget to the legislature and they appointed--and so they approved it.  So they would only, at first, give him so much money and he says, "I cannot build the library for that.  I will--I don- will not take that money because it is not enough to build the library that we need."  So he waited another year and went back and they finally gave him money, enough to build the library.  And so that library, the legislature said we want the library to be named for you.  They passed a bill naming the library the G. Lamar Harrison Library [Langston, Oklahoma], and is still that's what the name is.  He got the roads paved up--going on the campus.  And they finally got the ch- the school accredited by North Central Association, you know.  And at first they thought when he told the board, his board that he was under--that he was trying to get the school accredited, they thought-they, if some of them came up and told the board what they hoped to do, they said it has to be what you have done, not what you hope to do to get the school accredited.  And he had to get a certain percentage of his faculty with Ph.D. degrees.  And he had to--the whole plan had to be, you know, had to be lo- had to be done to get accredited.  So he was able to get accredited by the North Central Association.
Story_ID: 571313
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am can you tell us, now--now you were at Prairie View [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] from 1936 to 1940, right, four years?  Was it four years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  You mean '32 [1932] to '30 [1930]--let me see.
Speaker 1: Thirty-six [1936] after he [Harrison's husband, General Lamar Harrison] got his Ph.D. to 1940 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, we were there before he got his Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Oh you did, oh okay.
Speaker 2: Whe- when we--when I finished Langst- when I finished Oklahoma City [Oklahoma], we went to Prairie View then.  He completed his work at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] but he didn't get his degree.  He hadn't written the dissertation, so he had to write a dissertation and he had five years to--to write that dissertation.  And he wrote it on the black colleges [HBCU].  He visited all those black colleges and he based it on that--on that study that he did of the black colleges (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now he wrote a book too, right, as a result of his study?
Speaker 2: So it was '30 [1930].  Yeah, he wrote a dissertation and he completed it and went up and took his--we were still at Prairie View when he went up to take his orals.  And--and he presented his--he had to take a oral exam on his--on his dissertation.  And then that--that's when he got--we were already in Prairie View.  You see fact is, he was on a trip to the black colleges when he was--when he was--let me see, when he was informed that he was pres- had been elected president of Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma].  I knew it because someone, one of the chapters sent me word that he--I would be the first lady of Langston in this telegram.  And I got the word before he got the word.  But he was on a trip visiting certain colleges, you know.  And so it--he--after he was in Prairie View then, oh about five years, then he got the degree.  He had to come back and take his orals, you know.  And then that was when in '36 [1936] he got the degree.  But he started working on it in--in--before '32 [1932].  Thirty-one [1931] I think he came up, we went to Ohio State and--and completed his--all--all the course work he needed.  He had to take exam on German and in French, both language when you get it in of p- Doctor of Philosophy.
Speaker 1: Okay so, but--did he--were things--I mean, why did he leave Prairie View, I mean, was there a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was, at that time, when he was in Prairie, he was--he was head of the education department.  And he decided--then he applied for--for Lan- for Langston for--to be president of Langston.  He was also a former resident of Oklahoma.  See that's where his father and them lived.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's from Guthrie [Oklahoma], right?
Speaker 2: No, he was from Cache [Oklahoma], he was out from Cache, C-A-C-H-E, that's where he had--they had this hundred-acre farm from town, and Cache, was out from Fort Sill [Oklahoma] (laughter).
Story_ID: 571314
Speaker 1: So the move to Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma], now Langston, was it called Langston then?
Speaker 2: He, he [Harrison's husband, General Lamar Harrison] got the word in 1939.  And 1940 in January we moved to Langston [Oklahoma].
Speaker 1: Okay, now was it named Langston in those days?
Speaker 2: Langston, it used to be.
Speaker 1: See here it says (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because it used to be something else when he go--when he was elected and he got the name changed to Langston when he was president because it was A and--
Speaker 1: It says here it was Colored Agricultural Normal University (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was--Langston is one of the eighteen state colleges would set up in the South so that they could--the black people had to go to the black college in those states.  Eighteen state--eighteen--it was by a--by an act of [U.S.] Congress that they had to set up these states so that they would provide higher education to the blacks.  Like one time I couldn't say that word.  (Laughter) Yeah, we were colored.  Yeah, remember when we were colored?
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am (laughter).
Speaker 2: I--I was working for the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] and one of the staff people got us to say black.  And we cha- you know, it was hard for me to say black, now it's hard--I said that black for so long, it difficult for me to remember to say Afro Americans (laughter).  We are now Afro Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Langston--so--so--Langston was a state school?
Speaker 2: It's--it's a state school, yes.  It's a state school.  It was called something A--agricultural and A and--like you say A and T [agricultural and technical], it was--it was called something else.
Speaker 1: It says here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so the Langston is from the man named Langston was--
Speaker 1: John Mercer Langston.
Speaker 2: Yeah, John Mercer Langston, yeah that's why.  He had to tell them, why would you want to name it, there's a little town, a black town, named--that is Langston, Oklahoma.  Why would you wanted to name it from a little black town.  He said no, it is for John Mercer Langston, that is why I want to change the name to Langston.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Langston University, is it in Langston?  It's not in Langston, Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's in Langston, Oklahoma.  Uh-huh, yes.  It's right--was right on the highway, the highway divided Langston University from the little town of Langston.  The main highway went through.
Speaker 1: Well the tradition is that Langston is a black town, is that--that true pretty much?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It is one of the--I think there're eight black towns in--at one time in Oklahoma.  The girl that worked for me was from Boley [Oklahoma].  Boley was an all-black town, you know.  There--I think there were eight of them, all-black towns.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, yes, says here the name used to be Colored Agricultural and Normal University (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And right, right.  Yes, that's what he had it changed to.
Speaker 1: Okay, he changed it to Langston University.  Named for John Mercer Langston who was a--a educator in Ohio.  He's from Virginia but ended up in--
Speaker 2: I think he's from Virginia, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he ran for state legislature in Ohio, he and his brother, Charles [Charles Henry Langston] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That may be so yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I think, I think he, he served in some capacity in Ohio.
Story_ID: 571315
Speaker 1: So now you're the first lady, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, now I am first lady of the white house (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes and you're a young woman, you're only thirty-three years old, right?
Speaker 2: He [Harrison's husband, General Lamar Harrison] remodeled, the house was a red brick when we went there and he had his department of building, I forget was a department that taught people who to build things.  And he had them to stucco the house and add rooms to it so, you know, and a garage so that it was funny, we had five bedrooms.  And the last time I was there in--in 2003 when I got my honorary degree, it had been made into a place for visitors to stay and the president's home was way across the highway, you know, separate.  The person didn't wanna--we were right in the center of the--of the school, you know.  The white house was, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well how did you like Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma] or did you?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a, you know, sort of a well-knit town and then I shopped most of the time and socialized in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma].  I belonged to a bridge club in Oklahoma City.  So the--the person that was head of the--of the home ec [home economics] department and I were very close friends.  And we would drive to Oklahoma City for our bridge clubs meeting.  And I did most of my big shopping in Oklahoma City.  However, their--the near town was Gu-Guthrie [Oklahoma], thirteen miles, and we did most--that's where we did our grocery shopping things.  And then I bought some things there at a clothing store.  The lady would shop in New York [New York].  She would go to New York and shop.  And she would ask me what I would like to--her to bring me back.  So she would bring me back name, big name, you know, clothes.  And she knew my size and what I liked and what color I would want.  So she shopped for me in New York and bring me things when I didn't go to Oklahoma City.
Story_ID: 571316
Speaker 1: Now was Oklahoma, I, I know we've seen the pictures of Oklahoma in the '30s [1930s], the Dust Bowl, it's all dried up, it's the Depression [Great Depression], everybody is poor (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hurricanes and all.
Speaker 1: Yeah, hur- tornados.  So what's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there were certain times of the year you would expect those hurricanes and you got and you were supposed to go down, if you have a basement or something, we just got to the place we never paid any attention.  So we never--I never went to the basement, you know, when they said the hurricane was coming through.
Speaker 1: So, so you never experienced that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: No, we rarely we didn't have it.  Uh-uh.  You'd see dark clouds, you know, but we never had a hurricane to destroy anything on the campus [of Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma].
Story_ID: 571317
Speaker 1: How many students did--did you have in those days there [at Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: Well it went up to, at first it was under a thousand, and then it went up, I think now, I think at the peak it was at least two thousand and some, you know.  So they--at us when they really, you know.  I went up to Oklahoma State College [Oklahoma Territorial Agricultural and Mechanical College; Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma], Oklahoma, we just called Oklahoma A and M, then it became Oklahoma State College.  I went up and did a--my master's [degree] and a year on my doctorate there before 19- when they were forced to open the white schools.  You remember they had a case, Sipuel [Ada Lois Sipuel] woman who want--wanted to go to the law school in Oklahoma University [sic. University of Oklahoma] which was out at Norman, Oklahoma.  And they had a case about that you know, and for a while she was off to a side.  They had a little room that she would have to sit in.  And then they tried to open a law school in--in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma], and they set up so much money for that law school one year.  Nobody enrolled in the law school.  So the next year, said G. L.  [General Lamar Harrison] never requested the money for the law school.  So it just dropped.  And so then the blacks when to OU [University of Oklahoma] for law school.  There was quite a case, Sipuel case, about that law school.
Speaker 1: Is it Sipuel versus the State of Oklahoma [Sipuel v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, 1948] is that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I went to, up to Oklahoma A and M before they--they de- they-Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], you know, made all the schools to be open and someone--some of the--they would--G. L. was under a board of regents for eight schools.  At first he was under one for a lot of--a lot of schools.  But then he wanted to be under the same regent that Oklahoma State was under.  So that was for eight schools that was under the board of regents.  And so he--I lost my train of thought.  Anyway, he finally was able to get the school accredited from North Central [North Central Association of Colleges and Schools].  So that when the students finished before he was accredited, they would have to do extra work to get accredited, you know, to go to another school that was accredited.
Speaker 1: This is a good point because, I don't think a lot of people realized that some of the early black colleges [HBCUs], their degrees were not recognized by or accepted, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, that's right.  They were not recognized unless they were approved by the education s--s--regional association [Oklahoma Education Association], you know.  So that--that was then after he was able to get accredited then you did not have to take extra work when you, you know, to be--to go to another college--a big college to be accredited.
Story_ID: 571318
Speaker 1: What was your role as first lady at--at Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, all the guests that came to the campus stayed at my house because they could not stay in the hotels nearby.  None of the--in Guthrie [Oklahoma] or Oklahoma City [Oklahoma], blacks could not stay in the hotels.  So they had to stay when they came to speak, for instance, W--W.E. Du Bois [sic. W.E.B. Du Bois], he stayed at my house.  So, on that house on that picture of the house I wrote when you look at it, Dr. W.E. Bois slept here (laughter).  I noticed in your magazine that I had listed the people that knew Dr. Du Bois.  So, I said well I will write and say on mine that he slept there in the white house (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now what was he like, I mean, you--you met him?  And do you have any stories about him?
Speaker 2: I did all the entertaining.  At the beginning of the year I had a reception for the incoming freshman.  At the--when they graduated I had a reception for the graduating seniors.  And once a year, I had a party at Christmastime for the faculty.  And I invited all the faculty and the workers.  Now some of the faculty people thought I should not have worked--invited the workers.  But if it was--the man worked on the yard, he got an invitation too, just like any of the others.
Story_ID: 571319
Speaker 1: Now before we went there, the president had a housekeeper.  Well, my husband [General Lamar Harrison] when he walk- worked--when he went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] he worked his way through, he had to work some place to go.  And he was for us hiring the students to work, not a housekeeper.  So, I was the first to have four or five students who got everything paid, they didn't have to pay a dime.  They got the room, the tuition, their--their registration, everything was paid.  And then during the month, once a month, I gave them five dollars change to spend whatever they might need, you know.  So I helped each year, I helped five--four or five students.  One worked on the yard, one worked in the house and kept the floors, at the time we had hardwood floors.  And then one did the cooking and one waited the table.  So when guests came, the person waited the table and they learned.  They usually were home ec [home economics] students that knew something about it.  But they always said they knew more by actually doing it in--at my house.  So, one of the--one of my friends here who taught school, who finished Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma] by working through because she lived in that old--in that black town wrote and said she had no money at all, but she was determined to get an education.  So she came and one of the--her professors she said told her--took her down to my house and asked me to give her a job because she needed it.  And so she finished, when she graduated I gave her a summer at summer school at Oklahoma A and M [Oklahoma Territorial Agricultural and Mechanical College; Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma].  Then she went to Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] and when she was there, she needed some money and wrote us and I sent it to her.  So when she finished and started teaching here, she wanted to pay me back and I said, no you just pass that on to another person who'd help her to go to school too.  So during the twenty years, I had almost a hundred students who got their education by working for us in the house and doing and going to school.  So some of them still call me.  I have one from Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] that called me for my birthday this last, in December.  And they, you know, they--they--they referred to--to those kids as Prexy's [ph.] kids on the campus.  But they--one mother told her daughter, she said, "If it hadn't been for Mrs. Harrison [HistoryMaker Dorothy Harrison] you would not have an education." And three of her daughters, two of them worked for me in the house, you know, during when she was going to school.  And they have asked me when students have had homecoming, they have asked me to come back and be there for their homecoming.  You know, it--it made me feel good that, you know, they recognize it.  So I enjoyed my--I enjoyed my--I went--as I said, we had service on Sunday in the--in the chapel, you know, for the students and I always went there.  And one of the--the dean of the school of the Baptist school, they had a school right outside of the campus on down the road and he taught sociology I think up on the campus and he served as chaplain on Sunday.  And he always said, "Mrs. Harrison, you were always a lady on the campus."  It was a nice tribute, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll say so.
Story_ID: 571320
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other guests?  You mentioned Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] was a guest, who were some of the other guests?
Speaker 2: Nat King Cole was, you know, was a guest there.  The president of--of Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois] came and spoke.  He brought various people, outstanding, [HistoryMaker] Etta Moten Barnett came and gave, at that time, she didn't do just singing, she did a lecture and illustrated with her--with her singing.  And she--just to see her walk across that stage was a big, you know.  So she stayed there at the house, you know.  And, well--
Speaker 1: She was a movie star then, by that time, right?  She was in the movies.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Yeah.  I went down to Brazil and on the--on the plane they played the movie 'Flying Down to Rio.'  And there were ten of us went down to Rio [Rio de Janeiro], Brazil at Christmastime and spent our Christmas down there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that movie had Fred Astaire and I don't know who all else, but (singing), "La-da-da la-da-da-da-da."
Speaker 2: Yeah and I played in a bridge club with Etta Moten Barnett and Anna Julian [Anna Johnson Julian] also played in the bridge club with me.  And she would--her daughter would bring her here and I would take--drive to the wherever the bridge club was meeting.  And then they--she would come back and wait until Faith Julian came to pick her up.  So we were very good friends also.  So--
Speaker 1: Were any of the Franklins around?  I know [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin's family is from Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: Yes, he from Tulsa [Oklahoma], but he went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] for his education.  And then from there, I don't remember where he went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or where he went for the rest of his work.  But he went to one of the big schools.  He used to grow orchids.  When I had a friend, well, it was Jill's [ph.] friend too who taught at North Carolina College [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University] in Durham [North Carolina].  And we would go and see them, visit and we would go over to John Hope Franklin's home and he would take us up and show us all those beautiful orchids that he grew as a hobby.  And then I used to Christmas cards--a card with--with a--one of the orchids showing on the--the front of the card, you know.  He used to use those as his Christmas greetings to people.
Speaker 1: Did--did Marian Anderson ever come out to the school or Bethune [Mary McLeod Bethune] or?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no we didn't have her.  But he, he [Harrison's husband, General Lamar Harrison] tried to bring outstanding blacks to the campus for the students to see.  He wanted to know the things that blacks were doing in different thing- fields, you know.  And so we always had some--one time the governor and his brother who was a senator from Oklahoma called.  One of--they were visiting in another part of town and one--the one that was the senator had a set of books that he wanted to present to the library.  And so they--someone called my husband and said they are on the way and they will want dinner--lunch.  So I had to fix lunch for them, you know.  And I didn't, I had this person was home economics to come on and the students that were already gone back to their classes then they--she would come over and help me get the lunch together.  Those tiers, I had on my--on the sideboard at Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma] and that table I bought--I bought it myself.  I saw it, you know, a big store downtown and I wanted it.  So I paid something like two hundred and fifty dollars for that table and I--I--when I left, I brought my table with me because I had bought it out of my own money, not--not--was part of the school's things.
Speaker 1: Like a sectional coffee table or a circular--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --sectional coffee table.
Speaker 2: And it had--it had rollers on it at one time.  And I used to have it fixed and the last time I had it fixed they couldn't fix the rollers.  So I--they--it's not--doesn't roll.  But I--I enjoyed my life at Langston because I was also connected with the Oklahoma City [Oklahoma], you know, too.

Speaker 1: --Large boat--a large ship I want the experience.  We argued and argued, and finally I said, "I will take the money out of the account and I'll go to work and put it back in."  That did it.  He [Harrison's husband, General Lamar Harrison] didn't want me to work.  So he said, "Well Dot [HistoryMaker Dorothy Harrison], you can go that way."  And so I went and the lady had a Mercedes-Benz and we went all through--up through Norway, Sweden, Denmark, all the way to the coast of Russia, but we didn't go into Russia.  So we traveled and this friend of hers was white, and--and so when we would go to find a place to stay the night, we--the white girl would go to the st- we would go to the station and find (unclear) homes to stay in overnight.  Sadie [ph.], my friend, wants to stay in big hotels and I was always in the one in the middle that had to decide where we would go and stay.  It was an interesting trip, but I said to my husband, if I ever say I want to go in with a four--three women again on a trip, I hope you will knock me in the head (laughter).  It was a interesting trip (laughter), anyway.  So you wanna talk about Liberia.
Speaker 2: Yes, well yes.  We were talking about traveling and we kind of just spilled over into this reel.  We've been rolling while you've been talking about this.  But, so, when did you go over on the Queen Elizabeth [RMS Queen Elizabeth]?
Speaker 1: No, we fly--fly.  My husband worked on a boat in order to go to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  Every summer he ran up from one--Boston [Massachusetts] down to the--down the coast.  He considered--he thought of the boat--a ship as a workplace, so that's why he never wanted to go on any ship anywhere.
Speaker 2: I was just asking what year it was that you went on the ship?  What year was it?
Speaker 1: It was about '61 [1961] soon after I came up here.  And he told me if--if I would come back home, we were supposed to go down to Italy and other sections, southern part of Europe.  He said, "Dorothy," he wrote me a letter, "If you," that I got when I got back to (unclear), "If you will just come home I'll take you back any place you want to go."  So I got a plane and came back home, back here to Chicago [Illinois], 'cause it was just the first year.
Story_ID: 571322
Speaker 1: We're gonna take you back to 19--to the '40s [1940s] and now you went through the inauguration of--
Speaker 2: Pres (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) V.S. Tubman [William V.S. Tubman, Jr.] in Liberia in 1944.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: And tell us about that now?  He was invited because he was the president of--of Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma], your--your husband?
Speaker 2: Also he--the ambassador from Liberia was ambassador to United States, Simpson [Clarence Lorenzo Simpson], S-I-M-P-S-O-N.  So G. L. [General Lamar Harrison] met him.  One of our professors [Melvin B. Tolson] was a--the poet of Liberia and he wrote a long poem on Liberia.  So he came, Simpson came to visit also the campus.  And so, when we decided to go to the inauguration of--of Tubman, you know, we were the guests of the Liberian government.  And we stayed there in the hotel, I think [HistoryMaker] Etta Moten Barnett was a gu- was sent by the government, United States government because her husband was with the United Press [sic. Associated Negro Press] or some kind of a press, Negro press or something.
Speaker 1: Ferdinand Barnett [sic. Claude Barnett]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, Barnett.  So they were also guests and also the president of Howard University [Washington, D.C.] was a guest of the government of United States.
Speaker 1: Okay, that Mordecai Johnson, okay, right?
Speaker 2: But we were the president of the gover- Liberia government, not the U.S. government because of our connection with Simpson who had been there.  And so, we--we--we were--also when we were there, G.L. was given a degree from the univ- they had a university there and we went--we went.  You know, we all had all these formal clothes, long dresses, you know, and every affair and he had a tu- one of those tall hats and cut-away coats.  We had--he had to buy all that stuff when we went to Liberia for the inauguration of the--you know, a lot of streets were not paved, you know.  But there were people from all over the world that was there for the inauguration of Tubman.  And they had reception, you know, all these formal things that you wore and the garden clothes, they had a garden party and you wore garden stuff, you know, with a hat and so forth.  It was quite interesting to be there.  And Simpson's daughter, one of the students from Nig- from Liberia came to Langston and he was married to Simpson's daughter.  And they--G.L. gave them a cottage to live in during that time that the husband was going to school to get his degree, you know.  So that was another connection with Simpson and Liberia.
Story_ID: 571323
Speaker 1: So then again, you know, we went when Tubman [William V.S. Tubman, Jr.] died, Tolbert [William R. Tolbert, Jr.] was president and he was inaugurated.  So we went back for his inauguration also (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, now that's 1972, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  And then we--that time, we went to the other African countries.  We went to Ghana and we were supposed to go into Nigeria, but--let me see--no, no while we were there--the time the president went to London [England] for medical treatment, the government was overthrown when he was away.  And we went down to--with our bags from our room to go where the person that was--the guide was there, and he said, we cannot leave, it's over--it's--it's overthrown or something.  It--I looked out the wind- the word he--the word he used made me think it was overcast outside.  I looked out, I said doesn't look like it's overcast to me.
Speaker 2: Did he say coup, is that what he said, coup?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or coup, huh?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, that was the coup.  And we couldn't, had to stay two more days.  And so we went back and registered.  They wouldn't let anybody leave the airport.
Speaker 2: This in Ghana, right?
Speaker 1: This is G- yeah, this is Ghana.
Speaker 2: This is when Nkrumah [Kwame Nkrumah] was toppled?
Speaker 1: Right, right, they had that coup.  And we were going to go to Nigeria, but we didn't--our time was taken up having to stay overtime in Ghana, you know, Accra [Ghana], in Accra.  And so he said no, they have--they have overtaken the government, overthrown the government and we cannot leave.  So when we went to Nigeria, we only went--landed in the airport, we didn't get to see Nigeria.
Story_ID: 571324
Speaker 1: Then we went to Uganda, Idi Amin was over--then, you know.  And there was a person, we did get into some of the homes there because of--of--another person was traveling from--from there, they--she arranged for them to have students in the places in the universities here in the United States.  So she was going to see how what--they were doing when they went back to the place, to Uganda.  So we got in some of the homes there, you know.  And then you--after we left there we went to, what was some other places--we went to Ethiopia but that was the last trip.  It was Uganda, there's another where they had safaris (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kenya--
Speaker 1: --of--of where you went on a--
Speaker 2: Safari?
Speaker 1: --yes, where we went to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Kenya--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Kenya?
Speaker 1: Kenya, right.  We went to Kenya there and we went on one of those safaris where we take us in a--in a jeep like to cover and we could see all those animals, lions and all those things.  And then we went up to Ethiopia.  We had met the emperor.  He had come to Oklahoma State University [Oklahoma Territorial Agricultural and Mechanical College; Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma] because of the program that we're doing in--in Ethiopia.  And we were invited to a dinner where he was and his wife.
Speaker 2: Now what was he doing at Oklahoma State, I mean, this is a Haile Selassie, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Haile Selassie, right.
Speaker 2: Emperor Haile Selassie I.
Speaker 1: Yes.  So we had dinner with him at--at the Oklahoma State University because they--they invited us up there because we were part of the system, you know.  So that was an interesting trip when we saw the--where he stayed, the castle, the ho- the capital [Addis Ababa, Ethiopia].  So that was an interesting trip to--to Africa because we--why we went in the first place was to the inauguration, but we went--the first time we went onto the capitals of France and London [England], and up to Scotland one time.  We went to--so we did a lot of travel, you know, a lot of travel.
Story_ID: 571325
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was your impression of Liberia?  Was Africa what you had imagined it to be?
Speaker 2: Then, it--it was trying to be something.  It was really trying to be a, you know, a country.  And the people that lived in the subur- in the hinterlands, they would come and bring their white cloth and present it to the--the president, you know.  And they had a, a great relationship between the educated people and the people that lived in the hinterland, and they would come and bring certain products and things and present them to the--so, it was.  And they had a university in Ethiopia--in--on Liberia.  So G. L. [General Lamar Harrison] went out and they gave him a degree.  I had it on the wall for a while.  But after it became, you know, when the fella overthrown the--the capital and took over, it has just been terrible over there, you know.  And you didn't even want to know that you'd even been there in that country.
Speaker 1: I think it was like around 1977 or so (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There--the lady, you know, she is, who became president, she is of the educated.  I don't know whether she is one of the people formally of--of America.  Anyway, she is trying to bring the country--
Speaker 1: That's the new--new president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, right?
Speaker 2: The new president, yeah.  Yeah, she's trying to bring it back.  But they were--were recognized when the times we were there by the governments of Europe.  You know, they would send representatives and they all were in these formal clothes, you know.  I have a picture after we came back there--to Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma], the lady was putting on a fashion show and she had us to wear the things that we wore in Langs- in--well over in Liberia with the tall hat and the cut-away coats and this beautiful gold-colored dress that I came down in and almost like a train in the back, you know.  It was a beautiful dress I had bought for that occasion.
Story_ID: 571326
Speaker 1: Do you remember Ambassador Dawson and Lula Dawson, Horace Dawson [HistoryMaker Horace G. Dawson] and Lula Dawson [HistoryMaker Lula Cole Dawson]?  They were ambassadors to Liberia at one point, black people?
Speaker 2: I know, Beulah [Beulah Stamps], the lady that just called me, she and her husband [James E. Stamps, Jr.] were over there at one time, and they spent five years there in Liberia.  And they were trying to--he was in accounting or something like that.  And they had a house and everything with people worked for them, you know.  And then Dick Jones [General Richard Lee Jones] was a--a ambassador there too.  And we went to see them at the time.  Algetha [Algetha Jones] and them lived here in this--in the build- this building, 'cause I've lived here over for five--forty years.  You know, I had a three bedroom when my husband [General Lamar Harrison] was living, which we used as just two bedrooms because we took the sliding wall out and had a large living area.  We used to do a lot of parties and had caterers to come and do the--do the food all that we served.  And then when he died, I moved into a two bedroom and I used it as--and then about ten years ago I moved up here into a one bedroom.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so what's the lady's, Beulah what--what's her last name?
Speaker 2: Stamps.
Speaker 1: Stamps, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was--
Speaker 1: She and her husband were--lived there for five years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a Stamps, he was the son of James Stamps [James E. Stamps, Sr.] that was well known here in the city.  And so she married one of his sons and another person, her sister-in-law married the other son [George Stamps].  And she lives down in the Doral Plaza [Millennium Park Plaza, Chicago, Illinois], downtown.

Speaker 1: Now, I--I wanna ask you about Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.].
Speaker 2: All right, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And when did you become a Delta, did you become a Delta at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: I D- became a Delta when I was--Fisk did not have a Delta chapter on the campus.  They had one out in town and only two real fair girls from La- from Fisk was taken in at that chapter.
Speaker 1: At the?
Speaker 2: In the city chapter, city-wide chapter.  Then when I--
Speaker 1: So you're saying there was discrimination based on color in Delta?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) They certainly did at one time.
Speaker 1: Now, you know what the tradition is nowadays, they say that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was not--
Speaker 1: --the Deltas are the--are the--
Speaker 2: --I knew, I had some friends in the building that were AKA's [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], but my sister [Beatrice Penman] was a Delta.  I was not expected to go anything but a Delta whenever I would pledged.  When I went back to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], I was taken in the chapter there, Epsilon chapter, which was a city-wide chapter, uh-huh.  So, but I didn't really become involved into the sorority until my sons [Gerald Harrison and Richard Harrison] died.  I--I don't like to talk about it.  Anyway, I became very active and ran for my chapter, Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] chapter, recommended me for national treasurer.  At that time they called us grand treasurer, grand officer (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, now, now, now before we get too far now, when was it, what year was it that you joined Delta, was it like 19- ?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-two [1932].
Speaker 1: Thirty-two [1932], okay, 1932, all right, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, then--
Speaker 1: Then you joined at Ohio State at the--at the Epsilon--lon- chapter?
Speaker 2: At Ohio State.  But when I went Prairie View [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas], they had no chapter on the campus either, you know.  So I really didn't become active until I moved to Oklahoma, connected with the Oklahoma City chapter.
Story_ID: 571328
Speaker 1: So then, in 1952, I became national treasurer [of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.].  My sister [Beatrice Penman] had been treasurer for thirteen years.  And then she suggested, "Why Dorothy [HistoryMaker Dorothy Harrison], why don't--," and that is the time when I needed other things to get involved in to keep my mind off of my loss.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now that's--I know you said you didn't want to talk--talk about it, but just tell us, two of your sons died when they were still, you know?
Speaker 1: Yes, my sons died at the age of thirteen, two years apart.  One died in a--he [Gerald Harrison] was in a jeep with a college student and two friends, and they went out to swim in a farmer's pond out in the town of Langston [Oklahoma].  And on coming back they went over a bridge like, the jeep turned over and hit my son in the head.  He had just been to school in Charlotte Hawkins school [Alice Freeman Palmer Memorial Institute, Sedalia, North Carolina] for private--it was a private school in Greensboro, North Carolina.  He had spent his--we didn't ha- he had a small high school out in the town of Langston, but it was not much.  So he went to this private school for his first year in college [sic. high school].  Charlotte Hawkins was a private school for most of the people in the South went to this private school for high school, and he went--spent his first year there.  Then--anyway then that summer he came home he was killed.  In--so my younger son, Richard [Richard Harrison], had learning problems and I went--spent a year in Los Angeles [California] putting him in a special school for a whole year.  Then he came back.  He had asthma from the time he was three years old, but it was under control and I learned to give him these shots.  He was allergic to dust and ragweed.  So when we came back, he was--had been in a--to a movie in one of the buildings and he came back with--someone brought him home, he was having a bad asthma attack.  So I gave him a shot, I was always afraid of giving him too much at one time, I was, you know, how many drops I was giv- I was inject in his arm.  So finally he just--I was sitting up all night with him in a chair sitting him up so he could breathe.  He was feeling so bad.  So finally I said well, I will call the nurse.  We had a place for a nurse over there in a small building.  I will call her and ask her to come and give you an injection.  She came.  I had been up all night.  She said, "Well you lie down."  And then she came and she gave him something, and then she came and said, "Mrs. Harrison he's not breathing, come on and help me."  So I went in the study where he was sitting up in a chair, and she had given him a shot and he wasn't breathing.  And I said, "Well let's give him artificial respiration."  We turned him over.  So I ran in--my husband [General Lamar Harrison] had gone to a board meeting in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma].  And so I ca- I called the office and they said they would send somebody over and they sent someone, but it was too late, he died.
Story_ID: 571329
Speaker 1: I had to be busy.  So I decided to go back to school.  I had sleep--at first I started going places.  Then I--I had to make adjustment.  I used to--when I went to bed I always had a book to read because I'd just start dreaming about them.  So finally I decided to go to school up at--I drove twenty miles up to Stillwater [Oklahoma] to go to school, and I started and I got my master's [degree], and I stayed one year on the doctorate.  By that time, I then began to get involved in Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] and I was, was, I was--that was '48 [1948] and '50 [1950] when I lost my sons [Gerald Harrison and Richard Harrison].  So I became involved in Delta on the national level and I became the national treasurer for four years from 1952 to 1956.  They had a term, you could be elected for two years and two more, four years was supposed to be the maximum.  So they called the person that was vice president.  She wanted to be president because Dorothy [HistoryMaker Dorothy Height] by that time had served nine years and that's when they changed--
Speaker 2: This was Dorothy?
Speaker 1: Height, right.
Speaker 2: Dorothy Height, all right.
Speaker 1: My sister [Beatrice Penman] was treasurer during that time.  And so--part of that time.  So they were meeting and they decided to rule--to put in the rules that you can be elected for two years and reelected.  Dorothy had served four years.  She says it cannot be retroactive that law, cannot--you putting in it cannot refer to me, so I'm still eligible for two--four more years.  So she stayed in and then one year there was a war or something going on to travel, so she stayed in nine years.  During that time, I served four of those under--when she was president I was national treasurer.  Then they--committee called me, convention committee called me and asked me to run for president.  I, I had questions because I was still at Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma] serving as a hostess for my husband [General Lamar Harrison], you know.  And I--and I knew what was involved when you become president, because you had to go out and make speeches and all that, you know.  I knew what was involved.  I said, "Well let me think about that.  I--I--I'll call you back after I think about."  They were meeting in Washington [D.C.] getting the slate.  And the vice president was called.  She had some kind of health problems, would almost fall out during the meetings and so forth.  They didn't want her to be president and she wanted to be very much, and she was a friend of mine.  So I knew how she felt.  And I hesitated about saying I will be president, because I knew also what was involved in travel and so forth.  And so finally, I agreed.  My husband really wanted me to be president, for the name, you know.  So I told him, I said, "I have to make up my mind because I know what's involved."  And so I finally told them I would accept.  So I served two years.  During that time--part of that time when Dorothy was president, we were invited to the Hi- to the capital to the White House [Washington, D.C.] and Mr. Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] was president.  Mrs. Eisenhower [Mamie Eisenhower] invited us when we were meeting in--in Washington.  They invited us to come to the White House.  They had a reception for us.  The whole--the whole bird.  And so that's where that picture was made with Mrs. Eisenhower.
Speaker 2: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And the--those are the officers who was the executive director, Dorothy Height and I was treasurer, and Reba was still, Reba Cann [Reba S. Cann] from Cincinnati [Ohio] was still vice president and we had the officer, so that was where that was taken.
Story_ID: 571330
Speaker 1: Well, when I was president [of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.], you know, it--the first Christmas party we had was for the Little Rock Eight--
Speaker 2: Nine.
Speaker 1: --you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nine, yeah, Little Rock Nine.
Speaker 1: Right. Yes, we supported them.  And we--the--my vice president was Dr. Jeanne Noble [Jeanne L. Noble].  She was vice president.  She was ver- she was very active and very capable person.  And so we--that was at our first Christmas party with--with--with Daisy Bates.  And we--she went down there and supported the Daisy Bates with money and so forth.  And the sororities--
Speaker 2: Just--I don't think we established, like what year did you become the president?
Speaker 1: What--I became 1956 to '58 [1958], '56 [1956] to '58 [1958], the two years.  So that was the first of the Christmas parties.  Then we did--but just before the '60s [1960s], you know, when they were sitting in and all this was going on, so we also supported, we had--we--I have a copy of the speech that I made at the '68 [1968] convention in which I mentioned all the things that we covered, you know, during that t- that two period.  I have given a copy for the files.  And the lady was supposed to make me a copy and send me it.  So she called me yesterday and told me it was in the mail because I was supposed to have it long before.  So anyway, we--we had--regional, we had group people that were in situation of integrating the black students into the white high schools and things in these certain areas.  And we had for the teachers, we had meetings in certain areas to bring the teachers and what they needed to do and so forth with these new--with these students that were coming into their classes.  And we also had other things that were leading up to the 1960s groups, integration groups.  We also, I'm trying to think now, we had reorganized the office for modern methods of doing, like vouchers and things to account for the money.  So we had just bought--we bought the new building when I was--when I was treasurer, the 1814 M Street, that's when we bought the build--the--our first headquarters.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], right, 1814 M Street?
Speaker 1: Right, then later on we bought another building at 17 New Hampshire Avenue which is much bigger.  We spent millions of dollars to be--buy that building.  I have a article on it someplace over there.  And I--
Story_ID: 571331
Speaker 1: Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] is a big sorority, right? And yeah, uh-huh (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, when I was president there was 274 chapters and were about--the membership was about 2200.  Now, we have over 900 chapters.  I have a birthday card from one of the 900 and some chapters in Georgia.  And we--the building not long ago we had remodeled and it was over a million dollars just to remodel the building.  You know, we also now go to Washington [D.C.] and have a day for the people from very--all the chapters have representatives meeting in Washington and with their--with their representatives and telling them what is going on and what is coming up, and they have a picture of them on the White House [Washington, D.C.] steps on one of those magazines I have.  So, anyway, we had also just started the five-point program, service program.  So, one time we was started to add service to our name rather than the sorority, service sorority, but they did finally drop that part.  But we have five national programs and it depends on the need for the type of program.  So we were carrying on these five programs that were started just as--during [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height's administration.  So we were carrying on those different programs during my term also.  We also had a newsletter that we started during that time that represented--it was--it was--we also had a journal, but then we had a Delta newsletter so that they--the--the things that were going on in headquarters made contact with the chapters through this newsletter, you know.
Story_ID: 571332
Speaker 1: So after the two years, the sorority [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] wanted me to serve the other two because Dr. Jeanne Noble [Jeanne L. Noble], Soror Noble didn't really want to go in because she was doing something else on her own, she was also teaching, you know, at one of the universities in New York.  So she really didn't want to start being president then because she had something she wanted to do.  But my husband [General Lamar Harrison] did not want me to serve.  He saw what was involved and he really did not want me to serve another two years.  So, I told him, "Well I--I had to think it over too, just whether I wanted to serve another two years."  So I finally made up my mind and I told the nominating committee that I would not be--would not come--would not be for another two years.
Speaker 2: Now this is--this is in '58 [1958], right?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  That's the reason I only served two years.  Most of them serve, a few of them had served two.  Anna Julian [Anna Johnson Julian] only served two years.  But most of them want to serve another, like [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height, she wasn't married.  Jeanne Noble wasn't married, you know.  So, she didn't have something else that would take her attention.  So, most of them served four years, they want to serve two.  So, I decided that I was best off that I not serve another two years.  But I stayed on the executive committee a total of nineteen years.  So, each one of the presidents would want me to be on the board, so they would ask me to serve in another capacity that would make me--I served as chairman of the headquarters.  I served as chairman of the personnel committee.  I had to go when the president would ask me to go because problems came up between the executive director and one of the staff.  So, I went to settle that between the two persons, you know.  And I--I still--the executive director was having problems with the staff person, so I went and talked with both of them.  But when I left, the--it was settled.  And that person still sends me Christmas cards.  She is no longer on the staff. She--and then I was chairman, national chairman of the bylaws committee.  It was always something to keep me on the committee.  Because I never formed cliques and when we had board meetings, I expressed my opinion and I didn't go back to the hotel and get in cliques.
Story_ID: 571333
Speaker 1: I also set up, when I was on the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] board here, I was on the board of directors, executive board, national board of the Y.  When I was on the board, I took a course on the relationship between the staff and the volunteers and what was their posi- special duties, you know.  And so I took three courses--seminars that was taught by the university--of a professor of the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  So, I saw the need and Lynnette Taylor [Lynnette Dobbins Taylor], who was serving as director after Patricia Roberts Harris left, asked me to do this--do this relation course between when new board members came on the--on the executive committee, and so I would do this course for them.  I--that--and I did it for oh a number of years.  Each time the new people were elected at the convention then we would have this course of what their responsibility, plus the response and their relationship between the staff.  Now we have about twenty-some staff people there in Washington [D.C.] when we started, when I was national treasurer and Dorothy [HistoryMaker Dorothy Height], we had just two.  So, that was one of--and they still do that.  And one of the person didn't that I was the one that started that orientation.  And when she saw my paper, she said, "Well that's what we do now.  And she said you sign this and I'm gonna take it back to the headquarters."  I said, "I think they have one back there."  But anyway, that was one of my contributions that they still carry on to this day.  And so, but--and at--at one of the first meetings when I was treasurer, I was handling all the mon- money I dep- deposited in the bank in Guthrie, Oklahoma.  And so they decided that the money should be--be put in the bank in Washington.  So Sadie Wash- Sadie Alexander [Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander], the first president of Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.], we had a meeting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She's a lawyer from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], right, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --right, she came and she told them afterwards, "You should always have [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Harrison on this executive committee" and so--on the executive board.  So, they tried to keep me on as long as they could.  So, I was one thirteen years before I decided that was enough (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, we're gonna pause here a second. Okay, all right, so, so we were talking about your service for Delta Sigma Theta and so, so you've been on exec- you were on the executive board for a number of years right?
Speaker 1: Right.  Exec- I was on for nineteen years.
Speaker 2: Oh, hold on one second, hold on, here she is.  Okay, so, you're--you're still involved with Delta right, even now you're--you're still involved with Delta Sigma Theta today?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right, right, yeah.  I will--we will have our Founder's Day on the 27th [of January].  I should show you--I'll show you a letter.  They have classified me now as one of the still-living legend.  They--they will be doing something at the Founder's Day, you know.  There were several of us.  You had to be a certain age and do so much, you know, be involved.  So, that is the local chapter of Delta.  So, they have called me and classified me now as a living legend.

Speaker 1: Let me catch up on the chronology again.  Now, you moved to Chicago [Illinois] in--with your husband [General Lamar Harrison] in 19-?
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960].
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960], okay.  And he had retired from Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma] at that point or?
Speaker 2: Yes, and he worked here.  He taught at Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois] and one of the other colleges because he left before he reached the retirement age.  He was only sixty and at sixty-five you get five more years.  And they wondered why he would leave.  And he said he wanted--when he got where he--when he reached the retirement age, he still will--wanted to do something in a city.  We--at that time, we had two apartment buildings here that we owned, you see.  And they later, they went on into right--Blackstone Ranger moved in the area and they went down.
Speaker 1: Oh so they--
Speaker 2: So, we had that under a rental a group that took care of the buildings when we were still living in--in Langston [Oklahoma].  And when we came here, he didn't want to bother with them and then, so he taught school until he reached the retirement age.  And then he worked for the city--he worked for the Committee on Urban Opportunity [Chicago Committee on Urban Opportunity].  And so, he didn't stop working until he was seventy-eight years old.  And that's when he--he started, you know, stopped working, um-hum.  And he lived to be--he died in '86 [1986] at the age of eighty-seven.
Story_ID: 571335
Speaker 1: And as for you now, you've been a part of a number different boards and organizations, I mean there're so many of them?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have worked in--with a lot of--now The Links [The Links, Incorporated], I helped to setup the chapter in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] at that time in 1957, I set up the Link chapter there.  And then I moved here and I became a part of the Chicago Links.  I have been president of it, a treasurer of it, financial secretary.  I--I was--co-chaired the cotillion.  We have it over forty-six years now, that they have had--I was here at the first cotillion.  I, per- they would get a person to chair and they would say, "I will chair it if you get Dorothy [HistoryMaker Dorothy Harrison] to co-chair it."  So, I co-chaired the cotillion three times.  They have a souvenir book and I co-chaired the souvenir book three or four times.  So I have been active.  And now, I am another--I have a book over there and a letter I'm now a platinum, I took alumni stages and now I'm called a platinum Link.  I--I have a letter over there and a award book over there with that in it.

Speaker 1: I worked with the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association].  I sat nine years on the board of directors, and during that time I helped to write their bylaws.  And then I--when I was--
Speaker 2: The YWCA is important because it got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) then I was elected national to the national board of the YWCA.  When I was a Link [The Links, Incorporated], I helped sponsor the first Head Start program here that was federally funded by ten thousand dollars.  It was for--in the Rosenwald [Rosenwald Nursery School, Chicago, Illinois], Oneida Cockrell was running it at that time for upper class blacks that they paid money for.  So, that summer we sp- we did a Head Start for underprivileged children who did not pay anything.  So, I was--I had to buy the equipment and pay the--the staff, and I, I had to account for that ten thousand dollars.  And we ran that, the Deltas--Links ran that for two years.  I worked with the city associate of the Art Institute [Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  I was on the board of directors for that.  And I was chairman of the education committee, and during that time we sponsored a photography exhibit for the high school, both private and public.  And we put those on--on exhibit there at the Art Institute in the picnic room downstairs.  And we would give--classify them as to whether or not they were first or second or third award prizes.  We didn't give really prizes, but they just.  And so when we stopped doing it, when I came--when I stopped doing it and my friend Beulah [Beulah Rolle (ph.)] did it for two years, nobody else on that board, most of them were white, and they didn't wanna take on that responsibility.  So, they were disappointed, the art teachers, who would pick four of their best ones and then they--at the Art Institute they would look at them again and decided which one of the five or they submitted how many they would put on exhibit.  So, that was a what--a nice thing that I--we did.
Story_ID: 571337
Speaker 1: Now see--let me see here--I was trying to think of any of the other organizations that I listed.
Speaker 2: There's quite a few that we have a--we have a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There's the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], The Links [The Links, Incorporated]--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, we have a list of--
Speaker 1: Those are the major ones I guess.  I had--my interest (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) National Council of Negro Women.
Speaker 1: Oh yes.  Well, I was a life member under that and life member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and I also went for twenty years, I went to the symphony [Chicago Symphony Orchestra] here and went twenty years, had a subscriber to--to the Goodman Theatre [Chicago, Illinois], I went twenty years.  And I-I really lived an interesting busy life, even though I was not teaching.
Speaker 2: Urban League Women's Board [Chicago Urban League Women's Board], I mean, just about every board you can think of here.  Lot of different ones.
Speaker 1: As a volunteer, I, I, I have done a lot of time for other groups.
Speaker 2: Okay, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And the national Links, when they needed to setup their headquarters and get their things, I chaired one of the national committees to secure the first executive director and also to bring all the material to the headquarters I--under the president was Soror Ellison [Grayzel Lavone Ellison] in--at Maryland.
Story_ID: 571338
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any particular thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I--I was just reading a, let me see what did I call it, point of view of a article that I wrote at--for--regarding the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.].  And, you know, this chapter here, we only have one chapter which is over six hundred members.  I--I--
Speaker 1: In Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And it also, at one time, it is mostly--it's a black organization.  And the question came up one time whether we should be more--include white women in--in the college into the Delta, invite them in--our--also honorary members.  And I at that--and this paper, I felt that we were sort of discriminating against the whites, women.  That we don't--only took in, I think, during that period I was--said only fifty-four people and I thought well, we should not be so inclusive.  I'm not sure that I think that now.  I think there is a place for just black organizations.  But I questioned it at one time.  One point of view, I just read--recently I looked in my drawer, there're some things I wrote, you know, articles and (unclear), the address I gave at the close of the '58 [1958] convention.  I--the address I have then I had a copy of it and I had someone to make a copy and put it in the files here in Chicago.  You--you look back sometimes and think well maybe I would do it differently depending upon the time and the situation now different--way differs from what it was, you know, during a certain period of my life.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: What's a what?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, I certainly hope there is a common goal in some things.  I'm not sure that we have reached the better situations in all interracial p- interracial points of view, whether there is a--should be more contact between the groups and understanding between the two racial groups.
Story_ID: 571340
Speaker 1: I think we have moved a long ways when you're even thinking of a black president for--and I think, I'm sure, there are some who do not think we are ready for it, or for a woman president.  But we have moved a long ways toward that, that we really think there may be a time now for an interra- for a black president or for a woman president.  But we will be faced maybe with in 19- in 2008.  I think that we have come a long ways to that place where we even consider such a thing and that it is possible that we may have either a woman president or a man black president.
Speaker 2: Are--are you excited about the candidacy of Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] and Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton]?
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm very, very excited about that.  I'm very excited.  I think the question is whether he has enough experience.  Whether it is necessary, if his program and his outlook is broad enough to take care of that, of whether he has enough ex- just two years in the [U.S.] Senate and not a broad experience.  But his outlook is so good and his fa- his whole philosophy is very good for everybody.  And I think that when you look at--from that standpoint, that experience is not necessary.
Story_ID: 571341
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, again all the places you've been and all the things you've been a part of, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My majors?
Speaker 1: Your legacy?  What--what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I think my service to the Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] is one of the things that I am proud of.  That I feel that I had a big--a nice part of.  And I--I'm proud.  I think Delta becomes, is the major thing that I always consider.

Speaker 2: My Dorothy [HistoryMaker Dorothy Harrison], what?
Speaker 1: Who today do you consider to be your family, is it an extended family or?
Speaker 2: Oh extended.  Well, I think some of my friends I think of as my extended family, especially Lavolia [ph.], who worked for me during The Links [The Links, Incorporated], during--and she is more like a daughter that I have ne- I did not have.
Speaker 1: What's her last name?

Those are, well, I--Beulah [Beulah Stamps], my friend, that lives here [Chicago, Illinois] in the building, we are very close and I have looked for her for help.  Now, it looks almost like she is looking more for me for help at, at this particular time.  And my nieces in California, Pat--Patricia Ryder, Beverly Ryder, and Gwen Poindexter [Gwendolyn Poindexter] are very close.  They usually visit me quite often.  They come here for various reasons.  They have other friends here and--and I certainly feel very close to them.

Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, are you through, are you through (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well the last question is similar--is similar to the legacy question, but a little different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to be remembered as a thoughtful person, as a person--a caring person that people can depend on.  And a person that people to come and discuss their problems with me and--and hopefully that I can help them.

Speaker 2: No, no.  Well, I--I pull for the Clubs [sic. Chicago Cubs], I've always been a Cub fan, even when I was living in Oklahoma.  My husband [General Lamar Harrison] was a White Sox [Chicago White Sox] fan.  But I have always been a Cub fan.  There was a Cub on that team was--when they--early when they first started putting black men on their team and he was one of the fellas that I liked to see on the team, he was a--played, I think, on third base.  So I'm a White Sox fan now.  I--I pull for--is for the football team.  I don't have any special, you know.  But I--I'm a fan for the, what is it--what is the football team?
Speaker 1: Bears [Chicago Bears].
Speaker 2: Yes, right, yes.  And I--I like to see Tiger [Tiger Woods] play and I like to see on tennis, I like to see the Williams sisters [Venus Williams and Serena Williams] play.  So, those are the main ones for the sports, I guess.

Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: No, there's no secret to it?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  Well, oh I wanna mention that my honorary degree is a special.  I believe it is the only--the colleges in Oklahoma are not permitted to give honorary degrees.  The president, Dr. Holloway [Ernest L. Holloway], had to go to two boards to get their approval.  And the degree reads, the Board of Regents through Langston University [Langston, Oklahoma] confers the honorary degree of--I'm trying to remember the exact words, but they--regents had to give their approval, two of the regent groups for them to give me a--that honorary degree because in Oklahoma the colleges are not permitted, state colleges are not permitted to give honorary degrees.  So I feel very special.  And when I went there, the governor of the state was on this platform with me, as well as representatives from both Regents of Higher Education [sic. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education] was there also to see--to give--when I got that degree.
