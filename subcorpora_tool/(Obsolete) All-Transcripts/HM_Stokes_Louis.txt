Speaker 1: Let's begin, Congressman Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], talking about your mother, starting with your mother's name and where your mother was born and where she grew up as a girl and spent her childhood?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Louise Stone [Louise Stone Stokes], her maiden name.  She grew up in a little place in Georgia called Wrens, W-R-E-N-S, Georgia.  She was one of eleven children born to her mother, Fannie [Fannie Brinson Stone], and father [William Stone] (laughter) (unclear), granddad's name.  Anyway, she grew up there and had about an eighth grade education.  Later she left Wrens, came to Cleveland [Ohio] as a very young woman and she was single.  And she worked as a domestic worker, having only an eighth grade education.  She was a part of that great migration that took place in the early part of the century.
Speaker 1: Do you know why she chose Cleveland?  Did she have family there already or--
Speaker 2: She had an older sister who had already preceded her there.  And I think that was why she, she chose to go there, thinking that it afforded her an opportunity for employment.  In the South, she, she had felt that she had no real future.  She was picking cotton, working on the farm and she just didn't want that type of a life.  She wanted something better for herself, and the consequence of it, she, she left there and went to Cleveland and started a new life.
Speaker 1: And, and so she got work as a dom- she got domestic work when she moved to Cleveland.  Do you know how she met your father [Charles Stokes]?
Speaker 2: I don't really recall how they met.  He was a laundry worker, probably had about the same amount of education or even less than she had.  And he had come from Macon, Georgia.  And he had similarly gone to Cleveland looking for a little better life and opportunity.
Speaker 1: And did your mother ever share any stories with you about what life was like growing up in Georgia and the kinds of things that she did as a girl and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  I think she indicated that they had a wonderful life, that they had a very loving, caring family.  But they were sharecroppers and for her, as a young woman, there was really no future.  And so this is one of her reasons, of course, for having left the South.  But there're really not a lot of stories that she shared with us about growing up (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 599277
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother [Louise Stone Stokes]?
Speaker 2: Well, she was relatively small.  She was maybe 5'5".  She was a very pretty lady, and she was very religious. And since our father died while we were very young--in fact, Carl [Carl Stokes], my brother, Carl, was a year old, and I was three years old.  And so it left her with two boys to try and raise, and we were the typical boys that are, are not real easy to raise.  And, but she was tough.  That little lady was tough enough to handle us in every respect, and so it--do you need to repeat anything--
Speaker 1: No I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: --but she was just a wonderful woman.  She was very dedicated to education and she constantly talked to both of us about acquiring an education and getting something in your head so you don't have to work with your hands, like I've had to work with my hands.
Speaker 1: I know you said your father died when you all were very young.  What--do you remember anything at all about your father?
Speaker 2: No, because I was only three years old, Carl was a year old.  So we don't remember anything about him.
Speaker 1: What was your father's name?
Speaker 2: Charles [Charles Stokes].
Story_ID: 599278
Speaker 1: Did you all know your grandparents at all?
Speaker 2: I knew my grandparents, I knew my grandfather on my father's [Charles Stokes] side.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: John [John Stokes], and then I knew my grandfather on my mother's [Louise Stone Stokes] side.
Speaker 1: And his name?
Speaker 2: William, William Stone.  I couldn't think of that earlier, but William Stone.
Speaker 1: Now, when your father passed away, did your maternal grandmother come to Cleveland [Ohio] to take care of you and your brother while your mother worked?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, my mother found it very difficult to be able to take care of Carl [Carl Stokes] and I because oftentimes, she had to stay on the job and she couldn't come home until Friday.  She'd go to work on Monday and as a domestic worker, she took care of the children of these families and sometimes working two and three different homes.  And so she was on the job from Monday through Friday, and come back home on Friday evenings.  So she needed someone to be there with us.  So she sent for her mother, and her mother came up from Wrens, Georgia.  And she took care of Carl and I while Mom went to work.
Speaker 1: And do you remember those times with your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Oh, very well, very well.  She was just a, a very sweet, wonderful woman, and I have the fondest memories in the world of her.  She was special, very special.
Speaker 1: Can you share some of those memories with us?
Speaker 2: Well, it's just that she and I, I think even more so than she and my brother, just had that special relationship between a grandmother and a grandson.  And she was a great cook, and she cooked all those great, southern, soul food meals.  And she was the type of person everyone just loved.  She would sit out on the porch and everyone called her Aunt Fannie [Fannie Brinson Stone], whether, whether they were related to us or not.  She was--everybody knew Aunt Fannie.  And she'd sit out on that porch and everybody'd pass by and say, "Good morning, Aunt Fannie," or "Hello, Aunt Fannie," or they'd stop to pass the time of day with her.  And she, too, like my mother was also very religious, read the Bible constantly and was--they had to bake the cookies and do all the kinds of things that grandmothers do for grandsons.
Speaker 1: Do you know what she initially thought of Cleveland, coming from Georgia to Cleveland?  What did she think of the city?
Speaker 2: You know, I really don't know. I really don't--
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestry?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, our great-grandfather was a slave.  And that's as far back as we can trace our history.
Speaker 1: Do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: I really don't.
Speaker 1: And that's your great-grandfather on your mother's side or your father's side?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 599279
Speaker 1: Tell me, what is your earliest memory of growing up?  What's one of the very first things you remember?
Speaker 2: I, I can remember being a little boy on 69th Street in Cleveland [Ohio], living between Cedar [Avenue] and Central Avenues, where we lived in a house, 2234 East 69th Street.  And there was a--it was a double home, and we lived at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What do you mean by double?
Speaker 2: Well, one family--it was a two family, really.  And we lived on the first floor.  And some cousins of ours lived on the second floor.  We were renting.  The front yard had all dirt yard.  It was no lawn out there, anything of the sort.  And I can just remember that house and the neighbors and the grocery store right across the street from our house and the elementary school [Giddings Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio] which we went to, which would be one street over.  And you'd go through a shortcut, to go through from 69th Street to 70th [Street] where the school was located, things like that.
Story_ID: 599280
Speaker 1: Can you share some memories of holidays with us, like what were holidays like?  Were they very special times, Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because of the nature of my mother's [Louise Stone Stokes] employment and the fact she couldn't be with us a lot of time, Christmas probably was our most special time.  She always reserved being with us on Christmas.  And while we were very, very poor, and our gifts were limited, many of our gifts coming from welfare because Mom had to also go on what was known at that time as AFDC [Aid to Families with Dependent Children] which was welfare, but they were happy times because it gave Mom and Grandmother [Fannie Brinson Stone] and Carl [Carl Stokes] and I a chance to just really be together and enjoy one another.  And sometimes we were joined by my mother's brother, our uncle.  We called him Uncle Dock, but his name was actually Pughsley Stone.  And that made it nice.  And then, of course, by then many other members of our family had migrated--my mother's family, really, had migrated to Cleveland [Ohio].  And oftentimes, they would be in their homes, or they would come to our home on Christmas, things of that sort.  And then along with it, I guess I remember--I don't know whether it'd be holidays or not, but I remember Mom would take Carl and I on little picnics.  And I remember the little, the little picnic basket that she'd pack and those sandwiches she'd have in there and the lemonade in there.  I can remember us out in the park just really enjoying that type of time together.  We were poor, but we were, you know, a very happy and loving family.
Speaker 1: And could you please give us your siblings' names and their birth order?  I know you just have one brother, including yourself?
Speaker 2: Yes, my brother, Carl, was born June 21st, 1927 and, thereby, making him my baby brother, although he, he never really wanted to be a baby brother (laughter).  He wanted to be the big brother (laughter).
Story_ID: 599281
Speaker 1: You told us a little bit about the community you grew up in, the grocery store across the street.  Can you tell us a little bit more about the community you grew up in, in Cleveland [Ohio]?  Do you remember some of your friends that you grew up with, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  The, it was a very close neighborhood.  Many of the, many of the mothers on the street worked the same way my mother [Louise Stone Stokes] worked.  They were domestic workers, and they got to know each other by leaving about the same type of morning--the same time of morning and taking streetcars out to the suburban areas where they worked.  Many of the young people, the age of my brother, Carl [Carl Stokes], and myself, were kids we grew up with, at Giddings Elementary School [Cleveland, Ohio] and played together in the streets and came to know and remember all of them so very well, you know.  And right next door to me was a fellow by the name of Walter Thomas [ph.] and the Henderson [ph.] family lived on the left hand side of our, our home.  And the store across the street from us was owned by a man by the name of Marcus [ph.].  And, so I remember the neighborhood very well, but--and basically, people who made their living in meager ways.  About the only person I can remember on the street who did much better was the Gaffney family.  They, they lived across the street from us, behind Marcus' store.  And Mr. Gaffney [George Gaffney, Sr.] was a painter, and he and his, his two sons--three sons really, but I think the older two boys often went out on jobs helping him paint.  And they probably were the most affluent family in the neighborhood, very wonderful people.  George Gaffney [George Gaffney, Jr.], the older boy, became a painter, and Caldwell Gaffney, the second eldest became a doctor and a surgeon.  And I think the third boy, Floyd [Floyd Gaffney], went off in the arts, doing interpretive dancing, things of that sort.  But we--everybody on the street knew everybody.  And many of the young men on that street with us grew up to be professional people.  And, but that's my earliest recollection.
Story_ID: 599282
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up, remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Gee, that's a good question, but I don't--I'm not sure I can answer it.
Speaker 1: Any cooking smells that remind you of growing--
Speaker 2: Any what?
Speaker 1: Cooking smells?
Speaker 2: Well, Sunday mornings, I can still smell the aroma of what home was like with my [maternal] grandmother [Fannie Brinson Stone] in that, that kitchen cooking that big breakfast meal on Sundays and other members of the family coming by and having breakfast with us and, and that type of thing.
Speaker 1: Any sounds that remind you of your childhood?  Streetcar or anything like that, any sounds?
Speaker 2: Sure, I can remember streetcars, was before they had buses and other modes of transportation.  In Cleveland [Ohio], the streetcars were the way that you were able to be transported around the city.  And so I remember the clang of the, of the streetcars, electric streetcar.
Story_ID: 599283
Speaker 1: Can you tell us the name of the elementary school you attended again?
Speaker 2: It was Giddings [Giddings Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio], G-I-D-D-I-N-G-S.
Speaker 1: And were there any teachers at Giddings who had a particular influence on you?
Speaker 2: I can remember Mrs. Martin [ph.], my reading teacher, Mrs. Glucoff, G-L-U-C-O-F-F, who taught us geography.  Those two stand out in my mind.
Speaker 1: And what kind of student were you during elementary school?
Speaker 2: I guess I was a pretty good student.  I remember that reading room we had and how--there were tables in the room.  And when you were a beginning reader, you were fair--a fairly good reader, you sat at this table.  If you improved, you went to the next level, and you sat at this table.  And the object was to get at the top table in there.  And that meant you were a good reader, and, and I loved reading.  And I can remember--I don't much remember the process getting to the good table, but I, I was able to get there.  I know that.  And I can remember how proud I was to be at that table in Miss Martin's class, yeah.
Speaker 1: And during elementary school, those years, did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: I think since I was twelve years of age, I wanted to be a, a lawyer.  And that emanated from the fact that when I was twelve years old, people in the South, black people were being lynched.  And our black newspapers at that time carried those stories.  And along with it were cases like the Scottsboro case in Scottsboro, Alabama, the famous case where the Scottsboro Boys were charged with having raped two white women.  It became a very famous [U.S.] Supreme Court case [Powell v. Alabama, 1932].  And I remember thinking that in many of those cases, there were white lawyers who volunteered to go and represent blacks who were being charged with various things throughout the South.  And it seemed to me that this was something I wanted to do.  Someday I wanted to be a lawyer, and I wanted to be able to go anywhere in the country and be able to defend my people.  And I--and, and so I guess I had visions then of being a great lawyer who would be in demand to go around the country and represent black people in the kinds of cases that were being brought against them.
Speaker 1: Did you know any black lawyers?
Speaker 2: You know, that's an excellent question because I really did not know any black--at age twelve, I didn't know of any black lawyers in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: And can you tell us a little bit about what kind of child you were during that time?  Were you shy, were you obedient or, you know, really outgoing?  What kind of child were you?
Speaker 2: I was quiet.  My brother, Carl [Carl Stokes], was probably much more outgoing than I was.  And, but I think everyone sort of accepted me as being relatively quiet.
Story_ID: 599284
Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church growing up?
Speaker 2: We did.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the church you attended?
Speaker 2: St. Paul A.M.E. Zion Church [Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like at St. Paul's?
Speaker 2: Well, not only did I grow up in that church, I joined the church at the age of sixteen and confessed myself to God and that's the day I'm very proud of and a day I remember very vividly.  I was also a Boy Scout in the church.  I recall being the lawyer for the church later in my life.  I helped them found the credit union of the church and represented the credit union.  I established a forum at St. Paul A.M.E. Zion Church and we had top notch speakers who would come to those forums.  They were well attended.  And I recall being, being a trustee of the church at one time.  So I was very much involved with the church, through the fact that, that Mom [Louise Stone Stokes] took us to church, and then she also required that if we were going to go to the, what we called show--you say now, the movies, but at that time, it was called the show.  And the rule was that if you were going to go to the show on Sunday, you had to go to church first.  And so I can't say that every time I went to church on Sunday morning, it was because I was (laughter), I was anxious to go to church (laughter).
Story_ID: 599285
Speaker 1: What kinds of things did you enjoy doing as a young boy?  You mentioned you liked to go to the movies.  What other things did you like doing [in Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Well, we played, played baseball.  We played some football out in the streets, and then we, we played games out in the streets and things like that.
Speaker 1: Did you shoot marbles?
Speaker 2: I didn't shoot marbles.  I, I tried marbles.  I just wasn't good at it.  Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] was very good at it.  And we played a game called Chubbies [ph.], which you play with a ice pick.  And when I think now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And how do you play it?
Speaker 2: --how dangerous that was (laughter), but, but at that time, that was one of the great games to play.
Speaker 1: How did you play it?
Speaker 2: With a, with an ice pick and I remember something where you'd, you'd put the pick here in your hand and you'd flit it over so it would, it would do a little turn or something and how it went down and stuck in the ground, meant something and that type of thing.
Speaker 1: And it was called Chubbies?
Speaker 2: I think it was called Chubbies, uh-huh.  And then played horseshoes in backyards of some of our neighbors.  And then we'd, we did some boxing at that time, and both Carl and I liked boxing, and so that was one of our favorite sports.  For a while, I played a trumpet--or took trumpet lessons until I, I stopped and don't remember much now about, about playing a trumpet (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 599286
Speaker 1: Okay, so Congressman Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], what was the name of the middle school or junior high school you attended?
Speaker 2: I went to a very famous high school in Cleveland [Ohio], Central High School.
Speaker 1: Now, did you go to middle school at all, like sixth, seventh and eighth grade or was that still part of elementary school?
Speaker 2: No, Giddings [Giddings Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio] took us through the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then you went in the seventh grade at, at Central High School.
Speaker 1: Oh, you went to high school at seventh grade (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it was a junior and senior high school that was mixed at that time.  The building, of course, is now torn down.  But at that time, both the junior and the seniors were mixed in that school.  And I stayed--I went through the ninth grade there.  And then they had built a new Central High School on East 40th Street in Cleveland because they were going to tear down this building, which was located on East 55th Street.  And so I was a part of the first class that moved into the new high school at tenth grade.
Speaker 1: Let's back up a little bit.  I wanna ask you a little bit about middle school.  During the junior high school years, who was influencing you at this particular time in your life?  Who were you most influenced by?
Speaker 2: I think the teachers at Central High School influenced me greatly.  The schools, the teachers at Giddings--I've mentioned a couple of them to you, had taken a very special interest in both me and Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes].  And I remember when they used to send me from class to class, making announcements in the elementary school.  And then I'd, before I left, I saw Carl take over that job coming up, which I had had on previous occasions there in the school.  And by the time I got to high school--this was a school where the teachers were predominantly white.  The students were predominantly black, 98 percent, I suppose at our school, of black students.  But teachers took a very special interest in all of us.  And it seems as though they were on a mission.  That mission being to, to make us know and understand, we were as good as or perhaps better than any white schools in Cleveland or white children.  And they never let us lack confidence in realizing how good we were and how capable we were.  And as a consequence of it, they were tough on us.  But they were tough for the reason they wanted us to be the best.  And so I got a great high school education, junior and senior.
Story_ID: 599287
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite subjects [at Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked history.  I loved English, didn't like math, and wasn't good at math.  But, and I guess what--I'm trying to think what they would call it now, but it was sort of like the government classes, social studies and things like that.
Speaker 1: And like during those years, what--were you still aspiring to be a lawyer?  Was that still your dream to grow up and become a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Well, it was in my mind, I think, something I would love to do.  But I was also being realistic.  I knew that my mother [Louise Stone Stokes] who was on welfare and by then also, we had moved into public housing there in Cleveland [Ohio], the Outhwaite, O-U-T-H-W-A-I-T-E, housing project [Outhwaite Homes]; had no chance of being able to go to college.  My mother's dream at that point in time was that Carl [Carl Stokes] and I get a high school diploma.  That meant everything to her, that these two boys get a high school diploma.  And so she constantly pushed us to stay in school, get this high school diploma.  And this was where she constantly implored us to get something in your head so you don't have to work with your hands, the way I've worked with my hands.  And, and probably the, her greatest disappointment was when at the age of sixteen, my brother, Carl, dropped out of, of high school.  And that really hurt her, you know, because he had helped spoil that dream.  But in the meanwhile, while I was in high school, I still dreamt of someday being a lawyer.  And I wanted to be able to try cases and defend people and be in that courtroom.  That was my dream.
Speaker 1: And what were some of the activities you were involved in, in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I ran track.  I, I was on the, on the school newspaper.  I wrote articles for the sports division of the paper.  Let's see.  I was in the Latin club 'cause I was, I took four years of Latin, up through Virgil, and we had a Latin club.
Speaker 1: Student government at all?
Speaker 2: I did not do anything in the student government that I recall (laughter).
Speaker 1: Band, were you in the band?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No?
Speaker 2: --no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, knowing, you know, you say you were thinking realistically that your mother would not be able to afford the college.  But were you thinking about if you could go to college, where you would like to go?
Speaker 2: No, it didn't get that far, really.  I remember Miss Thomas [ph.], an African American teacher who asked me if I would stay after school one day.  And I began wondering, oh, boy, what did I do now?  (Laughter) And I stayed, and I recall she, she said, "Louis [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], I wanted you to stay and talk with me because some of your teachers here are wondering about your going to college and what plans you're making to go to college?"  And I recall saying to her, "Miss Thomas, I can't go to, to college," I said, "my mother can't afford to send me to college."  And she and I went on and talked, but it stands out in my mind that I was facing reality in the sense of being able to, to realize (background noise)--
Speaker 1: We need to pause Scott [Scott Stearns]?
Story_ID: 599288
Speaker 1: And so you were having this conversation with your teacher about college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Miss Thomas [ph.] said to me, "Louis [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes]," she said, "some of your teachers and I were wondering about what plans you're making for college?"  And I said, "Miss Thomas, I can't make any plans for, for college and my mother [Louise Stone Stokes] can't afford to send me to college."  And that was when I came, you know, face to face with reality and understood that as much as I'd like to go on to college and someday be a lawyer, and, and as nice as it was for some of my teachers to be interested in knowing what plans I was making for college and feeling that this was important to them also, I knew that, that this was just a dream.
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from high school [Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-three [1943], January, 1943.
Speaker 1: And what did you do next, after graduation?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, I was working at a store called Outdoor Sportswear, Incorporated [Outdoor Sportswear, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio].  And it was a army and navy type store.  And I had been hired part time by the owner of the store.  It was a man by the name of Isadore Apisdorf.  And he had hired me originally as a porter.  And he hired me with the understanding that it was my job to be a porter, to clean the floors of the store, to scrub down the outside of the store on the street and to help put up stock and so forth.  And so during that period of time, he and I sort of had an understanding that he also wanted to see, experiment and see whether or not I could become a salesman.  And he explained to me that, "This is an experiment between you and I," and he said, "if it works, fine."  He said, "But I don't want you to hold it against me if it doesn't work."  And so I told him I'd like to try it.  So what had happened was, it had begun to work.  He liked the way that I was capable of being able to act as a salesman, and so they actually hired a young white kid to come in and do the portering work and left me as, really as the first black salesman in downtown Cleveland [Ohio].  And so we had the understanding with him that whenever I graduated I had a job there with him.  And as I, as I told you, I, I knew I couldn't go to college.  So my idea was, I'd go to work--we called him Izzie--go to work for Izzie, work full time and hopefully, someday I'd get myself a little haberdashery and get enough, save enough money to get a little haberdashery and start a little store in, in our community.  And so when I graduated in January, I then worked until August when I was drafted into World War II [WWII].
Speaker 1: And you were in the [U.S.] Army for three years?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Story_ID: 599289
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about your [U.S.] military experience?
Speaker 2: Probably the most unpleasant experience of my life.  I was a eighteen year old kid, going away from home, on my own for the first time in my life.  I had never really been subjected to racial discrimination.  My mother [Louise Stone Stokes] had warned me.  She had warned me that Columbus, Ohio to which they took all recruits straight from Cleveland [Ohio] to orient them into the service, was a very prejudiced town, for me not to go downtown and try to go into the restaurants and things of that sort because they didn't accept blacks in restaurants.  And I found her words to be real words of wisdom.  I went to Columbus.  From Columbus, they sent me to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri in St. Louis, Missouri [Jefferson Barracks Military Post, St. Louis County, Missouri].  And we're trained in all black units, separated totally from white soldiers.  We lived together, ate together and trained together as, as separate and unequal parts of the United States Army.  And that continued on to places like Camp Stewart, Georgia [Fort Stewart, Georgia], Camp Shelby, Mississippi, places of that sort.  And I had incidences, incidents, rather, that occurred of a discriminatory nature, several different posts, things of that sort.
Story_ID: 599290
Speaker 1: Can you share some of them with us?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember in, at Camp Stewart, Georgia [Fort Stewart, Georgia] where all the black soldiers were required in the morning to get up, get in a truck and they took us down to the white part of the, of the base.  And then it was our job to, what they called police the white soldiers barracks or the grounds around their barracks.  That is, they gave us some long sticks that had nails in them in order--and they gave us some bags, some shoulder burlap bags.  And it was our job to walk around and stick, that stick into any type of mess or paper or anything that was on the ground and to clean the grounds that way by taking all the trash in these burlap bags.  And we resented having to do that.  So a group of us were taken down one morning, and we took the sticks and the burlap bags, and we put 'em up under the barracks there.  And then we went across the street to the library and we sat there until time for us to, to go back for a pick up, where they came back to pick us up.  Well, on this particular, someone had told, I guess the military police, what we had done.  So they came into the library, raided the library, arrested all of us and took us back, took us over and actually put us in a little area there where they retained you.  I forget what you call it now, but anyway, even in there, they had toilets for black prisoners and toilets for the white prisoners.  And after they released us from there, they took us down to, back to our barracks.  And at our barracks, we were called in by the company commander, and he told us that we were going to be made an example of for the other black soldiers in our company and that that punishment was to--for us to carry mud packs on our backs and have to parade up and down in front of our company barracks.  And I was sort of spokesperson for the group.  And I, I told 'em that, that what they were asking us to do was unreasonable and protested what they were doing.  And I remember that they changed it somewhat.  We--they took the packs off of us, but we still had to walk up and down in front of the barracks and be an example to the others.  That was just, I guess one of the many kind of incidents that occurred [in the U.S. Army].
Speaker 1: And so did you say--did you stay stateside during your tour (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, we, went out to the port for a shipment and evidently, we were going to go to a hot climate because the equipment given us was for a hot climate.  But we were there about two or three days and V-J Day [Victory over Japan Day] occurred.  And that's when President Truman [President Harry S. Truman] declared V-J Day.  We had just bombed Hiroshima [Japan], and the war [World War II, WWII] had been ended.  And so then we were turned around and sent up to Portland, Oregon.  So I never went overseas--
Story_ID: 599291
Speaker 1: When you came out of the [U.S.] Army in 1946, you then had an opportunity to go to college.  Can you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, what happened, when I, I came out in 1946, honorably discharged.  And I still had that dream of being a lawyer.  But by now, we had the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] which gave veterans an opportunity to be able to take advantage of the G.I. Bill and go to college.  So I came back to Cleveland [Ohio] and I first enrolled at Case Western Reserve University and at the Cleveland College of, of the university [Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio].  And I began or was about to begin as a full-time student when my mother [Louise Stone Stokes] said that I had to go to work.  She said, you've--you know, in her mind still, she--I'd gotten that high school education [at Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio], and it was now my role to go to work and help her because she'd helped me and Carl [Carl Stokes] all those years.  And so I realized that she needed the help, but I also wanted the education.  And so I decided to go, to go to work full time and go to night school.  So I did.  I, I got a job at the treasury department [U.S. Department of the Treasury] as a typist.  I typed treasury checks all day long.  And then I went to Cleveland College of Case Western Reserve University at night.  And I did that for two years.  And at that time, Cleveland-Marshall Law School [Cleveland-Marshall College of Law] in Cleveland had a program where if you had two years of undergraduate study, and you had a B average or above, you could go directly from undergraduate school into, to law school.  By then, by having lost three years in the service and I was in a hurry to get my education and so I took advantage--I had, I had the kind of an average that gave me the ability to be able to, to take advantage of this program.  So I went, transferred then from undergraduate school directly into Cleveland-Marshall Law School.  And, but I continued working a job full time, all day, and I went to law school, five nights a week from six to ten o'clock every night.  And four years later, I graduated with a law degree in--
Speaker 1: So was that in nineteen (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--it was--
Speaker 1: --fifty-two [1952]?
Speaker 2: --nineteen forty-six [1946] when I went to college, and 1948, I guess, '48 [1948] or '49 [1949], I left there and went to law school and graduated from law school in '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Okay, and at Case Western, did you actually earn your B.S. or your B.A. degree?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it just--
Speaker 1: --'cause you went straight into law school after two years.
Speaker 2: I went straight from--after two years of undergraduate, went straight into law school.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: Can't do that today, but (laughter) I was able to do it at that time.
Story_ID: 599292
Speaker 1: And when you were in law school [Cleveland-Marshall Law School; Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, Cleveland, Ohio], what were some of your favorite courses?
Speaker 2: Constitutional law was my, constitutional law, evidence, pleading, criminal law, those were my favorite--those were basically my favorite courses.
Speaker 1: And do you remember some of your law school professors?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I remember the--
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite or one who influenced you in a particular way?
Speaker 2: Well, they had a great contracts lawyer and taught us our first course in law school.  And he was a brilliant teacher and his name was Lewis [Robert L. Lewis].  And Professor Lewis was a young man, just brilliant.  And he taught that course in a way where the first course in law school really became important and you really understood the basics in terms of, of contracts and, and began learning concepts in the law, things of this sort.  And so I remember him and several others whose names would take me a few moments to recollect, pleading, pleading, I loved.  That was a great course. Evidence (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was pleading?
Speaker 2: Pleading taught you how to prepare a lawsuit and how to actually put together the, the--what we call a pleading that's filed with the court and how to respond to, to pleadings when you represent a defendant in a case and things of that sort.  Those are the things I, I just loved about the law.
Speaker 1: And when you shared your dreams and wanting to go to law school with your mother [Louise Stone Stokes]--or did you share those with your mother, that when I grow up I wanna be a lawyer?
Speaker 2: I am not sure.
Speaker 1: Well, what did your mother think about you going to law school?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think she, you know, as long as I was working (laughter), she, she--it was okay for her, for me to go ahead and get this law degree too.  But don't stop working (laughter).
Story_ID: 599293
Speaker 1: So when you earned your law degree [from Cleveland-Marshall Law School; Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, Cleveland, Ohio], what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Well, I really wanted to practice law.  That was, that had been my dream, and I wanted to, to learn right away how to be a good trial lawyer.  I, I was able to begin in 1954.  A friend of mine by the name of Tommy Robinson [ph.] worked for a real estate company.  And it turned out that they needed an in house lawyer, and this is a place called the Carmack, C-A-R-M-A-C-K, Realty Company [Carmack Realty Company, Cleveland, Ohio].  And Mr. Carmack [John Carmack] was a outstanding African American realtor, probably the, the top black realtor in Cleveland [Ohio] at that time.  And so I got the job as his inside house counsel, and really learned real estate law from him.  But the beauty of, of the hiring was the fact that he told me when I was not handling his matters, that on the side, I could actually practice any other kind of law and that became a part of my transaction with him.  And so it gave me the chance to do what you had to do at that time, as a young black lawyer, without any real clientele.  You hung around the courthouse.  And basically, you hustled cases, people who came down there and were charged with crime, had no lawyer, you would be standing around, and people would point you out and say, "There's a lawyer over there," that type of thing.  Or the clerks would direct people to you, things of the sort.  And you really were just hustling cases.  You were trying to make a living.  And I started doing that and picking up cases and trying those cases.  And--
Speaker 1: And were they mainly like criminal cases, the ones you would pick (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Basically, all kind of little criminal cases, misdemeanors and a few felonies, things of the sort.  And here and there, you'd pick up a felony, and you'd pick up a decent fee or the court would assign you to the case when they found out that defendant had no, no funds or was indigent.
Story_ID: 599294
Speaker 1: So, Congressman Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], we were talking just about the early days of practicing law.  And just, what was it like for a young African American attorney practicing law in Cleveland [Ohio] in the mid-'50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: When I came out of law school [Cleveland-Marshall Law School; Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, Cleveland, Ohio] in Cleveland in 1953, black lawyers could not go into major law firms.  They couldn't go into basically white law firms.  Some of the black lawyers who were practicing law at that time, most of whom practiced in small offices out in the black community, sometimes were able to take in a new, young lawyer.  But oftentimes, there was no place for you to go.  You had to learn how to practice on your own, get started on your own, and it was very, very difficult.  In fact, at that time, black lawyers could not even lease offices in downtown Cleveland.  I remember when two of, of our best black lawyers there, older lawyers, brought lawsuits in order just to be able to lease space in downtown buildings from white lessors.  And so that was the situation.  So I was fortunate to be able to go with Carmack Realty [Carmack Realty Company, Cleveland, Ohio] because coming out of law school as I did and under those circumstances, I didn't have money to open up an office.  I had, prior to going to Carmack, one of the older, young--older lawyer, black lawyers that had sort of taken me into his office for a while and let me know I could just sort of practice out of there until I could get something started for myself.  And I always remember how nice that was of him.  So that was the basic situation.  So that's why I said, you had to hustle cases.  It was not easy.  In the first place, white people didn't come to black lawyers for them to represent them.  And many black people felt that if you wanted to get something done in the courts, that you couldn't take a chance on black lawyers because they felt like white lawyers have lunch with the white judges, and the black lawyers can't do anything for you.  So it was a tough time to, to come out of law school and try to, to practice and earn a living in that way.  It is different today, much different.  It's--when I think of the law firm where I'm now a senior counsel, Squire Sanders and Dempsey [Squire Patton Boggs], a worldwide law firm, 750 lawyers, where we have in Cleveland, for instance, a young fellow, black fellow, by the name of Fred Nance [Frederick R. Nance] who is the managing partner of the Cleveland office.  But in 1953, none of that was possible.
Story_ID: 599295
Speaker 1: And so when did you join the firm of, I believe, Terry, Perry, Whitehead, Young and Davidson [Stokes, Character, Terry, Perry, Whitehead, Young and Davidson, Cleveland, Ohio], when did you join that firm?
Speaker 2: Well, that was some years after I had begun practice.  While I was still there with Carmack Realty Company [Cleveland, Ohio], I was--as I said, sort of taking cases and building a practice of my own in terms of my criminal defense work.  There was a lawyer in Cleveland [Ohio] by the name of Norman S. Minor, M-I-N-O-R, probably one of the greatest trial, criminal lawyer whose ever practiced law anywhere.  He was a man who had become a legend in his own time.  And I wanted to be like Norman Minor.  I wanted to, I wanted to be the kind of trial lawyer he was where everybody respected his greatness as a lawyer.  And it happened that I got assigned to a case with Norman Minor by the court--the court assigned two of us to represent a rape defendant.  And--
Speaker 1: Why did they assign two lawyers?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a major case.  And so you give, put two lawyers on because it was a major case.  And so this was the greatest thing that could happen to me, to be given the chance to try a case with my idol, a man who I aspired to be so much like.  And we tried that case, and the defendant was acquitted.  And right after the case, Norman Minor started asking me questions about myself, "How long have you been practicing law and where are you practicing law and tell me about yourself," that type of thing.  He wound up showing up at a little office my brother and I had set up by the--by 1955, when Carl [Carl Stokes] came out of law school, I had left Carmack Realty and Carl and I set up a two office law firm together.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the firm?
Speaker 2: Stokes and Stokes [Cleveland, Ohio] (laughter).  And Carl was at that time, after he came out of law school, he was able to get a job as assistant city prosecutor, and, but he could also work in the law firm.  And then, of course, Carl began running for political office.  And so I basically was maintaining the law firm.
Story_ID: 599296
Speaker 1: And Norman Minor [Norman S. Minor] came up to the office one morning and wanted to look around our office [Stokes and Stokes, Cleveland, Ohio]--and it wasn't much to look around at.  It was just a reception room and two offices.  So that was, (laughter) that was it.  But because of, of what he had seen in that case that he tried--he and I tried together, he asked me if I'd be willing to handle some cases for him while he was away on vacation.  And so I told him I'd be happy to do that.  And basically, he didn't want me trying the cases.  He just wanted me to continue the case over for him so that when he got back, he could take over the case.  And one of the cases that I went in to get a continuance on, the judge refused to give me a continuance.  And he said, "This case is gonna be tried right now."  And I said, "Well, I can't try this case, your honor.  This is Mr. Minor's case.  All I have authority to do is to get a continuance for him."  He said, "The case is not gonna be continued."  He said, "This case is going to trial right now.  Are you gonna represent these people or not?"  And so I said, "Yeah, I'll represent 'em."  So, we tried the case.  I won the case.
Speaker 2: Do you remember what the case was about?
Speaker 1: I don't remember it now (laughter).  And so Mr. Minor had heard, after he got back what had happened and so forth.  And he was pleased with that.  So what he basically did that morning when he came to our offices, he said, "How would you like to come practice with me?"  Well, what--you know, what (laughter), what else could happen in your life at that point and have Norman Minor ask you, "How would you like to come and practice with me?"  And, of course, it didn't take me long to say yes, (laughter).  So anyway, I went with him.  Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] and I then left our offices and went with him.  The firm name became Minor, Stokes and Stokes [Minor, McCurdy, Stokes and Stokes, Cleveland, Ohio].  And that was a turning point in our careers because when Norman Minor takes you into his office, and you become the law firm, Minor, Stokes and Stokes, that said a lot to a whole lot of people in Cleveland [Ohio] and gave Carl and I greater recognition as young lawyers.  And so that's how that came about.
Story_ID: 599297
Speaker 1: And, you know, I wanted to back up just a few steps.  And did your brother share with you that, you know, he wanted to follow in your footsteps and go to law school?  What were your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I came--Carl [Carl Stokes], I mentioned to you earlier, dropped out of high school, sixteen years old.  And he went out to work in a, in a steel plant, Republic Steel [Republic Steel Company].  And he was pushing a broom, sweeping floors out there.  But it gave him the money.  He wanted to hang around the guys in the pool room and stuff like--and hang out in the streets.  But as I said, it broke my mother's [Louise Stone Stokes] heart.  Well, when he came out of the [U.S. military] service--he came out in '48 [1948], I guess.  I came out in '46 [1946], and he came out--May, or '47 [1947], he may have come out, I was already in college [Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio].  And he said he was gonna do the same thing.  And we both talked about being lawyers.  And so that's--it went from there.
Speaker 1: And do you remember your mother's reaction when you all first established your practice, Stokes and Stokes [Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was proud, yes, she was proud.  She was just very, very proud.
Story_ID: 599298
Speaker 1: Let's talk about a few of your other cases during the, the early years, in your fourteen years of practicing law prior to joining [U.S.] Congress.  Can we talk a little bit about the Terry v. State of Ohio [Terry v. Ohio, 1968] case, search and seizure?
Speaker 2: Well, what had happened was that even before joining with Mr. Minor [Norman S. Minor], I was active with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and they had, they had appointed me as the chairman of the Cleveland Branch, NAACP's Legal Redress Committee.  That meant that I had a group of black and white lawyers who wanted to be involved in civil rights matters, over whom I exercised the chairmanship of the Legal Redress Committee.  And these lawyers worked with me on any type of case that we decided to, to handle on behalf of NAACP clients.  It was a volunteer thing for all of us.  None of us got paid.  But this was our way of, of being involved.  So I handled a lot of cases because the Civil Rights Movement was going on at that time, and even before Norman Minor, I was gaining a reputation as, as a trial lawyer.  And so after I'd gotten with Minor, I get a call one day from a fellow by the name of John Terry [John W. Terry].  One of my criminal defendants was a man by the name of Billy Cox.  Billy Cox was sort of notorious in the, in the City of Cleveland [Ohio].  He had been picked up several times on murder charges and things of the sort, and I represented Billy.  And I got to know a lot of the people who hung around Billy.  A young fellow by the name of John Terry was one of the hangers on, and so I get this call from Terry, and he tells me that he's in county jail, and could I come down and see him to, to represent him.  So I went down and talked to him, learned that he and two other men had been arrested and that guns had been found on two of them, him and a fellow by the name of John Chilton [sic. Richard Chilton], C-H-I-L-T-O-N.  And  ordinarily in a gun case, you go in and a man's been found with a gun on 'em, the best thing you can do is try to plead 'em guilty and get 'em probation or some kind of leniency.  But I, in talking with him and John, and Chilton, I, I continued to get a different picture here that something was different about this case.  And the fact situation was that a police officer [Martin McFadden] standing at the corner of 13th [Street] and Euclid [Avenue] had seen three males walk up and down the street and then come back together and then walk apart and up and down the street.  Two of the black--two of the males were black, one was white.  And, but they had done nothing except come together, stand together, talk a little bit and then one or two would walk up and down the street.  And then they'd come back together.  At the time the police officer approached them and spun Terry around and then took a gun out of his coat, overcoat, and then spun Terry--Chilton around and took a gun out of his coat, and then ordered all three of them into a store and placed 'em under arrest, they'd still done nothing, but were standing on the street, not committing any crime.  So I decided I would file a motion to suppress because it did not seem to me that the elements of the Fourth Amendment in terms of what is a reasonable search and seizure had occurred here.
Story_ID: 599299
Speaker 1: On the hearing on the motion to suppress, I asked the police officer [Martin McFadden] how long he'd been a police officer.  He said, "Forty-seven years."  "How long have you been a detective?"  He said, "Forty-five years."  I said, "Have you in the forty-five years as a detective ever arrested anybody under these circumstances?"  He said, "No."  I said, "Were they doing anything on the street?"  He said, "Nah, just talking."  And I said, "Well, what was your purpose for approaching these men?"  And he said, "Well, to tell you the truth, I just didn't like 'em."  And I guess this was thirty-five years ahead of what they now call racial profiling.
Speaker 2: Profiling, yeah.
Speaker 1: And my theory was that the police officer cannot just stop and frisk a person on the street in the absence of something called reasonable, reasonable cause or a crime being in commission.  And so I, I tried that case and ultimately, the case went all the way up to the United States Supreme Court.  It became a landmark case in criminal law.  It is now taught in every law school in America.  It is also taught in every police academy in America.  And it is known as the Terry Stop and Frisk case [Terry v. Ohio, 1968].  And I argued the case in the Supreme Court and it was just great to, to have the experience of participating in what is now a landmark case in, in American law.
Story_ID: 599300
Speaker 1: And what was the experience like arguing before the [U.S.] Supreme Court?
Speaker 2: Awesome, absolutely awesome, standing in front of nine legal giants, to be able to argue on behalf of constitutional law principles as they batter you with one question after another.  In fact, there was a very cute story that goes with it.  That morning I was arguing the case, they tell you in advance that on the lectern from which you speak, there are three lights.  It's a green light, an auburn light and then a red light at the bottom of that in a row.  When the green light goes on, you start talking.  When the auburn light goes on, you reserve five minutes of your time so that you can come back and argue after the prosecutor has had a chance to, to make his statement.  And then the red light there means, stop, you're out of time.  Well, I was less than five minutes into my argument, and I had thirty minutes to argue, when Justice Potter Stewart asked me the first question.  And from that first question, all nine of them leapt into the (laughter), into the scene there, with question after question.  And so I forgot all about these lights on the lectern.  So when I looked down, the red light was on which meant I was out of time.  But I looked up at Chief Justice Warren [Earl Warren], and I said, "May it please the court, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve five minutes of my time for rebuttal."  And I sat down.  And the gentleman who's in charge of the court who was in waistcoat and all that, you know, and he comes over to me.  And he says to me very sternly, "Mr. Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], you do not have any further time," and walked away.  So after the prosecutor had argued, the nicest thing happened to me as a lawyer, a young lawyer standing before those nine men.  Chief Justice Warren looked down at me, and he said, "Mr. Stokes," he says, "you have used all of your time."  He said, "However, this is an important case, and the court would like to hear further from you.  And for that reason, the court is going to extend you five additional minutes for rebuttal."  And that just was the nicest thing that could have happened to me.  I'm a young lawyer sitting there sweating, scared, I've really blown everything (laughter) by not reserving my five minutes.  And it turned out good (laughter).
Speaker 1: In what year was the Terry v. Ohio [Terry v. Ohio, 1968]?
Speaker 2: It was decided in 1968, we actually tried the case in 1963.
Story_ID: 599301
Speaker 1: And let's talk about what happened the year before the decision [Terry v. Ohio, 1968], 1967, when your brother ran for mayor of Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Can you--were you intricately involved in his campaign and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had no political ambition whatsoever.  I, I loved being a lawyer, being in that courtroom.  And Carl [Carl Stokes] was the politician.  He loved politics.  But anyway, he, he first ran for and got elected as the first black Democrat ever elected to the Ohio legislature [Ohio General Assembly].  Then he was so popular that they were afraid he might run for [U.S.] Congress.  And god forbid having a black man run for Congress in Ohio.  So the state legislature in which Carl was serving gerrymandered the 21st congressional district of Ohio, meaning by gerrymandering, they spread the black population out in a manner in which their voting strength was totally diluted.  Carl came back to Cleveland and asked the Cleveland NAACP [Cleveland Branch NAACP, Cleveland, Ohio] to file a lawsuit on his behalf against the same legislature in which he was serving for their having illegally, unconstitutionally, gerrymandered the 21st district.  The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] gave me the case because I was their lawyer.  And so I pulled together a group of, of lawyer who were on the Legal Redress Committee [NAACP Legal Redress Committee] and we filed a lawsuit against the Ohio legislature and against the Ohio governor for illegally, unconstitutionally, gerrymandering this congressional district.  In the meanwhile, Carl continued to be very popular and with--through the Civil Rights Movement we had going in Cleveland, people began urging Carl to run for mayor.  So he did run for mayor in 1965, and he lost by sixteen hundred votes.  And at that time, Cleveland was only 37 percent black.  It was not a black city.  And there were no black mayors of major American cities.  So we knew we were on a cutting edge of history if Carl could do this.  So in 1967, Carl came back again.  Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and other civil rights leaders came into Cleveland and registered black voters in a way they'd never been registered anywhere before.  In 1967, Carl won, became America's first black mayor.  And Cleveland was still only 67 percent [sic.] black.  His picture was on the front of Time magazine, Newsweek magazine, and all of the national publications.  And he was, his achievement was being heralded all around the world.
Story_ID: 599302
Speaker 1: What was his strategy the second time?
Speaker 2: The sec- well, the first time he ran as an Independent.  But Louie Martin [Louis E. Martin], who was in the White House at that time, working as a part of the White House team, advised Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] that it was better for him to run as a Democrat and since he was a Democrat, but was, was doing this Independent thing because of the racial situation in Cleveland [Ohio].  He ran as a Democrat, and, and won.  And not only did we put the 37 percent of, of blacks together, knowing we had to have at least 15 percent of the white vote.  And he was able to go out there and get 15 percent of that white vote to go with the 37 percent.  And the interesting thing was, he defeated a man by the name of Seth Taft.  Seth Taft was the great-grandson [sic. grandson] of an American president [President William Howard Taft].  And so what happened was, this was the great-grandson of a slave who defeated the great-grandson of an American president.  And so after Carl became mayor, well, we won his case [Lucas v. Rhodes, 1967] on the gerrymandering in the United States Supreme Court.
Speaker 1: And what year was that, Congressman Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes]?
Speaker 2: That would have been in 1968 [sic.].  That also came out in 1968.  And so when I went to him, and I said, well, we won your case because the Supreme-the United States Supreme Court ordered the local district court to reconstruct the lines.  And when they reconstructed the lines, constitutionally, the district came out 65 percent black, 35 percent white, which meant for the first time in the history of Ohio, we had enough people in a congressional district, black people, to elect a congressperson.  So I went to him, I said, "Well, Mr. Mayor," I said, "we've won your case," and I said, "you can now go to [U.S.] Congress."  He said, "I don't wanna go to Congress."  He said, "I'm the mayor of Cleveland."  And as a consequence of it, word got out that Carl was not gonna run for Congress, and a lot of people wanted to run for Congress that had nothing to do with the case.  So NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] people came to me and said, "It was your work that created the district, why don't you run for Congress?"
Speaker 1: And what was the, what was the name of the case in 1968 that, the redistricting case?
Speaker 2: Okay, that was, oh, that--one moment--we got--
Speaker 1: That's okay, we'll get it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.

Speaker 1: Congressman Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], what was the name of the case that was argued before the [U.S.] Supreme Court, the redistricting case?
Speaker 2: Okay, that was Lucas v. Rhodes [Lucas v. Rhodes, 1967] because at that time, Charles Lucas was the head of the Cleveland NAACP [Cleveland Branch NAACP, Cleveland, Ohio].  And interestingly enough, he also was my opponent as the Republican opponent in my general election to [U.S.] Congress.  But we did so in a very friendly manner.  He was a very high class man and someone whom I respected very highly.  And even though we contested one another, it was done in a very friendly manner, and with the understanding that the Republicans had to put a candidate into the race.  And who better than Charlie Lucas who was so highly respected.
Speaker 1: And you had said earlier that you were really enjoying practicing law and you really had no political ambitions, so why did you decide to run?
Speaker 2: Well, when, when people came to me and asked me to run, there were a lot of people who were saying they were gonna run for Congress.  And the community really felt, well, these are people that didn't have anything to do with, with help--some of them were public officials.  But councilmen and offices of that sort, labor leaders.  And the people felt that it was the hard work of me and the lawyers who worked with me that had created this district and taken this case all the way up to the United States Supreme Court.  And they said, "Lou, it'd be a natural for you to run, and that you and Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] to hold these positions in this community."  So I went to Carl--in fact, a group of us went to him that Sunday morning and asked him what he thought and whether or not I should be the candidate.  And actually, one other person was under consideration from the NAACP's [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] perspective.  And he had been Carl's campaign manager in the first [mayoral] campaign and in the second campaign.  And so we went to Carl's home that morning and he talked with me.  He talked the fellow who had been the campaign manager.  And he came out of the room, and he said, "Lou is gonna be our candidate."  (Laughter) And it started with that.  And even though I had no ambitions, politically, I felt that at that point in time, I had practiced law fourteen years.  And this was a great challenge for me to go to Congress, be the first black congressman from the State of Ohio.  And I discussed it with my family.  And they agreed that, that they would go along and help whatever way they could to make this, this happen.  My wife, Jay [Jeanette Francis Stokes], felt that, that she would like to see me do it if this is what I'd like to do.  And so we did it.
Story_ID: 599304
Speaker 1: And what was the reaction or what kind of feedback were you getting from the white community, that this was gonna happen, you know, Ohio was going to elect an African American congressman?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, we wound up with twenty-one candidates in all, fourteen Democrats and seven Republicans.  And so--and there were white and black candidates.  And I think the white community basically took the position, yes, there are enough blacks registered at 65 percent to elect a black congressman, but that since this was a new district and it wasn't guaranteed that any black was gonna win, particularly with that number of blacks in the race, and so as a consequence of it, black and white community both contested for these seats.
Speaker 1: And do you remember your campaign strategy and, you know, just how you set yourself apart from the other candidates?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the first thing we ran into, was people saying that we don't want a political dynasty here.  The fact that (laughter)--
Speaker 1: The Stokes dynasty (laughter).
Speaker 2: The Stokes, Stokes (laughter), the Stokes boys will be a dynasty.  So we had to, we had to discount that by saying, "Well, no one ever said this about the Kennedys," and we named, we showed a lot of Irish there in Cleveland [Ohio] who hold--held public office in the same family, things of this sort.  And so we, we offset that pretty good, I think.  We used the, sort of a strategy, "Another Stokes for the very same folks," (laughter).  And that, that--the community is better with two Stokes than even with one.  And, and then we had to separate me from Carl [Carl Stokes] in the sense that, that issues in [U.S.] Congress are different, and you're gonna need somebody who can stand up on those kinds of issues.  And then that, who better than Lou Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes] to work in Washington [D.C.] to help Carl back in Cleveland be able to bring money into Cleveland and, and programs into Cleveland that will enhance our city's growth.  So those are some of the theories that we operated on.
Speaker 1: And what was it like for you personally because here the script was flipped a little bit.  Your brother had followed in your footsteps before, in the past.  So here you were following in his a little bit, just in terms of the political track.  So what was that like for you personally?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I had always, not only just loved Carl, but had great admiration for him because he, he was a special brother.  He--and, and from childhood, I knew there was something special about him, and that he was gonna do special things.  And so as a consequence of it, I took some teasing from people about this baby brother who was now the, you know, this big man in America.  And, and I realized personally, that even though I had acquired a good reputation and a good name, both as a civil rights lawyer and as a criminal defense lawyer, Carl had, at that point out achieved me.  He'd become the first black mayor of America.  And so I accepted that without any sibling rivalry, I guess because of my admiration and my love for him.
Story_ID: 599305
Speaker 1: So, okay, let's talk about the early years in Congress.  You were elected to your first term in 1969.
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968].  I took my seat in 1969.
Speaker 1: Took your seat in '69 [1969].  Tell us a little bit about what Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] was like in 1969 and more particularly, what it was like for African Americans?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was sworn in, in January of 1969, also sworn in that day was William Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.] from Missouri, the first black congressman from Ohio--from Missouri, and Shirley Chisholm, first black woman ever elected to Congress, and she was from New York.  And so there were, at that time, when we took our seats, six black congresspersons there.  So Shirley and Bill and I made it nine.  Now, the largest number we had ever had of blacks in Congress had occurred between 1875 and 1877.  And we had six in the House [U.S. House of Representatives] and one in the [U.S.] Senate.  And so it meant you had seven, and an interesting thing had occurred.  Between 1877 and 1900, we had two black senators and we had twenty House members--never twenty at one time, but a total of twenty-two.  But by 1900, all of them had been defeated.  The enactment of the black laws and other discriminatory methods had effectively defeated every black senator and House member.  Just before the last one went out, his name was George White [George H. White].  They describe him as being a militant, black congressman.  He came from North Carolina, and he made a great speech on the floor of the House.  The Congressional Record of that day says he said, "This, Mr. Speaker, is perhaps the Negroes' temporary farewell to the United States Congress, but phoenix like, he will rise up and come again."  And so following that historic speech, from 1900 to 1928, not a single black sat in the United States Congress, a period of twenty-eight years.  They came back in 1928 [sic. 1929] with Oscar De Priest [Oscar Stanton De Priest] who was elected from Chicago, Illinois.  And then from 1928 to 1968, there were a total of six blacks.
Story_ID: 599306
Speaker 1: So when we came in that day with nine of us, then that was a historic moment in American politics.  So a lot of attention was focused on Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.] and Shirley [Shirley Chisholm] and I because the three of us came out of the Civil Rights Movement and so forth.  And so, right away in response to that media attention, we started doing all kinds of things up there.  We were, we were real activists there in, in the [U.S.] Congress.  The other members of Congress, the black members were senior members to us.  And we knew we couldn't do anything without having them with us.  Now, we wanted to move some things, and, you know, we wanted to raise some sand.  And, but we had to go through Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] who had just been stripped of his power by the Congress.  And Charlie Diggs [Charles Diggs] was there and Gus, Gus Hawkins [HistoryMaker Augustus F. "Gus" Hawkins] and the others.  So we asked Adam Clayton Powell to convene us as a group.  And he said, he wasn't gonna be around there too much because of what had been done to him.  But he'd authorize Charlie Diggs to be our leader.  And so with that, Charlie Diggs sort of became the unofficial leader of this group that, at that time, called themselves the Democratic Select Caucus [sic. Democratic Select Committee].  And that name would later be changed and Bill Clay was the one who later suggested that we need to call ourselves the Congressional Black Caucus and we adopted that and accepted it.
Speaker 2: Why did you all feel it was necessary to have this caucus, this, this outside group?
Speaker 1: Well, because with nine of us there then in Congress, black people throughout America felt that this was a historic moment.  We now have nine black congresspersons.  But they also felt that [HistoryMaker] Louis Stokes can't just come to Congress as a black man and represent Cleveland [Ohio].  He has to represent black people all over America.  And so they thought of us in that respect, that we had the obligation of representing them because they had no representatives.  None of these representatives and none of the nine of us came from the South, unless you wanted to say Missouri was, was south.  And so, for instance, a black kid in Tougaloo, Mississippi could not get appointed to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York].  And so under our group, if Shirley Chisholm appointed Joe Jones in Tougaloo, Mississippi to West Point, then that's an example of what they were looking to, from us.  When the Black Panthers [Fred Hampton and Mark Clark] were killed over there in Chicago [Illinois], people wanted us to come in there and investigate that unlawful, illegal killing of people by the police in Chicago.  We went down to Mound Bayou, Mississippi to investigate what was happening to black people at that hospital there [Mound Bayou Community Hospital, Mound Bayou, Mississippi].  We investigated a couple of shootings of blacks on campuses.  And through all this type of activity, we realized that we really needed to band together on behalf of black people and poor people and disadvantaged people throughout the nation.  And that became our mission.  And that's why we felt we need to officially declare ourselves as the Congressional Black Caucus.
Story_ID: 599307
Speaker 1: And how effective was the Congressional Black Caucus in the beginning?
Speaker 2: Well, it was new to America, and I think it, it struck fear in a lot of people because the six members who were there before the three of us came had never formed a caucus.  And as a result of it, they saw them singularly.  When they saw us come together as a group, talking about being a caucus, it struck fear in, in a lot of people there in the [U.S.] Congress because they didn't--they had no idea what we were gonna do.  And so, indeed, when we tried to meet with President Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] to tell him how devastating his policies were on black and poor people in this country, he was advised, "Oh, don't meet with them.  They're a bunch of radicals."  And, of course, what happened was that President Nixon was due to come to Congress one evening to speak on a State of the Union message.  And on the floor earlier that day, Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.] and I were talking about it, and I said, "Well, why would we, as black members of Congress, come here tonight and listen to him talk when he won't meet with us about the problems of our constituents?"  And I said, "I think we ought to just boycott it.  We ought not be on this floor tonight."  Bill agreed.  He took it to Shirley [Shirley Chisholm] and the other members of the Black Caucus.  Everybody agreed that when he spoke that night, there would be no blacks on the floor, and we would issue a press release saying why.  Well, for the first time that went all over the world, that the black members of Congress refused to attend the state of the message--the State of the Union message by President Nixon because of his policies towards blacks and others.  And two days later, Charlie Diggs [Charles Diggs] got a telephone call from the White House saying President Nixon would like to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus.
Speaker 1: And what was that meeting like?
Speaker 2: An interesting meeting.  President Nixon, being the astute politician that he was, entered the room where we were gathered.  And all of us had been gathered there in the oval room [Oval Office], I guess it was, and had our places where we were standing.  He came through a side door, and when he came in, he went to each member of the Congressional Black Caucus, took a few moments talking with them, being friendly with them, asking them something about their districts or somebody in their families.  In my case, he asked me, "How's Mayor Stokes [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes]," and discussed that with me, and he was, he was a very, very suave, debonair politician that morning.  When we made our presentations--we had one hour--we made our presentations to him individually, each of us designated to speak from a different perspective, he paused for a moment after we finished.  He said, "I do not blame you for coming to see me."  He said, "If I were in your shoes, I would do exactly what you have done."  He said then that he would assign certain members of his staff to work with us in certain areas to see where we could come to some common agreement, and thanked us for coming.
Speaker 1: And did he follow up?
Speaker 2: Well, the follow up was not as good as was indicated that day, and I think we finally--we wound up really attacking him again on many of his policies--
Story_ID: 599308
Speaker 1: And when you first went to [U.S.] Congress, what were--I know that the Congressional Black Caucus, too, wanted to ensure that African American legislators were appointed to key committees and that kind of thing.  So how successful were you all in those efforts during the early years of the CBC?
Speaker 2: One of our concerns was the fact that in most of the congressional offices, there were no minority employees.  The basic minority employees on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] were in our offices on the House [U.S. House of Representatives] side.  There was only one black senator at that time, and that was the senator from Massachusetts [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke].  And so on the [U.S.] Senate side, you--there were almost no black employees, very few.  So as a consequence of it, we wanted to see more minorities being given a chance to work in other congressional offices, senatorial offices and on congressional and senate committees where there's real opportunity for those staffers to make meaningful, penetration into litigation or legislation that is pending before the Congress.  And so we undertook that as one of our missions or goals.  And we set up what is now known as Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, and through that foundation, we were able to start placing highly talented, well educated, young, black interns on House and Senate committees, and, indeed, in some other congressional and House offices.
Speaker 1: And what about in terms of the representatives themselves?  When you first went to Congress, were you finding that African American representatives were getting appointed to key committees within Congress appropriations, you know, as well as some of the others?  And how effective the Congressional Black Caucus in changing that?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that we did, Charlie Diggs [Charles Diggs] was our first chairman, and I was the second.  I was elected as the next chairman of the caucus, each being for a two year period.  Under my administration, I felt we needed to do an analysis.  And that was, whether or not we were at that time proceeding as we should, having had an initial opportunity to, to focus on Congress as a caucus.  And so I appointed Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] of California to head up a taskforce, and I asked them, I said, "Let's look at the caucus from the perspective of the past, the present and the future.  Tell us what we--not only what we've done, what we should now be doing in order to protect ourselves into the future and make ourselves more powerful here in the Congress."  When Ron and his committee or taskforce came back in, they said that we had no longer had the responsibility to try to conduct ourselves as we had in the past, that we didn't have the resources or, or the finances to be able to be all things to all black people in America.  And they said we had to abandon this role of trying to also be civil rights leaders, that we were elected as legislators.  And this is the area in which we had expertise.
Story_ID: 599309
Speaker 1: As a consequence of it, it was our responsibility to try and place ourselves in key positions throughout the [U.S.] Congress, committee system, so that we will have an effect on any legislation moving through those committees.  They had surveyed the congressional committees, and they found out that on the three power committees of the Congress, the three committees with the most power, there had never been a black member of Congress.  So--
Speaker 2: And what were those three committees?
Speaker 1: That was the appropriations committee [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations], which handles the entire federal budget, the rules committee [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Rules] which has in it the full power of, of control over taxation, oil and gas leases and that type of thing and tremendous power.  And then the third was the, the ways--was, I'm sorry, the ways and means committee [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means], which was the one that, that has the oil, gas and lease power and the tax power.  And the rules committee which controls all the committees and whether they get to the floor and when they get to the floor, whether or not the bills can be debated, whether they can be amended, tremendous power.  And so we then accepted that report, and we made our move.  Our move was to get me on the appropriations committee, get Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] on the ways and means and to get Shirley Chisholm on the rules committee.  And so that move was made.  We were successful in doing that.  We had effectively broken into the power in the Congress.  And then we tried to expand the other members into areas of influence.  For instance, Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] wanted to go on the armed services committee [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Armed Services].  And the, the committee that places on committees had the audacity to tell us that, "We'll take any black member except Ron Dellums."  And this was when I had occasion to tell the speaker that the day has passed when white people select our leaders, that Ron Dellums is our leader in this area.  That's who we want on the committee.  It took 'em five minutes.  They went back in on the committee and they came back out and told us that he's on.  So.
Speaker 2: And what kinds of changes were you starting to notice once African Americans, legislators were appointed to key committee within the Congress?
Speaker 1: Well, immediately, they had an opportunity, first, to start acquiring seniority on those committees so that they could become subcommittee chairmen and eventually chairmen of those committees.  We wound up some years later with almost all members of the Congressional Black Caucus having some kind of a subcommittee chairmanship or a chairmanship of a full committee.  And that, that meant we had an opportunity to be--influence legislation and to, to acquire power in a power institution.
Story_ID: 599310
Speaker 1: So Congressman Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], during the early '70s [1970s], mid-'70s [1970s] as more African American legislators were getting key appointments on important committees, what impact and effect, in your opinion, was that having on African Americans throughout the country?  How were African Americans throughout the country benefiting from that?
Speaker 2: Well, I think they were benefitting in this sense.  When Parren Mitchell [HistoryMaker Parren J. Mitchell, III] of Baltimore, Maryland became caucus chairman [Congressional Black Caucus], he had already initiated what he called a brain trust.  One was in housing and then he had another one in minority businesses.  And under his brain trust, he had established a number of experts throughout the country, who came to Washington, D.C., worked with him on housing legislation, worked with him on minority business legislation, and it was sort of a pilot for all of us to see how we could do the same in our areas of expertise.  For instance, I know when Parren came to me, and he said, "Lou, you're on the appropriations committee [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations], one of your committees is labor, health, human services and education [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies]."  He said, "Why don't you set up a health brain trust where you can address matters of health through a brain trust." Thought it was a great idea.  I did, and over the next twenty-five, thirty years, well, I continued that health brain trust.  It gave top health policymakers and doctors and, and others in related fields of health to come to Washington, D.C., work with me in terms of any health legislation moving through the [U.S.] Congress where these experts could provide me the kind of expertise I need in order to pursue a black perspective on legislation moving through the Congress in health.  And with that being done in housing, education.  For instance, Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.] and Shirley Chisolm had educational brain trusts to work from, and Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] had his trust.  They all had--it was just magnificent the way it worked out so beautifully.  And so that way we sort of became watchdogs over all these areas in which we were acquiring expertise to try and benefit black people through the legislative process.
Story_ID: 599311
Speaker 1: And let's talk about in 1976 when you were asked to serve on the House Select Committee on Assassinations [U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations].  First, can you tell us what the task of that committee was?
Speaker 2: Yes, the, the King family had actually been working with Congressman Walter Fauntroy [HistoryMaker Reverend Walter Fauntroy] of the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] to get an investigation of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  The reason being that there were a lot of rumors and allegations that were hanging out to the effect that the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] who had actually captured James Earl Ray was also involved in the assassination of Dr. King.  And this group came to [U.S.] Congress, talked to the Speaker of the House Carl Albert at that time, and persuaded him that it was necessary to appoint a committee that would look into all aspects of the assassination of Dr. King and make an assertion as to whether or not the FBI was involved.  The committee ran into some political problem in terms of being created because there had been another group of House members who had wanted an investigation of President Kennedy's [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] assassination.  Fifteen years had gone by and there had been no committee created for that purpose.  So a deal was struck that a committee would be put together to investigate both assassinations.  And that satisfied everybody and the committee was then appointed.  I remember the speaker saying to me that they'd like for me to serve on the committee because of my past background in terms of, of being a trial lawyer and so forth.  And so I agreed to do and was, and was honored to do so.  The first, first two chairmen of the committee did nothing.  The first one was a congressman from Virginia [Thomas N. Downing] who had announced he was going to retire from Congress.  The committee was appointed, I believe, in September of '77 [1977].  From September until December when he left office, did absolutely nothing.  The committee just went along, no action.  The second chairman appointed was Mr. Gonzalez [Henry B. Gonzalez] of Texas, and unfortunately, between January and March of '78 [1978] when--or maybe it was '77 [1977] because I think the committee was appointed in '76 [1976] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: And so between January and March, he and the counsel for the committee got into an open, public dispute.  And in March, Gonzalez announced his departure from the committee.  At that point, Speaker Tip O'Neill called me and said, "Louie [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], you're next in line in seniority."  He said, "I'd like to appoint you to be chairman of the committee."  I accepted the chairmanship and it is at that point that we began in the real investigation of both assassination.
Story_ID: 599312
Speaker 1: And what were your findings [by the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations]?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we spent two years with our investigation.  We were funded about $6 million to conduct the two investigations.  We concluded in the case of President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] that Lee Harvey Oswald was the shooter of the rifle that actually killed the president, but we also found that there was a possibility of a conspiracy.  We could not name the, the co-conspirators, but we did name groups which we felt could have been involved as co-conspirators in his assassination.  In the case of Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], we concluded James Earl Ray was the shooter, that he, in fact, assassinated Dr. King.  But we also felt that there was a possibility of co-conspirators in that assassination also.

Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: First question is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Have a favorite food?  Yeah.  I love seafood and I guess one of my favorite dishes is Chilean sea bass.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite color?

Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Charles Stokes] side.  But we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Louise Stokes [Louise Stone Stokes], L-O-U-I-S-E, middle name was Cynthia, C-Y-N-T-H-I-A, Stokes, S-T-O-K-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, her maiden is Stone, right?

Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: October 27th, 1895, in Wrens, W-R-E-N-S, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace the relatives on that side?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think we go back to--great-grandfather on my mother's side.  And that's probably as far as we go.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what do you know about your great-grandfather on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Nothing, except he was a slave.
Speaker 1: Well, that's significant.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about the end of slavery that were passed down through the family?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I--unfortunately, for some reason we did not explore this type of thing with our mother and I guess she never really volunteered it if she knew it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I really don't have any stories we can share with you.
Speaker 1: Do you know if he was a slave from around Wrens, Georgia, around the same place that your mother was born?
Speaker 2: I do not know that.  Now, I have a daughter who is currently doing some family genealogy and she's doing an outstanding job of it.  That may be something we can provide to you for this series, but I currently cannot give it to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do, do you know very much about your mother's grandparents and what they were doing?
Speaker 2: I do not.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were they farmers, do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I know that her family--her family worked a farm in Wrens, Georgia, and I guess they were sharecroppers.  And how far this sharecropping went back in terms of her father's father and others, I have no knowledge--
Story_ID: 599316
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Louise Stone Stokes] talk about growing up in Wrens, Georgia?
Speaker 2: To a limited extent.  We know that she had approximately an eighth grade education; that she went to a one room type of school there in Wrens.  We know that, since her father [William Stone] was a sharecropper that she was expected to do farming there on the farm where they lived; and that she had picked cotton as a young girl, and that's about the extent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she discuss the circumstances that led to her moving to Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She saw that her future was very limited.  She was, as I've already said, a young woman with only an eighth grade education; she knew she was limited in that respect; and she saw herself, as she put it to us, her future was picking cotton and doing the other menial tasks on a farm, and she wanted something better for herself in life, and felt that if she went to Cleveland where she already had one of her sisters, that she could have a much better life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was the connection with her other sister that made it easier for her to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --make the transition?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How many brothers and sisters did she have, did you know?
Speaker 2: There were eleven in all.
Speaker 1: Typical big family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was one of eleven.  Yeah, a typical large rural family that could be found with many black families in that era right before or during the out migration which occurred in the early 19th century.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Did she talk about how she came up?  Did she come up on a train or--
Speaker 2: Train.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  So what year--how--or how old was she when she came up?
Speaker 2: Gee, I guess early twenties, but I'm not sure exactly.
Story_ID: 599317
Speaker 1: I want to move to your father's side now, and then we'll get them together.  But, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name was Charles Louis Stokes [Charles Stokes], C-H-A-R-L-E-S, L-O-U-I-S, Stokes, S-T-O-K-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't have his date of birth, but I believe he was born in Cordele, C-O-R-D-E-L-E, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He died at a very young age.  He was only twenty-eight years old when he died.  And he died there in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a story about his death?
Speaker 2: He died of acute peritonitis, which back at that time was, I guess, almost fatal because they didn't know medically what to do with it that they do today.  It's really--we know it today as acute appendicitis.  But, at that time they didn't know what to do with as they do today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So--now, is there--what do you know about your father's side?  He died young, but do you know much about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  He may--he may not have had as much education as my mother [Louise Stone Stokes] had, and he was a laundry worker in Cleveland.  That's what he was doing when my mother met and married him.  She was a domestic worker working in suburban homes where she basically took care of their children, she scrubbed their floors, cleaned their--and laundered their clothing, and served their dinners, and cleaned their homes; and he was a laundry worker.  And so, you know, they met and fell in love and got married.  But to my knowledge, that was the only employment we knew of they had was as a laundry worker.  What he did as a laundry worker, I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Now, what year did he pass away?
Speaker 2: It would have been 1928.  I was three years old; my brother Carl [Carl Stokes] was a year old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was born around 1900, I guess then at the time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So is there a story about--that your mother tells about how they met?
Speaker 2: I don't recollect any story.  I'm not sure how they met really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he have any other relatives in Cleveland that stayed in touch with you all after he passed?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There were a number of brothers and sisters in his family, and I'm not really sure how many.  I know he had a number of brothers and he had a couple of sisters.  They were a large family, very similar to my mother's family.
Story_ID: 599318
Speaker 1: Are there are any, any stories about his, his personality, what he was like?  Do you have any sense of what his personality was like?
Speaker 2: Well, members of the family as well as people who knew him outside of our family always talked about what a wonderful man he was.  He obviously was a very even tempered person; relatively quiet, and was known as being hardworking, and just a nice guy.  My mother [Louise Stone Stokes], all those years as a widow, always let Carl [Carl Stokes] and I know what a wonderful man he was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about your mother's personality; can you tell us something about hers?
Speaker 2: Mom spoke very softly that her voice oftentimes was indistinct.  You could hardly hear her.  You had to listen very carefully to hear her, she was so quiet.  And, she could be fun and, yet, she probably was more serious than someone with a lot of humor.  She was very devout, very Christian.  I used to see her read her Bible every night before she went to bed when she was there at the home with us, because oftentimes she lived on the job and worked on the job Monday through Friday, then she'd be home Saturdays and Sundays with us.  But whenever we saw her at night before she went to bed, she read from her Bible.  She spent a lot of time talking to Carl about getting an education.  That was her penchant.  She wanted to see her two boys get a high school diploma.  Now, she knew she'd never be able to send us to college, but she wanted us to get that high school diploma.  And so, we frequently heard from her about education.  She always said, "Get something in your head so you don't have to work with your hands the way I've worked with my hands."  And we heard that over and over and over again.
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea of what inspired her to be so focused on education?
Speaker 2: She, she carried herself with a great deal of dignity and sophistication.  And I think her knowledge that she didn't have the education to go with it, she learned how to act as though you had an education and how to carry yourself.  And I guess by being in those white homes where she took care of their homes and served their dinners and all that, she knew all of the protocol with reference to serving dinners and what goes what and where and how you--what goes first and--all that.  And--but she was--she was a strong lady.  She had to be strong to handle me and Carl because we were like most young guys.  We were--we grew up there in the tough part of town [Cleveland, Ohio] and, you know, we spent time in the street.  But she stayed right on us to let us know what she'd accept and what she wouldn't accept, and we were going to conduct ourselves as long as we lived in that home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, from what you know about your father [Charles Stokes]--I know you didn't him very, very much (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I never knew him.  I was three years old when he died.
Speaker 1: --yeah.  And your mother--who do you think you take after the most from what you know?
Speaker 2: Well, our exposure basically was to our mother and her relatives as opposed to my father and his relatives.  We, we did get to know some of his relatives, but we didn't spend the kind of time with them that we spent with my mother and her relatives.
Story_ID: 599319
Speaker 1: What neighborhood did you live in when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Well, we grew up in Cleveland [Ohio] on East 69th Street, and 69th Street was between Cedar [Avenue] and Central Avenues.  And that's the first place I can remember living.  As my understanding was that as a baby, that we lived on the same street and--I'm not sure of the address on that street--but I know the home in which we lived on 69th Street was 2234 East 69th Street.  And that's the home I can remember up until my mother [Louise Stone Stokes] moved us down to public housing, and that was known as the Cleveland Metropolitan Housing [Cleveland Metropolitan Housing Authority; Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority].  And this was called the Outhwaite Homes project, O-U-T-H-W-A-I-T-H-E [sic.].  Outhwaite Homes project.  And, that's where we grew up from the age--I'd say I was probably about fourteen; Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] would have been about twelve.  And so, prior to that time, we lived on 69th and we moved to 4301 Case, C-A-S-E, Court, in the Outhwaite Homes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So basically--
Speaker 2: And that's, W-A-I-T-E, not T and no H there.  Outhwaite.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Outhwaite.
Speaker 1: So basically, you grew up on 69th Street, right, you know, until the latter part of your teenage (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Until--yeah, until we were about fourteen and twelve.  And then, from say, I was sixteen until I graduated; fourteen 'til, 'til about eighteen when I was inducted into World War II [WWII]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we lived in the project homes.
Story_ID: 599320
Speaker 1: I guess 69th Street played--well, describe, I guess, the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, the home that we grew up in there on 69th Street was a two family home, we lived downstairs.  We had some cousins who lived upstairs.  The downstairs consisted of two bedrooms, a living room what you'd call a front room, a kitchen, and a bath.  And my mother [Louise Stone Stokes] had her mother [Fannie Brinson Stone] come up to take care of Carl [Carl Stokes] and I when she'd be on the job and couldn't be home.  And so, our grandmother lived, or slept rather, in one bedroom, and Carl and I slept in the other bedroom, except when our mother came home on the weekends; and then she, Carl, and I slept in the same bed in the other bedroom.  It was a home in which I remember the potbelly type of stove that heated the whole house, coal stove.  And the front yard was a dirt front yard; there was no lawn out there, it was just a dirt front yard.  Our neighbors were 98, 99 percent black.  I can remember an Italian family and a Chinese family right there on our street.  But other than that, it was 98, 99 percent black.  The school, the elementary school we went to, was one street over on 70th [Street]; between 70th and 71st Street, Giddings Elementary School [Cleveland, Ohio], G-I-D-D-I-N-G-S, Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Was that school named for some black educator or black figure?
Speaker 2: No.  It was an educator, somebody by the name of Giddings, but I can't remember who exactly it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm remember some black Giddings that are involved in history (unclear).
Speaker 2: No--so, I don't it was think it was named after him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so--I have to ask this question.  I guess it would occur to somebody in Ohio (unclear), but are the Stokes on your father's [Charles Stokes] side related to any of the Wilberforce Stokeses at all?
Speaker 2: No, but we claim them (laughter).  Yes, sir, I--we know that Stokes family, and he is the president of Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio], and a great man; Rembrant Stokes [sic. Rembert E. Stokes].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Great man.  And we always tell people that Rembrant and his family are on the wealthy side of the family (laugher).
Speaker 1: And I read, too, that you're somehow related to Rick James.
Speaker 2: We are.  Rick James and I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The musician, the late musician.
Speaker 2: --we're cousins, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're cousins.
Speaker 1: You're cousins on your mother's side or your father's side?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, his mother was my--was--my mother was his mother's [Mabel Sims Johnson] aunt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 599321
Speaker 1: The household consisted basically of your grandmother [Fannie Brinson Stone] and you and your brother Carl [Carl Stokes], and your mother [Louise Stone Stokes] actually had to stay at the home of the people she worked for during the week; is that it?
Speaker 2: Yes, oftentimes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did I--and people forget that it was that way in those days.  It doesn't happen so much now, but people who were domestics often did stay in the homes of the people they worked for.
Speaker 2: And she had to help raise other people's children.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a tough one.  I know there's a book that's been written here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] about a union that was formed of the maids to try to get the right to go home, you know.
Speaker 2: Sure.  Sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And was--did she have to do that or her whole--the whole time that she was a domestic or did she ever--
Speaker 2: No.  There was a period there when she would come home every evening.  She'd go out early in the morning; she'd take at that time a streetcar.  You know, at that time, they didn't even have buses.  You took the old streetcar.  And she had to take maybe one, two, three streetcars some mornings in order to be able to get out to this suburban home where she was working.  Then she'd have the same situation in the evening when she came home.  And I remember her telling us that she was paid eight dollars a day plus carfare.  Now, probably carfare was, you know, a dollar, fifty cents, I don't know what it was, but she made eight dollars a day for working the whole day in a domestic capacity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You know, what suburb (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's why she--she also found it necessary to go on welfare and--
Speaker 1: So it wasn't a living wage really?
Speaker 2: It really wasn't, and that's why she found it necessary to, while she was working every day, to also go on welfare.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That book is called, 'Living In, Living Out' ['Living In, Living Out: African American Domestics and the Great Migration,' Elizabeth Clark Lewis] just in case somebody's listening to this and also trying to get it--I can't remember the author, but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --about the fight to go home, you know--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: So she would leave on Mondays, I guess, and then--
Speaker 2: Come back on Fridays.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So it was--she really had quite a job then trying to raise two boys and the work--
Speaker 2: That's why she sent for her mother, our grandmother.  And basically, it was our grandmother who spent most of the time with us and helped raise us.  And we were very, very close to her.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Like of what?
Speaker 1: Well, an earliest.  The very first thing that you remember in life (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) If I do, I don't know what it was.  Frankly, I've never, never faced that question before.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: I mean perhaps if given time I'd think of one, but offhand, off the top of my head, no.
Story_ID: 599322
Speaker 1: In the absence of your first childhood memory, what is a--do you have a good childhood story from growing up, an early childhood story?
Speaker 2: No.  But I think that as I look back in those years, we had a good experience as children.  We were poor, but we didn't--we didn't know we were poor; we probably thought everybody was like that in that day and age.  There weren't any televisions for us to see the wealthy side of life.  We were happy; we were in a very happy home.  And, you know, I think both Carl [Carl Stokes] and I did a lot of things as young boys together, and we came up in a neighborhood, even though it was a poor neighborhood, everybody else was like us.  So, we made a lot of friends and grew up playing with a lot of people of whom we have very fond memories.  And as I look at the time we spent growing in public housing, likewise, these are good people in Cleveland [Ohio]; they were just poor people.  There were lawyers there, there were school teachers; many of them just couldn't find employment.  One of the best places for lawyers to go and find work was in the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] at that time.  You could go in post office and find all kinds of well educated black people during that period.  But they couldn't get into those professions.  So out of those Outhwaite Homes [Cleveland, Ohio] has come people similar to Carl and I that are doctors or lawyers or judges or prosecutors and people--and school teachers--people in all professions who lived in the housing project at that time.  As I say, they were good people.  Their families, their parents were very much like my mother [Louise Stone Stokes].  They wanted the best for their children.  They wanted them to get as much education as they could get, but they were limited in what they could do economically because they were poor people.
Story_ID: 599323
Speaker 1: Your brother Carl [Carl Stokes] is a year younger than you, right?
Speaker 2: Carl is two years--
Speaker 1: Two years?
Speaker 2: --he was two years younger than I.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were pretty close in age?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it, was it--a lot of people, you know, wish they had a little brother to grow up with or a brother close to their age.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Was it good having a little brother around (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know my brother never did buy that little brother concept.  He always felt that he was the big brother.  And he acted that way.  And he, and many people thought he was the big brother because he acted that way all the time.  Yet and the same time, there's a side of him that looked up to me as his big brother, and he's written things to me and signed different things in which he acknowledges me as his big brother and how proud he was of me as his big brother, things like that.  But publicly, he put on that front; he wasn't the little brother, he was big brother (laughter).
Speaker 1: I guess in that same vein, can--he was such an important figure in black history; he was the first mayor of a major city [Cleveland, Ohio], you know--a black mayor for a major city.  Describe his personality growing up.  What was he like growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, Carl, even as a very young boy had a certain charisma that attracted him to people, whether it was in school or in some church or social gathering, his charisma, his personality made him the attraction.  And, you know, I always as a kid, I always knew there was something very special about my brother.  And I accepted it that fact.  But--and as he grew up, of course, that charisma grew, and the moment he walked into any room the light shone on to Carl Stokes.  And he was so personable and so likeable.  And he had all the other characteristics; he was smart, he was intelligent, he was good looking, you know; at the same time, he was physically tough.  And he was the kind that whatever he did, he did it better than other people did.  If he was playing ping pong, he'd be the best ping pong player.  If he was running track, he'd be the best at track.  He just had--God gave him that golden touch that enabled him to turn whatever he touched to gold.  And so, that I saw in him maybe before most other people saw it, because I lived with him every day.  Now like, you know, we were kids; he and I have had fights just like other brothers do.  And, you know, Mom [Louise Stone Stokes] had to part us many a day.  And days that she wasn't there, we really went at it with one another.  But at the same time, when we walked out of that house, we were against--stood together against anybody outside of our family.  And that was the way we grew up.
Story_ID: 599324
Speaker 1: Could your grandmother [Fannie Brinson Stone] keep up with you two?
Speaker 2: It was a little harder for her to.  But what she would do, my mother [Louise Stone Stokes] had a, had a brother.  His name was Pughsley, P-U-G-H-S-L-E-Y, Stone, S-T-O-N-E [Pughsley Stone], and we called him Uncle Dock, D-O-C-K.  And--
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind that name, Pughsley, that you know of?
Speaker 2: He was--well, he was named after someone else in the family, and I'm not sure what exactly this other Pughsley's relationship was.  That--I'm sure that's in my daughter's genealogy chart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was a tough guy.  And whenever Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] and I got too much to handle, she'd call her son over and tell him, "Dock, come over here."  And she told him--tell him about whatever we had done.  And that meant he took you outside or if he handled you inside, he took off that leather belt and he gave you a spanking with that leather belt.  And other times he'd send you outside to go get some kind of a twig off of a tree or something, and he used that on you.  And so, she had, she had that weapon whenever we got out of control, and, and she used it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 599325
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite things to do when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked playing baseball.  Playing things like marbles.  We played touch football out in the streets.  We boxed, and that was most of the things.  I played a trumpet--took trumpet lessons at one time in my life.  Also took piano lessons.  But, in either case, Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] took piano one time also, but we didn't get the Rick James genes that gave us any real musical talent.  So, you know, we played at those things and that was it.  We never developed in any respect musically.  But, those were some of the things that I enjoyed doing growing up.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned boxing.  And you grew during the Joe Louis era, right, when Joe Louis was--
Speaker 2: We grew in an era where black kids didn't have a lot to look up to being.  At that time, every little boy wanted to grow up and be like Joe Louis.  We didn't have any other black heroes.  We didn't have black congressman and blacks who had achieved in the sciences and other professions.  And so, basically, in most families you're looked up to today when you'd be another Joe Louis or something like that.  And so, on our street, when we were on 69th Street [Cleveland, Ohio], in the backyards there, we would have boxing contests.  And we had a guy on the street, a Mr. Taylor [ph.], who had been a former boxer, and he kind of took Carl and I under his wing and taught both of us boxing.  And, you know, Carl did more with it than I did.  Carl went on to the fight in the Golden Gloves, and he also boxed on the West Virginia State boxing team [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia], and he boxed in the European theater when he was in the [U.S.] Army.  But, it started right there on 69th Street when we boxed in the backyards in the evenings.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Did you have a radio when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had one of those old radios.  That's what we used to listen to Joe Louis' fights.  And it was--I forget the name of those old radios, but we had one like almost every, every family had at that time.
Speaker 1: Seemed like everybody had a Philco for some reason--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  One of those of kinds of radios.  And, of course, you sat there, you sat by it at night and listen to it like people sit down today and watch T.V.  But at that time, there wasn't any T.V., so you'd sit there and you'd listen to programs.  I remember a favorite program was 'Jack Armstrong' ['Jack Armstrong, the All American Boy'].  And it was--just trying to remember some of those that I remember--that's 'Amos 'n' Andy,' and things like that.  And--
Speaker 1: Did you know that Amos and Andy were white then, did you--?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't remember now whether at that time we knew that or not, you know.  But, those were the kind of programs everybody listened to at that time.
Story_ID: 599326
Speaker 1: Other than Joe Louis, did you have any other heroes, you know?
Speaker 2: When I was growing up, one of the things I was particularly aware of was the lynchings and other atrocities that were occurring in the South with reference to black people.  And I guess I was aware of it because I read the black newspapers.  I remember I was a newsboy myself, and I started delivering papers at the age of twelve.  And I delivered the old Cleveland News, which is, you know, not in business today, but I delivered that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The Cleveland Gazette--wasn't that out when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Was the Cleveland Gazette still coming out when you came up?
Speaker 2: Gazette, yes, which was the--the pre-Call Posts [Call and Post] of that day.  I'm not sure that I ever delivered the Call Post.  I do know delivered the Cleveland News.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And on Sundays I delivered The Plain, The Plain Dealer.  But--and I think at some point I must have sold some of the black newspapers, too, because I remember that's where I used to read about these lynchings and other atrocities affecting black people. And--
Speaker 1: The Defender [Chicago Defender] or the Courier, Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Defender and the Courier were two that I was very familiar with as a young man.
Story_ID: 599327
Speaker 1: And I think that's where I first began to think that someday I wanted to be a lawyer because, unfortunately, to go back to your question about people I could look up to, I didn't know of any outstanding black lawyers.  I knew about Clarence Darrow who was white.  There was a big lawyer in New York [New York] who defended the Scottsboro Boys, and--but he was white.  And that was one of the things that really wanted me to be a lawyer.  I wanted to be a trial lawyer and go into cities where these types of things were occurring so that I could represent black people, feeling that, that while it was good for these white lawyers to take on these cases and represent them, that they should really have a black person--a black lawyer of the caliber of these white lawyers, who could go into these various cities where these situations occurred and represent those people.  And so, there were no Thurgood Marshalls for me to aspire to be like at that time.  Thurgood came along later and I admire him today.  He is a hero of mine.  But when I was a little boy, we didn't have any Thurgood Marshalls to look up to.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, just to put it in perspective on some level, the pictures that used to be in the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] and the Defender [Chicago Defender]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --of lynchings were graphic, were they not?
Speaker 1: As a young boy, twelve, thirteen years old, that was what grabbed me and that's what made me think, someday, and I wasn't being realistic.  I was a little poor boy who--I was going to be lucky if I got a high school diploma that my mother [Louise Stone Stokes] wanted me to get.  I couldn't even dream really about college, but I dreamed--I guess you dream even though it doesn't fit reality.  And that's what I did.  I dreamed that someday I was going to be this great lawyer, a black lawyer, who went all over the country representing black people.
Speaker 2: So, you really didn't know the black lawyers in town in those days, or what they were--
Speaker 1: At that age I didn't, no.  No.
Speaker 2: There probably were some.  I know there were.
Speaker 1: There were some, yes.  Yeah, I'm sure there were some because later on when I grew up and went to law school [Cleveland-Marshall Law School; Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, Cleveland, Ohio] and came out of law school, there were black lawyers out at that time, and, and some very prominent black lawyers.
Story_ID: 599328
Speaker 1: Did you start school at Giddings [Giddings Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio]? Is that where you started?
Speaker 2: Went to elementary school, started there at Giddings and finished at Giddings; went to the sixth grade, and then left there and went to Central Junior High School [Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio] which is located close to Cedar Avenue on East 55th Street.  And, oh, went to junior high there, and then there was an old school.  There was a school that John D. Rockefeller went to and graduated from.  And--
Speaker 1: That goes back to the 1880s, right--I mean '70s [1870s].
Speaker 2: It goes back a long ways, yes.
Speaker 1: John D. Rockefeller, yeah.
Speaker 2: But that was one of the things famous about the school that back in its early days, that was the high school he graduated from.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So what did--what--was Giddings like?  Was that a good--do you have any good memories of Giddings?
Speaker 2: I do have good memories of it.  The teachers there were conscientious.  They made us learn.  They were good teachers.  They were tough, but they were good.
Speaker 1: Were there all black teachers at Giddings?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  The majority white.  But we only had, as I recall, two black teachers in Giddings Elementary School.  But all of them, black and white, took a real interest in us.  The same is true in both Central junior and senior high schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those teachers were dedicated to us, and they were dedicated and committed to making us understand that, even though we were 98, 99 percent black in that school, that we were as good as or better than any students in any of the Cleveland public schools.  And because they knew and we knew that--say even Cleveland Central High School, Cleveland East Tech High School [East Technical High School, Cleveland, Ohio], were predominantly black.  Most of the other high schools were white.  In fact, at that time East Tech High School where Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] went because he didn't go to Central, he went to East Tech, everybody knew that those were schools where predominantly blacks went.
Speaker 1: I remember Cleveland East Tech from my high school days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that was where the basketball--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, great track and basketball teams.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Cleveland East Tech would come to town and everybody would duck on the team (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  (Laughter) Yeah, those were great days.

Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that really stand out as mentors to you in grade school or high school [Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.   In high school I particularly remember a Miss Thomas [ph.], because I remember one day in high school--and she was one of my favorite teachers, but I remember her asking me to stay after school that evening.  And I couldn't recall what I'd done wrong to make her want me to have to stay after school.  But, anyway I stayed and when she began talking with me, she asked me, she said, "Some of us here, teachers here are wondering what plans you're making for college and where you're going to go to college?"  So, I remember telling her, I said, "Miss Thomas, I can't go to college."  I said, "My mother [Louise Stone Stokes] can't send me to college."  And I said, "Soon as I get out of school, she's expecting me to get out of school and go to work so I can help her from what she's gone through all these years trying to just get me through high school."  And, I'll always remember that conversation because it meant so much to me that Miss Thomas felt that I was a student of the quality that she and other students [sic. teachers] wanted to take an interest in seeing where I was going to go to college.  And that meant a lot to me.  I remember Miss Martin [ph.] who was a young, black teaching at Giddings Elementary School [Cleveland, Ohio], and she was our reading teacher.  And at that time in elementary school you would go from one table to another, depending upon your reading skill.  Like the first table would be for the best readers.  The second table would be for the good readers.  And then, she'd have a table for the mediocre readers, and then the bad readers.  And, of course, if you started out at one of those tables, you wanted to be advanced to the next table and so forth and the next one.  So--and--but I remember how conscientious she was about teaching us to read.  And there's another teacher who just passed recently, and she taught us math.  And I remember her because I'd messed up some problem one day in her class, and I remember taking her--always had a ruler, and she'd go up and get that--it was a little about a foot long ruler, and she'd come up to you and she'd take your hand and hold it and bend the hand back while she beat on that hand with that ruler.  And I can still see her that day hitting my palm with that, that ruler, and it's been a few years since she did that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now--
Story_ID: 599330
Speaker 1: Were you a pretty well behaved student or were you a troublemaker or what kind of student were you in school?
Speaker 2: I was by no means a perfect student.  By no means.  You know, I had a clique of guys who I ran around with, and who got in trouble one way or another there with the teachers.  I remember once, I think, in art class was where a group of us went, we took this art--none of us had art ability--we took this class because it supposed to be an easy class, and we felt we'd be together and have some fun.  And I remember one day whatever we did that I got suspended there for whatever I did in that class.
Speaker 1: Was that at Central High School [Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: At Central High School.  I was in high school in an art class at that time.  And I remember how my mother [Louise Stone Stokes] had to come up to school and talk to the principal and the art teacher to get me back in the school.  And I remember the lecture I got from my mother about she was out there working as hard as she was working, and doing the kinds of things she had to do on the job, scrubbing people's floors and all that, to get me an education, and here I was acting a fool in school.  And I'll always remember that.  And I agreed that there was no reason for me to have caused her that kind of hurt; that I wasn't in school trying to learn as I should have been.  And so--but I was basically--I was a good student.  I could--I mean, I could do the work, but like many other guys, I just didn't apply myself all the time.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: I loved social studies and government, and I loved English.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those were my favorite subjects.
Speaker 1: Now, you ran track.  What did you run when you ran track?
Speaker 2: I ran the quarter mile, and--but I didn't do it consistently.  I didn't because that time I was working a job; I had to work all through high school.  And so, athletics were secondary to my working.  And so, I remember I was out there for a while and that was--my race was a quarter mile, but--
Speaker 1: But that takes a lot of stamina, I mean for--I used to run track myself.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I know our coach at one time just tried to find out who could run a quarter mile--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --find out who was going to run.  That takes a lot of stamina to sprint a quarter mile.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's a good race.  That's a good race.
Speaker 1: So you must have been in pretty good shape to run a quarter?
Speaker 2: Well, pretty good physical shape.  I was--but I was just average.  I wasn't any extraordinary runner.  And, but I enjoyed participating.
Story_ID: 599331
Speaker 1: We were just talking about school, but--so in high school [Central High School, Cleveland Ohio], you didn't really think you were going to go to college?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  I graduated, I graduated with the knowledge that I had to go to work, and I did have the dream that maybe at some point I could earn enough money to start me a little haberdashery store.  I loved clothes and I knew in the black community that most blacks love dressing and clothes.  And so, I thought someday, I said, "Maybe I'll get me a little haberdashery store here in the neighborhood somewhere," and--but college was out.  When I finished high school, I'd been working as a porter in a downtown army navy store [Outdoor Sportswear, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio], and when I started out working for--it's a good store here--I started working as a porter in this store, and the man who owned it was a Jewish fellow by the name of Apisdorf, A-P-I-S-D-O-R-F.  And his first name was Isadore, I-S-A-D-O-R-E, Isadore Apisdore--Apisdorf [Isadore Apisdorf].  He sat me down and he said, "Listen, I'm going to hire you as a porter," he said, "but I've got a feeling that if I teach you the business of salesmanship and how to sell, that a black person ought to be able to sell to white people the same way white people sell to white people and black people."  And he said, "I'm going to teach you the business."  He said, "Now, the only thing is," he says, "if it doesn't work out," he says, "I don't want you to hold it against me," he says, "but I think we can make a go of it."  And so I said, "Well, fine, I'd like to try it."
Speaker 1: That's interesting now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This Jewish gentleman has a store--was he--did he still have an accent, was he direct from Germany or had he been to here?
Speaker 2: No.  He had been here a while, yeah.  And very sincere guy and good businessman and, but he had that type of deep feeling.  And so, he did.  I started as a porter which meant that it was my job to go out in front of the store every morning and wash the street down, and clean up everything out in front of the street; then I came in, it was my job to mop the floors in the store; and then put up stock; and, and in general, just keep the place clean.  That was a porter's job.
Story_ID: 599332
Speaker 1: In the interim periods when there was, you know, there was a slow business going on, that type of thing, is when he would take me and teach me about quantity and quality of materials, and what was good and what was bad, and all the intricacies of salesmanship.  And he and I became very close in that sense, and he did his part and I did my part.  And one day, it was a white person I guess who was going to buy something, who came into the store [Outdoor Sportswear, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio], a guy.  He walked in, and so, I went over to him as I was supposed to and say, "May I help you, sir?"  So he looked at me and said, "No, you can't help me."  So about that time, Izzie [Isadore Apisdorf]--we called him Izzie--saw me walk away from this fellow.  He walked over to me and he says, "Louis [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes]," he said, "what did he say to you?"  So I said, "Well, I asked him if I could wait on him and he said 'No, you can't wait on me.'"  He marched over to this guy, took him by the back of his collar, marched him over to the door, and told him, "We don't want your kind in here.  We don't want your business," and shoved him out the door.  And so, as I was graduating [from Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio], he said to me, he said, "Louis, you can have a job here.  If you want to work for me full time, you got a job here."  And he meant just as a salesman.  He had hired a young white boy to be a porter and had me teach him the porter job, and he had put me on full time doing salesman work while I was working part time and going to school the full time.  So, as a consequence of it, that was what I was going to do until such time as I acquired enough money to get my own little haberdashery, you know, or a store of some kind.
Story_ID: 599333
Speaker 1: So, it happened though I graduated [from Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio] in January of 1943, and in July of 1943 I was advised by Uncle Sam that I'd been drafted into World War II [WWII].  And by August, I was shipped out of Cleveland [Ohio] and was sent to Columbus, Ohio, for the preparatory and initiatory process of making you a soldier.  And, then from there I went to other places like the Jefferson Barracks, Missouri [Jefferson Barracks Military Post, St. Louis County, Missouri], where I took my basic training; then from there to Georgia, and to Alabama, and Mississippi, and Arkansas, and all the southern states--
Speaker 2: I was going to say those are all southern states (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and Texas and other places like that; places where I had never been as a young kid from the North.
Speaker 2: Now, was there a certain amount of cultural shock having to go to these places after living in Cleveland?  I know there was race--prejudice in Cleveland as well.  We know that, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --here you're going to all the--you're doing a southern tour almost.
Speaker 1: Well, the tragedy was I was eighteen years old, and here I was drafted into the United States Army, but placed into a segregated army.  Everyone in my unit, all the soldiers were black, and we were made to understand that we were to work together, and sleep in the same barracks together, and do everything together as black soldiers in the Army.  Now, all of the officers, all of the people in charge of us were white people.  And this was a shock to me because I'd never been exposed to this type of thing before.  And for an eighteen year old kid this was a shock.
Speaker 2: Did you have an idea of the Army being different from that?  Did you have any idea it was that segregated and that, you know--
Speaker 1: No.  I--in Cleveland, I'd never been--sure, there was a certain amount of segregation through the school system, stuff like that.  But it wasn't mandatory, you know.  This was mandatory segregation.  You didn't serve with white soldiers.  And so, right away that made an impact on me.  And the first thing that I remember when I finished--well, before I went away I remember my mother [Louise Stone Stokes] saying to me, she said, "Now, Bill [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], when you get to Columbus," she says, "don't try to go into those restaurants.  Now they don't serve black people in those restaurants, and don't you go down there and start any trouble by trying to get served in those restaurants.  Just stay out of them."  And so, that was my first admonition of what I could expect coming from my mother.  And then we went to St. Louis [Missouri] where I did basic training and, of course, that was all black.  And then we were shipped out to go to Georgia, and on the way down the train stopped in Memphis, Tennessee, and we were taken into the train station for lunch.  As you walk into the train station, we were taken past the first large room which was filled with only white soldiers who had the same uniform we had on, but they were just white soldiers in there.  The next room to them were all German prisoners of war who were in that room.  And then there was a black curtain that separated that room where the German prisoners were and the room where they put all of us as black soldiers.  So we sat on the other side of a black curtain separate on the other side of the prisoners of war, and we sat there that day and just realized how reprehensible segregation was.  And then, there's just so many other experiences that I had as a, as a young black soldier that really made me understand what it was like to live in the South and to be black.
Story_ID: 599334
Speaker 1: Did you ever question, you know, of what service you could be to this country in that, under those circumstances?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was fortunate enough to be in a unit with some blacks who had been to college; some from the North, some from the South.  And I found them to be very vocal guys in terms of the conditions.  And there would be meetings and things, and I admired the way that they could articulate conditions under which we were being forced to live and to work and so forth.  And that kind of made me know that I had to get a college education.  A lot of them thought I'd already been to college because I was able to converse with them, and to debate with them, and things of that nature.  And that also just made me know that I've got to get me an education one way or another because I was impressed with the quality of life that they brought to a situation, having a college background.  But, I continued to run into one discriminatory situation after another.  And I remember we were in Georgia at an Air Force base [U.S. Army Air Forces; U.S. Air Force], and every morning the [U.S.] Army truck would come by and get us at our barracks and take us down to the white part of the field there where the white airmen were.  And we were then given long sticks with nails on the end of them, and it was our job to police these white boys' barracks, and which meant we went around all the area and we'd stick, you know, this nail down into the paper and other trash and clean up around their barracks.  And so, I convinced the guys that we ought not do this and they agreed.  So there was--happened to be a post library there.  So every morning when they would bring us down, we'd get out the truck and we'd take these sticks, and then as soon as the truck left, we would go place these sticks up under the library footage there, bearings up under the thing--up under the library, and then we'd go up in the library and we would read until time for the truck to come pick us up.
Story_ID: 599335
Speaker 1: On this particular morning somebody had told them what we were doing, and the military police came in and raided the library, caught all of us in the library.  Some of us jumped out of windows (laughter) at the library, but they caught us, all of us.  I remember I jumped out of a window and because you're on the first floor, but you can--when you get out there.  So they caught all of us and they took us over and put us in the police compound.  Even there they had black toilets for the black soldiers and white toilets over there.  And all of us were put in there in the prison there.  But all in there, the black toilets and white toilets are segregated in there.  And so then, they took us back to the barracks, and I remember the captain, white captain, Captain Gentry [ph.], and he had us come before him and told us that he--we had to be punished, and that our punishment was that we would have to wear these packs; I think it was about fifty pounds--packs of mud on our backs and we would have to parade up and down in front of the barracks, our own barracks, so that all the other soldiers would know that we had broken the rules.  And I remember our deciding to fight that.  And I remember we went in to see him and protest it.  And I was the spokesperson for the group, and I told him that we had just come out of Jefferson Barracks [Jefferson Barracks Military Post, St. Louis Country, Missouri], which were considered to be the toughest training post in the country, and that we were willing to soldier, but we were unwilling to do anything such as this because we thought it was inhumane to make us put these types of packs on our backs and march up in front of everybody.  And so, he compromised in some way.  I think we still had to march, but we did it without the packs, something of the sort.  But, it was enough experience that I'll never forget.
Speaker 2: That's quite a story.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, did the rest of the soldiers think it was a good idea to go to the library or did they all--I mean, I'm just--I'm just wondering if everybody complied with the agreement to go to the library (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Our group did.  All of our group did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I suppose the guys, when these other guys--because other units were sent out to do different things, you know, but this is what we were sent out to perform.  And all of our group stood together.
Speaker 2: Now, did they continue to try to make you go police these barracks and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) After that, no.  No, they stopped.
Speaker 2: So that stopped it?
Speaker 1: That was over.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: But it wasn't long before they shipped us out of there (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They sent us to another, another post.
Story_ID: 599336
Speaker 1: So, they, they never shipped you overseas when you were--?
Speaker 2: No.  I was in the port out in Seattle [Washington] just prior to V-J Day [Victory over Japan Day].  They had issued all of us our equipment for overseas duty, and evidently we were going to go to a warm climate, because the kind of gear that we had been given indicated that this would be a warm climate.  And, then V-J Day occurred, and President Truman [President Harry S. Truman] declared V-J Day.  And, then two days, three days after that, they shipped us out of the Seattle port and sent us up to--I think we went up to Oregon--Portland, Oregon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you could complete your service in Oregon?
Speaker 2: I stayed there--I had--they began terminating the service based upon your points.  And, as I recall at that time, I had something like thirty-one points, and so I got discharged.  I had a little less than three years in service.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: So, they sent us up to Camp Atterbury [Indiana].  I got discharged there and sent to Cleveland [Ohio].
Story_ID: 599337
Speaker 1: That sounds like--this is something I asked earlier to somebody, the general [HistoryMaker Lieutenant General Frank E. Petersen, Jr.] I interviewed this morning about--.  Were you aware of the Tuskegee Airmen at that point and the--
Speaker 2: I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was.  In one of the units where I was serving, a couple of guys had been chosen from our unit and sent to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama] for that.  I remember one kid from Cleveland [sic. Michigan] who I served with was William Carter.  He was one of those that shipped out for Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was wondering if, you know, how you all felt about that--you know, how you felt about it--
Speaker 2: When we were--well, we had come to grips with the fact that Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] and other leaders, particularly our black newspaper editors and the newspapers, were fighting for the right of black soldiers to be treated like soldiers and be integrated into the services, and under the theory that that we want to serve our country, and but that we ought to be able to serve our country in an integrated service, and we ought to be permitted to die with respect and honor by not serving as segregated soldiers in the [U.S.] Army, that--and we ought not be relegated to the kind of servitude jobs that the blacks were being relegated to.  They had them in what they called the Seabees [U.S. Naval Construction Battalions]; the guys who'd go in and do work behind the scenes, and those who were in the Medical Corps [U.S. Army Medical Corps] who just took care of the white soldiers that were injured, and--but they weren't letting us fight on the frontlines, they weren't letting us fly the planes, and do the other things.  The same was going on over in the Naval Academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland] and in the [U.S.] Navy services.  Blacks were relegated in the same situations, segregated Navy.  And--but one of the breakthroughs as a result of the leadership of Adam Clayton Powell and the newspaper publishers was the agreement to set up this Air Force unit [U.S. Army Air Corps; U.S. Air Force] at Tuskegee, to be headed up by a black general [Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.] and, and to start letting blacks fly planes as pilots and fighting.
Story_ID: 599338
Speaker 1: Your brother was in the [U.S.] Army about the same time, right?  He went in a year after you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Came in about two years after me.  Carl had, Carl had dropped out of East Tech High School [East Technical High School, Cleveland, Ohio] at age of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--this is a story--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Carl Stokes--you said that he was a, you know, favorite kind of person--everybody thought he was a great person--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and--how he did he wind up dropping out?
Speaker 2: At the age of sixteen he dropped out of high school.  And it broke my mother's [Louise Stone Stokes] heart because of the two of us, I think she really wanted to see him get the education.  I think she felt he had a better chance of doing something with education than I did.  And so, he dropped out.  You know, Carl, Carl loved hanging around in the poolrooms and shooting pool, and which was another thing he was good at.  And so, he loved to have some change in his pockets, hanging around with the boys on the corner, and in the poolroom.  So he went out to Republic Steel [Republic Steel Company] and got a job and was working out there pushing a broom, but he was getting enough money for him to hang around in poolrooms and talk trash with the boys.  And then he got drafted into the Army same way I did.  And, of course, when I came out and--came out first--and I started--I took advantage of the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] and rode out here to Case Western Reserve University [Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio].  And when Carl--
Speaker 1: Well, that's about where, about twenty miles from Cleveland [Ohio] proper or--
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  It's right here in the heart of the inner city.
Speaker 1: Case Western Reserve?
Speaker 2: Right in the heart of the city.  It's right at a 107th Street and off of Euclid [Avenue], and right in the heart of the city.  And so, I had enrolled there, and when he came out he decided he, too, was going to advantage of the G.I. Bill, but in order to do so and go to college, he had to go back to high school.  So, Carl at that time was twenty-one years old.  So at the age of twenty-one, he went back to high school, got his high school diploma, and then went into undergraduate school.  But Carl had went to Case Western Reserve for a while, but he also went to West Virginia State University [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] in Virginia--West Virginia, rather.  And he stayed there a couple of years, and he came back here, and I think he went to Case at that time.  And then he became a state liquor agent.  And while he was a state liquor agent, he went--for Ohio--he was at places--different places around Ohio; he was down in Dayton [Ohio] and Toledo [Ohio], places like that.  And so, he would go to school at different universities while he was performing that job.  Then he decided to go out to the University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota].  And he went out there where he went to undergraduate and graduate school.  When he finished his first year of law at the University of Minnesota, he, he was in a program where he got his undergraduate degree, and then he came back to Cleveland and he followed me into Cleveland-Marshall Law School [Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, Cleveland, Ohio].
Story_ID: 599339
Speaker 1: When you finally went to Case [Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], you, you were pretty much--you were ready to go to college?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I, I wanted to a college education bad because I wanted to be a lawyer, and I knew that I could now use a G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] to acquire this college and graduate degree and--but when I told my mother [Louise Stone Stokes] that I was going to go to college, she said, "You can't do that.  You got to go to work."  And she said, you know, "I need you to go to work and help me, and then we can help brother," meaning Carl [Carl Stokes].  And so, I agreed with her.  So I canceled to school full time, and I went and got a job.  And I wound up working a job all day and went to college at night.  And then at that time I knew this G.I. Bill had to take me through undergraduate school as well as law school, and I didn't know whether it was enough there to do all that for me.  And then--and then besides that, having spent three years in the [U.S. military] service, I realized time was going by, and I wanted to get this college education, this law school education as quickly as I could, realizing I lost three years of my life in service.  And so, at that time, you cannot do it today, but at that time at Cleveland-Marshall Law School [Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, Cleveland, Ohio], if you had a B average or above in college here in Ohio, you can go directly from undergraduate school into law school.  So, I had the average.  So after two years of undergraduate work, I was able to go directly into law school.  And then I went to law school for four years; I worked a job all day, went to law school at night; sat in the classroom from six o'clock to ten o'clock, five nights a week for four years.  And at the end of that, I got my law degree.
Speaker 1: Now, that's quite a story.  Now, did you go back to work for Izzie [Isadore Apisdorf] at all or did you get another job (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  I thanked him, you know, profusely for what he had offered me because he stayed in touch with me all the time I was in service.  And whenever I came home, one of the first people I went to see was go see Izzie and spend some time with him.  And when I got out of service, he told me, he said, "Louis [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], your job is here [Outdoor Sportswear Inc., Cleveland, Ohio].  If you want this job, you can come back to work for me anytime."  And I told him, no, that I was going to go to school and then to college and that I was going to get a different type of job and be able to go to school at night.  And he encouraged me in that and supported me in that.  When I graduated from law school, he was right there in that auditorium supporting me.  Just a, just great guy and a real father figure for me in my life.
Story_ID: 599340
Speaker 1: It just occurred to me now--so that there's maybe a special relation between the black and Jewish community in Cleveland [Ohio] for some--you know, the Karamu House [Cleveland, Ohio] being founded by the Jelliffes [Russell Jelliffe and Rowena Jelliffe], and your experiences with the haberdashery--with the, the army navy store owner and other people; is it--do you think that's true in Cleveland in particular or is it just, you know--
Speaker 2: Cleveland is a city where I think that the Jewish community and the black community have had a relatively long and historical relationship of working together.  And, as I said, my first real contact with the Jewish community came through Izzie Apisdorf [Isadore Apisdorf].  And then when I was a young lawyer, I worked with and got to know a lot of young Jewish lawyers, and we socialized together, and we did political things together.  And I remember Rabbi Lelyveld [Arthur J. Lelyveld], who served on the NAACP's [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] board with me.  And he was a man who went to Mississippi during the time that the Civil Rights Movement was in full flame all over the South.  And he went there as a part of voter registration in Mississippi.  And he was beaten unmercilessly by some of the hoodlums there in Mississippi who had not wanted white or black people into Mississippi trying to change their way of life.  And, you know, Rabbi Lelyveld and I were very, very close friends.  And then there's so some many others.  When Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] ran for mayor, many Jewish people involved in his campaign to become the first black mayor of a major American city.  And so, yes, the black community and Jewish community in Cleveland have had a long and, and good history together.
Story_ID: 599341
Speaker 1: Now where did you work when you were going to law school [Cleveland-Marshall Law School; Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Okay.  After I told my mother [Louise Stone Stokes] then that I would go to work and go to college at the same time, I went to the treasury department and--there, the United States treasury department [U.S. Department of the Treasury], and because I could type I became a typist, and it meant that I sat there for eight hours a day typing out social security checks, and that go out from the United States treasury.  And--but it was easy for me to do this; sit in front of a typewriter all day typing checks if I was going to be able to go out to Case Western Reserve [Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio] at night and study and be in classes out there for three and four hours a night.  So I went from there to the Veterans Administration [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] and got a job as a file clerk.  And I was a file clerk for the Veterans Administration for a period of time.  And then I went to the General Services Administration.  All these were federal civil service jobs.  And at that time they paid well.  And--but the work wasn't too heavy, so I didn't have to worry about to the fact that I was going to have to spend four hours at night sitting in a classroom and trying to still be alert and to be on top of things.  And then I think the final job I had before--just before I left law school, was I was a timekeeper for the state department of transportation [Ohio Department of Transportation] out on old Turney Road in Garfield Heights [Ohio].  And--so, I think that was the last job I had.  And then as a lawyer, about a year after I was out of law school and I'd already passed the Ohio bar, I got a chance to go with a man by the name of John W. Carmack [John Carmack], C-A-R-M-A-C-K, who was a leading real estate dealer in the black community in Cleveland [Ohio].  He needed someone in his office who could be his lawyer, and he made a deal with me that at the same time I was being his lawyer, in slack periods if I wanted to, I could take in other cases and start building a practice.  And so, if I--in the mornings if I didn't have any business in the real estate office [Carmack Realty Company, Cleveland, Ohio], I'd go down by 21st [Street] and Payne [Avenue] where the jail and municipal court was and I'd stand around and hustle cases, and that was the way I started a law practice.  And the combination of the cases I picked up there in general along with working at this real estate company got me my start as a lawyer.  And I practiced law, primarily as a criminal trial defense lawyer, for fourteen years before I went to [U.S.] Congress.

Speaker 1: There are a couple of people I want to ask you about here.  One is--all right, can't remember instead of looking but okay.  Yeah.  Norman Minor [Norman S. Minor] is one.  Now, he was a Cleveland [Ohio] lawyer, a black lawyer from Cleveland, right?
Speaker 2: He wasn't just a Cleveland lawyer.  He was probably one of the nation's top criminal lawyers.  And, Norman Minor was someone who was another one of my heroes.  He was someone that I wanted to be like.  He was the greatest criminal trial lawyer I've ever seen in operation.  And I wanted to be like Norman Minor.  I wanted to be able to try lawsuits like he did.  He was magnificent in a courtroom, and just nobody could touch him.  And it turned out that I had an opportunity through a judge to be appointed to try a case or represent a defendant who was charged, as I recall now, with rape.  And both--it was a pretty aggravated situation, so they assigned both Mr. Minor and myself to represent him, which meant that that was the first time I was going to get a chance to actually try a lawsuit with Norman Minor.  You can imagine what it meant to me as a young lawyer who was going to be in the courtroom with the greatest criminal trial lawyer this community had ever seen.  And we did try the case.  At the conclusion of the case, instead of him closing the case and giving the closing argument, he told me, he said, "You're going to give the closing argument in this case."  And I was taken off my feet because never in my wildest dreams did I think that in a case with Norman Minor he would tell me to close the case, that's just understood he'd be the one to close that case.  But I did it.  And I remember while the jury was out, he called me out into the anteroom and he asked me a lot of questions about how long had I been practicing, and where I went to school, and about my family.
Story_ID: 599343
Speaker 1: A couple of weeks after this case, he showed up out at my law office where Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] and I had a three room office [Stokes and Stokes, Cleveland, Ohio].  Each of us had our own room, and then we had one room for our receptionist.  And so, it was a very small operation.  And the secretary buzzed me back in my office and said, "Mr. Minor [Norman S. Minor] is here to see you."  And I said, "Oh, stop playing around and kidding me," because I couldn't figure Norman Minor being in our little digs.  But she said, "No, seriously.  Mr. Minor is here."  So I came out and there he was.  And he looked around our offices and then he came in my office and sat, he says, "How'd you like to come work in my office?"  And I almost went through the floor.  This was a dream that I couldn't have even planned for to be asked to go into a law office with Norman Minor.  But he had had or displayed a talent prior to this of taking young black lawyers in his office whom he felt had some particular potential.  And so, Carl and I went in the office with him.  The law office became known as Minor, Stokes and Stokes [Minor, McCurdy, Stokes and Stokes, Cleveland, Ohio].  And just virtue of being with Minor, Carl and I acquired a great deal of respect and attention.  And I sat with him and tried cases with him for eight years.  And I can just tell you that the cases that came to him were the toughest cases and the most notorious cases in the community.  When they came to Norman Minor, they expected him to spring them to get them out of whatever kind of trouble they were in, and generally they were in big trouble.  But, so, that was during the period of time when I sat second chair to him for eight years.  And on my own, I acquired a number of cases that began to bring special attention to me here in the community too.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, what year did Minor, Stokes and Stokes start up?
Speaker 1: It was right after Carl came out of law school, which would have been--let's see.  I came out in '53 [1953]; he came out in 1955.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, somewhere in '55 [1955], '56 [1956].
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's a year after Brown versus the Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, there was a lot of activity.  Another one of your heroes I read was Thurgood Marshall.
Speaker 1: Yes, he was.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, he was.
Story_ID: 599344
Speaker 1: Did you have much associ- now, now were you at this time, in terms of civil rights activity, were you involved in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in Cleveland [Ohio] by this time?
Speaker 2: As a young lawyer, I had been involved with the NAACP.  And at that time, we had a young lawyer by the name of Clarence Holmes, who was the president of the NAACP, and the executive director was another young fellow by the name of Harold Williams.  And so, they asked me to take the job of being the Legal Redress Committee chairman [NAACP Legal Redress Committee].  And I saw it as an opportunity to continue my work there with the NAACP, but also, to be able to really do some good work legally on the local front by taking that chairmanship, because it brought with it a full committee of white and black lawyers; generally, top lawyers who wanted to be involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  This was their way of kind of contributing to it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So about what year is this then?
Speaker 2: Now, we're now approaching--let's see, 1960 (pause).  I would imagine '53 [1953] (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is this before your brother [Carl Stokes] came out--
Speaker 2: --fifty-five [1955].  So, I--we're talking about '58 [1958], 1959, '60 [1960], '61 [1961], '2 [1962], '3 [1963].
Story_ID: 599345
Speaker 1: You got married in 1962, right?
Speaker 2: My first marriage.  I had two marriages.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.  So the first one was in 1960?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How did you meet your wife, the first time?
Speaker 2: The first wife?  I was introduced to her by a friend of mine who was a minister.  And he was a close friend and a minister.  And he was very close to my first wife's family, and he arranged for the two of us to meet.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Are there any children from--
Speaker 2: We had three children [Shelley Stokes Hammond, Angela Stokes and Chuck Stokes] by the marriage.  We divorced ten years after we got married.  So it would be--I think we got married in 1948 and divorced in '58 [1958].  And I had custody of the three children from that marriage.
Story_ID: 599346
Speaker 1: What was political climate in Cleveland [Ohio] like in those days?  Were they--did you have any blacks on city council or--
Speaker 2: We did have blacks on the Cleveland City Council.  And we had had blacks on our Cleveland City Council since somewhere in the '40s [1940s], and including black women on the--
Speaker 1: Okay. What are names of some of the people?
Speaker 2: Judge Jean, J-E-A-N, Murrell M-U-R-R-E-L-L, Capers, C-A-P-E-R-S [Jean Murrell Capers], was one of the people who--she was probably the first black councilwoman in Cleveland, and then later she became a judge; a Cleveland municipal court judge.  And I saw recently where she had her ninety-forth birthday.
Speaker 1: So, she's still alive?
Speaker 2: Still alive and still looks as though she's in her late fifties.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But she wasn't the first black on the city council then, but she--
Speaker 2: Yes, she was.
Speaker 1: She was?
Speaker 2: For the first black woman.
Speaker 1: First black woman, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--but there were--you said there were blacks on the city council from the '40s [1940s] and--well, how was the--I mean, was--I guess what I'm asking you about is to try and explain to us on some level how political--black political power came together in Cleveland, you know, from those early days.  Because I know we're leading up to, you know, '68 [1968] where your brother becomes mayor.  So, I mean, how did he get enough political power--political clout for that to take place?
Speaker 2: Well, we had black councilmen there and--but you didn't have any blacks serving in cabinet positions in Cleveland or any other big major positions of power.  And, when Carl Stokes came along, he had become so charismatic he had also, as a lawyer, run for and got elected as the first black Democrat to be elected to the Ohio House of Representatives.  And so, with that pioneering achievement, he began becoming widely known and respected as a legislator.
Story_ID: 599347
Speaker 1: And then by 1965, in the height of the Civil Rights Movement there in Cleveland [Ohio], he became even more prominent because of his standing tall on behalf of the black community and being a real leader.  For instance, one night I remember they were having in 1965 riots in Cleveland over in the Hough community.  And Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] and I walked the streets of Hough with him attempting to quiet things down.  But bullets were flying all around us out there during the course of that rioting on the streets, and smoke was everywhere, and you could hear gunfire off in the background.  And it was a tough night.  But people looked to him for leadership, and so, I wound up there in the riots of conducting some hearings so the people in the community could come out to those hearings and talk about what had happened during the riot and why things were so bad in our community.  And so, then the community turned to Carl at a time when some of our black ministers had stepped up in the legal--in the Civil Rights Movement in Cleveland to try to fight on behalf of black people by going to the mayor's office and protesting his policies and other things that were concurring, such as police brutality, lack of jobs, opportunities of that sort.  And, of course, the mayor refused to see these black ministers, and then the ministers decided they would just sit in his office until he agreed to meet with them.  And finally, the police forcefully ejected these ministers from the mayor's office; that was Mayor Locher [Ralph S. Locher].  So, the community then were enraged.  And the people urged Carl to run for mayor against this mayor, and with the assurance that the black community was going to go all the way for Carl.  And all he needed to do is get enough white votes to be able to win the election.
Speaker 2: Now, what was the proportion of the black community to the white one (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Cleveland at that time was only 37 percent black.  But, yet, we were a major American city.  The city itself was the eighth largest city in the United States.  But, as I said, it was 37 black, so it meant the black community alone could not elect a Carl Stokes.  So Carl then did exceed to that sort of a draft, and he ran for mayor in 1965.  Well, no one had ever seen a black man run for mayor in Cleveland before, and so, most people--many people didn't believe it could happen, so they didn't really put forth any major effort.  When the campaign was over, Carl had lost by roughly sixteen hundred votes.  So that said that if we had really known and understood, and sharpened that campaign, we could have certainly picked up sixteen hundred votes, which meant Carl could win the race for mayor.  So, Carl on his own, organized the black councilmen and the black clergy; put them all together and put them in support of his candidacy.  So, in 1967, he wound up benefiting from the 1965 campaign, and he became the mayor of Cleveland once again.
Story_ID: 599348
Speaker 1: We'll revisit that in a second, but I want to, like, go back and maybe talk about some of these cases.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: One I have here, one case that you headed up was Craggett versus the Cleveland Board of Education [Craggett v. Cleveland Board of Education, 1964]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about that--
Speaker 2: Could we take a moment and let me get some water?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Craggett v. Cleveland, okay--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --versus the board.
Speaker 2: While I was chairman of the Legal Redress Committee [NAACP Legal Redress Committee] for the Cleveland Branch NAACP [Cleveland, Ohio], the national chapter contacted the Cleveland [Ohio] chapter and told them that they would like for Bob Carter [HistoryMaker Robert L. Carter], who at that time had taken Thurgood Marshall's place as the legal head of the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.].  And so, Bob Carter came to Cleveland, met with me, and what they wanted to do was to launch a new attack on school desegregation, on school segregation rather.  And so, what they wanted to do was to use Cleveland as the first city in the North against whom they would bring a school segregation lawsuit; Brown v. Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] having been the major case prior to then.  And so, working with Bob Carter, we filed a lawsuit and the lawsuit was known as Craggett versus Rhodes [sic.].  Rhodes [James A. Rhodes] at that time was a governor, and Daisy Craggett was a hardworking activist in the Hough community [Cleveland, Ohio].  And, as a consequence of it, we went to federal court, and this was the first case for a desegregation ever brought by the NAACP in the North.  We went before a judge who was probably the most racist judge I have ever encountered in any courtroom.  But Bob Carter was the attorney trying the case, and he was just treated in a very reprehensible way by this particular judge, and he wound up a few days after we had begun the case just throwing us out of court.  And, of course, we realized that we are pioneering and that we just have to work at this in a different way.  Subsequently, after I had left the chairmanship of the Legal Redress Committee, another young black lawyer here brought a lawsuit on behalf of a plaintiff against the Cleveland school board [Cleveland Board of Education] alleging that the Cleveland school board had illegally and unconstitutionally created a segregated school system in the Cleveland public school system.  And they lost the case in the lower court, so they took it up to the United States Supreme Court, and the United States Supreme Court agreed that Cleveland had intentionally and unlawfully segregated little black children from little white children in our Cleveland public school system.  And so, that was the origin of Craggett versus Rhodes and in the subsequent case which had taken the place of Craggett.
Story_ID: 599349
Speaker 1: Now how were black children segregated from white children in Cleveland [Ohio]? How was it done?
Speaker 2: There was a period of time here when schools were supposedly overcrowded.  And as a result of it, many black children were only sent to school for parts of a day.  They were not sent to school daily like other children for--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is--maybe go into history on this for a minute.  And that's the, you know, migration of all these blacks coming into Cleveland for jobs, being limited in terms of where they can live and then becoming overcrowded and overcrowding of schools, right?  Is that correct--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --to the point where the schools couldn't deal with the capacity?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, see, at that time, they were not sending black children over to the west side.  Black children were being relegated under the school system's rules to the east side.  And then when they didn't have sufficient room for them in those schools, they just furloughed those children out of the school system.  And so, that was the part of the real problem.
Speaker 1: So they gave them time off just to--
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was, they used that as an excuse to build more new schools in the black community, keeping them from going to schools on the west side where their schools would be integrated.  And that's where the United States Supreme Court said that they were illegally, and unconstitutionally, and intentionally segregating little black children by race.

Speaker 1: Craggett versus the Board [Craggett v. Cleveland Board of Education, 1964] was a victory then for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Actually, when the case went up, it was no longer Craggett versus the Board.  We--that was the case that the judge threw out of the court.
Speaker 1: Prece- okay.  Okay.  But the case that eventually won was--what was it called--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm trying to think of--
Speaker 1: It was--
Speaker 2: I can't remember.
Speaker 1: --was it versus the City of Cleveland or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It probably had to bring it against--
Speaker 1: --Craggett is versus Rhodes, you said, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Rhodes, Governor Jim Rhodes [James A. Rhodes] because he was the governor--
Speaker 1: Governor Jim Rhodes, yeah.
Speaker 2: --at that time.  I guess legally that's why we had to bring it in that manner.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Against the governor of the state.
Speaker 1: But eventually, NAACP's case was made in--when was this successful case adjudicated?
Speaker 2: You know, I can't give you that year.
Speaker 1: Was it before your brother [Carl Stokes] was elected mayor or--
Speaker 2: No.  It had been after.
Speaker 1: After.  Okay, all right. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sure.
Speaker 1: So, that lingered for a while, that case drug on for (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 599351
Speaker 1: Now, it's--in '66 [1966], now, it says here that you--well, '65 [1965] you became presi- vice president of the NAACP, Cleveland Branch [Cleveland Branch NAACP, Cleveland, Ohio], right?  Is that true?
Speaker 2: I think I did serve as vice president.
Speaker 1: And then that same year you became vice chairman of the Cleveland Subcommittee of the U.S. committee on civil rights [Ohio State Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, do you have anything to say about those positions?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure there's a lot to tell about it.  When I was vice president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] I was still chairman of the Legal Redress Committee [NAACP Legal Redress Committee].  As such, I investigated a lot of police brutality cases.  This was during the period also, I think, when I took a case up to the United States Supreme Court.  The case is entitled Terry v. Ohio [Terry v. Ohio, 1968].  The Terry case was a case involving two men; one's name was John Terry [John W. Terry], and the other name is Richard Chilton, C-H-I-L-T-O-N, both of them were charged with carrying a concealed weapon.  When I, just prior to trying that lawsuit, I had filed what you call a motion to suppress.  The motion was to suppress the two guns from evidence at the trial.  My theory being that, if you suppress the guns, that there's no--you can't have any finding because the guns don't exist.  And so, I did that for the reason that I--when I heard the facts in this case, I really believed that we had a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the [U.S.] Constitution, which provides for due process and equality of the laws.  I, after filing a motion, conducted what we call a preliminary inquiry on my motion.
Story_ID: 599352
Speaker 1: The police officer in this case had seen three men standing at the corner or intersection of East 50--East 13th [Street] and Euclid [Avenue] what intersects with Huron Road [Cleveland, Ohio].  And he described the situation as being where two black men would coming together standing and talking on the street, and then they would walk down the street together and they would meet a white man, and then the three of them would stand and talk, and then one of the group, white or black, would leave the others and go down the street where they would once again be joined by the third person.  And so, at some point he walked over, he demanded to know their names, then he searched two of the men; in fact, he searched all three.  He found guns on two of the men.  But when I interrogated the police officer on the stand, I asked him, "Were these men committing any crime when you watched them?"  He said, "No."  And I said, "Had you ever known them before?"  And he said, "No."  So I said, "Well, what was your reason for approaching these three men?"  And he said, "Well, to tell you the truth, I just didn't like them."  Well, my theory was that, you cannot, because you see two black men and a white man walking up to each other, talking together on a street, then one departing then coming back together; because you don't like them, that you can't stop them and begin searching them and taking them through that indignity on the streets.  And I did it because I know and understood what police do with black people often.  Many others like that particular officer whose name was McFadden [Martin McFadden], often see a black person on the street and don't like the person, go over and stop them, and then next thing they do, they frisk them and then after they've embarrassed them, they don't find anything, they then say, "Okay.  You can go on your way."  And so, I saw all of that in this case.  And so, when the judge overruled me and the motion to suppress case, I tried the case, tried once again, to get the court to do what was right on that motion, and he wouldn't do it.  So, I then appealed the case; I lost in the court of appeals here in Ohio [Ohio Court of Appeals for the Eighth District]; I lost in the Supreme Court of Ohio.  So then I took it to the United States Supreme Court, and, the United States Supreme Court ruled that, even though we could not suppress the guns, they set up what is called the Terry Frisk or the Terry Stop.  It became a landmark case in criminal law.  It is now taught in every police academy in America.  It is also taught in every law school in America.  They all study Terry v. Ohio [Terry v. Ohio, 1968].  And so, that to me was a great achievement.  I didn't win the case, but I won through the theory of having set up the Terry Stop and Terry Frisk law or doctrine in the law that did not exist before that case.  And so, it was a great thrill as a young lawyer, firstly, to argue a case to the United States Supreme Court.  And it happened that Thurgood Marshall was one of the justices--nine justices to whom I argued this case.
Speaker 2: Okay.  How did the justices vote, I mean?  Tell me how--was it close or was it--
Speaker 1: It was not close.  I had--I got one vote, and I think that was Justice Douglas [William O. Douglas] who voted in my favor.  I even lost Thurgood Marshall on this one.
Story_ID: 599353
Speaker 1: Now, this is something that's still being debated.  I know in Illinois recently, the City of Chicago, was under some heat for something called the anti-gang loitering law, that the police can look at a group of youth and determine that they're gang members by looking at them, and then search them or arrest them for standing on a corner, you know.
Speaker 2: Same theory that this officer [Martin McFadden] acted on in this case.  And what you have now today is this whole thing about racial profiling.  Well, thirty years before you had anything about racial profiling, was what I had in my case which said, you can't look at somebody and make a judgment that they are committing a crime, or about to commit a crime simply because of the way they look.  And today, they call it racial profiling, but that was over thirty years before then was when I brought this case.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it is today, as you said, it is considered a landmark case in criminal law, and it is cited.  And any case where the court is dealing with a stop, or a stop and a frisk, they will cite the law of Terry v. Ohio [Terry v. Ohio, 1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they still--they still have the right to do that, to make that kind of judgment now because, I guess--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't--
Speaker 1: --the [U.S.] Supreme Court did rule that stops on the street, you know, you can't just go to a person's home and just do that, right?  From what I read--
Speaker 2: Well, in order to stop a person on the street according to that case, the officer must believe that his life is in imminent danger.  That's the basic criteria for it.
Story_ID: 599354
Speaker 1: Now, to go back to something that's, that's a little--may not be as serious on some level, but I wanted to ask you about the Cleveland Browns and Jim Brown, of all things (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I know that in terms of football, football is big in Ohio and Northeast Ohio--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And the first NFL [National Football League] team to integrate was the Cleveland Browns--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: --and in some--and maybe ten years after that, here comes probably the greatest football player in football history, Jim Brown, who is also a political activist on some level and a controversial figure.  And you had some interaction with Jim Brown; can you tell us about, you know, some of that interaction?
Speaker 2: Well, firstly, I'm one of those fortunate individuals who used to be able to go down to the Cleveland Stadium [Cleveland Municipal Stadium; FirstEnergy Stadium, Cleveland, Ohio] on a Sunday and watch the Cleveland Browns play, and then would be able to look on that field and see Jim Brown, the greatest football player who ever lived, and definitely the greatest running back that we've ever seen.  And so, I count myself as being blessed or fortunate to have experienced that.  And, by virtue of Jim being around Cleveland [Ohio] for roughly nine years, I, like others, got a chance to know him there.  And, then there were two lawsuits in which he was involved in which he retained Norman Minor [Norman S. Minor] to represent him.  And Norman Minor in both of those cases brought me in as his law partner to work on those cases with him.  So, I got to know Jim very, very well.  I have great, enormous respect for him, and the kinds of things that he has done; not only for the pro football--for the sport in this country, but the time he's taken with his program for incarcerated males, and the fact that he has not lost sight of those who have less of a chance in our society, particularly young, uneducated, desperate young men who fill our prison system today.  In addition to it, it was Jim while he was still a player with the Cleveland Browns who founded what's known as the Black Economic Union.  And my brother Carl [Carl Stokes] who you'll see in any photograph taken around that time of the BEU, was their lawyer.  And so, he's done--he's done an awful lot in his life, I think, not only for the professional sport, but for his community and for black people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think it's Jim Brown, Walter Beach, John Wooten, I think of.  Later, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Lew Alcindor in those days; and Ali [Muhammad Ali] were also part of this union.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: So these are some of the greatest athletes in the country.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm telling you.  They are, yeah.  And they came to that because of Jim.  They all respect him and admire him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now who is the--I hate to put on the spot, but who is the first black player in--is it Bill [Bill Willis]--I think it's--I can't think of his last name--but he's still alive, I know he's living in Ohio now.
Speaker 2: Oh, you're talking about--
Speaker 1: Well, we'll get it.  Just don't worry.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: I can't think of it either.  I know his name, but I can't think of it right now.

Speaker 1: So, we're moving up to--and the, the Terry v. Ohio case [Terry v. Ohio, 1968], now that was--that case was--the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision was in '68 [1968] wasn't it?
Speaker 2: It was in '68 [1968]; that's right.  That's when the decision came down.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, it was '67 [1967] that your brother was elected mayor, right, of the City of Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967] he was elected as mayor; he served 'til '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the terms of it--the term was just two year terms?
Speaker 2: Two year terms at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right.  So, well, how was it, you know, having your brother as the mayor?
Speaker 2: Well, it was different.  It changed my life totally because people knowing that I was Carl's brother, felt that they could get to Carl [Carl Stokes] through me, and, of course, instead of people calling into the law office to get me to represent them, they were calling to get me to get him for some special favor for them.  So, it got totally out of hand in terms of people misconstruing my role as a lawyer and my role as being Carl's brother.   But it was an interesting time.   It's something to be proud of.  Carl had his photo on the cover of Time magazine, he was on the cover of Newsweek, he was on the cover of almost major newspaper or magazine at that time across the world.  And it was very significant that this black man who was the great-grandson of a slave had defeated for office the great-grandson [sic. grandson] of an American president.  When Carl defeated Seth Taft, he had defeated the great-grandson of President Taft.
Speaker 1: Yeah, [President] William Howard Taft.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so, all over the country, he was a very celebrated figure.  It was at one time talk legitimately of his being a vice presidential candidate.  And, it was a tremendous feat.  It was a feat he had won by virtue of putting together a coalition of the black community, other minorities, and whites of goodwill.
Story_ID: 599356
Speaker 1: What were some of the issues in Cleveland [Ohio] during those days?
Speaker 2: Housing, health, education, schools, lack of inclusion of minorities in various facets of the community.  Somebody who could really run a city such as Cleveland and make it a productive city, and to acquire and maintain the kind of housing that people in Cleveland want and need.  The whole system around there at that time just--NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] just shortly before then won the victory of getting blacks to work in the banks as tellers.  And, of course, Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] appointed blacks to all--to almost all, but to many seats in his cabinets, and they were outstanding blacks that he had been able to find, but which white mayors had not been able to find.  And so, it was great times.  Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had been in Cleveland; he had been a part of registering voters.  He came to Cleveland in 1965; he came back again in 1967.  And on both occasions, he registered black people as they had never been registered before anywhere in America.  And it was his theory that this is the political side of the equation; that we now had to complete the economic side of the equation of moving blacks into the mainstream in the economy of the country.
Story_ID: 599357
Speaker 1: Now, what are some of your thoughts on, on Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?  I know that you, you had some comments I think on both John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and Dr. King, and, I think--well, the Kennedys and Dr. King that you could, have written about.
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that I experienced in the [U.S.] Congress was being named as the head of several major committees in the Congress.  Besides being the chairman of the V.A., HUD, independent agencies subcommittee on Appropriations [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on V.A., HUD, and Independent Agencies], where I was chairman over about $91 billion of the budget, which at that time, the federal budget was about $1.3 trillion.  And, in addition to it, I also served on and then later became the chairman of the ethics committee of the House [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ethics].  And in that capacity, I handled some nationally recognized cases; the Abscam cases, the cases involving sex and drugs between members of Congress and the pages; I had the case of Representative Gerald Ferraro [sic. Geraldine Ferraro] when she was running for the vice presidency of the United States, and then I was appointed this chairman of the Select Committee on Assassinations [U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations].  And in that capacity, I was chairman of the committee that investigated both the assassination of Dr. Martin King Luther, Jr., as well as the assassination of the late president John F. Kennedy.  These are two tough investigations.  But they were things that this country felt the Congress needed to do, and the Congress asked me to do the job as the chairman of that committee.  In addition to it, I served as chairman of the intelligence committee of the House [U.S. House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence], which meant I had control of all of the apparatus of intelligence that our country has all over the world.  And, then when the Iran situation came up, because I was chairman of the intelligence committee, the speaker at that time, Speaker Wright [Jim Wright], appointed me as a part of the Iran-Contra panel [Iran-Contra Affair].  That was the group that investigated the illegal and unconstitutional sale of arms to Iran.  And we pursued that case to its final analysis.  And then when we invaded Grenada, the little spice island down in the Caribbean, I was one of the members of the Congress who was sent over with the charge of ascertaining the facts and circumstances surrounding the invasion of that little tiny spice nation.
Story_ID: 599358
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I want to pick up on some of that as we go but I want to go back a minute to the election in '68 [1968], your election to [U.S.] Congress.  How did--well tell us about that.  How did you decide to run for Congress in the--
Speaker 2: Well, firstly, I really had no political ambitions.  Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] was the political animal in our family.  I saw it as my responsibility to keep the law office going and to keep the cash register in the law office ringing.  In addition to it, I was in some courtroom every day at that time trying a lawsuit.  And generally it was a lawsuit dealing with criminal defendants.  But with the two of us practicing law and his being involved in politics, he became and got elected, to the Ohio legislature [Ohio General Assembly].  And when he did, he became the first black Democrat ever elected to the House of Representatives [Ohio House of Representatives].  Carl at that time had become charismatic, and he had such a great political future ahead of him that some of the powers to be figured they had to short circuit him.  And that was to be able to keep him on being able to run for Congress.  Ohio had never had a black congressman.  And so, Carl was a threat to them.  So what they did, the same legislature in which he was serving, gerrymandered the 21st congressional district in a way where it diluted the strength of the 21st district, which meant that no black could run and be able to get elected by the black community.  Carl came to the Cleveland NAACP [Cleveland Branch NAACP, Cleveland, Ohio] and asked them to file a lawsuit against the legislature in which he was serving, which at that time was controlled by Governor Rhodes [James A. Rhodes].  And he asked them to file a lawsuit against them, and that would break up the gerrymandering and so he would be able to have a solid based district where they could elect a black congressman. I was the NAACP's [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] lawyer, so they turned the case over to me again.  I got a group of lawyers together, we filed a lawsuit; we took the lawsuit to the lower court, local district court, and they ruled against us.  We then appealed the case directly in to the United States Supreme Court.  The United States Supreme Court ruled in our favor; they said that Ohio had illegally gerrymandered the 21st district.  They ordered them to carve out a district that was based upon the constitutional line of the district and the contiguous nature of the district.  When the lower court did that, the district came out 65 percent black, 35 percent white.  It meant that Carl could go on now and run for Congress.  I went to him and I said, "Hey, Carl, we won your lawsuit.  You can now go to Congress."  He said, "I don't want to go to Congress.  I'm the mayor of Cleveland [Ohio]."  And indeed he was, and, as I said, with the notoriety that went with that.  So, when the community learned Carl was not going to run for Congress, because no one was going to challenge him in that respect, then everybody decided it's their time to go to Congress.  And so the list was growing longer and longer every day.  So the NAACP people came to me at a Sunday meeting that we generally had around breakfast, and they said, "Lou [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], you created the district through your work.  Why don't you consider running for Congress?"  And so, I agreed to go back and discuss it with Carl.  We went back and talked to him about it.  He agreed that I should run.  And for a guy who had no political ambition, who was content to be a lawyer, I wound up running for Congress.  But I ran against all those other people who thought it was their time to go to Congress.  There were fourteen Democrats and seven Republicans running for that seat; a total of twenty-one people.  Most of the fourteen Democrats were--many of them were office holders in the community.  And we had the primary; I won the primary two to one over Leo--Judge Leo--I'll think of his name in a few minutes.  Jackson.  Judge Leo Jackson [Leo A. Jackson].
Story_ID: 599359
Speaker 1: Just a few more things about 1968, then we'll move on to [U.S.] Congress.  But I think that in 1968, there seemed to be a general impression, even though we had a black mayor in Cleveland [Ohio], that somehow Cleveland was sinking, and that I mentioned off camera the movie, 'Uptight,' it showed, you know, basically this tough ghetto with Hough--featuring Hough [Cleveland, Ohio] and all that, and then the--after that, with Fred Ahmed Evans shooting people, and the--I don't know what year it was when the lake [sic. Cuyahoga River] caught on fire in Cleveland because of pollution or something.  But there was this general impression that Cleveland is somehow sinking or something.  How do you, you have any reflections on that, that kind of thinking and, on what you all were trying to do to bring it, you know, up?
Speaker 2: Well, when Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] became mayor, I think a lot of people thought that they were buying an insurance policy against riots.  And Carl explained that the election of a black mayor in and of itself does not insure you against riots; that there have to be other signs of hope that people can look to in order to feel that they are a part of that society, and that they're cared for.  One of the things he did pursuant to that was to convince the business community that they needed to raise funds to help him to be able to bring programs in to the black community and to reinforce his election as mayor with programs and things that help them in a self-help nature in the community.  So they did that, they responded very well; raised millions of dollars and put it into a program called Cleveland: Now!  And then, as a means of dispensing that community, Carl put that money into various segments of the black community.  One of the groups in the community that got some of the money was a group headed up by Fred Ahmed Evans.  And it was a group in the black community that Carl thought he was helping them with their craft stores and other cultural aspects of the program that this particular group had.  And he had no idea that this group would take the money that he gave them and go out and buy guns.  And that's what they did.  They went and bought guns, and then they concocted a plan to draw firemen into the community and be able to fire upon these firemen when they came in, in response to the fire call, and then when they fired on them, to be able to fire on the police that came in to correct that situation.  And so, that's what happened.  They drew white firemen into the community, and when they came in they fired on them and had them up under siege.  And then white policemen came in to try and rescue the white firemen, and they were put under a siege, and some were killed.  And, what happened was the white police then wanted to go again to that community and get revenge for the white policemen that had been killed.  And Carl knowing that, understanding the human nature of that situation, refused and kept the police from going in there to just wipe out that community.  And, of course, there was something he could never fully recover from because the white community really hated him for keeping those white police from going in there, wiping out Fred Ahmed Evans and those blacks who had created that situation.
Story_ID: 599360
Speaker 1: Now, the other thing you're talking about in terms of derogatory terms such as the mistake of Cleveland [Ohio], and mistake on the lake, and the city where the river caught on fire.  That's true, the river, the Cuyahoga River did catch afire, and it was a result of oil and other materials that were dispensed from industry into the Cuyahoga River, and it became so polluted at one point that it actually caught on fire.  And there was so much spillage and oil and other debris that a fire could actually exist on top of water.  And, of course, that created national attention.  But it also did something else; it enabled me in my first term in [U.S.] Congress to have Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] come up and testify about the Clean Water Act [Clean Water Act of 1972], which was under discussion at that time in a debate, where he could testify and favor the need for Clean Water Act, and particularly for cities such as Cleveland that had suffered from this type of pollution by industry over the years.  And then I was able to get the committee that had jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act to use Cuyahoga River as a pilot example for the national.  The theory being that if they would give us the kind of money we needed to clean up the Cuyahoga River, that that would say if you could clean up the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, you can clean up any body of water anywhere in the United States.  And the Congress did put the money in.  Cuyahoga River was cleaned up.  Today there are businesses and all kinds of restaurants and other social places around what's called the Warehouse District in Cleveland.  And it's a place that attracts tourists and residents, and is a place that is a real hot tourist spot in Cleveland which came about as a result of our being able to clean up the Cuyahoga River.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's been a 365 degree change from--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --the way the waterfront looked then as to the way it does now.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: With the new stadium [FirstEnergy Stadium, Cleveland, Ohio]--the old days when you watched a Browns' [Cleveland Browns] game, you looked past the Municipal Stadium [Cleveland Municipal Stadium, Cleveland, Ohio], you'd see steamers and barges and stuff, and it looked like an industrial (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It didn't look like a recreational place or--
Speaker 1: Not at all. Not at all.
Speaker 2: --you know, smoke and such.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: But now it's a lot different.
Story_ID: 599361
Speaker 1: Do you have--you may not, but I have to ask you.  Do you have any idea what--and I know those were days when there was a lot of revolutionary rhetoric in the air, but what was Fred Ahmed Evans' thinking?  What's your impression of what--what was he thinking about with, I mean, the trying to--where could he go with shooting the police officers--
Speaker 2: Well, those were days when a lot of blacks in communities--not only in Cleveland [Ohio], but out in Los Angeles [California], around the area they have out there--I'm trying to think of the name of the--
Speaker 1: Watts [Los Angeles, California] or--
Speaker 2: --Watts, Watts area.  And in some other places where the people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oakland [California], Watts or any number of places.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They talk about revolution.  If there was--it was popular back in the '60s [1960s] when they would talk about revolutionary and--
Speaker 1: Was there an incident that prompted Fred Evans and his group to do what they did?  I mean was there something that sparked it?  Because usually, when you have a--
Speaker 2: They created the incident.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's all, they manufactured--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But what seems strange is that they planned to do this--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and it wasn't a reaction to some immediate activity (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was it.  They planned to do it and they did it with the money that was given to them by Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] under the auspices of the Cleveland: Now! program.  And--but there was no incident that kicked it off.  In 1965 in the riots there, there was an incident because we had--on the hottest night of the year in August, a black man had gone up into a black tavern in the black community in the Hough [Cleveland, Ohio], and asked them for a glass of water.  And they refused him a glass of water and told him to get out of there.  And this is a tavern sitting in the heart of the Hough; a devastated, poor, predominantly black community, and they refused him a glass of water on the hottest night of the year.  And that was what precipitated the riot that started out that night.  But there were many other causes of it, but that was the single incident.  But for the one you're talking about in '67 [sic. 1968], there was no incident.  They created the incident, Ahmed Evans and his group.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he was subsequently convicted and--
Speaker 2: He was convicted and served time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: May still be serving time for all I know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 599362
Speaker 1: Now you were on the ground floor of putting together the Congressional Black Caucus. Can you--
Speaker 2: I was one of the founders.
Speaker 1: Yes, one of the founders, you and John Conyers [HistoryMaker John Conyers, Jr.] and--well, tell, tell us about--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --who else helped do this and why?
Speaker 2: When I went to Congress in January of 1969, Shirley Chisholm had just been elected as the first black congresswoman from New York.  Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.] had been elected as the first congressman from Missouri.  The three of us went to Congress in January of 1969.  When we got there, there were only six black congressmen.  And so, this made a total of nine of us in the 91st Congress, which was a historic moment.  The earliest--the largest number we had ever had there previously was in the post-Reconstruction period, 1875 or 1877, when we had seven black members in the House [U.S. House of Representatives] and one in the [U.S.] Senate.  And so, when we came in that day, the nine of us, that meant we had the largest number ever.  But it carried with it much more than that.  Between 1875, 1877, and 1900, there had been a total of twenty-two blacks that served; twenty in the House and two in the Senate.  The two in the Senate were both Republicans; both were from Mississippi.  The twenty that served in the House were from various southern districts, all southern districts.  But by 1900, because of the black laws that had been enacted through the South, the intimidation by the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] and other surreptitious means and manner, every black senator and congressman had been defeated.  That was in 1900 when the last one went out.  He was a man by the name of George White [George H. White].  Politicians--or historians rather, describe him as being a militant Negro politician from North Carolina.  He made a famous speech just before he left the House on his last day.  In his speech he said, "This, Mr. Speaker, is perhaps the Negroes' temporary farewell to the United States House of Representatives, but phoenix like, we will rise up and come again."  Now his prediction was accurate.  We did come again.  But it took us twenty-eight years to come again; from 1900 to 1928, not a single black face represented any part of America in the United States Congress.  We came back again as he predicted in 1928 [sic. 1929] when Oscar De Priest [Oscar Stanton De Priest] was elected from Chicago, Illinois, and he was Republican.  Then from 1928 to 1968 when we were elected, there were a total of six blacks elected to the House.
Story_ID: 599363
Speaker 1: So that day we came in, with the three of us it made nine.  So that was the historic moment.  Now, the three of us had been involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  As a consequence of it, the day we came in being first from our respective states, plus being the nine--making it now nine, and plus our involvement in the Civil Rights Movement, gave the media all the reason they needed to focus in on the three of us, and we were given a lot of media attention immediately.  And we came in in the same vein in which we had been in in the Civil Rights Movement; outspoken, and demanding, and things of that nature.  But we were three freshmen congressmen, and we knew and understood that we didn't have any power there.  But we got attention from the media, but no power.  We knew that if we were going to be able to accomplish something historically for black people, we needed the other six to help us form one unit, because black people across America were also aware of the fact that this was an historic moment.  And they also looked at it in this respect; that Lou Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes] and Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.] in Missouri, and Shirley Chisholm, can't just come to [U.S.] Congress and represent Cleveland [Ohio], and New York, and St. Louis [Missouri].  They've got an obligation to represent us down here in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas; all these southern states where there were no black congressman.  And so, we couldn't come to Congress and just be a normal congressperson and represent our districts.  Black people in those states looked for us to represent them.  And we knew it and understood that.  For instance, right after our election, the police went into a home there in Chicago, Illinois, and mowed down Black Panthers [Fred Hampton and Mark Clark] in the middle of the night and claimed that they were victims of a shootout.  Actually, it was a shoot in where the police went in and killed those men in the middle of the night.  Now, down in Orangeburg, South Carolina, they had riots on the campus [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University].  Police killed blacks down there.  Down in Mississippi, Mound Bayou Hospital [Mound Bayou Community Hospital, Mound Bayou, Mississippi] was being closed.  It was the only hospital that black people could go to.  So, we immediately realized that we had a responsibility to go in Chicago.  We had a responsibility to go into Orangeburg, South Carolina.  We had a responsibility to go to Mississippi, and try to help those black people under those circumstances.  And so, we were able to get Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.], who was still there, to lead us.  But he said day to day he wasn't going to be there because Adam had been stripped of his power the day that Bill and Shirley and I were sworn in with the other six.  They stripped him of his chairmanship, stripped him of his seniority, cut his pay; and so, he said, "I'm not going to be around here that much.  I'm going to assign Charlie Diggs [Charles Diggs] to be chairman of this group."  And at that time, we weren't even calling ourselves Congressional Black Caucus.  The original name that Charlie Diggs gave us was the Select Democratic Committee, or something like that.
Speaker 2: Democratic Select Committee.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And so, then we had a meeting a couple of years later and I remember Bill Clay saying, "Listen, if we're going to represent black people, we ought to have black in the name of this organization."  He moved that we make it the Congressional Black Caucus.  We did that, and that's when we became the group.  By then, there were twelve of us which included Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] and Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums], who had come in after us, and Walter Fauntroy [HistoryMaker Reverend Walter Fauntroy] of Washington, D.C., who came in as the thirteenth.  So, at that time, when we formed the Congressional Black Caucus officially, there were about thirteen of us.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was the beginning.
Speaker 2: All right and now, you served as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus for a period of time, right?
Speaker 1: I was the second chair.  First, first chair was Charlie Diggs from Michigan, and then I was the second chair.
Story_ID: 599364
Speaker 1: So, what--well, you know, I guess we should discuss like what the--what some of the issues were that the Congressional Black Caucus tackled in those early days.  You talked about, you know, representing black people in the South, being a voice for them too.  But, what other issues did you tackle?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things was the fact that, at the time that were sworn in, Richard Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] was sworn in as president.  And immediately, his policies were devastating to black people and other minorities, and disadvantaged people throughout our country.  And so, we realized that if we were going to be able accomplish anything legislatively to help our people that we had to meet with him and had to explain to him how devastating his policies were to minorities in this country.  We began to initiate an opportunity to meet with him.  And he refused to meet with us.  We were described as being black revolutionaries, and other derogatory terms.  And this was when they developed the benign neglect policy, towards the black congressmen.  Just, you know, acknowledge that they're over there, but forget about them.
Speaker 1: Now, when he refers to you as revolutionary and so forth, I mean, you were all the black--all the black congressmen that were in the Congressional Black Caucus, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: I mean, so it wasn't like there were some that weren't.
Speaker 2: No.  All of us that were in the caucus were asking to meet with him.  And that we were by no means revolutionaries.  You know, we were elected representatives to the United States Congress.  And--but anyway, so he was coming over to--that is, the president was coming over, to speak at a State of the Union message.  And earlier that day, we were on the floor, and we got to talking about it, Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.] and I were talking; and so, I say, "Well, Bill, it just seems to me that the president won't meet with us, so we ought not to meet here tonight with him."  And I said, "The best thing for us to do is to boycott his speech here in the Congress."  Bill agreed, and Bill took it to the other members of the caucus.  All of us agreed to boycott Nixon's speech before the Congress--State of the Union speech before the Congress.  That night when the media noticed that there wasn't a single black face on the floor of the Congress, they immediately reacted to that and reported it, and it went around the world that we had boycotted Nixon's speech.  And two days later, Charlie Diggs [Charles Diggs] got a call from the White House saying, "President Nixon would like to meet with the caucus."  And so, that was a big event.  And we prepared for it.  We had the help of a lot of key people around the country who, knowing we were going to have this Nixon--this meeting with Nixon, they wanted us to be well prepared.  And they volunteered their expertise and came there and worked with us, and we put together a dynamite package in areas such as housing, and health, and education, and the environment and things of that nature to present to him at that meeting.  Then we had this historic meeting, and each of us--not each of us, but a number of us had a chance to make individual presentations to him regarding the proposal that we put before him.  He did set up a mechanism or process by which several of his key people--he had his cabinet there--and several of them were to meet with, with our staff people--their staff would meet with our staff and try to work on some things together.  But basically, no real good came out of it.
Story_ID: 599365
Speaker 1: Now, what was, what was your working relationship like with Senator Edward Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke]?  He was the only--first black senator elected since Reconstruction, from Massachusetts.  He was elected in the late-'60s [1960s].  What was your working relationship like with him as a Congressional Black Caucus?
Speaker 2: Well, Ed made it very clear that, you know, he was in the [U.S.] Senate and--
Speaker 1: He was a Republican too.
Speaker 2: --and he was Republican, and he sort of considered himself as a caucus of one on the Senate side, and that he was not going join the Congressional Black Caucus.  But, he indicated his willingness to work with us on matters where we needed his assistance.  And, indeed, when I was chairman, he addressed the annual Congressional Black Caucus weekend big gala, and he was our speaker.  And Ed and I probably had a closer working relationship than he did with any other member of the caucus because he was on the appropriations committee on the Senate [U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations], and I was on the appropriations committee in the House [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations].  And we happen to both sit on the labor, health, human services, and education subcommittee on appropriations [Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies].  And so, we would meet one another in the House-Senate conferences, and we'd be working on the same issues together.  I'd be fighting for it from the House [U.S. House of Representatives] viewpoint, he'd be fighting for it from the Senate viewpoint.  And so, we had a very good working relationship.  When the judiciary committee had before them the nominations for the [U.S.] Supreme Court of Carswell [G. Harrold Carswell], and the other person whom I cannot think of, you'll remember that two, two nominees who were bad on civil rights.
Speaker 1: Yeah, southern--
Speaker 2: Yes, both southerners, and with bad records.  And we, of course, in the House had no jurisdiction over being able to stop those confirmations of those two guys.  We went to Birch Bayh and to Ed Brooke, and Birch Bayh and Ed Brooke formed the coalition there and they fought those nominations, and those were Carswell and Haynsworth [Clement Haynsworth], if you remember Ed.  And both of them were defeated over there.  That was the work of Ed Brooke in that Senate, he and Birch Bayh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right.  I remember that, yeah.
Story_ID: 599366
Speaker 1: Well tell us about--now, 1972, there was a call for a black national political convention in Indiana.  This was, I guess a further kind of trying to--attempt to consolidate black voting power and political power.  Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, it didn't turn out exactly as we had planned.  The Congressional Black Caucus, I think, through Charlie Diggs [Charles Diggs] had initiated a call for a National Black Political Convention.  And it was something that immediately appealed to blacks all over the country to see all of their politicians, elected officials come together at one big meeting where they talk about issues related to the black community, and what we can do, and how we can strategize, and that type of thing.  So people--black people loved it.  And black elected officials got excited about it.  But during the course of the process preparing for it, one way or another the poet over here in New Jersey--
Speaker 1: Amiri Baraka or LeRoi Jones--
Speaker 2: Amiri Baraka and his group got control of the planning process.  And--
Speaker 1: Would this be the Congress of Afrikan People, I guess, in those days, I believe.
Speaker 2: --he had the advantage of--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I'm not sure--
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Kenneth Gibson, the mayor of Newark [New Jersey] were supporters of his (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kenneth, he was, yeah.  But Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] was the mayor of Cleveland [Ohio] at that time.  And I know both of us attended.  And what had happened in that process, Amiri and his group had just--they had put their people in control of everything.  And they had set the agenda, and their agenda was totally different from what the Congressional Black Caucus had in mind when they issued that call.  As a consequence of it, they wound up in the conference on the last day with a very controversial issue where a resolution was passed calling for the abolishment or something of Israel, which had nothing to do--Israel's issues should not have been included in our issues where we were talking about what do we do to save black people in this country.  But, see, that was the kind of thing brought in through Amiri and his group.  And they--I remember under their plan there, Carl and I were sent to speak to some group, high school, way out, thirteen miles or so from Indianapolis [Indiana], and that type of thing.  So, as far as I'm concerned, there was a real failure and we did not accomplish what the caucus had hoped to accomplish in terms of a real agenda for black people to get them out of the morass of problems that we were confronted with at that time.

Speaker 1: National black political assembly [National Black Political Convention] was kind of a disappointment the way it--
Speaker 2: It really was.  It really was.  And nothing ever came out of it.
Speaker 1: Well, there were--I'd say this--I think for the first time in--that I can remember--I was young and had never experienced too much, but black people from around the country were meeting about an agenda for black people.  I know in Ohio, we met in Dayton as a group to talk about things, and then we had an Ohio meeting in Cincinnati in '72 [1972] where we discussed issues, but at least it, you know, sparked some discussion and dialog and some activities in cities I guess.
Speaker 2: Well, it was a missed opportunity as far as I'm concerned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I said preliminarily, black people were excited about it.  And so were the public officials and black elected officials excited about it, because this was grand opportunity for us to come together and collectively work on problems related to the black community.  That was primarily most of us were elected by having black bases in our congressional districts or our city districts, things of the sort.  We owed it to black people to try to come together and collectively work on their behalf.  But it didn't turn out that way at that meeting.  And when I say nothing came out of it, I meant that nothing as a result of coming together in Indiana ever produced anything.
Story_ID: 599368
Speaker 1: Did the Congressional Black Caucus have a stance on the Vietnam War during those days?
Speaker 2: Most of us were opposed to it.  I can't say that we were unanimous in that respect because I just don't remember at that time.  But I know I was opposed to it.  And it was--it created a problem even for my brother Carl [Carl Stokes] because he was the mayor of Cleveland [Ohio], and he had--he was dependent upon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] and Humphrey [Hubert Humphrey] to try and get programs and money into Cleveland, and here was his brother opposing the president and the vice president on the issue of Vietnam.  But, well, Carl understood that I had to do what I felt was right in the Congress, so I know I opposed it, and many other members of the caucus did.
Story_ID: 599369
Speaker 1: Now, you were--you mentioned earlier some of the committees that you were on.  The assassination committee [U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations], and the committee to investigate some of the Iran-Contra [Iran-Contra Affair] activities.  There are several committees.  We stand today in 2007 on the verge of a lot of committee investigations of the Iraq War and other activities of the Bush [President George Walker Bush] administration.  Did--what did your experiences on those committees inform you about our government and how it works and, I mean--it had to be, I would just imagine that some of it is just disheartening, I mean to--I mean what--I mean, were you surprised at some of the stuff you discovered in those committees?
Speaker 2: Before we get to that, let me give you a little background in terms of the caucus [Congressional Black Caucus] and the committee system in the [U.S.] Congress.  When I went in the Congress, I wanted to be on the education and labor committee [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor; U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce] because Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] was mayor and he felt if I was to be able to help him, that the education and labor committee was probably a committee I could best help him.  And so, the man who had charge or the congressman who was in charge of giving me my committee assignment, came back to me and he said, "Louie [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], I can get you on the education and labor committee," he said, "but in order to do so, the Democrats want you to do them a favor."  So I said, "Well, what's the favor?"  He said, "They want you to go on HUAC."  Well, the HUAC was the old House Un-American Activities Committee.  I told him, I said, "Charlie [Charles Diggs], I just signed a petition to have it abolished."  So, anyway, he went on to convince me that because of my background in criminal and constitutional law, they felt that I could be a real needle in the sides of the Republicans who were on that committee, and along with the Democrats, too, on the committee who were trying to find a Communist under every rock or under every tree, and--but they wanted someone there that could stand up to those guys with the [U.S.] Constitution and all that.  So, I did agree to go on the committee.  And so, when I'd done two years on that committee, it meant that the Democrats owed me something.  And so, the same guy who had helped me get the education and labor and take that assignment, discussed with my trying to get on appropriations [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations] with the understanding that this was a committee where if I'm going to be able to help a poor district like I represented in Cleveland [Ohio], I had to get money into that district.  When we looked at the committee system, no black member of Congress in its history had ever served on the appropriations committee.  But we looked further.  No black had ever served on the rules committee; no black had ever served on the ways and means committee.  And so, we realized that if we're going to be able to break into a committee system in Congress where the power lies, we had to break into those three committees from which we'd always been kept off.  So, we decided since the Democrats owed me something, let's make the move with me, where they can't turn me down because they owed me something, and break in the appropriations with me.  We did that, and they put on the appropriations.  I'm the first black that ever served on the appropriations committee in its history.
Speaker 1: Who was the chair when you started?
Speaker 2: Mahon [George H. Mahon] was the chair when I went on.  And then later Jamie Whitten became the chairman of the committee.  But, simultaneously with it, we then moved to put Shirley Chisholm on the rules committee [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Rules], and we moved to put Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] on the ways and means committee [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means].  That means we had then effectively broken into the power in the Congress.  We had blacks on all three of those committees.
Story_ID: 599370
Speaker 1: And so, under my chairmanship of the Caucus [Congressional Black Caucus], what we did was to try to spread ourselves out.  There were only thirteen, fourteen of us, but we realized if we spread ourselves on the committee system, that this is where we would be able to wield some power by acquiring seniority on those committees by virtually staying there year after year after year.  The perfect example of it is that even though Shirley [Shirley Chisholm] is gone, and I'm gone, Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel], by staying on that ways and means committee [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means] from way back when we put him on there, is now the first black chairman of the ways and means committee of the House, which means he has power over all the oil and gas interest of the country; all of the taxation power of the United States, all of the--well, not all of, but a great part of the health legislation of the United States.  It's a powerful position.  And so our vision was accurate to make that move.  Now, I guess also by virtue of my background as a lawyer and that type of thing, and the constitutional lawyer aspect, they asked me to go on the ethics committee of the House [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ethics].  And that's when--and I was first black to serve on the ethics committee.  And I wound up being the chairman of that committee.  For six years I chaired the committee when we had the Abscam cases, the sex and drugs cases, the Geraldine Ferraro investigation, and we had the--numerous other major investigations.  I also did, when I was chairman of the House intelligence committee [U.S. House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]--then I had jurisdiction over all of our intelligence activities all over the world, and, which took in the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], and the DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency], and Army intelligence [Military Intelligence Corps], Navy intelligence [Office of Naval Intelligence], [U.S.] Secret Service, FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation]--all of that.
Story_ID: 599371
Speaker 1: Then they asked me to take the, the chairmanship of the House Select Committee on Assassinations [U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations].  Our assignment was to investigate the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and the late President John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy].  And we conducted those investigations over a two year period.  We spent about $6 million for the investigations, and we came out with nationally televised hearings on both assassinations as well as volumes of books with reference to our findings where our job was to tell the American people what the facts and circumstances were regarding the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and President Kennedy.  And, to refer to your question, yes.  In each of the investigations that I conducted for the [U.S.] Congress, there were a lot of things that we found out.  Some things that in some categories we could talk about, some things that we could not talk about.  One of the things I'm satisfied with is that in the assassinations of Dr. King and President Kennedy, that we have now revealed to the American people all of the facts and circumstances, and I'm proud of the fact that nobody, I mean nobody in the now twenty years since then, has been able to refute any of our findings.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And yet, there still seems to be some--you know, a lot of--still speculations and uncertainty about what happened to the extent that, I think, the King family believes an entire different scenario and--
Speaker 1: You're right.  The King family, yeah, has supported the fact that James Earl Ray said he did not kill Dr. King.  And they came to the public view that he did not kill Dr. King.  Our findings of our committee, our investigation led us to the conclusion that James Earl Ray did kill Dr. King.  And so, to that degree, we, we differ.
Story_ID: 599372
Speaker 1: Now in terms of the one, you know, major incident--I even heard it last night on the--discuss the Iran-Contra drug- you know--
Speaker 2: Investigation?
Speaker 1: --investigation and how that affected the black community.  There was a--a few years ago there was an article by--in the San Jose Mercury [The Mercury News] that made national news about the link between drugs in the black community and the Iran-Contra Affair.
Speaker 2: And in my opinion, it's true.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's my opinion it's true.  The--during the course of that investigation, there were allegations that through the efforts of people like Ollie North [Oliver North], who was heavily involved in both arranging all these midnight visits in the White House [Washington, D.C.] for Iranians and others, he was heavily involved in Nicaragua with the Contras and that type of thing.  And these drugs were coming in from Nicaragua, and the drugs were coming in into the black communities in, in America, in the heart of Los Angeles [California], and in the heart of Cleveland [Ohio], in Chicago [Illinois], in Detroit [Michigan].  And so all of that was a part of that Iran-Contra escapade.
Story_ID: 599373
Speaker 1: Just listening to your life story here, I'm compelled to ask you this, and that's, you know, did--was, was being elected to [U.S.] Congress and serving as a congressman, you know, liberating on some level for you personally?  It seems as though you're a person who always is incredibly talented and people recognize it, but you seem to doubt that you, you know, you should be elevated for some reason.  I mean, I don't know (laughter).  I mean, what is it--I mean, to finally get a position where you, you know, you don't have to worry about, you know, what your next step was, you know, what the next level was going to be.  Was that liberating on some level?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure I really--I want to answer your question, but I want to be sure I understand what you're asking me.
Speaker 1: It seems like at every--a lot of junctures, from high school [Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio] on, you seem to--you know, you were surprised that your teacher considered you college material by asking you about going to college or you were surprising in the [U.S.] military and other, you know, in school and so forth.  And then, I don't know.  It just seems that when they asked you to run for Congress, you--all these people were eager to run, and they had to ask you to run, you know.  But, I mean, was it--I mean, it seems like Congress is a--I mean, and you certainly, you know, did valuable service--I mean, did--I guess when you look back on it, was it--you consider that like, I guess, a place where you could finally say, "Well, okay, I'm, you know, I finally feel satisfied that I'm a worthy public servant or--," I don't know.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, let me say this.  I had no political ambition.  I loved being a lawyer and trying lawsuits in court.  I looked forward every morning to just getting back in that courtroom.  I loved being in the fray.  I loved dealing with the wits aspect of a trial, and speaking to juries and analyzing juries, and cross examining defendants, and representing people who were charged with crimes that brought into play the [U.S.] Constitution and the law and the interpretation of the law.  And so, that was my life.  I would have been content doing that the rest of my life.  And maybe at some point in my life considering a judgeship.  But fate decreed through Carl's [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] elections and his involvement in politics that I would become involved in politics.  My sole interest in politics was helping Carl be whatever he wanted to be politically.  But I had no ambitions in that respect.  But when I was--when people asked me to run for the office and I agreed to do so, then I looked at being a member of Congress in the same way I looked at being a lawyer.  It was my intention to be the best congressman ever elected to Congress.  And so, I put into it what I had to put into it, utilize whatever talents I have and ability and so forth.
Story_ID: 599374
Speaker 1: And the series of firsts that I've just recited for you a few minutes--, these are things that no other black member of [U.S.] Congress can claim.  These are all firsts, and they came about, I guess, through recognition of my abilities as well as my being able to prove that these are things that can be done, and be done at the highest level.  And that's for instance, like I'm proud of the fact that no one's been able to refute any of the findings of our investigation into two assassinations which the Congress had never done before.  That was historic for the Congress to do investigations in--within the Congress of assassinations of a president [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], and the greatest black man who's ever lived [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  Appropriations [U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations].  I took more money into Cleveland [Ohio] than has ever been taken into that city through the appropriates process.  I put all over the country--they consider me the godfather of programs, like the TriO education programs; and money I put in those programs.  Medical programs, health programs.  There's a building on the campus at NIH [National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland], the Louis Stokes Laboratories because of what I did in health.  Howard University [Washington, D.C.] has a Louis Stokes Health Sciences Library because of what I did for Howard and other black--historically black colleges and universities [HBCUs], and what I did in the area of health for young, black medical students and some of the programs that I enacted for them.  And so, when I look at all of this and put it into perspective, and people say to me and say, "Well, do you miss being in Congress?"  I don't miss it.  And the reason I don't miss it is because I did it the way it was supposed--it was supposed to be done.  And when I left there, it was there were no more mountains for me to climb.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And you served until when was it, nineteen ninety--
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-nine [1999].  I served thirty years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: From 1969 to 1999.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 599375
Speaker 1: And so, since that time, you've basically been a consultant?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm senior counsel here at Squire Sanders [Squire Sanders and Dempsey; Squire Patton Boggs], and, and I do governmental type of law, and some lobbying.
Speaker 1: I know there's very few former congressman go back to their home districts, you know, to live.  Is it--I mean, why is this, and--I mean, do you have a--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I still have a home, and I have a home here, and I have in Cleveland [Ohio].  And that's the way I've lived for more than thirty years now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was in [U.S.] Congress, I had a home here because I was raising a family, and I wanted to be close to my family during the week rather than to wait and see them on a weekend.  And so, we bought a home here so I could raise my family here, but kept a home in Cleveland so that when I went in there on weekends, you know, after being in legislative sessions all week.  I'd have a home there in place to operate from it as my home.  And I still maintain that.  So Cleveland will always be home for me.  It's the place that gave me and my brother [Carl Stokes] and also my daughter--I have a daughter, Angela [Angela Stokes], who is a judge in Cleveland.  And so, it's given our family a great opportunity for public service, and I want to always be a part of Cleveland.  But, it's more practical for us to, to live here.  My--the law office I'm with is in Washington [D.C.], and it's better--easier for me to operate out of Washington and just commute back and forth between the two cities.
Story_ID: 599376
Speaker 1: Now, your brother's service as mayor lasted until 1971, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He served two terms of two years each.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he was--he was a newscaster for a while?
Speaker 2: When he left Cleveland [Ohio] after he left being mayor, he went to New York [New York] and he became the first black news anchor in New York when he went to NBC and became their news anchor.  He did that for a couple of years, and then he went back to reporting as a reporter for NBC.  He spent eight years being an anchor and a reporter.  And while he was there, he won an Emmy [Emmy Award] for his piece he did on Paul Robeson, and so he became an Emmy Award winning journalist.  He went back to Cleveland after the eight years in New York, and went back to practicing law, and specialized in labor law.  Then he decided to run for a judgeship.  He ran for it and got elected to the Cleveland Municipal Court, which is the same court that my daughter [Angela Stokes] serves on now.  And then he ran for and got elected as a presiding and administrative judge on the Cleveland Municipal Court.  And he served on this court then until President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], in 1994 I guess, became the president, and he appointed Carl as our ambassador to the Seychelles, which is over in the Indian Ocean.  And he served in that capacity as our ambassador until he became sick, and subsequently in 1996 he passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, one time--it doesn't say on the outline when it was, but it says that at one time your mother [Louise Stone Stokes] was chosen as Mother of the Year in Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  It's something that we're very proud of.  Both--she was chosen both as Mother of the Year in Cleveland, and then selected at the state level as Mother of the Year.  And then she competed in a competition to be elected America's Mother of the Year.  She went out to California for that and she actually competed.  But she was not selected in that capacity, so, but she's Cleveland and Ohio's Mother of the Year, that particular year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when that was that roughly?
Speaker 2: You know, somewhere in the '70s [1970s] I think.  Carl [Carl Stokes] was mayor and I was a congressman, and she had seen both of us elected to office, and she was accorded that honor.  But it was somewhere in the '70s [1970s].  We have the date somewhere.  I don't have it right here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 599377
Speaker 1: Now, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, firstly I think we live in a country in which racism is still alive and it's doing well.  I think we've made a lot of progress in this country, and I'd be the first to say that things today are not like they were--for instance, when I went to [U.S.] Congress in 1969, we've come a long way.  In the same way that I've made quite ado--to do about the fact that it was six black congressman, then nine.  Today there're forty-three black congressmen.  Now that obviously is great progress.  And most of those congressmen are now from the South, a major amount of them.  And we're proud of that.  We've seen black mayors all over the city after Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes], because one of the things that his election did, blacks in Chicago [Illinois], New York [New York], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Atlanta [Georgia]--
Speaker 1: Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: --Detroit, Los Angeles [California], all looked at Cleveland [Ohio] and they said, "If Carl Stokes can do it in Cleveland, we can do it here in Chicago and Philadelphia, and all these cities."  And they did.  And so, he was the impetus; he was the momentum for blacks all over this country to aspire to higher office, and they did achieve higher office.  And so, we can be proud that we've made that kind of progress politically.  But if you take all of our progress in terms of the professions, doctors are still--black doctors are still less than 4 percent of the doctors in this country; engineers, black engineers are less than 3 percent.  You take any profession in our country today, and we are still in the minimum scale with reference to the total of those professions.  And so, what it says to me is, that, yes, we've made progress, but then the progress has been minimal.  And so, it means that we still have a long way to go.  And it means we're going to have to do what we've done in the past and that is fight for it.  We just in November, in Michigan, they passed a state law banning affirmation action to destroy the progress that Michigan was trying to make in terms of affirmative action.  They're taking the case to the United States Supreme Court for it.  So as this happened two months ago, we can't say that we have--we have brought down all of the bans or deterrents to everybody acquiring an equal education in this country.  And so, it means to me, we have to continue fighting.  We have to understand that the racism in our country has created these kinds of molds--much of it is perhaps not as it was in the South with the blacks, black only signs, and white only signs, and black water fountains, and white water fountains, black toilets, white toilets.  It's not as blatant, but it still exists.  And so we can't let--we can't let down.  We have to continue fighting to achieve equality in this country.  And that's what it's about, is equality.  Not superiority, but equality.  The opportunity for every human being, no matter what his color, his ethnic background or his past experience with reference to servitude or any other detriment.  Every American ought to have the chance to grow into being whatever they want to be in this country without any hindrance or any detriment.
Story_ID: 599378
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  When you look back on everything you've done up to this point, is there any major thing that you'd different if you could do it over again?
Speaker 2: Yeah I suppose always, if you have a chance to go back, there's things that you would do differently.  And, you know, I think I'm no different from anyone else.  I don't think that every decision I've made was the right decision.  I made some decisions that, you know, I would have wished I could have changed.  But you have to look back and there has to be a standard by which you did whatever you did, whatever decision you made.  And I know that whatever decisions I made, that they were carefully, calculating what is the right thing to do by the people who sent me here.  I never lost knowledge and understanding of the fact that I was sent to Congress to represent people.  In the little ballot that people used to vote for me, it said, "[HistoryMaker] Louis Stokes, representative to Congress."  I understood what that meant.  And I sat there as a representative.  So I understood that when I got to Congress, I wasn't some big deal that got elected because I was some kind of a bid deal.  I got elected because people said, "We have faith and confidence in you that you can represent us."  I don't know of any greater honor that a person can be given than for a person to designate you as their voice and their vote in the United States Congress where very few blacks have ever served.  And so, I took that literally.  I understood that.  And so, whatever decisions I made, I tried to make them in the best interest of the people who sent me there.  And I can say to you candidly, whatever decisions I made, when I went to bed that night, I knew that my conscience was clear, that I made the right decision on behalf of those people.  Now if it turns out later I made the wrong decision, then I don't let that trouble me because I know when I did it, I did what was right in my heart for those people.
Story_ID: 599379
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: That's a tough question.  Tough question.   When I look at the things people are still doing--I've been out of [U.S.] Congress eight years.  I never asked people for anything except the right to represent them in the Congress.  And I tried to do that to the best of my ability.  I've been out of Congress eight years.  People are still naming streets, naming buildings, creating all kinds of scholarships and things in my name; all of which is to say that they appreciate what I stood for and what I did representing them.  And so, I guess the legacy is being portrayed by people, what their idea of the legacy is.  They think that I did, I achieved milestones for them in health, and in education, and in housing, and in environment and other areas.  And so, the legacy I look at not from my expression, but what people are saying.  They--when I have the only building, new building, millions of dollars that says on it, Louis Stokes Laboratories at the National Institutes of Health [Bethesda, Maryland], with the knowledge that no other black in history has ever had a building on that campus in their name.  I mentioned earlier, a building in my name on Howard's campus [Louis Stokes Health Sciences Library, Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  There's a building on the Wilberforce campus [Louis Stokes Health and Wellness Center, Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio], there's a building on Central State's campus [Louis Stokes Center on Aging, Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  Those things just say to me, "Lou Stokes, [HistoryMaker] Louis Stokes, you did your job, and you did it well."
Story_ID: 599380
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about your family?  Because you mentioned your daughter's a judge in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 2: That's right.  I've really been blessed firstly with a wonderful wife.  You mentioned earlier that I had a first marriage.  That marriage lasted ten years, and we were divorced, and then I met my second wife.  We met and married, and today we've been married forty-six years.  And she is a grand, wonderful person.  And I could not have achieved the kinds of things I've achieved had it not been for her.  She's the person who really permitted me to do all the kinds of things I needed to do in order to be able to accomplish the things I have.  And so, her name is Jay, J-A-Y [Jeanette Francis Stokes], and I love her very, very much.  I had three children from my previous marriage, and I had custody of those children when I married Jay.  And so, as a very young woman, she took three children from another marriage, and then she and I had a child, and she raised all four of those children as though they were all her own.  And she's been a beautiful mother for all four of them.  And they love her as much as I love her.  And so, and they've done great things, which I attribute to her because she, she basically had to raise them.  I wasn't there.  I was running up and down the rails between Cleveland and Maryland.  I was on speaking engagements all around the country, and doing all the kinds of things on weekends when I would be away from the family and they would be left alone.  But those children turned out beautifully.  My oldest daughter Shelley [Shelley Stokes Hammond] is the director of the Founders Library at the Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And she's the director of all the funding and everything for them.  My second daughter is a judge in Cleveland, Judge Angela Stokes.  And my son is the director of editorials and communications for WXYZ in Detroit [WXYZ-TV, Detroit, Michigan].  He's a graduate of Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and the school of journalism at Columbia [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York].  And he has a program there every Sunday called 'Spotlight on the News,' and he is well respected and high celebrated in Detroit [Michigan].  And then our baby girl is Lori Stokes.  By the way his name is Chuck Stokes.  My baby girl is Lori Stokes, she is the morning and noon anchorwoman for WABC [WABC-TV], the ABC station in New York City [New York, New York].  Then in addition to them, we have seven grandchildren.  I have four girls and three boys, and my two oldest grandsons, one is graduated from Williams College in Massachusetts [Williamstown, Massachusetts], the next in age is graduating from Case Western Reserve University [Cleveland, Ohio] in May and the others are all ranging from ages twelve to eighteen because we also have one of the granddaughters is now a freshman student here at George Washington University [Washington, D.C.].  So, I think we have a lot to be proud of.  It's just we've been blessed with wonderful children and grandchildren, and I'm just blessed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything I have not asked you that you think we need to cover before I ask my last question.
Speaker 2: Well, I honestly have to say to you, as I've said during our breaks here that, I think you've done an extraordinary job, and I'm very pleased to talk with you because an interviewer really makes the interview, and I know that.  And the type of questions that you've asked enables me to educate people on what I've done and what my contribution has been to history, and I just thank you for the manner in which you've interviewed me.
Speaker 1: Oh, thank you.  You're too kind.
Speaker 2: Well, it's true.  I say it because it's true.

Speaker 1: Well, our last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You've got some good questions.  You know it brings into play, someone asked Carl [Stokes' brother, Carl Stokes] that before he passed, and his reply was, that he fought, didn't always win, but he fought.  I think I'd have to say something similar to what I've said with reference to legacy.  It has always been important to me to be the best of whatever I do.  I've taught that to each of my children [Shelley Stokes Hammond, Angela Stokes, Chuck Stokes, and Lori Stokes].  I didn't care what they selected, what they wanted to be, never tried to tell them what I wanted them to be, but I did tell them the same that Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] used to always say to all of us, and that was, be the best of whatever you are.  And, I'd people to be able to say with reference to Lou Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes], he was the best.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: My pleasure.
