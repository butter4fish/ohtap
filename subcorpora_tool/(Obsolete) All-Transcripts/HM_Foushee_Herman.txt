Speaker 1: --Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes, Herman, H-E-R-M-A-N, Marrel, M-A-R-R-E-L, Foushee, F-O-U-S-H-E-E.
Speaker 1: And what is you date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is June 26th, 1949, and I was born in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, which is in Orange County.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Occupation?  Well, I, I'm retired.  I retired from the federal and district governments back in 1998, and I have since become a consultant.  I have two businesses that I run.  And one is a tax and financial management business that has two divisions, in the tax--we have in the tax office we prepare individual, corporate taxes and do things that we were talking about earlier, in terms of (unclear)--when people set up 501(c)(3)'s.  And then in the financial management side, we help people with their financial planning, and help them to show them how to make money, and then refer them to a financial advisor for different investment vehicles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On the business management services side, which is a consulting side, what I do is I have three divisions there, one is provide access for people who are trying to do business with the federal and district governments.  The other is help people set, set businesses up.  I take 'em from the conceptual stages, help them incorporate, set up a partnership, or if they want to set up a sole proprietorship.  Then we go and we help them file, get their federal I.D. number, and just get them into business.  And any inspections they need to do, we, we help them with, with all of that.  And the, the other one is where it's, it's government operations, where I go and I work with different local governments.  For example, my most recent job was down in Riviera Beach, Florida, where I had went through and did an evaluation of their contracts and procurement office and worked on helping them become more efficient at processing contracts and procurement documents.  So that's my occupa--you said my occupation?  That's what I do for a living (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, Sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is July 17th--July--is it the 18th?  July 18th, 2003.  See, I'm (laughter)--
Speaker 1: All right, and where are we at the present time?  You don't have to give your address.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 95658
Speaker 1: Okay, now before we go into depth, there are five "People" magazine-ish type questions we always ask, and they just require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is: sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Fish, blue fish.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes, summer.
Speaker 1: A favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue and, I have two.  I have blue in clothes and green in everything else (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: You said short, so.
Speaker 1: All right, now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes, the Dominican Republic.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: I usually go three or four times a year.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I thought it was Brazil from all--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I know.  I used to go there once a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a long trip.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do; that is: "it won't be this way always."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I know you said keep it short, but the reason I like that so much is that I never remem--I'll never forget I had just finished high school, and I--you know, in North Carolina, in '68' [1968]--I mean '67' [1967] it was very difficult to get a job.  I had a job as a dishwasher.  It was 110 degrees outside, and I was washing dishes at this restaurant.  And the manager of the restaurant came through, and I was like, "Oh, man, what am I gonna do?"  He said, "Son, it won't be this way always."  So, ever since then, and then when I'm talking to people, and you know, they're getting--they're down and out or whatever, I always refer back to that.
Story_ID: 95659
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I wanna ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your, your mother's side and your father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I'll start with your, your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure, Betty, B-E-T-T-Y, middle name is Holman, H-O-L-M-A-N, last name is Foushee, F-O-U-S-H-E-E.

Speaker 2: She was born in Orange County, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, in a rural part of the--
Speaker 2: Rural part of Chapel Hill.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, give us some idea of what, what your mother's relatives were doing.  I mean did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes.  On my mother's side, yes, I knew my grandparents and my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My--they, in terms of when they--what they were doing you mean?
Speaker 1: About what they were doing in the 19th century, and did you have any knowledge of, of maybe what they were doing prior to the Civil War or after--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --immediately afterwards or?
Speaker 2: Immediately after the Civil War, my great-grandfather was a, was a bricklayer, and my, and my grandfather [George Holman] was as well, and a lot of my uncles and cousins became bricklayers as well, you know.  As you know, down, down South, there were several, certain industries that Afro-Americans, blacks, weren't allowed to participate in.  Brick mason was one of the few that they were able to participate in, where they could make a, a decent living.  But the disadvantage was if it rained, you couldn't work.  So they, they were in the, in the construction field.  And the--my grand, my great-grandmother did domestic work with different families, and as did my grandmother [Golden Holman].  And my mother [Betty Holman Foushee] was a caretaker.  She used to take care of all of senior citizens.  In fact, even though she's just, she's getting closer to their age, she's still doing the same thing, taking care of seniors.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories that are passed down through your family about, about slavery or, or any African traditions or any, anything like that?
Speaker 2: On my, on my mother's side, the--they were freed pretty early, right after the 1865--18--yeah, shortly after 1865, and were allowed to--and they had--they were, they were given the land.  They--my great-grandmother had like eighty acres of land.
Speaker 1: It was given to them by--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: By, by the--
Speaker 1: (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --by the slave owners.  By the white slaver owners, right.  And they, you know, they farmed the land like everybody else, and--
Story_ID: 95660
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, this eighty acres of land [that his great-grandmother, Golden Holman, owned after slavery]--
Speaker 1: Yes, the eighty acres.  They're still living on it, and it's been parceled out and willed down.  And my, you know, my, all of my--I guess my mother [Betty Holman Foushee] and all of her brothers and sisters have acres, and then my grandmother's brothers' kids.  So it's, you know, the whole, the whole eighty acres are still there.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's good.
Speaker 1: My--yeah, the, I guess, both my father and--I mean grand--great-grandfather and great-grandmother got their forty acres.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm not sure about the mule.  I never saw (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 2: They did get something, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: They did.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, now what was your mother like, and is she still alive?
Speaker 1: Yes, she is.
Speaker 2: Okay, what is she like, and what, what was she--did she have access to education when she was young--
Speaker 1: Well, she had access to education.  She had--she had nine children.  She started when she was age fifteen.  You know, back then in the South, they, they, they didn't use birth control pills a lot (laughter), back in, in the '50's [1950s], well '40's [1940s], I guess when I was born. So, they--we had, had--she had seven boys and two girls, so.  She was all ways very energetic.  She worked hard on a daily basis, and you know, she always provided, you know, for us.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Now, so she, she worked taking care of the elderly you said in the job she had?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Story_ID: 95661
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us about your father.  What's his full name, and how do you spell it?
Speaker 2: Herbert Foushee, H-E-R-B-E-R-T, B. Foushee is F-O-U-S-H-E-E.
Speaker 1: All right, and what, what's his date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His--I don't know.  I, I know his place of birth was Oran--was Chapel Hill, North Carolina.  And he was born in the early 1930s.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, well--
Speaker 2: He, he was, he was, he, he passed in December of 1965 [sic, 1964].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you were a teenager when he passed?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: About 15?
Speaker 2: I was 15.  And then I, I went to stay with his first cousin, finished raising me through my high school and college years.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now what was your father like and what, what kind of work did he do?
Speaker 2: He was a truck driver.  He was a, you know, very lively, life of the party type of guy, and as I recall, he always going around trying to help people do things and solve problems.  He was--he always encouraged me to go to church, but I'm not--I don't ever remember him being there (laughter).  But he was really--everywhere he went, you know, I would, I would tag along.  You know, I used to ride with him in the truck, go a lot of different places, and go so see him do a lot of different things that, you know, that, that people did when they were in their twenties, thirties.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now were you the, the, the--where did you fall in the birth order?
Speaker 2: I was the oldest.
Speaker 1: You were the oldest?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you had access to him, you know, first.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so he let you go, go places with him, help him do things?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, I used to go places, do things with him, and you know, I was like his sidekick (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, it must have been hard when he died then?  How--
Speaker 2: Well, it, it, it was, it was.  I mean in--especially at that age and to--it was a, it was a real, real gap.  And you know, I was, I was really lost, and that's when his first cousin was like, you know, I'm your godfather, so I'm gonna take care of you.
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear)--somebody there--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, his, his name is Isih Foushee, I-S-I-H, F-O-U-S-H-E-E, and his wife is Carlene (ph.) Foushee, and they had already had four kids, and they still took me in.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have any place to live in--
Speaker 2: Oh, we did.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, we did.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But, I guess, I, I was very close to my father and my father's side of the family, so it was an--and when my godfather stepped in to assume his role, I was--it was, it was, it was in the same town.  It was just right up the street.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.
Speaker 2: And it provided some direction and support for me.
Speaker 1: All right.  Tell me are there any stories from, you know, the African past or slavery that are passed down through your father's side?
Speaker 2: I, I don't remember any.  My--they never talked about it.  They never really talked about it so I don't know.
Story_ID: 95662
Speaker 1: Now, what were race relations like in Chapel Hill [North Carolina] when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, growing up (unclear)--there are two different phases.  In the '50's [1950s], the--I started elementary school [Northside Elementary School] in '55' [1955].  It was we had a elementary school for blacks, and we had an elementary school for whites.  We had the same thing in--and we had one junior-senior high school for, for blacks.  We--the Chapel Hill, the population, black population, is less than 20 percent.  And the--when I grew up there, the total population was only 25,000.  We--it was one of the, as you re--if you have read the book "[The] Free Men," [by John Ehle] it was one of the test sites that the Civil Rights, different civil rights organizations used because it was supposed to have been one of the more liberal cities in the South.  And I was very involved with the Civil Rights Movement, with the Congress of Racial Equality, CORE was the basic organization, Civil Rights organization there.  The--when we--when they, when they had the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC] come in, but they were not as--they, they, they were not as ginger and did not fit in as well as the Congress for Racial Equality did because it, it was their perception of the different organizations at that time.  And Floyd McKissick was the, was in charge of the Congress of Racial Equality back during there.  We did sit-ins; we did the, we did the-- walked along Franklin Street.  We--I did--I remember the summer of '62' [1962]; 1962 I think it was.  I spent most of my summer on the picket line in front of the drugstore, trying to make it so that we could sit at lunch counters, now Colonial Drug.  And the guy who was a pharmacist there, who owned it, was, name was John.  We called--so it was Big John Drugstore.  So, in--so that was, that was there.  I had the fortune of meeting with--being in the, in the same room with the likes of, of [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] back then, 'cause see, they came to Chapel Hill, to Greensboro.  [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson, you know, was, was one of the players back there--back then.  And when I was a little youngster and I was involved with the youth group, they had us divided between the, the adults and the youth.  The, the race relations were really during, during the time when the, when the Civil Rights marches started.  There was--it became very tense because a lot of the people in Chapel Hill, the blacks, worked for the white folks.  So consequently, they did not have--they, they were very reluctant to come forward because their bosses would be--unless their boss gave them permission to participate in the civil rights marches or in the picket lines, they didn't do it.  And as you know, most, a lot of 'em, were, you know, did domestic work, so their boss--if they heard their boss talking about it, then they didn't do it, you know.  If they did it they would get fired, and you know, they couldn't afford to lose their jobs.  So a lot of 'em didn't do it.  We, when we had the, the sit-ins, you know, one of the, one of my responsibilities was to make sure that we had--that I had the attorneys available and the bail bondsmen so that we could bail the people out of jail right away.  And we--I, I remember I was like, you know, I'm always here.  I was always there, but I couldn't--that's (unclear) like why can't I participate, you know?  Why can't I, why can't I participate in the sit-ins?  They said well, you do the picket lines, and you're too young; you know, you're a juvenile.  But June 29th, I guess--I mean December 29th we didn't have enough people so they let me do the, do a sit-in, and I finally got, got my chance to be arrested with everybody else, but was treated as a juvenile.  So I felt, really felt like I was a part of the, of, of making things happen at that time.
Story_ID: 95663
Speaker 1: Okay, now I wanna go back to now your early childhood and ask you about memories of growing up.  We gonna catch you back up as a teenager again.  But when you were growing up, what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells that you remember?
Speaker 2: Sights, I remember hills; I remember the, the country, sights, the university going down to the University of North Carolina [at Chapel Hill], sight--relatives, remember the sights of all, most of all my relatives growing up 'cause we were a very close knit family.  And you know, most of the, the blacks lived in a certain part of town, and then it just wrapped around.  And I'll never forget when my grandmother, great--and great-grandmother lived.  There was a, a yard, a field, behind the house on Lindsay Street, which is three blocks from the University of North Carolina campus, and there was a fence that separated the blacks from the whites.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a sight I remembered.
Speaker 1: Did adults tell you what it was for?
Speaker 2: We knew what it was for.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it was understood that, that, you know, you're not to go beyond that fence, and because that's for white people, just like we knew that we couldn't go and sit at the lunch counter, and you know, and you knew that there were, that--and they had--obviously on the bathroom doors they had "Colored" and "White" on the bathroom doors, so there was no question about it.  And so you were programmed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nobody had to tell you (laughter).
Speaker 1: What, what else do you remember about growing up?
Speaker 2: In terms of smell, I don't, there's nothing that I can remember about smell and growing up.
Speaker 1: (unclear) food--
Speaker 2: Well, food, yeah, you know, good quality food that my, that, that my neighbors, and grandmother, and, and relatives prepared, family reunions and things like that.  But smell is--the, the food would be the only thing that I can really think of.
Story_ID: 95664
Speaker 1: Well, what, what kind of a little boy were you when you were growing up?  What did you like to do, and what did you dislike?
Speaker 2: Well, what I liked to do, I liked playing sports.  I was a, I was a little kid who always had a job.  I had a, I had a paper route.  I was all--you know, I would go swimming every day.  I would cut grass to make money.  I would do all kinds of things.  I did everything, all the things that the regular kid did, you know, ran around, you know, threw rocks at cars.  You know, you, you--
Speaker 1: What, what happened if you hit 'em?
Speaker 2: You know, the car, the cars always moved so fast, I don't think you--I think you just--it's just a thrill; you like to see it go up in the air and just see how close you can come, but we never hit him.  But I do--and, and, and as a kid, I do remember it was not just racism that, that I--that we were facing.  You know, growing and we had--Chapel Hill [North Carolina] is a, they had a, a cla--it was a class town as well.  And I remember this place called the Robeson Street Center.  It's now called Hargraves [Community] Center, a name that was named after Ms. Robeson.  And the poor kids like me, you know, she would treat differently--
Story_ID: 95665
Speaker 1: Yeah. And we were, you know, since we were treated differently, you know, we decided to--I'll never forget one night we decided to protest the--our treatment.  So, there was a, there's a, there, there's a gentleman who had a tomato patch.  And so my cousins and I--there were about six of us--went by the tomato patch, picked up, we got two tomatoes each.  And then one, one kid went and knocked on the door.  You know, back then everybody opened the door, and nobody knocked on the door.  And when Ms. Lucille [Caldwell] came to the door, we unleashed our tomatoes.  Then you know, (laughter), and so--
Speaker 2: This is a white guy that's in charge of this--
Speaker 1: No, no, this is a black woman.
Speaker 2: A black woman?
Speaker 1: A black woman who treated us--it was, you know, it was like you guys, you know, y'all don't have any money, y'all, y'all poor, dah, dah, dah, dah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this black woman that was in charge of the center [Robeson Street Center, now Hargraves Community Center], she treated the kids with money differently than the kids that didn't (unclear).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So you, you ope--she opened the door and (unclear)?
Speaker 1: (Unclear) was a tomatoes--of course she called the police, and they chased us down, and they didn't catch us.  They caught one of our cousins, and he--and she knew who it was.  So they, they reeled us in--but not--you know, they, they, they asked, they, and they--the police chief, actually who I knew, you know, because, you know, this is a small town, you know.  And I was one of these kids who was always around town and knew all of the merchants and everybody in the city, the Chamber of Commerce president, and all that stuff.  So, you know, he said "What are you, what are you doing?  Why, why did you do that, 'cause I--you know, you're a good kid?"  I said "Well, she treated me differently, you know; she called me poor and told me I, I'll never have anything and never amount to anything, so I took offense to it."
Speaker 2: Did she actually say that to you?
Speaker 1: Yes, she said that to us, Ms. Lucille Caldwell.  I'll never forget, yes.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, yeah, well, so we unleash it.  So he said, "Oh, okay, well, in that case, where's your mamas?"  You know, "Y'all can go; y'all free to go."
Speaker 2: You all were lucky (laughter).  Yeah, that's a good (unclear).  Now what happened to this Ms., Ms. Lucille Caldwell?  Did she remain in that spot?
Speaker 1: She remained in the position.  Nothing ever happened to her.
Speaker 2: Did she change her attitude or was it worse?
Speaker 1: No, she didn't change her attitude.  She still treated us the same.
Speaker 2: Even though she--
Speaker 1: But she--
Speaker 2: --knew who--
Speaker 1: --but yeah, but she, you know, she would, she would look at us a little differently when we came around, you know (laughter).  She would be like, oh, here comes the, here comes the boys from (unclear), so, and--but that was about it.
Story_ID: 95666
Speaker 1: And, and growing up, you know, I, I remember, you know, I was--I competed in the classroom with--and, and there were three of us who were the top three students, and I was one of those growing up in our, in, in our, in our class.  And I was--remember always competing, and I think I remember the, the biggest thrill was when I was in sixth grade.  And we had to take a, a comprehensive exam, which determined how we ranked, in our class.  And you know, James Rogers was always, he, he--usually he and I and Ernie, Ernest Monar [ph.] usually got the, the top grades.  And that time I got the top, I got the top grade.  I got the highest score, so I, you know, was like the top student, so, as far as the, the comps, comprehensive exam for--we didn't really know what that meant.  And as I talk to people today, you know, people are starting, they're starting to use them in other cities.  But one of the things about Chapel Hill [North Carolina], if you know, is it had the number one school system, high school, in the country when I graduated from there by--and--
Speaker 2: You know, that's, that's not a well-known fact.
Speaker 1: Right, and it still is number one school in the country--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --public school.
Speaker 2: All right, the Chapel Hill High School?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, Chapel Hill High School.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And you know, I played football.  We play for--I remember we played football every day at recess and when we went to Cub Scout meeting we played football; with the Boy Scout meeting we played football.  That was our real outlet.  'Cause it was, you know, it was football, they say, is like a religion in, in the South?  It was like that, you know, something that little kids did all of the time.  We picked--we didn't pick up basketball until we got to junior high.
Speaker 2: Now that seems strange because we all know North Carolina is the home of Michael Jordan, and [University of] North Carolina [at Chapel hill]'s basketball team under--is that Dean Smith?
Speaker 1: Dean Smith.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Right, I never picked up a basketball until I was in seventh grade in the P.E. class.  It was not something that we did down there.
Speaker 2: Okay, were you all aware of the prominence of the basketball team?
Speaker 1: Well, we watched it, you know, but you couldn't participate, so.  But you felt like--you, you could see black football players, but you didn't see any black basketball players.
Speaker 2: Right, so University (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Uh--
Speaker 2: --of North Carolina in those days was all--
Speaker 1: All white.
Speaker 2: --white.
Speaker 1: Oh yes, until--the University of North Carolina didn't had--I, I knew the first basket--black basketball player was [Charles] Charlie Scott, because I was with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and I was the representative from our high school.  I was a liaison to the University of North Carolina's Fellowship of Christian Athletes, so I got to know Charlie very well.  You know, they made sure that the black person met the other one (unclear) (laughter), so.  But you know (unclear), no--you know, we did not play basketball growing up.  We played football.  And soccer, I didn't hear of soccer till I got to the [U.S.] Air Force (laughter), so, no.  You know, you, you, you found a way to survive, and you went to school, and you played football, and that was it.  You went to Cub Scout meetings; we went to Boy Scout meeting; you went to church, on Sundays, two or three times a day, at night; prayer meeting on Wednesdays, so--
Speaker 2: What denomination were you, were you (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Baptist.
Speaker 2: All right, now, the name of the church you, you can give us that?
Speaker 1: First Baptist Church in Roberson Street in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
Story_ID: 95667
Speaker 1: All right, now what was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: Oh, the grade school was Northside Elementary School [Chapel Hill, North Carolina].  And the junior high was Lincoln Junior-Senior High.  That was a black high school.  I went to seventh and eighth there.  And then, when they integrated the schools--the, the second year they integrated the schools.  In '63' [1963] I went Guy B. Phillips Junior High.
Speaker 1: Gaby?
Speaker 2: Guy B., G-U-Y.
Speaker 1: Guy B. Phillips (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Guy B. Phillips.
Speaker 2: Guy B. Phillips--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --Junior High.  I was in the first graduating class there, in ninth grade.  And I remember the highlight there was they had--they did the, the play "Show Boat," and, and that was big down South (laughter).
Speaker 1: That, that--for those who don't know that are watching this, what's it about?  Just give us a little synopsis of it.
Speaker 2: You know what? I don't remember the--I, I don't really remember the--
Speaker 1: Let me just say, it's a show--takes place as the show boat, you know, with some white performers and you know, black minstrels and so forth on the, on the--doing a show in a town.  That's the scene of activity.
Speaker 2: But I was the only black person in there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And they--
Speaker 1: "Old Man River" and all that.
Speaker 2: Right, they sang "Old Man River," and I, I, I remember they made me the emcee of the, of the program, of the show.
Speaker 1: Which never happened in those days (laughter)--
Speaker 2: No (laughter), right.
Speaker 1: --back in the old days (unclear)--(unclear)
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I, I did the second half.  I didn't do the first half.  There was, they're divided in two different acts, as I recall, a white, a white female did the first half, and I did the second one.  And I'll, I'll never forget, I had a script, and I came out and I started on the script, and then I just ad-libbed and just lit the crowd up.  You know, it was just, it was just so, so much fun to, to be able to do that.  And after, and after that, I think they started letting blacks participate more in a lot of different things in schools.  Although the school was desegregated, it was not integrated, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, I hear what your--so you're saying that even though blacks were in the school, they were a full part of the activities in the school.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So, just like being in that town before they integrated the town.  You, you, you're there, but you're not, you can't do certain things.
Speaker 2: Exac-- Correct.
Speaker 1: Either, either they're, they're legislated or they're implied (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, they're implied.  It's just behavior; you know that you're not supposed to it (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: You don't see any other black students doing certain things.  And if you tried, you'll get rebuffed--
Speaker 2: Right, and you'll get considered a rebel.
Story_ID: 95668
Speaker 1: Okay, were, were you a rebellious youth in high school?
Speaker 2: I was a very progressive type.  I was a visionary.  I think I was, I think I was before my time.  In junior high school I was carrying a briefcase. And I, I said I was gonna be a lawyer, and I was gonna do civil right law.  And so, yes, and I was very--you know, and I was active in, in the Civil Rights Movement, so I guess I was.
Speaker 1: Did you have any heroes in the Civil Rights Movement at that time?
Speaker 2: I did, my uncle, James Brittain, who was the person who was in charge of the Civil Rights Movement in Chapel Hill [North Carolina].  And he later became president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] for many years in Chapel Hill.  He was my father's [Herbert Foushee] brother.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now that's something to--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's inspiring.  That would, that would inspire you.  So--and, and you explained that earlier you were part of the sit-in movement--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, and participated with Congress of Racial Equality [CORE].
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, I'm at the likes of Floyd McKissick, you know, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson and all those, all those people, Ralph Abernat--Abernathy I think came to town, and we did a, a big march from Chapel Hill to Durham [North Carolina].  I remember that.  And in the book, the "The Freed Men," [sic, "The Free Men"] the, they talk a lot about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a book by who, do you know?
Speaker 2: I think it's John Dunne [sic, the book is by John Ehle, John Dunne is one of the book's subjects].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's, it's called "The Freed Men."  I have it upstairs.
Story_ID: 95669
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So in high school were you, were you still focusing on becoming a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Yes, in high school I was focused on becoming a lawyer, junior-- and then--well, I change.  I wanted to be a professional football player.  And then I learned how to play basketball, so I wanted to play basketball.  And then I wanted to be--they had, when we got to Chapel Hill High, okay, they had what they call the, the college prep program that the white folks were in.  And then for, then they had the medical/technical programs that they steered the blacks to.  And, and I, I wound up in that categ--in that group, with the, with the med--with the medical tech folks.  And so, all of a sudden, instead of wanting to become a lawyer, I was convinced that I should become a medical technologist.  And you know, so I was--then I took a lot of science courses and all that, all those kinds of things, science, math, and wound up--but then senior year, I switched back over, decided that was not what I wanted to do.  I was gonna do college prep.
Story_ID: 95670
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is something that often happens, oft, oft, often happened in those days in, in white schools, black students would be tracked.  And if their parents were not aware of, of the possibilities of higher education, they can certainly be tracked to a vocational field easily in these without--
Speaker 2: Well, their parents didn't know any better, because your parents, you know--if, if your parents didn't finish high school, they didn't go to high school, they have no knowledge of what it, what it is that you should be doing.  They--you know, if you go to a PTA [Parent Teacher Association] meeting, they never really discussed what goes on in the classroom about students.  You know, they talked about administration of the, of the, the school.  The principals have their agenda, and you know, you knew where you fit, and you knew what you were supposed to do, and you knew what you should not do.  So, you, you know, it was--we--I felt like I constantly battled racism, even as we--when I got--I was telling you when we were off tape that we had, they, they only had one high school.  In 1966 they closed the black high school, and we only had one--they built one high school.  They closed both high schools, and then we had one high school.  And I'll never forget we had--I had this teacher who I thought was really prejudice, and she taught economics.  And I took her economic class, and I'll never forget the day she said that there is--that inflation and something was the same.  And I said, "Ms., no, it's not."  "Well, how do you know, boy?"  I said "because I know it's not, because what you're saying is not true," you know, and I--she say's "Well, do you, do you wanna teach this class?"  I said "Yes, I will" (laughter).  So, I called her bluff, and I guess of all the other students in the class, you know, I had--she'd, she let it happen.  So, I spent the--so I said--so after class--she said "Well, you see me after class."  I said okay.  So after class I went to, I went up to see her, and she said "Okay what day do you wanna teach?"  You know, she was, you know, very condescending.  So I said Tuesday, and--oh, inflation and deflation she were synonymous.  So, I spent the weekend at the library, and I never went to the library (laughter) unless I had to.  I, I spent the weekend in the library preparing my lesson plan.  My, my guardian father [his godfather, Isih Foushee] was a teacher, and see, she didn't know this.  So he helped me to structure a lesson plan.  So I (unclear) a lesson plan, went into class, and she wound up giving me an "A" on the presentation, and not only that, I wound up getting like a, an "A" for the course for, for the first, second, and third quarters--they went in quarters--and then the last quarter she gave me a "B."  But they had what they call effort and conduct grades.  They had your regular grade, and then they had effort, which was like a number, one through five, five being the worse.  Okay, so, since the--we--since there was no way to, to penalize a student ex--in terms of the, the grade itself, but I'll never forget I got grounded because she gave me a "A" for, for my grade, but she gave me a "5" for effort, and a "5" for conduct.  And I was asking, I said "How can I get an "A" out of the course and put forth no effort and be a disruptive student (laughter)?"  She said "It's your attitude, your, it's your cocky attitude."
Speaker 1: Uppity--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a cocky attitude, a black person was not supposed to have, to be confident at that time.  So all the black students got, in our class, got 3's--got 2's or 3's, and white boys and girls got 1's and 2's in effort and, and conduct.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, did--I mean did you feel when you were in high school that, that it was similar to the recreation center [Robeson Street Center, now Hargraves Community Center] where you were put down for not having as much money?  But now you, you, you probably still didn't have as much money, and you were black too in an all-white setting.
Speaker 2: So it was a double whammy.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was a double whammy.  So, you know, you're, you're constantly fighting to be treated as an equal person, you know.  You know, you, you don't, you don't have to have--you know, you just want respect as a, as a person, you know.  If I make an "A," I should be given an "A."  You don't have to say--I mean it's obvious if somebody makes an "A" and they a "5" in effort and "5" in conduct, what does mean?  That means I'm a genius?  I don't have to study (laughter)?  I don't pay attention in class?  I mean, so, yes, it was the same type of thing, you know, all over town.  And those the kinds of things, I actually, I had forgotten this until today when, when we started talking about it because those kinds of things that you like to forget.
Story_ID: 95671
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of your social life there, did you--were there enough black students where you all had a social life yourselves, or did you integrate into the rest of the--I, I think you kind of indicated that it wasn't (unclear) integrated into the rest of the student body.
Speaker 2: Right, we, we didn't, and there were a few of us who I integrated, I, I, I hung out a lot with, with, with, with white folks.  I started going to, I integrated the church, their Presbyterian Church.  I started going to their Presbyterian Church downtown and went, you know, I started hanging out with them.  And I would go to the, to the white folks houses.  You know, I saw another part of town, and I saw how, you know, how, how they lived.  They had air conditioning in the summertime.  We had fans, you know.  So it was, you know, totally, totally different.  And the--we had, you know, different social functions, but generally, like I said, the--back then, you know, they--it was not integrated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so in terms of prom and all that sort of thing, class officers, and you know, did you--
Speaker 2: I ran for, I ran for treasurer my sophomore year.  That was my first year at the high school [Chapel Hill High School].  And I ran against a, a young lady and a young man.  And everybody told me I gave the best speech, but they couldn't vote for me (laughter).  So I didn't, I didn't know whether it was an underclassmen, because I was an underclassman, or whether because I was black, or because they did want, they didn't wanna trust--and then it was brought to my attention that the most powerful position in the organization is treasurer, because you control the money (laughter).  You, you know, you could sign the checks.  I learned that very well at Howard [University in Washington, D.C.] (laughter).  The president can't sign the checks without the treasurer signing the checks, so it was a very powerful position, so, in terms of class officers.  But then our senior year, when they had only one high school, the--we had already had the elections before they made the decisions to have the high school.  So what they did was, the person who was the president of the student council from the black high school became the vice president of the student council at the white high school when the integrated.  And the person who was president, was like the president, and then they had like second and third vice presidents and stuff like that--excuse me to compensate for the people who were, who were elected to make sure that they had their office.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you--what would be the highlight of your high school career?
Speaker 2: The highlight of my high school career I think was--
Speaker 1: High school life I--
Speaker 2: High school life.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, was being--was knowing that I had a, a coach, white coach who was, who was racist, and I was able to be the, the first black to play quarterback at, at--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --at the high school.
Speaker 1: --quarterback on the football team?
Speaker 2: On the football team, yes, to actually play the position.  I had a couple who they, who they let in practice, but they were never listed on the roster as quarterback, and they never really ran the team as a quarterback, as I did.  My junior year, my sophomore year, and my senior year I switched positions to, to end when they integrated the schools, because they had a really good black quarterback who came over from Lincoln High School, and I knew I wouldn't be starting.  And I wanted to, to play college football, and I figured my only--my best chance would be to be a wide receiver or end, because--they would call 'em ends back then--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--right, so--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --you switched over--
Speaker 2: So I switched over.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I went to the [U.S.] Air Force I perfected it, but that was in  the--my--the highlight, the thing that made me feel the best was I didn't start, no; I didn't play, no; but I was recognized.  And we had our--you know, down, down South, like I said, football is a religion.  And we had our after-game homecoming celebration, and I was announced as the quarterback, and I got a standing ovation from the student body.  I was the only one to get a sto--a standing ovation from the student body.  So that was, that was--I felt a sense of accomplishment.
Story_ID: 95672
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you were on the verge of graduation [from Chapel Hill High School in 1967], were you still focusing on medical technology?
Speaker 2: No, I was, I was kind of confused by then (laughter), did know what to do.  I wanted to go to college, but Vietnam [Vietnam War] was very prominent.  I knew that I had to, I was gonna have to, I was gonna be drafted to go in the military, because I, I couldn't afford to go to college.  So I wasn't sure what I was gonna do, so I decided to--when they saw they're drafting for the Marines, I quickly joined the Air Force (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--now there's a good rationale for joining the Air Force I'm sure, so tell me, tell us what that is as opposed to Marines.
Speaker 2: Well, the Air Force, it, the, they, they are--if you know, there are three major branches of services, which is the Air Force, Army, and Navy, and the Marines are the grunts of the Navy.  They usually go in first, get wiped out first, and then the Navies, and the Navy guys stay on the ship and you know, the fire from the, the boats, from the ships.  And the, the Marines are actually the ones out there doing there fighting, same things with the Army.  And I felt like in the Air Force I would have a better chance of, of surviving, in terms of living.  The life expectancy in Vietnam was very, was, was not very high for Marines and, and Army.  In fact, one of my cousins got shot like three or four times when I was waitin' to go in, you know, and I was like oh, my God.  So that's--and I--in the Air Force I felt--I, I did, based on my research, you know, once you got out, you'd have an--well, while you were in, you had careers; and you, you went in to do a, do a specific job, and when you enlisted, that's what you did; and it was based on test scores.  And in the Army they were sending all the black folks to the fields in '66' [1966] and '67' [1967].  You know, they sent you straight to the infantry.
Story_ID: 95673
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so, well, how was the Marines, how--I mean the--[U.S.] Air Force--
Speaker 2: Air Force?
Speaker 1: --rather, not the Marines (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh no.  Air--
Speaker 1: Where, where were you stationed and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Air Force was great for me.  As I look back at it, it was the best thing that could happen to me.  I went in, and I was in administration so, you know, I wore, I, I wore a suit and tie to work.  And in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, I wasn't gonna wear no suit and tie.  I was still washing dishes.  And after training, I worked in the, in the intelligence division, and I was at Grissom Air Force Base [now Grissom Air Reserve Base], Indiana.  I went--never went to Lackland.  I didn't go to Lackland Air Force Base [near San Antonio, Texas].  I went to Amarillo [Air Force Base in Amarillo, Texas], and then I went to--I stayed at Amarillo for technical training in administration.  I went into, I worked in intelligence for, the intelligence division for about a year and a half.  And then there was an opening in the legal office, in the Judge Advocate General's office, the JAG office.  And one of, this guy was in personnel, and I had done a favor for him and his--for his wife.  I'll never forget that.  You know, if--that's when I, that's when I really learned how the world functions, how deals are done.  Here, this--the major was giving his wife a hard time, the mai--who was a commander.  She worked for the--she was a secretary to the commander.  And the commander liked me because I was a good football player.  I made his, his organization look good, and I was a good basketball player, you know.  And so, you know, he says--so I went in--I, I would go in and talk to him just like he was a buddy.  And I told, I had talked to the guy's wife--I mean husband--and I--so, you know, he was telling me what the problem was.  He was a white guy.  And I went in and talked to him, and he said "Oh, I wasn't aware of that."  So, you know, he quickly changed.  He got a promotion, dah, dah, and you know, everything else, and he said "Man, I owe you forever."  So the position came up and he called me.  He said, "Are you interested in becoming a le--a legal specialist?"  I said "Sure," so I went to training up at Newport [Naval Base], Rhode Island with the--that's, that was my first exposure to Navy life, with the Navy base out--Navy--and the, and the Marines and Air--Army.  We were all in the same quarters.  And Navy life is so different than Air Force life.  In the Air Force we had our own rooms, bunks, you know, beds and everything.  They're, open bay, I mean I--it, it was completely, completely different.  And we had, we had to scrub floors and all that stuff, and we didn't have to do that in the Air Force.  You know, you, you know, you had janitors; you had people cleaning your building, and you had to make your bed and that was it.  And you went to work from eight to five.  There it was different (laughter), you know, so, it was a different type of life.  So I came back into Grissom as a legal specialist.  And I say it was the best thing that happened because the business, one of the businesses I'm in now, which is taxes, I learned how to do that in the Air Force, in, in the legal office.  My responsibility was doing taxes for the wives whose husbands were in Vietnam, primarily, and then the other military people on base.  And I did court reporting, so I learned how to type.  So now I can--so I could, now you know, I type 50, 60 words a minute.  When I qualified for my first position out of college I had to, one of the things I had to do was type.  I (unclear)--I did a (unclear).  So, you know, in terms of the Air Force, I learned how to do business in the Air Force.  I worked, I had a part-time job working in a, in the Airmen's Club, and--I mean in the NCO Club.  And I was, I had experience as a dishwasher, so I was dishwasher in the evening, and then I got promoted up to a cook.  I learned how to cook, and I became, you know, the head cook before I left to go to Korea.  And you know, life works really strange because when I got to Korea, the person who was a manager for the, the Airmen's Club in Korea, I had--was a person who hired me as a dishwasher at Grissom when I was in Indiana.  And I was also on an Air Force, Air Force base in Korea, and I was the night manager of the Airmen's Club.  He made me night manager immediately.  He said, "I know him; I know his capabilities.  You're gonna be the manager, the night manager."  So he had me managing the club, and I was twenty-one years old (laughter).  So, you know, that was my first introduction to, to management.  So I thought that was, that's why I said the Air Force was, was really good, because I learned that; I learned taxes; I learned finances from the lawyers that I worked with; I learned how to read the stock pages; I learned about investments.
Story_ID: 95674
Speaker 1: You asked me if I was a rebel. See, one of the things that you learn about, about life is that racism didn't just exist in the United States.  Racism existed overseas where the military bases were as well.  We had--just before I went to Korea, they sent--a black attorney and I got our orders the same day when they had a riot to go to Korea.  And it was a race riot downtown, right outside gate, main gate.  And one of the things I did was--
Speaker 2: Who was rioting in that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The milit--the soldiers.
Speaker 2: Okay, oh, the soldiers had a race riot (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Within, amongst themselves, the military.  The Air Force guys--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --were--the whites were fighting against the blacks--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --off base over women and stuff like that downtown.  And you know, black women--I mean the, the Korean women--the white, the white guys didn't wanna go out with, with the women that the black guys went out with.  And so the blacks--and then the blacks had a club that they went to, and the whites had a club that they had to.  They were--the clubs were seg--were seg--the social life was segregated over there.  And--
Speaker 2: Just (unclear)--
Speaker 1: And, and (laughter), this is in Korea.  And we had started a, we started the, the Brotherhood Association Servicemen, where we brought everybody together, all the black guys together.  And I used the same model that we used at the Congress of Racial Equality [CORE] and said okay, this is how we can do it.  I formed it.  I did the bylaws and all that stuff for them, you know, set it up.  And that was because of the experience I'd had working with the organiza--civil rights organizations.  And then when the--then we had race riots break out in other parts of Korea.  And because I had--I was instrumental in doing that--I'll never forget--I went to, I wound up going down to Kunsan [K-8] Air Force Base [in Gunsan, South Korea] when they had a riot break out there.  I went to Pusan [East (K-9)] Air Force Base [near Busan, South Korea].  The general, [Major General Robert W.] Malloy, was the general then.  And over there the commanding general for Air Forces Korea.  And he deployed me--I mean he had a--I had used his private jet to fly me to these different bases when they had racial problems.  And I was just, I was a sergeant down in the, in, working, you know, in the legal office.  And in fact, he and I stayed in touch.  We--up until about five years ago.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So, I mean, so that was the, the type of thing that we, we did over there, the social life.  And in Korea, we were able to, you know, bring harmony.  And I'll never forget I made a mistake of printing our strategy and distributing it to the guys.  And it got downtown, and they were like 5,000 civilians, 'cause I, I, I started a boycott, an economic boycott of the town.  It said no blacks are to go downtown.  We're not, we're not gonna go downtown and spend any more at, you know, on anything.  And it, you know, it got, and if they sold--you know, so.  And that was like, terrible.  I was sitting in my office.  Colonel Bowen [ph.] called me up.  He said, "Sergeant, I understand you're behind this."  I said sergeant--I said "I'm, I'm not the president of the organization."  He said "Yeah, but we know that you're the mastermind (laughter).  So, I need you down here at the main gate, and I want you to tell me what we're gonna do to resolve this."
Speaker 2: I assume they've had some, someone assigned to you, I guess, to figure out who's who, you know.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  So, I said, you know.  I, so I went, I was like, why are they calling me?  So I went, I got on my motorcycle and went down there, and I was like "Oh, my God."  He said, "You see what you caused?"  I said "Okay, what's the issue?"  I said "Why don't we go and talk-" I said, "somebody's gotta be their leader."  Then I said, you know, "Let's, let's go and talk to 'em, see what the issue is, and resolve the issue."  So, we went out, we went out--he and I, I went out with Colonel Bowen.  We went over to the, to the gate, and we talked--we took--there was a guy who used to work with me, Mr. Chang [ph.], and in fact, I have a picture of him that I'll show you later.  And we--he was the interpreter, and we talked to him, and we negotiated and said, you know, we apologized and said we're not trying to strangle--it was untended to strangle the community or to have a serious economic impact on the community, but you guys treat black G.I.'s different than you do whites, and we want to be treated equally.
Story_ID: 98049
Speaker 1: So you're finishing up the [U.S.] Air Force story.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then with the--then coming out of the, coming out of the Air Force, I was able to--I had, I had the G.I. Bill, which could pay for me to go to college if I needed it.  In fact, I used it all the way up to doing work towards a Ph.D. (laughter). 'Cause I finished college in two and a half years, so I was able to, to use--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --that money for, for that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how were you able to do that?  Now, now you chose to go to Howard [University in Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did, did you go to Howard immediately when you came back, or did you wait awhile?
Speaker 2: No, I got out of the Air Force October 2nd, 1971, moved to D.C. in December, and February of '72' [1972] I was--I started Howard.  I'd taken a couple of classes while I was in Korea.  And when I was in, when I was in--yeah, so I came back.  I looked at different schools.  I had always wanted to go to Howard because I wanted to be a lawyer.  I still wanted to be a lawyer when I came out, and so I said let me--Howard, at the time, had a joint degree where you could just, you could get a undergraduate and law degree in, I think, six years or something like that.  And so I wanted that, I wanted to participate in that program.  Was it--no, it was business and law, I think that's what it was.  So, that's what I wanted to do.  And so, I, I said well, "How am I gonna do this?"  And you know, as a kid, like I said, I thought I was always a full--ahead of my time.  And I applied to, you know, Winston-Salem State University in North Carolina, and A and T I think--no--yeah, A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, North Carolina], and that was it.  And then I decided I wanted--I said well, (unclear) then I, I didn't apply to Howard immediately because I was told I couldn't get in 'cause my, my--by the time I finished high school [Chapel Hill High School], my grades were not the best in the world.  I think I, I probably had a, a 2.3 or 2.5 or something like that.  So I didn't think--and you had to be in the top half of your class.  And all the white folks were in the top half (laughter), you know.  So--
Speaker 1: A lot of (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, we--I looked at it, but then I went to a football game, where North Carolina Central [North Carolina Central University in Durham, North Carolina] and Howard were playing.  And after the game, I went down to the field and talked to a couple of the players, 'cause I--when I was in the [U.S.] Air Force I played, I played end, and then I, I started playing safety.  I played safety in, in, in high school as well.  And so, I said you know, it looks like you guys need some, some defensive backs.  But, excuse me--with a lot of speed, so.  And the guy said yeah, man, we, we are, you know, we're trying to recruit.  So I walked over, introduced myself to the head coach, you know, Coach Tillman Sease.  I said, "Coach Sease," you know, "my name is Herman Foushee, and I'm interested in coming to Howard.  I play defensive back.  If you want me to send you some tapes, I could send you some tapes of my playing in Korea or whatever you wanna see," or--he said, "Son, you look like a, you look like you're telling me the truth, so I'll tell you what: call me in my office on Monday, and I'll send--make sure you have an application, and I'll get your application processed."  I called him--I didn't realize I was calling the, the lar--one of the, the largest universities in the country, you know, and talking directly to the head coach.  So I called Coach Sease.  He gave me his telephone number and everything right there.  I called him and he answered his phone--(unclear)--call him collect, so I called him collect.  And two days later, or two or three days later I had my application and filled it out.  I sent it to him, and about two weeks later I got my acceptance letter.  And he said, "If you make the team, depending on how well you do, there may be some scholarship money available for you."  So I said mm, and so I came in first, then I, then I, I spent that sum--you know, that spent the whole time, you know, weight training, getting ready for, for the season.  My whole focus was on academics and football, very little social life at Howard, if you can believe it, the first semester, because I have, you know, spring training was coming up after the first six weeks of class.
Story_ID: 98050
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: So you started [Howard University in Washington, D.C.] in the spring?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we started in the spring.  I went to spring training and wound up, and wound up doing very well, and I got a scholarship, football scholarship, as a result, as a safety.  And then, midway through the season I was switched to cornerback, so, and that was that, that, what that did was took advantage of--[clearing throat]--of my ability to play safety, as well as when I played end in high school.  I, I knew how to cover--how to, how to rush the quarterback because they used to--and, and how to protect the outside, which was a safety responsibility--which was a responsibility of the cornerback.  So, I was moved there, and then, and, and did that, and received a bunch of nagging injuries, so I never really got to play.  And then that first year, you know, I was, and I was considered a, a freshman coming in, but I was really, by the end of the first semester, I was, I was a sophomore.  And after I finished that, that year, I decided to go into student government, and (unclear), and got elected class president, which meant that I was on the student council and all of those things.  So it was--I didn't--so, and then I, you know, I just concentrated on academics and went to summer school.  The next thing I know, I'm graduating.  And I was like, do I go to law school now still, or do I go to--what do I do?
Story_ID: 98051
Speaker 1: Now who were the, who were some of the teachers at Howard [University in Washington, D.C.] that impressed you or helped you, 'cause you, you got through pretty quick, so I guess you didn't have a lot of trouble.  So it must have been some, some, some people who really helped you out.
Speaker 2: Yes, professor--I remember Sharon Banks.  In fact, she's an attorney there in the legal office, legal department up there now.  Lee Calhoun was one of my professors, and he's, he's, coincidentally he's one of my business associates now; [HM] Dr. [Ronald] Walters, Dr. Osuku [ph.]; there were, you know, there were several people in, several of the instructors in the political science department who really helped me a lot while I was there.  And in the business school, and I remember Bert Smith, who was the person who was in charge of the--he taught accounting.  He taught me Accounting I.  He taught me basic accounting.  He said nobody makes A's in his class, but I made an A in his class, so it was a real big challenge for him.  In the business school was really where I, I got my niche, because in order to graduate early, I had--I went into Howard with a triple major, political science, psychology, and business.  You know, people will say--'cause I couldn't decide, 'cause you know, you say, you know, you, you can be a better lawyer if you know this, if you do this, if you do this you can pass the different exams.  And that was my whole focus.  But then when I realized that I was able to graduate, I had to drop the two majors, two majors, and I could only have one major and two minors.  So, that's what I did.  And back then, as long as you were on the honor roll you could take as many classes as, as you wanted to, so that's how I was able to come out early.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I take 25 hours a semester sometimes, you know, 23, 27.
Story_ID: 98052
Speaker 1: When you were at Howard [University in Washington, D.C.], did--I mean at this stage--I mean when did you start your association with Howard University radio [WHUR]?
Speaker 2: When--that was in, that was in 1990.
Speaker 1: Okay, so much later then, through them days?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear).  Okay, so, well, what did you do--I mean, you went on to business school at, at, at Howard--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I was in, I was, I was at undergraduate at, at Howard, and then I went to graduate school in the business and, and public administration.  And I had my--since my, my major was not business in undergrad, I didn't feel comfortable with the MBA program, so I took--I did the MPA program, which is a Master of Public Administration.  The difference was three--four--courses: Econ. III, IV, and Quantitative Business Analysis III and IV (laughter).  I'd have never got out of school.  But--so I, I didn't--I did the Master in Public Administration and Public Policy, and that coincided with my career, because at the time, I was working in the government at the National Bureau of Standards [now National Institute of Standards and Technology] while I went to graduate school.
Story_ID: 98053
Speaker 1: Okay, now you had a succession of government positions (unclear)--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: What were some of the positions?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I started out as a, as a management intern with the National Bureau of Standards [now National Institute of Standards and Technology], where I rotated through different organizations to learn how to become an administrator.  They were trying to determine--you know, they were trying to put you in either accounting, budget, management and organizational behavior, or personnel.  I rotated through accounting, and that was not very challenging for me.  And you know, they--when you--when people think of you as an intern, they don't think of giving you substantive work.  So, I remember his little redneck guy from Frederick, Maryland, saying--up in the Bureau of Standards said--John McGuffin's his name--he said, "Well, we got something that we know he can't do."  They were doing a space plan.  They were gonna relocate people in their office.  And so they said well, we'll, we'll let him try this, and so I sat down with the, with the architect.  And he said "Well, I guess you'll have this finished in about two weeks."  He said "We'll, we'll need this in two weeks because we wanna go ahead with the plan."  So I said "Okay."  I said you know, "just tell me what it is you want, and give me the parameters, and I'll figure out how to get--I'll get some people to help me with it or figure out how to get it done."  So, I sat down, I worked on it, and the next day, I had the floor plan completed.  I went in to John, and I called Rich, who was the architect, and I went over to see Rich and showed it to him.  And he looked at it and he's like, this is perfect, (laughter) he said "Who did this?"  I said "I did."  So he went up to--and he told the guy who was in char--who was like the associate director of the bureau that I had done this.  So the guy said "I wanna meet him."  He wanted to meet me.  So he I went up to meet--his name was Dr. Howard Sorrows.  I went up to meet with Dr. Sorrows, and he said I want--he said (unclear)--you know, we had a long discussion about vision, about life and things that he wanted to do.  He said you know, "I want you to work for me in my organization."  He said I'm a saud-"I want to start a state and local government program in long--in the Office of Long Range Planning.  And I think that, you know, with your, with your political science background, you could be a major asset for that program," so I said "Okay."  So I went down, and I talked to the--I was still assigned to personnel, Office of Personnel handled all of the in--management interns.  So, I went down to, to see Dale Houston [ph.], who was the, our intern coordinator and, and the chief of staffing for the Bureau of Standards.  And Dale said "Well, no, we can't--we don't wanna do that.  We don't wanna see you take a risk of taking the job with him.  Why don't you remain as an intern, and then if things don't work out, we can still--we can move you to someplace else?"  So I, I said "Yeah, okay."  I said "Well, I think you need to talk to Dr. Sorrows about this."  So he, doctor--he called Dr. Sorrows and said "Well, you know, he's fresh out of college.  He doesn't know this."  You know, he's (unclear) this black boy can't do this.  He didn't say that, but you know, that was the tone, general tone.  So we--you know, so Dr. Sorrows and I, you know, set the office up, and I had every--I had the office set up, and I started establishing contacts and things this--things that they needed.  And you know, so he said, he, so he said look, "I'm hiring him."  So he hired me on his payroll, and--
Speaker 1: That makes sense--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: Everybody--
Speaker 2: It did, rather than being carried on overhead.  So he hired me as a program analyst, and I worked there and set up the state and local government program.  And then after I was on--so, it was a sweet deal.  You know, Dr. Sorrows I must admit gave me as sweet, sweet deal, with all that I had gone through in trying to get to where I wanted to go.  He said "All I want you to do is make good grades."  He said "You can--you don't--you know, if you need to take classes during the day, you know, it's fine.  We'll just give you administrative leave."  And I then remember one summer I didn't even go to work for three weeks--six weeks, six weeks.  All I did was go to school.  And I went to, you know, I went to--I had--I took three classes I think.  And every day I went to class, went to the library, then after I came, gave him three A's, and he was happy.  And I continued there, and when I finished, and then when I finished school, you know, I felt like I had really kind of peaked.
Story_ID: 98054
Speaker 1: And I always believe in moving out on a high note so I left there [the National Bureau of Standards, now National Institute of Standards and Technology], and while I was working for him [Dr. Howard Sorrows], I was at a conference, and I got recruited by Public Technology, Incorporated.  That's the technology arm of the National League of the cities, the U.S. Conference for Mayors, International City Management Association, the National Association of Counties and all those public interest groups.  So, I worked with them.  I worked with big cities, so I got to use my public administration knowledge there.  At the same time, I set up my tax and financial management business [Foushee's Tax and Financial Management Services] here.  So, this was in 199-1977 [sic, he founded his business in 1978], so it-- everything started to really propel when I, once I finished grad school [Howard University in Washington, D.C.].  That's when I bought the house as my graduation present to myself, and you know, decided to use the office here as, for my tax business, and then tax and financial management, and then went to work for Public Technology.  And you know, I'll never forget the guy who was the director of personnel's--'cause I was still, I still had not finished school when I left.  And he was trying to say that I had to pay back--had to pay for my--pay the government back, 'cause the government--I was on the G.I. Bill, plus the government was paying my tuition, and plus I was getting paid full salary as a, as a junior executive in the government.  So, if you're wondering how I was able to buy a house when I finished grad school (laughter)--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So--
Speaker 2: --(unclear) allowed to keep all that money.  I mean that was real money, not just a transfer between the government and the (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Right, that was real money, 'cause tui--the government paid tuition.  I had took down there and paid my tuition for George Washington University, American University, Howard, University of Maryland, wherever I went, because Howard was in the consortium university for the city [Washington, D.C.], so I went to all the different universities.  And so, as, as long as I made good grades, they--he really--they really didn't care.  So it was, like I said, it was a sweet, sweet deal.  And then I spent a year or so with Public Technology.  There were four black professionals out of a staff of like fifty, and we all had the same story, you know, and we're all still buddies now, in senior-level positions.  And in fact, one is, one of my colleagues, who was next door to me, is now the deputy director for (unclear)--we--I know the chief, chief executive officer for the D.C. Department of Health, Ron Lewis.  And so, we--you know, it's a big racist organization, so in the meantime I recruited to come to work in the--by one of the gentlemen who was working for [President] Jimmy Carter in the White House.  And they got me a position over--in, intergovernmental relations with the U.S. Department of Energy.  So I worked for the, the deputy assistant secretary for energy for, until Jimmy Carter lost his election in 1980, for, for two years.  And then after that, I went over to work in Health and Human Services as a small business advisor, and I left.  I did that for four years.
Story_ID: 98055
Speaker 1: And then after that, I came to--left the federal government and came to the district government, [Washington] D.C. government, where I was chief of child support; I was in charge of child support, Child Support and Paternity Enforcement for, for D.C.
Speaker 2: Now that's a position that probably got a lot of criticism--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter)--
Speaker 2: --that's when those laws were changing and--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, they were.
Speaker 2: --had the--
Speaker 1: We buckled down, and, and I was very serious about child support.  I mean the--I'll never forget one the criticisms was that they said you know, "You don't have any children so how could you really do this job?"  I said do, I said "Do you have to rob a bank to know how much--that there's money there (laughter)," you know.  So, you know, they, they (unclear)--that was--but you know, people think that just because--so I--but, but I said, you know, "This is a business, and what you wanna do is run this as a business.  Your job here is to collect money.  You're a collection agency for people who are not paying child support, and that's what you--that's what this is about.  And collection agency is a business," so I, I ran it set up as a business.  I got burned out after three years.  That was, that was probably, that was a very har--that was a very difficult experience, to say the least, because it was a no win situation.  And then the office was reporting to an administrator who was, was a, a sheer Uncle Tom, one who thought that, believed that white boys are the only ones who could do anything.  And we used to, we used to go at it.  And why I'll never forget, I had 17--this is in Washington, D.C., in 1984.  I had 17 people in the organization out of 145 to 160, depending on the time period, who did not have high school educations.  And I tried to set up a program so that they could get a high school degree.  And he, and a few other people, knocked it out; they wouldn't let it happen.  They told 'em they should--'cause I was gonna set it up.  Because since I had been given the opportunity to go to school during the day, I was--you know, you know, we could do it, they could go during the day or--and then take some classes in the evening.  So you felt like they should have evening classes, you know.  So they--so it was--and these, you know, these were a lot of single parents, head of household, and this is their only source of income.  And you know, so, you know, we're talking about trying to help black folks, you know, get ahead.  You know, so they should have been--they said they should have been qualified when they were hired, you know.  So his white boys wouldn't approve the budget.  He had a white guy who was in charge of the budget, Gary, Gary whatever his name is.  But, yeah, so child support--and you know, you had an organization where you had people who were not qualified to do their jobs.  And it's we--although we went--when I took the organization over, it was number 53 in the country, and within 18 months we were number 46 in collections.  I mean we'd, we had done better than West Virginia and a couple of other states in our region.  So, in, in, in, instead of the, the staff did everything they could to make things happen and to make it successful, but they--they didn't have the support of the administration above so made it very difficult.
Story_ID: 98056
Speaker 1: After that, I went to the Office of Internal Audit and Contract Monitoring--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and the Commission on Social Services.  Huh?  With the city?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: With the, with the Commission on Social Services, right.
Speaker 2: Now you were, you were, worked for the city during the [HM Mayor] Marion Barry Administration.
Speaker 1: Yes, I did.
Speaker 2: Do you have any observations about him?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, he's--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --he's a, he--
Speaker 2: --such a controversial figure (unclear).
Speaker 1: He is, isn't he?  But Marion Barry is a, is a, he is a great man.  First of all, he was competent.  Nobody knows a city budget better than Marion Barry knew the budget.  Nobody knew the city.  He was committed to doing the right things for people.  He--in terms of government contracting, he made--they call Mitchellville, "Barryville," Mitchellville, Maryland, which is a suburban upclass citizen, because he made sure that black received a certain amount of, of government dollars, government contracts, and these people became millionaires, lots of them did.  He--
Speaker 2: Now that, that's something that I've heard quite a bit, that he made sure that African Americans got a fair share of, of the, of contracts.
Speaker 1: Like 35 percent, 35 percent, and he, he was committed to that.  He's a kind of, he's, he's, he's the kind of person who would give you the shirt off of his back, you know, and very smart.  He, and, and he had, he had a vision for the city.  The downtown that we see now was his plan.  He'll never get credit for it, but this was his plan.  And he, he started downtown development.  Uptown, the U Street Corridor, he, he insisted that the government building at 14th and U be there.  He said "This is gonna be the anchor building.  We're talking about changing our neighborhood.  This is gonna be the way we do it.  We're gonna put the government employees here, very nice elaborate building, 14th and U."  Now, U Street Corridor is one of the more prominent areas of Washington, D.C.  Property value is very high.
Speaker 2: A tough area over there--
Speaker 1: Oh, very tough area.
Speaker 2: --on U Street.
Speaker 1: Right.  And what, you know, and what, unfortunately what was, with Marion, you know, he, what he did was--now, his personal life was--is the only thing that people remember, but--
Speaker 2: One of the more prominent citizens in Washington [D.C.] said that Marion Barry had the poorest personal judgment of any human being he ever met.
Speaker 1: Well, he got, he, he--
Speaker 2: Do you agree with that or--
Speaker 1: Poorest personal judgment of any--I, I wouldn't say all that.
Speaker 2: No?
Speaker 1: But I would say that, what I would say is that he did not exercise judgment, you know, when I think he should have.  And I, I would never go that far.  I think that there are cert--you know, we--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --we, we--
Speaker 2: --is that he--
Speaker 1: We all do--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --no, we, we all do things, okay, and--
Speaker 2: I, I think his point was he was already under surveillance, and he knew he was.  And people were on the--you know, trying to get him actually.  And he kind of stepped in, you know, as if he didn't--he knew it.  He would even articulate it and then do things to, to make sure that he was, you know, caught in a compromising position.
Speaker 1: Well, I think he had, like, like, like any of us, he had, he had an appetite for certain things.  And when his appetite aroused, he responded to it.  I, I think that's probably the, the best way to put it.  I would hate to try to judge, to judge it because I'm the last person to judge somebody.  I, you know, I know I'm not perfect, and I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, so, and I've done some misjudging things, and some poor--some things that somebody would call poor judgment if they knew about it, you know.  But because nobody knows but me or whoever else was around, then there's nobody else to say it.  But I would say that he--I don't think that in the last time he got ready to run for, for city council--I had just met with him that day because I was gonna be the treasurer for his campaign.  And so, you know, I must--I was shocked when I, when I heard about it.  You know, I was like "What?"  You know, and I don't think that he realized that he was being watched.  You know, he's just an ordinary person, and that's all he wanted, ever wanted to be, and--but unfortunately, when you are disliked by certain people, that's what's gonna happen to you.  You know, you always gotta watch your back.
Story_ID: 95683
Speaker 1: Yeah, so how long were you in this [with the Washington, D.C. city government]?
Speaker 2: I was with this--I started in '84' [1984] in June, and I retired in December of set--of '98' [1998], so 14, 14 years.
Speaker 1: Now, now one aspect we hadn't discussed is your media presence as, as a voice of financial reason on (laughter)--start WHUR in 1990s (unclear), '90 [1990] to--
Speaker 2: You know, actually, let's see, there was--okay, '95 [1990] to '95 [1995] was WDC.  Can we stop the tape for a quick second?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can.
Speaker 2: I just wanna at--
Speaker 1: (STOP TAPE)
Speaker 2: [W]HUR was 10 years before that.
Speaker 1: Well, it was five years before that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Five years before that.
Speaker 1: And I did it for ten years, so I guess I did--
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987]?
Speaker 1: From '80', 1980 I did WHUR.  I did the Tax Tips tax program for WHUR on air and tape from 1980 to 1990.  And then from 1991 to '96', 1996, I hosted a business program with WDCU [FM].  The name of the, of the show was "Business Digest."  And I would--it, it was--I would interview and discuss all aspects of business, starting a business--how to go into business, start a business, conceptualize a business, different forms--form business, business formations, and I would bring in authors of books who, who--which were business related.  I would bring in public figures, interview them, and anybody that was, that did anything in relationship to business.  It was a talk show, and it was for--it was during the evening drive.  And it was, it was very well recognized show.
Speaker 2: You had like a radio version of "Minority Business Report," but more frequent and--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --emanating locally with the issues.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  We talked about everything.  But it was--I, I, I kept--I tried to keep the program at an eighth grade level so that--although most of the listeners of WDCU, the predominant listeners were upper class, wealthy people.
Speaker 2: Now we're talking about WDCU--
Speaker 1: It's--
Speaker 2: This is the University of District--
Speaker 1: University of District of Columbia in Washington, D.C., right.  Most of them were upper class. It's a jazz station, and they had the different programs.  They had the legal show, business show, music theater show, yeah, so, you know, different, different types of shows of interest to people.  Once that was a, that was their commitment to the, you know, to the community.  And we, you know, and we really got into it.  It was, it was a volunteer position.  I didn't get paid to do it, and I did it, yeah, for five years, almost every week (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In fact, I get, I get the itch sometimes and wanna get back into it.
Story_ID: 95684
Speaker 1: Now, now what are--tell, tell us some of the highlights of, of your tenure during that.  You--I'm supposedly--you know, you got some feedback from the community that was (unclear)--doing, (unclear)--
Speaker 2: The, oh, the high--it--they was they, they found it to be very--a lot of people who were already in business listened to the show because they found they learned something.  And being a, a business person myself and not just a journalist, there was an advantage because I knew the right questions to ask, and most times I knew the answer before I asked the question.  And I would be able--I would sit down with the guest before the show and go over the questions to make sure that they knew the answers, and they were prepared, and there were no surprises.  But the feedback was that it was a topnotch show.  They, they--it was like the number one show for that evening drive, on--it was on Thursdays originally, and then our programming was so good they moved it to Friday--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: -for an hour.  It was a half hour, then they moved to, to Friday for an hour.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your guests, and what were some of your topics?
Speaker 2: Top--I had, I had a slew of, of national guests, and most of 'em were, were authors, people who had written books.  The topics would be on, you know, economics today, the different things that are going on in the stock market, finance and you, how you should invest, what you should do, how you should--what--you know, how do you go into business, what you should do in business.  I've brought Vinny Jameson [ph.] in.  I remember he was at, in the Office of Corporations to tell people about how to set up a corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship, which (unclear) would be the advantages and disadvantages.  I would bring in tax experts to talk about different taxi issues.  We would talk about management issues, you know, employee issues - how do you manage employees--different personnel issues, retirement planning.  I got my--the most, the, the most lively of feedback shows I did were when we did--when I did the ones on credit, you know, repairing credit.  And people were really, really got into that--
Speaker 1: It's a--
Speaker 2: --or in real estate.  We talked about real estate, real estate sales, purchases, and emerging trends in real estate.  So those were the, the highlights of the, the, the topics that I remember most.  And I focused on those, and the things that we got the most response from, I would try to do more frequently, but not saturate the audience, if you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would take it to--and you know, like let's--for example, if we're--if I had an author in this week who was talking about--who had written a book on how to manage employees, the next time I would have a, something on motivating employees, and you know, try not to be redundant and do the same show.  We never--I try not to do the same show twice, ever, which made it very challenging.
Story_ID: 95685
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--okay what kind of advice would you give, for instance, to someone who say their starting up a, a business, and they, they need--say they had--they need ten employees to make this work.  And would you advise them to disregard the State Department labor laws and push their employees (laughter), really because they're starting up, or would you advise 'em to take it easy on 'em in the beginning, or what would be your advice here?
Speaker 2: My advice would be first to set up a, is to set up a corporation, then get, get the business form, get a payroll company, is the first you do, is get a payroll company so that the taxes are withheld, etc.  See, thing that people don't realize going into business is that it's not the technical competence that run people out of business.  It's generally IRS who run people out of business, and it's not employee taxes, withholding employee taxes.  It is the 941 statutory taxes, which is a quarterly tax reporting for social security and Medicare; that's what kills people; that's what runs people out of business.  I was meeting with a client just the other day who has the, the IRS problem of, you know, two--owes IRS $200,000 dollars for money that was withheld from employees, but he spent for other things trying to keep his business afloat, but that--but you don't do that.  That's called statutory taxes, and they gon'--and if the corporation--even if the corporation goes out of business, the only time, the only, only time that a person is not protected by a corporation is with, is with the 941 statutory taxes.  So I would, in terms of saying that somebody should be a, a consultant, or they should be on payroll and as a what do they call it when they give you a 1099, and you're not an employee--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --no benefits--
Speaker 1: --contractor.
Speaker 2: --contractor, you know, you're not a--if you go to the same place in business and you do the same thing, you're not a contractor, you're an employee.  And what happens is that person who is the contractor is the one who suffers.  They think they're getting all their money up front.  But when it comes to tax time, they get those 1099s, they're gonna have to offset that income and pay taxes.  They don't have an, an employer who's matching half of their social security.  They're paying it all when they file their taxes.  And next thing is health insurance, which is very expensive, life insurance.  And employer should take care of that for employees.  That should be a part of that benefits package.  But if they hire somebody as a contractor, as a contract employee, then they, they, they don't get those benefits.  You don't get vacation time, you know.  So, I would say: bring on a payroll company; set your business up; and don't--make sure that all of the laws are followed because you can get closed down for--and, and, and get your license--proper licensing because you can get closed down for any of those violations, no matter who you are or how well you're performing, you know.  They don't care who you are (laughter).  You're just a number.  You have an employee identification number, and that's the only thing that matters.
Story_ID: 95686
Speaker 1: (Unclear) story, this closedown story has been repeated over and over and over again in the black community and especially when you had the big rush of small business startups in the early '70's [1970s], I think.  There's a tremendous number that started up.  President [Richard] Nixon was funding black capitalism, he called it, and you know subsidizing startups of black businesses.  And those programs largely ended up failing.  What--
Speaker 2: Were there other capital (unclear), first of all.  When you, when you go into business--and the other thing that I would do is do a business plan.  And with a business plan, it's, you know, it's states the purpose of the business, tells you what you're gonna do, who's involved in the business, their qualifications, who your competition is.  You have to do a breakeven analysis, which shows how much money you're gonna need, and it's gonna--you're gonna do a cash flow projection.  What happened to those programs is these people were not doing business plans, or they were doing phony business plans just to get the money to get started.  You know, sometimes people are just so excited to go into business, especially if somebody is gonna give 'em some money, but they don't take the time to plan how they're gonna do it.  And once they do--once they get into it, they find themselves too far gone to, to turn around.  And next thing you know, the doors are closing because what did, what did they do.  They have a program, okay, we're gonna give you $20,000 dollars to open up a starter restaurant.  You can't start no restaurant on $20,000 dollars, but people were trying that, you know, try a clothing store.  But my recommendation, especially as we go out in the first few years of 2000, is to look at service-oriented businesses, video productions, film production, consulting, business management consulting, you know, those types of things.  You want to go into a business that's gonna require--that's not gonna, that's not gonna expensive to get into, first of all.  You know, when you're doing web (unclear), web, web design, consulting, all those things, all you need is, you can use your, you can use your bedroom of your house if you need to, to do it, because--until you have customers coming in and you know, getting your business set up.  You know, the worst thing you can do is go out, rent office space, buy furniture, etc., and so on, before you have income.  And that's what a lot of people were doing back in the early '70's [1970s].  (Unclear) in our community, we knew what they were doing, right, and they would go out, they were gon' buy that new house, go buy that Cadillac, go down to the store, get 'em--go and buy--go get them a woman on the side that they gotta support, you know, and you know, they--so they got, they have what they call the, the new entrepreneur life.
Speaker 1: Yeah, had the lifestyle without the--
Speaker 2: Without the cash (laughter).  They had champagne taste and beer wallet.  Now, so, that would, that would be my advice to them.
Story_ID: 95687
Speaker 1: And one of, one of the things that--I was the, you know, the first black pres--first president of the National Black M.B.A. [Master's in Business Administration] Association for, for [Washington] D.C. back in 1978.  Well, the plaque is right behind you.  In '78' [1978] to '80' [1980] is when I was in office.  And one of the things that we did was the members of the organization started to invest in businesses.  And you know, we bought liquor stores, and some of 'em bought nightclubs and stuff like that.  And you know, we work; we made money; and most of the time we lost money.  But, you know, you learn that you are not all--that everything you learn in the classroom is not--is that there are gonna be some things missing that you're gonna need to learn, and that's called learning life, learning life.  And those life experiences and will--you know, you hope not to make the same mistake again.  When, you know, when you--when we--when you look at it, one of the things that we had with the--was the key to surviving in Washington, D.C., is networking, establishing a good network, and a support system.  And then when you're an executive in this town and--or if you start making money in this town, become--you become very lonely because you have a lot of sharks; you have a lot of people shooting at you, and a lot of people are jealous of you.  And you have to be very careful who you surround yourself with or who you associate yourself with.  And you know, I--when you--if you see pictures, the same people who I had as friends, most of 'em in 1977 through 1980 are the same people who I have as friends now.  I did not enlarge my circle.  I'm very particular, and that's how I was able to survive working in the (unclear)--working with, you know, working for [HM] Marion Barry, you know.  A lot of people had new friends.  People want something.  If you're in power, they want what you have, or they just want to be around you.  I didn't allow that.  I didn't--you know, I had my little MBA friends, association friends, and you know, other buddies who I (unclear) with.  But very few people did I socialize with, you know, in my house, maybe go to their house from to time.  But I would have parties and folks would come over, but for the most part, no.  And that was my defense mechanism.  That's how I protected myself and insulate myself from what I considered the undesirables, you know, 'cause they're--you know, people will use you, if you let 'em.  And they will lie on you, and whatever they can do to get you in a position, a compromising position, they will.  You know, they, they, they have the thing that most people are greedy.  You know, when you've had somebody like Dr. [Howard] Sorrows, to pay for your education and you know, other people who've been--you know, Coach [Tillman] Sease, who give you a football scholarship--I mean to give you an opportunity to earn a football scholarship, and you know, you, you look back and, and you, you say "What do these people want from me?  Are they--what are they deserving of?  Why are they around?  Are they gonna be around tomorrow?  No," you know.  Why do they have six hinges on a casket instead of twenty?  Because you're not gonna have-how many friends in your life that you're gonna be with?
Speaker 2: Okay, (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I'm sorry.  I get off--I got off--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--well, that's a, you know, that's something that I know is profound to anybody making any money today--I mean those are--
Story_ID: 95688
Speaker 1: I'm reminded of--what you say makes me think about the athletes when they get these huge contracts.  Most of them are kids, and they get all this money, and they gotta be able to manage that money, you know, hold onto it.  And yet, they're not even old enough to develop a cadre of friends that are loyal (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And is it--
Speaker 1: --(unclear), you know.
Speaker 2: You're right, and the sad thing about it is that--I don't know if you ever read--if you read in the--in the "Washington Post" they have a section called "For the Record."  And in there, almost every day a former basketball or football player, who was making big money years ago, is in there for being arrested because he's trying to maintain the lifestyle he was maintain--that he was when he was an athlete or when he was in college.  And you're exactly correct.  One of the things, and that's one of my criticisms of, of Michael Jordan, you know, they, black athletes, first thing they do is run out and hire a white person as their lawyer or--and as their financial person.  Do you think they care about you?  No.  We black professionals, you know, give, you know, that extra touch because, you know, because of the, the nurturing way that we're, that we're born and the way we grow up.  We have a tendency to, to give a lot more, and we're concerned because they're one of us.  We're not in it for the money, you know.  Most black professionals can make a lot more money.  We could charge a lot higher fees than we do, but we don't because we are giving back at the same time, you know.  And a lot of us, you know, and a lot of us, and I'll, and I'll say, talk, speak about some of my colleagues who I associate with, you know, we're not greedy, you know.  We could manage if we, if, if we can manage--I have, I have several non, non-black clients, you know, and I manage their money.  Why can't, why can't black folks manage black folks money when they get a lot of money, you know?  And the other thing is, you know, keeping them out of trouble.  You know, John Thompson, coach of Georgetown University [Washington, D.C.], who is now a talk show host and a, and a broadcaster, was very good at that.  You have never read about any of his athletes getting in trouble, any of the athletes that he coached.  Why?  He had an academic.  He was probably the only coach at a majority white school that had an academic advisor that traveled with the team.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) I remember that.  Did you think the reason why he didn't go into the pro coaching level is because he knew he couldn't, couldn't exercise that same control over the players on the, on the (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That, or, he probably made more money staying her, not--they had 83 games in the pros.  Here they only had 26--20, 25, 26 games.  You know, he didn't have to--you know, I, I think that he, he, he wanted to be a, a big fish in a small pond, you know.  In the college ranks he was the man.  And I don't know if he even wanted to be bothered with the, the, all the things that go along with that.  I don't think everybody aspire to go to the next level, what they consider the next level.  You know, I don't consider it the next level.  I consider it a different business opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause I, I just wondered if (unclear)--Allen Iverson, a young man like him, you know, what--how would you keep him out of trouble with all those millions of dol--I mean it would be hard to exercise that kind of oversight.
Speaker 2: Right, he was one of the few that went to Georgetown, and he didn't do it--he didn't get in trouble while he was at Georgetown.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He got in trouble when he was, when he was playing up in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: You got that.
Speaker 2: And his stemmed from a domestic dispute, you know.  It was--
Speaker 1: And so he may have not very well been able to handle himself on some level.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Once--I think that, that he learned from George [sic, John] Thompson how to control his temper some, how to be treated as a man, and he--you gotta remember, he left school early, so he didn't get the full flavor that John Thompson had to give while he was at Georgetown.
Story_ID: 95689
Speaker 1: Now let me shift gears a little bit and ask you about, this is often our business in the black community.  Many people in the black community watch daily as members of the Arab community or the Korean community or other Asian communities or, or--and other people period come into the black community and set up business that seem to, that seem to take off, you know, using the same clientele base that black business had.  And you know, the, there's a lot of--there's a whole body of speculation as to how these people are able to sustain businesses in our community when we don't seem to be able to do it, you know, or, or--and you know--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --it's almost like a conspiracy theory, you know, like (unclear)--a conspiracy theories (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It goes, it, it goes, in my opinion, it goes back to a slave mentality, the "white is right" mentality.  We, first of all, a lot of times, you know, a black person--I was talking to somebody about this the other day--will rob another black person quicker than they will a white person.  You know, they will steal from another black person quicker than they will a white person.  So, when you transfer--when you translate it, take it from the streets into their business.  They have no--first of all, they don't respect a black business person.  They just wanna--they look at him as one of them.  They don't look at him as a business person, and they figured they, they have the money, and the can afford it.  And also I go back to they're undercapitalized when they go in, into the community.  Koreans, whites, and others pool their resources, and they have several different--and Vietnamese--they, they don't--it's not just one person who has the money to come in and set up the business; you're talking groups of 10, 20, and 1 person's out front, same thing with housing, look at it.  In a Hispanic neighborhood, they could sleep 10, 15, 20 in a house, but black folks, everybody gotta have their own bedroom (laughter).  So, so--
Speaker 1: A sense of entitlement.  We've been here so long, we--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --is that, is that what it is, a sense of entitlement (laughter).  But--and--but they're able to come in and set up the businesses because black folks support other than their own, you know.  And I go back to the Michael Jordans of the world, the Kobe Bryants of the world.  I, I will guarantee you that Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Shaq [Shaquille O'Neal], none of those guys who are making multimillion dollars have black professionals managing their money, and as their legal counsel, and as their agent.  I'll be willing to bet on that one, and I'm not a betting man, but I'll be willing to bet on that.  And that is a lack of confidence that they have.  And quite frankly, you know, it's--you know, they--it's a mentality and it's--as we--as you know, we're all a part of our acculturation process.  So, everything that we've seen and do, that reflects us, and that's where they are, and--
Speaker 1: Just to chime in on that, I, I guess.  The few that have hired black professionals I know are well known for having done that, which makes them an exception rather than a rule, like a Patrick Ewing, or [William] Bill Russell at a certain point in his life, Craig Hodges.  He used to be with the [Chicago] Bulls--
Speaker 2: Right, and then they're losing money, like a Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did, wound up broke.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, he was a Muslim.  He hired a white boy to manage his money (laughter).
Speaker 1: He lost it.
Speaker 2: And lost it.  They just took it from him, you know.  Look at all, and look at all those heavy fees that they're paying these guys.  Why can't they, why can't they hire a black professional to do this?  If, if, if they don't wanna hire a black person, then you know, they're not gonna buy from a black person.
Speaker 1: Is it, is it also because of the, the network of associates that are--I mean the, the sports agents, for instance, are typically lawyers, and they know each other, and they know the, the, the team owners, and they know--I mean, and it's hard to get in there--
Speaker 2: Sports agents are coming out.  They, they, they meet these guys coming out of college.  They have black sports agents.  They have blacks who have went to, who have gone to the University of North Carolina [at Chapel Hill] who are sports agents.  They have blacks who go to University or Arizona [Tucson, Arizona] who are sports agents.  They have blacks who have gone to Florida State [University in Tallahassee, Florida] who are sports agents, University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland].  But they think that the white boy or the, or the Jew guy can get them more money.
Speaker 1: Now there's another--I mean when you look at the--I think it was a conception that when, say a Palestinian comes over and opens a liquor store in a black community, and a Korean opens a nail shop, that they have just--that they somehow have come right out of the desert or right out of the rice fields to do this.  Is this, is this correct?
Speaker 2: That's not correct.  They have been planning this a long time.  And most of the time they, they have done this back in their own country before they get here, and this is not news to them.  They--most of them are attorneys, doctors or whatever, but they can't practice here because of American standards.  They won't let 'em in.  And I think that they have, they do business plans, they work together, and the pool their resources.  They--and people think that government gives them a lot of money to do this.  Government doesn't give them any money.  They use their family money.  They, they will refinance their house and take equity out to do it.  A black person don't wanna do that, 'cause they don't wanna risk losing their house if the business don't, if the business doesn't go well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 95690
Speaker 1: So what would you--you said, you said that you had prescribed for black people trying to get involved in small businesses now to get involved in the service industry.
Speaker 2: Yes, because it, it requires very low capitalization.  It requires less money to get in, and you're able to use the skills that you have.  Then that's what you, that's what you're selling.  And in doing that, you--there are a lot of doors that are open to us now that weren't open before in this industry.  So I would definitely do that.  And you should--and they should start their own business, set it up and run it, because you know, if, if they haven't tried it, they don't know how it's gonna work.  But I would definitely recommend that.  Because you don't wanna carry inventory.  You don't wanna buy machinery, all those things.  You know, then you gotta worry about 'em breaking, you know, so you gotta call a repair man in and all that stuff.  You know, it's better to just go ahead and set it up that way.
Speaker 1: Now it seems, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like we--our strength, businesswise, has been in personal services, personal care, like funeral homes, or beauty parlors, barber shops.  But it seems like these industries seem to be sliding away now.  I know the cosmetics industry and hair care industry, the, the production part of that, seems to be sliding away with the decline of SoftSheen and some of these other companies, you know.  And I've even heard that the funeral industry is now being franchised.  I mean huge corporations are buying the funeral homes and then franchising them.  And what, what's--do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: I'm not familiar with that.  I, I--about the funeral homes being franchised.  That's, that's news to me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, some big funeral home chains are coming up and they start buying the smaller funeral homes now.  They had this going on in Chicago [Illinois] and other cities.
Speaker 2: Right, really?  I guess it hasn't hit [Washington] D.C. yet 'cause they still have a lot of mom and pop funeral homes.  The cosmetic industry, we're losing in the nail side.  A lot of things are labor-intensive, you know, blacks don't wanna do that much anymore.  They, they want to wear a shirt and tie.  They don't wanna do nails.  They--you can't make as much money per clip, you know.  They're going for the big buck items, I think, unfortunately.  We're losing the nail industry to the Koreans in this area.  In, in North Carolina, the construct--they're losing the construction industry to Mexicans, 'cause you know, black folks don't wanna work outside in the heat and in the cold, and you know, and carry cinderblocks and bricks, excuse me.  And then you have--but for the most part, I think that what, what more, more and more black folks are starting to, to realize that, you know, we gotta get back to doing things that our, that our forefathers did.  And you know, quite--one of the things, one of the biggest mistakes was when they started closing the farms down, you know, instead of--and then on the farms now, I mean a lot the homeless people, if they had them working on farms, they wouldn't be homeless.  They'd have somewhere to stay, and they'd have food to eat.  But instead, they left the farm, and they're wondering around the city, those who are not mentally ill or whatever I'm, I'm talking about, the, the voluntary homeless people, not the, not the ones who are homeless because they can't help it.
Story_ID: 95691
Speaker 1: Do you really think that people don't really want to do these things, or, or that they've drawn to other--we have an underground economy (unclear).  It is extremely labor-intensive, you know, running from corner to corner, dodging bullets and other gang members, and I mean it's, I mean and it sounds comical in some ways, but it's not.  It's--
Speaker 2: It's not; that's serious.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--(unclear)--people going to jail and dying and all over, you know, material gain.  I mean most of the people that participate in this economy don't make the big time.  You know, they're not really--they don't get big.
Speaker 2: You know, I don't think they wanna get big.  I think they just wanna survive.  I think most of these people just wanna make it from day to day.  They wanna get from the projects to another--into a house or to a better apartment, and then they don't, they don't have six or seven siblings.  And I'm not saying that only the people in the projects or only the poor people are participating in this underground.  That's definitely not the case.  The money is made by the people as probably as close as 16th and, and Penn [Pennsylvania Avenue, The White House], you know, the, the, the policymakers of the U.S., United States are probably some of the people who are making the, some of them making money as a result of the underground businesses.  And we know in the oil industry they are.  But I think that people, I don't think they, they do it because they want to.  Some of them do--some of them see it as a, a means of getting something quick, you know.  And then some of them are exposed to it, some are recruited, and then others just don't know any other way.  They figure this, that's the only thing we can do.
Speaker 1: You think that people want, enjoy the freedom of doing something that's not regulated by the government or, or any of the downtown establishments that they know of?
Speaker 2: To be honest with you, I don't even think they think about it like that.  They don't think about the government.  When they're, when they're in an underground economy, they don't think about that.  I mean, let's go back to the question you asked me a few minutes ago, when you bring employees on, do you just--what was your question?
Speaker 1: Oh, I asked you did, did you--would you recommend someone in trying to squeeze that last drop out of them, and you know, in some--
Speaker 2: Not, not--what you were saying is not, not following the government--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --rules, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: People not thinking about that.  People are not thinking about government rules, people not thinking about that.  They're thinking about surviving from day to day.  Perfect example, if--right down the street here, Third--New Jersey and, and Mass [Massachusetts Avenue], there's a gentleman on the corner.  I was--I had lunch today with the, with the executive assistant to the director for the regulatory agency that controls licensing.  This guy is out there selling fruit, and the sell newspapers, and they sell water.  I said, "Does this guy have a permit?"  And we laughed.  And we said at least at they're not begging.  They're, you know, being entrepreneurial.  Do you think he thought about getting a permit?  No.  Do you think he thought about getting a health inspection?  Do you think he's thought about getting his food inspected by USDA and make sure that such and such?  No.  What does he wanna do?  He wants to sell that so he can go buy some more and make some more money.  So, no (laughter), nobody's thinking about that.  The underground--I think the people, for the people who go into the underground business, they don't think about dodging the IRS.  They don't, they realize that when they sell--if they, if they sell drugs, that the profits that they make, fifty--that they should pay taxes on it, you know.  They don't realize that.  They don't care.  They're not thinking about tax evasion.  They're thinking about making their money, and they don't realize that they, they, they, in themselves, are a business enterprise.  I have clients, you know, who we--you know, and any, anybody has clients who you know are in, in--have underground businesses, but you don't wanna know about it, you know.  You know about it, but you don't know about it.  You just make sure they report their income.  And so, yeah.
Story_ID: 95692
Speaker 1: Sir, what are some of your other hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, I-- it's very troubling when I drive down the street sometimes.  You know, it start--very basic thing as, as a hairstyle, you know, the twists and the long hair, you know, and the baggy pants and all that.  I think, I think that there--first of all, parents need to stop thinking about what they didn't have and try to give it to their kids, and start spending time with their children and sharing things with them, sharing ideas.  Our, you know, our parents, like, like I say, our parents were always working, 24/7, working two jobs or whatever because they couldn't, they didn't have enough money--make enough money on one job to sustain us.  So they didn't have that time to spend at home, and they found themselves doing everything else.  You--they'll find that in a lot of households people come home, the kids go in one room and watch TV, and the parents--the father, probably ain't even home yet from happy hour, and the mom is, you know, kitchen in the kitchen and running errands or whatever, and they are not communicating.  So my first hope for the black community is that there's more family intercommunication and interaction, that families have discussions around the dinner table like they used to.  If--I don't know if you recall if you have--I'm not sure whether your parents ever shipped you South for the summer, but one of the things that we used to do in the summer is, you know, we used to sit around when we ate at the table, we talked about what was on the news.  We talked about what was going on in the community.  You know, we talked about--you know, we communicated, and that's not happening today.  The other hope is that the blacks realize that, in order for them to really be free, that they need to join in the entrepreneurial spirit and become free, and support each other in business, patronize blacks who are in business.  The other thing is focus on getting a quality education.  I'd like to see more and more people get a quality education.  Don't just go to school.  Come out of there equipped with something.  You're already starting in a negative category, and if you're not equipped, you're never gonna even, become even.  And the other thing is to have faith and confidence in your abilities, you know, believe that you can do what you can do.  You know, one of the things that--I have to go back to that, that my fiancee, what Dee (ph.) all--would always say is, he says, you know, you took a---you take on projects that you know nothing about sometimes."  I said "because I know concepts.  I know business.  Not much changes beyond that."  And once you know those things--and you have to--and you believe that you can do it.  If you believe--if, if your client believes in you, then you can believe in yourself.  So, you know, you know, be confident, education, communicate, and you know, and, and be conscientious about what you do.  And the last thing I would say is have people learn how to develop good work ethics, not only going to work, but being productive while they're there.

Speaker 1: Tell me at this point, I know you're still young--(unclear)--tell me at this point, at this juncture, when you look back at everything you've done, I mean would you do anything differently?
Speaker 2: Would I do anything differently?  In terms of career?  Probably yes, I would do, I would something I would do differently.  I wouldn't have taken on the job of the child support [Office of Child Support and Paternity Enforcement in Washington, D.C.] (unclear) (laughter).  That's what I would do differently.
Speaker 1: Why, why would you have stayed out of that one?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Because, although I was effective at it, it's, it was because of the way the organization was set up.  It was set up to fail.  It was not set up to, to succeed, to be successful, and to do what it was really supposed to do, you know, so that would be the one thing that I would do.  I would have, you know, taken another career path.

Speaker 1: And at this juncture, when you look back at everything you've done, and once again, you're still doing things, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Being able to--you know, the, the, the media part that I was never trained for, being able to do things like, like that, being able to translate knowledge and have people recruit me to, to do, to do radio and to do TV.  My, my legacy would be I think I'm remembered--and, and it's, it's really interesting because my guardian's [his godfather, Isih Foushee] sister, Delora [ph.], was saying to me, she says "Does Howard [University in Washington, D.C.] have a political science department?"  I said "What do you think my degree was in?"  She said "Business."  I said "No, my degree was in political science."  So, I think my legacy is that I've been able to be considered a prominent business person without having a business degree- it was a minor in both cases--and to be able to, to use, to use that and to balance that.  And I think I'm, you know, I would be--that would be my, my legacy, and be able to have--you know, when I go around the--when I speak at different conferences around the country, I spoke at the Omega Psi Phi conference.  I was the first non-Omega Psi Phi person, I think, to speak at one of their national enclaves--to be able to talk about business issues; to be able to talk about political issues; to be able to talk about running and managing government entities; and I think the legacy is to be able to do all of those, all three of those things and be successful at 'em.

Speaker 1: Okay, and maybe in a more personal way, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's how I would like to be remembered, as one who overachieved.  I was too small to play football.  I wasn't smart enough to go to college.  I would never be able to afford to go to college.  I've never--I'm not supposed to be sitting here talking to you today, if you'd seen me when I was in high school and growing up.  I'm not supposed to be sitting here talking to you.  I'm supposed to be a cook or something down in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, or a medical technologist at the hospital working on weekends.  So, that's how I would like to be remembered, that, that I achieved beyond what I ever dreamed of.  I never thought this.  I never thought I would achieve what I've achieved.  When you're looking at the positions that I've had, when you look at the power and the ability to use networks to get things done, you know, getting results, it's--you know, that's how I'd like to be remembered.  And when I talk to my niece upstairs and you know, that's--and I want her to see that, no matter where she is in her life, that the sky is the limit.
Speaker 1: All right, thank you, Sir.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
