 Moser this is an oral history interview of Jesse Henderson on  November 23, 2015, being conducted for Dr. Laura Arata   s digital history  course and today we   re going to be talking about barrel racing. Jesse can  you tell me about yourself.  Henderson Well, I am 20 years old from a small town, Morrison, Oklahoma. It   s pretty  close here to OSU. I   ve been riding horses since I was four years old. We   ve  always had a least probably five horses on the property. Me and my brothers  both competed; I   m the only one in the family that has stuck with it  competitively. I   m an ag-business student going   I   ll continue to the  pharmacy and continue to rodeo.  Moser Are you a freshman, sophomore     Henderson I   m a junior.  Moser A junior here at OSU. You said you have brothers that rodeo as well, are  they younger or older?  Henderson Both of them are older. They both kind of quit riding horses before they  graduated high school, so they never got overly competitive in it. They  stayed kind of local, you know, jackpots, play-days, just small-town stuff  (nothing big). I   m just now starting to get past that point for financial  reasons.  Moser What events did they participate in events as well?  Henderson Both of my brothers, they did some   at our local play-days we have poles,  barrels, stakes, flags things like that. Kind of fun events, speed events but  they both also dabbled in roping. My middle brother did some steer riding  when he was younger, but my older brother was a really good roper.  5  Moser In your town, is rodeo pretty big? Are there quite a few people the rodeo?  Henderson We actually have quite a few really good contestants for my town. It   s too  small itself to have rodeos or two really big anything but some towns around  us has a big pretty big rodeo in Perry which I   m apart since I was four we  help it on things that were kind of at a good location to where I can travel an  hour or two hours and had some pretty decent rodeos of jackpots and things.  Moser Are you affiliate with the circuit? Do you follow circuit?  Henderson I myself don   t follow any kind of circuits right now not in the radio aspect  anyways like IPRA  International Professional Rodeo Association  or PRCA   Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association . I   m waiting for that one golden  horse to take me on my amateur year and I don   t waste my amateur year or  my rookie year. I do follow   I   m a member of the NBHA which is National  Barrel Horse Association and I will also be following the BBR this year  which is Better Barrel Races is some jackpot series that happen around here,  the finals are around here.  Moser You said you started getting interested in horses at four years old, when did  you start, did you know at that point you were going to barrel race or was it  aspiration?  Henderson Actually, I did know I wanted to. I remember in kindergarten when we were  asked to dress up as the profession we wanted to be for the rest of our life, I  came in a cowboy hat and boots. I said I wanted to be a professional barrel  racer at the age of four. Back then from about four to sixteen, I wasn't super  competitive. We had a single father of three kids and he gave us the horses  he could, but they were mostly cow-ponies. I did what I could with them I  had to teach myself a lot about barrel racing. At the local level    I did a lot  of barrel racing there but it is not competitive. I did not have a very fast  horse but it was definitely my learning period from four to sixteen years old  where I bettered my horsemanship in general.  Moser Over these years that you have been competing in barrel racing, how many  horses have you used?  Henderson Probably too many to count. Between flip-flopping with my brothers and  things, I would say at about sixteen years old I began   we began  accumulating a lot faster more competitive horses. Since then I have  probably used four finished horses since the age of sixteen, and I have a few  more that I am training. Besides that, I have probably gone through twenty  horses in my lifetime.  Moser Could you maybe talk about the procedure of, the age of a horse, the  maturity level for barrel racing, the lifespan of when that barrel racing  6  horse is probably at its peak, and maybe just discuss that a little bit and  maybe the training procedure as well?  Henderson Okay. Well, a lot of that is actually personal preference. There   s been people  say they won   t take a horse to the National Finals rodeo that   s not in its teen  years. There   s a lot of people that say that they hit their prime peak. I mean  before ten years, seven to ten years is going to be its peak. Anything before  that the horse isn   t quite matured, so they are prone to making simple  mistakes or getting distracted things like that. There is also the futurity level  where these horses run extremely competitively, extremely well at the age of  four and five. So that   s all preference in training and things. Personally, I   m  just starting to train my own barrel horses. I   m working with a couple right  now at the age of ten who has been a pasture ornament pretty much. (I   m  putting my own training on that). She   s a little past her prime (definitely past  her prime for being trained) but it is still possible at that age. I also have a  five-year-old. Probably around two to five I   d say is the best time to train,  definitely. They are the most influential there and they are not as set in their  ways. It is hard to alter a horse   s body as it gets older, so I would say that a  horse is definitely going to be retired from competitive barrel racing at  twenty, definitely, but most people won   t ride them after about sixteen to  twenty. They won   t be making things like the NFR  National Finals Rodeo   and the IPRA finals and things. It   s possible but not overly likely.  Moser You said that you had ridden over twenty horses, is there a favorite you had  and if so, why was that horse your favorite?  Henderson That   s a tough question. That   s like having to pick your favorite kid. I would  say   I can probably narrow it down to three in my lifetime. My very first  pony, a little grey horse named Sugar, she was my starting point, my  confidence booster, everything, this horse was almost thirty years old. Then  I went through a time in my life where I had fallen off and broken my  collarbone and lost my confidence a lot so when I decided to get back into  riding, we found a horse about a year later and his name was Bulldog. He  was an old team penning horse, not a barrel racing horse, but I trained him  to be a barrel horse and that   s the horse that boosted my confidence and got  me back in the saddle. Right now I currently ride a horse named Harley and  her registered name is Miss East to Rhyme. She is definitely my number one  horse right now. She is a diamond in the rough. I was lucky to get ahold of  her for the price that I got her, definitely. She is a solid horse; she   s calm,  she   s consistent, and it   s really helped me. I   ve learned from her and she   s  learned from me. We are a pretty good team right now and I   m happy with  her.  Moser Why did you come to OSU and join the barrel racing team?  7  Henderson I actually did not come to OSU for the rodeo team. I would   ve picked  something like Southwestern  Oklahoma State University  where the rodeo  team is just a little bit more competitive. I actually came to OSU because it   s  convenient. I live at home which it is about twenty miles away. I still live  with my dad and we raise and train horses there. I have eight horses  currently and that keeps me pretty busy. I wanted to be close to home where  he could help me out financially, so I chose to come to OSU. Then I  decided, later my freshman year, to join the rodeo team. I was on it for my  sophomore year. I competed some but it   s tough financially to college rodeo  while going to school. I actually have to work and things too. I work part  time and I keep my A-horses going. For personal reasons, I decided to rodeo  independently right now; it   s a little bit cheaper and a little bit less of a  hassle to have come into Stillwater and meet with the team and things when  I have horses at home that need worked all the time.  Moser Could you kind of tell us the rodeo season for OSU kind of from start to  finish and what is expected of you as a competitor and as a rider?  Henderson Ok. For this rodeo team specifically, we start right when school starts. We  have a fall season and we have a spring season. The winter is our dead time,  so we have probably have five rodeos or so in the fall and we begin as a  team we have to make practices every week. Barrel racers are expected to  make at least one practice a week where we can all get together and see each  other   s abilities and help each other out. Other than that, we   re required to  make every meeting which is once a month on a Tuesday. Meetings and  practice is a must if you want to rodeo or be eligible to rodeo in our club.  Other than that, we   re expected to come to the team, the club events and  things, the things that we are active with on campus and to help keep up the  rodeo grounds because we fund our own rodeo grounds and we take care of  it. We are expected to keep our own stalls and pastures clean. I   m not  actually a part of because I stall at home but for those who stall here, on  campus, we   re expected to take care of our own horses, take care of the  rodeo grounds, so, it   s really a team effort in keeping it going.  Moser Getting ready for a run, is there a pre-run ritual? Is there something that  you do just to calm your nerves or calm the horse   s nerves that has maybe  turned into kind of a ritual for you before doing a run?  Henderson Absolutely, and that   s kind of a   it   s kind of developed over time. I used to  get really, really nervous before a run. I didn   t have any kind of ritual. I just  kind of went in there and did it. I   ve discovered that having a set in stone  ritual to do before can really help to keep you and your horse focused and  calm. It   s not a shock that barrel horses usually have issues around the gate.  They get really, really excited; they know they   re about to run. Some horses  have worse issues than others. Personally, for me, I warm up my horse very  lightly just to stretch out its muscles, walk, trot, lope. I keep them away from  8  the arena that time so she doesn   t    She   s not focused on the arena she  doesn't see what's going on too much. I try to keep her calm away from it  and I   ll go stand up by the fence and let her stay calm next to the arena; that  way she can see what   s going on but no she   s she can rest there. Personally,  I like to be away from other people at this time. I will run over my run in my  head. Any issues I   ve been having I have to go over and over again on what  I   m going to do with my hands with my seat where I   m looking where I   m  putting my horse. I   ll go over that in my head several times. I   ll take a  moment and I   ll pray. I   ll just pray for protection for to keep us up on all  four feet, to keep the barrels up and be thankful that I   m there that day that I  get to participate in this amazing sport. When my name is called, I will  slowly walk to the gate and keep my horse calm. I   ve learned to level my  breathing, level my nerves to keep her calm and   it just happens.  Moser What is your ideal time? If you were to say the best time that you could have  and maybe talk about an average time and kind of your best run.  Henderson Well, that is kind of a trick question. In the sport of barrel racing, it depends  on the area what size your pattern is going to be. There   s, I mean, you can  go as far as Pendleton  Oregon , where when you win it you   re in the  twenties. On down to like a college rodeo in Alva  Oklahoma  where the  winning time is usually eleven second time. So, there   s a huge range, a huge  range of pattern size. Of a standard pattern, the record right now, held by  Brittany Pozzi, is a 16.4. There   s no way of having your average time or  your standard time because in my home arena where I run in Perry,  Oklahoma, it   s a large pen and I   m usually running 18.7 patterns. When I go  to some indoor arenas and things I can run down to 16.5 second patterns. It   s  a huge gap. There   s really no way to tell what your best time is because it  depends on your arena. You have to have your best time for that arena, then  you have to have your best time for that set, for that pattern. I can say that in  barrel racing that it   s a D-program, a division, so it   s a one-D, two-D, three-  D. The horse I have now consistently runs two-D three-D times time, so I   m  usually a half-a-second to three quarters of a second off of the winning time.  That   s where we kind of range our   that   s how we keep track of our times  is what kind of D you can run in. My horse, I haven   t got that one-D horse  yet so right now I   m saying pretty solid in the two-Ds.  Moser From your own opinion in discussing and talking with you today could you  talk about how do you feel if barrel racing is a real sport or not?  Henderson Absolutely. I mean, absolutely any rodeo person is going to tell you that it   s  trying on your body, it   s trying on the horse. There   s a lot of wear and tear  that goes down. There   s a lot of   I mean we count things like football and  basketball and soccer as sports and those are no doubt sports. I mean you  have to put in a lot of time and a lot of practice but whereas they are  working with an inanimate ball a football or baseball, we   re working with a  9  1200-pound animal that has its own mind its own ways. They have bad days  just like we have bad days. We are expected to go full speed, stop on the  dime, turn at high speeds, stay on the saddle the whole time. I would  definitely count it as a sport. there   s a lot of work put into rodeo in general  and especially barrel racing where we have to ride these horses. Our horses  are athletes just like us. It   s a true sport and there   s a lot of, a lot of training  that goes into it. Just, I mean, a football player has to train several times a  week, several times a day maybe. We ride our horses several times a week  or it   s just   it   s going to fall apart it   s like any other sport.  Milligan Why would someone say it   s not a sport?  Henderson I guess the thing that equestrians come across the most is about people who  don   t know anything about riding horses is they   ll say that we just sit there,  that the horses is doing all the work and you just sitting in the saddle you  just hanging on. My response to them is I will put them on my best barrel  horse I have and see if they can hang onto the saddle while she runs. They   ll  learn quickly that if you spend even a couple hours in the saddle when  you   re not used, you   re going to hurt. It requires strength and stamina; you  come out of a run breathless just like your horse. You   re using every inch of  your body to maneuver the horse and to cue that horse. You have to be  completely aware of everything from your feet, to your hands, to your legs,  to your seat, to where your eyes are. It   s more   (I don   t it   s more of a sport  than anything else) but we definitely have to overcome the fact that we   re  working with live animals and not just other people or balls or nets or  anything.  Milligan I   m curious what was your   what is the training. What   s your training look  like? Because that   s obviously   that   s intense to be in that situation for that  small amount of time. So, what does it take to be able to train to get  prepared for that?  Henderson Training is actually something that   s pretty new to me. There   s a lot of  people out there that have been training horses for thirty years and they   re  still critiquing the way they do things. I   m just starting it and I can say from  experience that I   m getting into training is there   s so much work behind  those horse that are finished and that can go out and they can rodeo and they  can do the same pattern every time they can take care of the rider. There   s so  much work put into those guys. Anyone can buy a horse that   s finishing,  that   s got training. But, to put the work in it is hours and hours of doing the  same thing over and over and just hoping for an inch of improvement that  day.  There   s   you have to maneuver the horse   s body. For barrel racing  specifically a horse has to be completely loose and completely susceptible to  your cues. You have to be able to move its hips its shoulders its side; you  10  have to flex its head. There   s so much put into it. They have to work on  every bit of that inch by inch because you can overwhelm a horse really  easily. A young horse, they   ll get frustrated. They don   t know what you   re  asking. It   s so much patience and it   s frustrating at times to work day in and  day out with these horses and then you think you   re ready and you go to a  barrel race or a jackpot and you make a run and it falls apart; then you have  to start all over again. That   s just part of the process is trial and error, going  back to basics over and over and over again until this horse is nine or ten  and it   s a fantastic horse. That   s when you have your reward, but it   s years  and years and days and days and hours spent in the saddle just teaching  these horses.  Milligan I think it   s interesting because I hear you talk about how you know the hips  have to flex and like all these points that the horse has to be able to do. How  do you know when you have a good barrel racing horse?  Henderson There   s really   we go off of breeding these days, papers and things. A huge  cue is you go off of how the horses is bred. If it comes from barrel racing or  racing or cow bloodlines. We strive for a mix and we go off a name on a  paper. But, there   s always a chance that you can find a horse that doesn   t  have those names or it is just some random stock bred horse and it turns out  to be an awesome barrel horse like Charmayne James who won the world  ten times, eleven times, ten times on scamper. This horse came from a feed  lot, and it was going to slaughter and she turned it turned into a world  champion. That   s, and it comes with time and experience of barrel racing.  You know how to see a good horse.  You know how to say that horse has potential. But, personally for me, the  horse I   m working on now, it   s we put it on the pattern after its foundation  training. We put it on the pattern for about a week and if that horse can   t  start looking for the barrels and showing that it wants to run, it   s probably  not going to make a barrel racer. You can   t make a horse run. You can   t  make a horse great if they don   t want to be great. So, you look for horses  that want to run that have the desire to do their job and that   s overall going  to show you if it   s going to be a good barrel horse. You can have the best  looking horse out there. You can have a horse that is broke to the nines and  will do anything you ask but if they don   t want to run barrels they   re not  going to round barrels.  Milligan How much time a week do you spend training your horses?  Henderson Training, specifically, I have one horse right now under saddle training. I  spend probably five to six days a week on her own ideally seven but with  school and work, it   s almost impossible. Five to six days a week, at least, an  hour in the saddle every day. Along with my finish horses, they get  conditioned at least four days a week so those horses. They don   t need as  11  much training as much time in the saddle that goal there is to keep them in  shape, so training takes a lot more time you have to put a lot more hours into  training. But, once you have a finished horse, you still have to put the hours  in to keep them in shape and keep them conditioned.  Milligan You spend a lot more time with your five-year-old horse than your ten-year-old  horse on that training.  Henderson Yes, usually, and it   s hard because you want to get on the easy horse and  ride them and relax. You got to push yourself and you got to say I   ve got to  get on this crazy horse right now. I definitely spend   you have to spend a  lot more time with them because you can work with them for three hours to  get to move ahead one way and where the other one knows what it   s doing  you just have to lope it a few times.  Milligan I   m curious a little bit more about your time with the OSU Rodeo Team.  What was the difference between working with the OSU Rodeo Team versus  the work that you   ve done on your own doing training yourself and maybe  working with people locally it sounds like less formally versus your time  with the OSU Rodeo.  Henderson Actually it   s   I never want to say anything negative about the OSU Rodeo  Team, they are     Milligan You can be honest here.  Henderson They built themselves up from the ground-up really; we don   t get a lot of  support from school, but it   s not extremely structured and we have these  requirements and we have these things we have to do to be able to rodeo.  But, for myself it   s very difficult to meet these requirements when I live off  of campus and I live out of town and it   s   I found myself not being eligible  for rodeos when the only reason I wanted to be on the rodeo team was to  rodeo, that   s my goal. I   m not concerned with being super active in school  activities. I   m here to rodeo. It   s my dream. It   s my passion. It   s what I  want. found it much easier to work myself at home and to work with people  I know. I have a lot of influences and people that I can ask for help and I  find it much more beneficial than coming twenty to thirty minutes into town  with a couple of my horses just to do the same thing that I can do at home  and so I just found it pretty inconvenient. For people who live here and  come out-of-state, it   s an awesome program, but for myself personally it  wasn   t beneficial.  Milligan Was there anything here from the training aspect for you maybe you, who  works with your horses, that was different. Did you get different advice or  different feedback from the advisors for the Rodeo club here than maybe  you   ve gotten other places?  12  Henderson Actually, the coach that we have right now he doesn   t   he monitors the  practices and makes sure people are there, but we don   t receive a lot of help  from the Rodeo Team. Barrel racers are pretty independent people anyways.  There   s not, I mean, some of them are going to take help somewhere but we  don   t have instructors, we don   t have anyone training us. He   s mentioned  that he   s going to bring a few people in and maybe have some clinics to  where the girls can get some advice and get some help on patterns. But on a  week-to-week basis, it   s just you go and you do your own thing. So, it   s  absolutely no different than working at home, we   re just being watched by  somebody.  Milligan Got it. That makes more sense, but I also wonder what the cost is to be  involved with the OSU Rodeo Team. Is there a general range?  Henderson Well, if you want to, we rodeo through NIRA which is the National  Intercollegiate Rodeo Association. The fees for that, I believe, are  260 just  to get your card but buying your card doesn   t ensure you can rodeo. That   s  the problem I went through. I bought my card but if I miss a meeting or a  practice because I   m busy or at work I can   t rodeo. There   s those fees and  then there   s   I think we have a  50 membership fee for the OSU Rodeo  Team itself. And that   s the initial costs. People can put more into that they  stall here if they do that and if they do the extra activities on campus and  things and they   ll put some money in for that but initially it   s the  260  NIRA card and a  50 membership fee.  Milligan Got it, I was having a hard time visualizing, because    I, well, we talked  about horses in general are expensive so I   m sure there are different fees for  someone who is out-of-state who brings their own horse and needs to stall  versus, but you had gas money to have to haul them here right?  Henderson Absolutely, and those aren   t mentioned those are just kind of, when you   re  in rodeo you know it   s there. There   s entry fees to whatever event you   re is  a  50 or  60 entry fee. There   s hauling for, I think we, our farthest rodeo is  probably four to five hours away. There   s the diesel for that. There   s the  feed for your horse there   s stalling your horse after the rodeo which is a  separate fee if you want to stall there. There   s just the endless cost of  owning horses: of traveling, of feeding them, entering it. I can hardly put a  number to it; it   s just expensive.  Moser Is there, for winning at the college level, is there a cash rewards are you  compensated some for that?  Henderson I personally have never, for the few rodeos I   ve gone to under the college  rodeo, I've never received money back. But, for those few who do place in  the money, there   s not a lot of compensation. They   that   s one of the  reasons why we don   t get support   much support is they say we rodeo   we  13  compete for money well the money we win doesn't cover the entry fees and  travel expenses; that barely compensates us for that day let alone the time  and money put into it throughout the year. So, there   s not a lot of money to  win back in the college rodeo. There   s more in the professional area or the  professional level of rodeo, but still any horse market is not a moneymaking  market. We do it out of passion. We do it because we love it; even the pros,  people winning millions of dollars. We   re pumping an equal amount into  our horses and our hobbies into our lifestyle, so this isn   t a money making  game. Anyone that   s in rodeo is not in it for the money; they   re in it because  they love it.  Moser You mention Charmayne James, are there other influential women that kind  of inspire you?  Henderson Absolutely, every little girl grows up seeing these barrel racers, seeing the  professionals and thinking,    wow I want to be just like them.    When I was  younger Charmayne was definitely my main influence. She was the best in  the world for years and years and years. Then, when you get older you begin  to see, you begin to actually watch and analyze these girls and how they run  and how they act and some of the girls, some of the pros that I simply watch  on TV or keep up with, I strive to be like them. There   s Martha Josey who is  a very, very successful barrel racer as well. Lisa Lockhart. Lisa Lockhart  and Fallon Taylor are both, which is ironic because anyone in the rodeo  world can. Fallon Taylor is a little different; she   s a    but, Fallon is, she   s  probably, I wouldn   t say I want to be just like her, but she   s definitely has a  hold over the girls and rodeo. I think it   s so important to set yourself as a  role model for younger girls because if you   re out there barrel racing at a  professional level there   s girls watching you.  You   re a role model at all times. I think Fallon Taylor does a wonderful job  of staying positive and keeping a positive attitude and encouraging other  girls. Encouraging each other in this sport is so important to me. At a local  level, I have a couple of girls, like Lauren Underwood and her name is  Becky Williams, they are amazing barrel racers but their names aren   t  nationally known but they definitely influenced me. They help me all the  time and I can go to them for advice and for encouragement when I     everyone goes through times when they   re like, wow, am I really that good  of a rider? I can   there   s no way I   m ever going to make the NFR. It   s  important to have people around you that you can look to and that can  encourage you and can push you to do your best at all times.  Milligan Do you feel like there are girls that are younger than you that have that  relationship with you?  Henderson There are. Since I was sixteen years old, that   s when I realize how important  it is to be a role model in the world of rodeo because it   s a spectator sport.  14  There   s little girls and boys out there that I   m   really, really watch and keep  up with it. When you don   t think you   re being watched, you are. When I  was sixteen, (it was as after a rodeo one time) I was cooling my horse down  and a little girl came up to me. She was about seven or eight and she could  tell she didn   t know horses very well; she was a little scared and she said,  I   ll never forget this. She asked me,    What   s like to be a cowgirl?    And it  was the most innocent sweetest thing and it caught me so off guard. I mean  that   s something that you don   t consider yourself really. You   it   s my life  it   s how I was raised because I grew up in it.  It   s easy to take it   take advantage of it to live this life and have horses and  you want to complain because you have the best horses. Well, you have  horses and a lot of people don   t have that and so, at all times all ages. I have  a few girls right now about the age of thirteen and fourteen who come to me  and asked me to help them with barrel racing or with the horsemanship or  and they   ve they become friends to me. They can be six or seven years  younger than me but those girls, they look up to me and I know that every  time I got there if I have a bad attitude about something or if I have a bad  run and I   m negative about it that they   re watching me, so it   s   there   s  always going to be girls watching you. If you make good runs, someone   s  watching you all the time.  Milligan How did you answer the question of what it   s like to be a cowgirl?  Henderson I guess I remember the question. I hardly remember my answer. It   s one of  those things, I tried to try to brush it off. It   s not a big deal. It   s not like I  mean it   s   cowgirl is such in such a term that we don   t use very much  anymore. We ride horses, we   re barrel racers but to be a cowgirl, that   s how  these little girls see us. It seems goofy to us. It seems funny to us but to them  it   s such a big deal and so I always brush of the question and ask the little  girls if she wanted to ride my horse and I led her around on my horse that  night. Even if she never owns a horse in her life I hope she remembers that  night.  Milligan I think that   s a brilliant answer to that question. Here, let me show you.  Henderson That   s the only way we can do it. You can   t describe this life.  Milligan So, talk to me a little bit about ag business? Why did you choose that and  what are you going to do with it? Do you have an idea?  Henderson Well, I   m actually just finishing my ag business degree. Turns out, I   m  probably not going to use it. I, this last summer, I was looking around, I was  at my house on my farm and the horse pasture and the barn and I was  looking around and I was thinking,    This life is expensive.    I   m not always  going to have Daddy there to fund me. He was able to give me such an  15  awesome life. He gives me everything I could ever ask for with these horses  and trailers and hauling all the time, competing. I know it   s expensive but I  don   t personally feel that financial burden, so I realize that I   m going to  have to do something down the line that can allow me to fund this way of  life so that I can fund my children. Hopefully, they want to rodeo and so I  decided to do pharmacy. I was looking into fields that are paid well and that  didn   t maybe, not a doctor or a vet because I   m not prepared for that and it  takes a lot of preparation. But, I decided to do pharmacy for financial  reasons and because it   s pretty flexible from the people that I   ve talk to. I  make my career choices solely based on my horses and my rodeo career and  what   s going to help me down the line.  Milligan So, what   s your plans with that? How are you going to transition to  pharmacy to getting prepared for that?  Henderson I   m actually going to   since I   m almost through with my business degree,  I   m going to finish that out but I   m going to kind of spread that out but  probably over a couple of semesters and I   m going to slowly add in all my  chemistry and the prerequisites that   s going to take to get into pharmacy  school. It   s a whole another several years in itself, so I   m going to kind of  combine them as much as I can, take some chemistry and physics to get him  prepared. Finish my prereq uisite s here and hopefully go on to OU   University of Oklahoma . I have a brother in Tulsa that lives there so  hopefully I can, thinking financially, the cheapest way to do this because it   s  going to be expensive either way. I   m going to pick the way that I can go  that allows me to still ride horses most of the time and be able to go to  school as well.  Milligan A house divided and a person divided.  Henderson Yes, yes I, with Bedlam so close I had to get into this debate. I grew up an  OU fan but came to this school and I was overcome with the school spirit  and the camaraderie that we all have here wearing orange. At first I was  hesitant to put on any orange (I didn   t want to) but I   m only OU at heart.  This school has definitely affected me; it gets under your skin after a while.  I love it here.  Milligan It does that. So, that also leaves me with this epiphany of, I   m really going to  have to step up my financial game for the rest of my life to be able to afford  this lifestyle, what   s your dad do?  Henderson My dad is actually   he works at Charles Machine Works which is Ditch  Witch in Perry, Oklahoma. He   s worked there his whole   I think he had  kids at the age of twenty (was my brother was born). He   I solely believe  that people are born with talent. Born to do things like I was born to be a  barrel racer like this as, I know this is what I meant to do like I   m good at it.  16  I believe my dad was born to be a parent. He has done nothing his whole life  but prepare for the future and for his kids and taking care of us. Since I was  four (is when my mother left), he is a single dad with three kids and he   s  never had a great paying job. He   s was a welder out there for about twenty  years which it pays good but it   s, there   s a lot of wear and tear on the body.  Now, he has an office job but he doesn   t have a college degree so he can   t  move up in the ranks out at Ditch Witch and so he stuck not on salary or  anything. He   s extremely smart with his money and that   s where   that   s  how I   ve gotten to where I am today is that he   s taking the time to prepare  and to financially prepare and save money. He lives, his advice is always  live below your level of standard. Live below what you actually can live. If  you can live a middle-class life, drop it down a notch. If you can live to like  the lowest amount   like if you can spend the least amount you possibly can,  don   t have the luxuries, don   t go out and eat all the time, don   t go to movies.  Don   t do it because that money can be used for future, and it   s definitely  changed my life. It   s   I couldn   t imagine not having what I have today.  He   s made that possible; it   s all my dad.  Milligan I think it   s interesting; maybe talk a little about your decision to go to school  because it seems like you have this path in front of you that doesn't  necessarily require a college degree. I   m curious why you chose to take that  path.  Henderson My dad definitely pushed me; he doesn   t care what I do in college, he just  wants me to have a degree. Because in this day and age, a degree gets you so  much farther than without it. It opens up doors that he never had open for  him. He knows that there   s   you can make a lot more and be more  successful if you just have a degree under your belt in general. So, he  wanted us to have that. He   s set up the college funds and everything to help  us get through. That   s   he told me to come to college and I didn   t want to.  He said when I graduated, I had a choice I had several thousand dollars in  this college fund and he said I could pull it all out and spend a year in  professional rodeo but that   s about all it   s going to fund is maybe a year   s  worth or I can go to college.  Maybe I   ll put up my professional career and I won   t get there quite as fast,  but I   ll prepare myself. I   ll be financially stable to where I can do even  better. If I would   ve jumped into the PRCA the year I graduated, on the  horse I had, I wouldn   t have won a dime. But, this gives me a give me time  to figure out where I want to be in life, figure out what I wanted to do, how  I   m going to make money, how I   m going to. It   s giving me a lot of extra  time to improve my horses and riding in itself. I   m very thankful that he  push me to go to college. I think with his background and knowing that he  can   t advance anymore where he is him, he wants better for his kids he  always has.  17  Milligan So, at what point, I mean I hear this and what you   re saying and I also, and  I   m trying to figure out where it stands. Your goal is to be   to ride  professional for whatever period of time you can do it however and  wherever that takes you it sounds like. At this point, when you   re looking at  more school and you   re kind of also looking at this other area that you have  to follow, where do you think that stands in your future right now, the  professional rodeo?  Henderson I probably won   t get to a PRCA level which is the NFR, I mean it   s the top  of the top. I probably won   t join the PRCA until I   m out of pharmacy  school. I   as much as I love to jump into it just learn about it trial and error,  all my way through it. I know it   s going to be a smarter choice for me to  hold off and to improve myself better at a NBHA, BBR, at a barrel racing  level and then jump into the rodeo world. Because just barrel racing and  rodeo are kind of the same but they   re completely different financially and  time-wise how much time it takes. I think I'll probably start out at an IPRA  level which is International Pro Rodeo Association and then there   s PRCA.  IPRA is just a little bit easier to get into; it   s a little less competitive and the  finals are right here in Oklahoma every summer, I believe. It   s going to be  less expensive. I don   t have to travel quite as far and I   ll have better luck in  that and I   ll learn a lot about the rodeo world through IPRA. I don   t see  myself joining those associations until A, I   m out of pharmacy school or B, I  have a horse that I know it   s going to be a successful rookie year because I  don   t want to waste the first year of having my card on an average horse.  I   m going to wait because it   s a big year and I   m going to wait until it was  worth it.  Milligan You mentioned Oklahoma City being the place for the championship for the  IPRC, right?  Henderson IPRA.  Milligan How is it to do rodeo in Oklahoma? Is it a big deal or is it hard to find  community?  Henderson I think, personally, that Oklahoma is a very, very good location to rodeo.  Next to Texas, I would say it   s probably one of the best. I think Oklahoma  and Texas are huge rodeo states. I mean, besides the NFR which is posted  out in Vegas, (it used to be here in the city  Oklahoma City ) and moved to  Vegas just for, I mean, we couldn   t take it anymore it was too big of an  event for us probably. But, Oklahoma is the horse capital of the world.  There are more sanctions, more breeds that have their finals here in  Oklahoma City than anywhere else. We have more finals and world shows  and everything here than any other state. I think it   s a prime place to be in  the horse world and the rodeo world anyways, (horse racing maybe not). It   s  convenient. You can rodeo Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, New Mexico we   re  18  kind of centered to travel as much as you want or don   t want you can stay  close to home and still make some pretty decent rodeos. Louisiana,  Mississippi they   re not so far. We   re kind of right in the middle, so it   s  convenient. I really think it   s one of the best places to be if you want to, if  you want to rodeo or show or anything.  Milligan Do you keep up   have you read much or kept up much with the history of  the rodeo industry in the US or even in the region?  Henderson I am definitely not a history buff. I know bits and pieces things that are  interesting to me. I know maybe   I   m not good at specifics like dates times  and names. I did a lot of rodeo queen pageants, so we had know quite a bit  about the rodeo industry in general. I wouldn   t say that I   m totally great on  history. I mean I   ve been to the Cowboy Hall of Fame and things like that  but I couldn   t remember all of it, the idea of it I guess is more important  than anything to me is to know some of the greats and how rodeo has  progressed over the years and such.  Milligan What   s involved in the rodeo queen pageant?  Henderson Well, that   s a whole world. It   s much like regular pageantry but dirtier. We  have to   we have to sit on his horses and we have to have the hair, the  make-up, the smile, the wave. We have to   I mean it   s a beauty contest on  horses but more so than that the thing that people don   t see is that you have  to be knowledgeable and passionate about the sport of rodeo. It   s   you can   t  come in to the rodeo world and want to be rodeo queen just so you can look  nice on a horse. We   re promoters of the sport. We wear those crowns not  just because they look nice, we wear them because people come to us they  see us, kids see us and were there to give a positive outlook on the sport of  rodeo. We   re supposed be knowledgeable about it so we can portray the  sport in a positive manner and to the crowd, to the spectators.  We speak for   the stock contractors there at rodeo committees that we  support. There   s a lot of time and effort put into it just preparing so you  know your history, you know what   s going on in the PRCA or the IPRA,  you know contestants you know how the sports works how every event  works in rodeo (the penalties everything like that). There   s that whole part  of it. Then there   s the part where you have to always look nice and you  would have to be cheery and as stressful as it is, it   s one of those things  where there   s always kids watching you and we   re meant to be a positive  outlook on the sport of rodeo and to promote it in the best way that we  possibly can.  Milligan What Miss Rodeo contests have you participated in and have you won any?  19  Henderson I have held five crowns in the last two years. I   ve   I haven   t done Miss  Rodeo Oklahoma. I was about to step up into that level, but I actually  decided to quit rodeo queening to barrel race. It   s   they are real hard to  balance. If you want to go to a state-level. I was   I had my application and  everything for Miss Rodeo Oklahoma filled out, and I decided that the  burden of that (well not a burden, it   s really an opportunity) but you have to  dedicate yourself to it, definitely. It takes a lot of time, so I decided that I  wanted   I didn   t want to put barrel racing on the back burner for a year or  two years or whatever it took to do Miss Rodeo Oklahoma and Miss Rodeo  America. I did a lot of more local competitions. I started like in a Perkins  Rodeo Queen. Perry   or, Cherokee Strip Riding Queen in Perry, Oklahoma.  I was the Central Oklahoma Junior Rodeo Association Queen, the Tulsa  State Fair Queen.  I think I   m missing one: the    89ers Day Queen in Guthrie, Oklahoma, for  that entire celebration. Those I think those are the only title I   ve held. I ran  for a couple more I got runner-up in the Newkirk Range Riders Rodeo  where I lost to the current Miss Rodeo Oklahoma, so no shame there. And  it   s a wonderful, wonderful world. It really, really helps me to be able to talk  to people to be able to present myself and it gives you a lot of connections in  the rodeo world. Even, I think it helps with my barrel racing even a little bit  just because as a rodeo queen I was able to meet with these contestants and  talk to these people and make these connections and be seen as a rodeo  queen. Then I   d take off the crown and I   m a barrel racer and I have these  connections and stuff so     Moser You   ve mentioned the IPRA traveling in different states to compete. I noticed  at the team roping level that a lot of team ropers will have horses waiting so  they can just go get on an airplane and fly and ride different horses. Is that  something that barrel racers do sometimes? And if so, what would be the  pros and cons of riding a fresh horse but at the same time riding a horse  that you don   t know?  Henderson That   s a little bit different in barrel racing than it is in team roping. I know  in team roping that they have their good horses and that those horses  actually do take a lot of training and stuff so you can just hop on any horse  very well. But, barrel racing I think even more so, probably more so than  about any other sport, except maybe calf roping. We put our time in with  these horses and our efforts and we get to know these horses and we have to  click with his horses and as much that is asked of the horse and rider to work  together, it is very, very, very difficult to go hop on a horse and ride and to  make a run without learning this horse and making a few trial runs. The girls  that like go to the NFR say they have to do ten rounds back-to-back. They  use   if you were to take a horse up there that you   ve never ridden before,  there   s a huge chance you could blow your pattern or blow off a barrel or hit  a barrel because every single horse that you ride is different. They each have  20  quirks, and some horses are free runners and some you have to push some  search for the barrels some you have to set up yourself. I mean there   s  millions and millions of different things that you have to know about the  horse to be able to make a top run. I wouldn   t say   I don   t know any barrel  racers personally that can fly out or go somewhere and have a different  horse or use a horse.  There   s some girls that when they   re in a bind, they   ll borrowers that they  know is a good horse but those girls, they have to be great riders. It has to be  a pretty solid horse for you to be successful on it. I personally have   I mean  I   ve used my friends horses a couple of times. I can hop on there   s and I   ve  rode it a couple of times and had to run but usually those horses are going to  be solid and consistent but then there   s some horses that you have to work  for a run but those people have to know how to ride the horses and so there   s  a lot of pros and cons. You, like in the NFR, where you have to do ten runs  back-to-back, that   s trying on a horse. It   s extremely difficult to make those  ten runs. It   s   the horse is going to be exhausted by the end of those ten  runs and so they   ll take multiple horses or they   ll borrow a horse for that. I  would say that they've practiced on it. They   re not going to go compete for  money, and for a title, for buckles, for a world championship or anything on  a horse that they   ve never ridden unless it   s   there   s no other choice like  their horses is lame or something, that might be the only choice but, ideally,  no. We spend the hours and hours and hours on the horses to connect with  them and to know exactly how to run them.  Moser When you   re practicing a week, what would you say, how many hours do  you put in that week for that seventeen seconds in that run?  Henderson Per horse or all of mine?  Moser Let   s just say if you   re getting prepared for a rodeo on Saturday night and  you   re waiting for that string to pop and you   re running that run and trying  to hit that 16.4 seconds. How many hours do you think you   ve worked up to  that point that week?  Henderson That week I   d probably, in the saddle, I   d probably worked at least seven  hours in saddle but then there   s the off time where I   m hosing down my  horse   s legs to keep out any heat or swelling. Putting poultice all over their  legs, booting them up to sweat their legs out. Keeping that horse sound.  Checking it all the time making sure there   s nothing wrong with any of its  legs. I mean there   s   it   s a huge thing to it   s a big deal to get to a rodeo and  your horse is lame or it   s leg swelled up or it   s limping. I would say one-week  probably at least seven hours in the saddle, an hour or more several  times a week. Then there   s the off of the saddle, the not so fun part where  you   re making sure its diet is perfect, its eating, making sure the horse is  healthy, drinking enough water, researching ways to improve your horse.  21  There   s   my mind is on barrel racing all the time. When I   m in class I   m  thinking of what I could be doing with this horse versus this horse. Where I  could be going next weekend or talking to people saying,    Hey, where are  you barrel racing this weekend?    I   m definitely   it   s endless hours put into  it with my mind but my body   s a different story.  Moser Mentioning the diet, do you adjust the horse   s diet prior to   do they have a  different eating patterns or different ingredients that you supplement prior  to, you know a week before or two weeks in preparing the horse for that  run?  Henderson Personally, mine does not. I think consistency is important with a horse. If  you change up their diet, you   re going to throw off the way they work or the  way, how healthy they are. You find where your horse can keep up its  energy and keep a consistent weight on and also you adjust it to where to  whether they   re good throughout the week. I mean I don   t change their diet  maybe by season. When it gets colder, when it gets hotter, when they   re  working more. We   ll throw in more protein, more calories, more high-energy  feeds but no we set it and we, the most important thing is to make  sure your horse your horse has everything it needs because you can   t prepare  a horse for run a few days before. It   s been weeks and days and months and  years of keeping that horse ready for a run. Besides making sure they have  foliage, water, feed, keeping them healthy, it   s consistency. I like to keep  things the same so the horses know what   s going to happen, nothing throws  them off.  Milligan I think I   ve only got maybe one more question and this is sort of an overview  of all of it. I   m listening to you talk about this and it is so time-consuming. I  mean obviously you said that you think about this constantly and it   s labor-intensive...  why do you do it?  Henderson I guess most little girls around the age of four or so, want a pony for  Christmas. There   s always a time and some kid   s life where they want a  pony or they want a horse or they love horses. I don   t know what it is about  horses that make people, kids love them. But some kids grew up and they  get out of it. I don   t know if I was   if it was bred into me I don   t know if it  was just by chance that I got this but it   s something that completely  consumes me. I   ve never not wanted to ride horses. I   ve loved horses my  whole life. I   ve loved riding and striving to get better and to be better and to  be like the girls on TV. We do it because it   s fast; it   s a rush to shave 1/1000  of a second off your time and you be put tens of thousands of dollars into a  tenth of a second.  It   s a little bit ridiculous, I guess, if you look at it but we spend all this time  and this money and this preparation. It   s   some people fish, some people  hunt, some people write poetry   I ride horses. They are everything to me. I  22  couldn   t imagine a life without horses; it would be like a life without air,  like trying living without air or water. It   s something that    and there   s  people out there like that that they   re just born to be with horses. I solely  believe that I am; I know I   m not the best by any means. I   m not even great  yet. I have a long, long ways to go and I   ll never be perfect at it. But to get  this animal and to have a perfect harmony with this animal. It knows you  and you know it and you know it   s exactly what this horse loves and exactly  what it hates, exactly what makes this horse mad. It   s rewarding to put all  this time and effort into it, to make a run or to have a little girl come up to  you who just has been watching you and you had no idea that you   re making  an impact in this world. Even one little girl. It   s an amazing feeling overall.  Milligan Now you make me want a horse. Well I think that   s well said...anything  else?  Moser That   s pretty good.  Milligan Thanks for your time today. Is there anything else that you want to add?  Anything that you want to throw in there, anything that we missed?  Henderson I think you guys covered it pretty well actually. I   m not great with words  so   .  Milligan You are. I think we are both really anxious to see what you do in the future.  Henderson Thank you, thank you. I definitely am too. It   s a work in progress.  Milligan That   s life, right?  Henderson (Laughter)  Milligan All right, well I   m going to go ahead and stop this.  -------  -------
