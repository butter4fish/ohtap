 Finchum Today is August 24, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we   re in Tulsa to  interview Lessie Randle. This is part of our Oklahoma One Hundred  Year Life project, so thank you for having us today.  Randle You   re welcome.  Finchum Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Randle I was born in Okmulgee County down near Morris, Oklahoma,  November 10, 1914. A grand year  (Laughs)  Finchum Coming up on a hundred and one then.  Randle Yes. November 10th I will be a hundred and one, God willing.  Finchum What was the name of the town?  Randle Around Morris, Oklahoma.  Finchum Marsh?  Randle Morris. M-O-R-R-I-S.  Finchum Morris, okay. Did you have brothers and sisters?  Randle Yeah, I had three sisters and one brother.  Finchum What did your parents do for a living?  Randle They were farmers.  5  Finchum Cotton and     Randle Corn, and had peas, and what have you.  Finchum Were they from Oklahoma, your parents?  Randle No, they were from Texas, both of them.  Finchum Do you know where they got your name?  Randle No, I don   t know where they got it, (laughs) but I didn   t know anybody  else by that name. I don   t know where they got the name from. It   s just  something they thought up, I guess. I don   t know.  Finchum Did you go to school there in Okmulgee?  Randle No, I didn   t go to school in Okmulgee. I went to school around Morris,  in a little place called Grayson. I went to school there. I finished school  here in Tulsa. That has been a long, long time ago.  Finchum About what time did you come to Tulsa?  Randle Well, to live, I guess it must have been around   well, they brought me  here when I was, oh, about ten, I guess.  Finchum Around 1925,    24? Somewhere in there?  Randle Something like that. I think in that area, if I can remember correctly.  Finchum What brought them to Tulsa? Why did they come?  Randle Well, they wanted to leave the farm and they had relatives here. Of  course, they convinced them that living would be easy, and they could  find work here. I guess they were tired of the farm, and they just moved  to Tulsa.  Finchum Do you remember how you got here?  Randle I imagine in a wagon, in those days. Of course, they didn   t have a car. I  imagine in a wagon. They had a wagon and team in those days, and  they   d travel by wagon and team from town to town.  Finchum It would take a little while to do that wouldn   t it?  6  Randle Well, yes. It didn   t seem so long at that time. It didn   t seem so long at  that time, but now it would. (Laughs) It   d seem forever now.  Finchum Well, when you were on the farm, did you have chores you had to do?  Randle Oh yes. Now I was very young at that time. Of course, I had to   I  would feed the chickens, bring in the chips, you know, for starting of  the fire, that sort of thing. Of course, now, Mom let us kind of work  with her in the kitchen. I learned a lot about cooking and stuff in the  kitchen in those days. Dad didn   t want us to do it. He   d say,    You better  watch those kids. I think they   re wasting too much.    (Whispering)  She   d say,    How will they ever learn?    (Laughs) That was pretty well  the way we came up.  Finchum What was the favorite thing she fixed that you liked to eat?  Randle Oh lord, there   re so many. I liked her pancakes, and for lunch she liked  to fix chicken. She fixed it so many different ways, and I loved that. Of  course, we grew our own chickens and our own hogs and killed those.  We just preserved most of all our food right there on the farm. Mother  would can the extra vegetables and fruits, you know, or she   d dry some.  We had our own milk cows. We had our own milk and butter, all that  sort of thing. We had our own food there, just about everything.  (Laughs) Just about everything.  Finchum Did she teach you how to make biscuits?  Randle Yes, she did. Yes, she taught me how to make biscuits.  Finchum Was she good at pie crusts?  Randle Yeah, Mother did pretty well at that too.  Finchum You did?  Randle If I do say so myself. I did. My mother was a good cook, a very good  cook.  Finchum Well, would she kill the chicken or would your father?  Randle Oh, we   d all kill them. When I got big enough to wring a chicken   s  neck, I   d kill them too. We   d all kill the chickens. I   d take that chicken  by the neck and I   d wring, you know. It just excited me to see them flop  right after you wring their necks, you know. They were dying. Finally  one day I said,    Now this is kind of cruel,    to myself. I said,    You kill  7  that chicken like that.    I said,    But you can   t eat him alive. You have to  kill him.    Oh dear, my, my. Those were the days.  Finchum How would they celebrate Christmas?  Randle Oh my goodness  A great big celebration. They   d cook for a week.  (Laughs) Pies and cakes and everything, and they   d have relatives come  in of course. They   d eat and they   d drink. Of course, the men folks  would have the stronger drinks and the ladies would have the less  strong drinks, you know. One thing that Mom made that I loved to  drink, that was eggnog.  Finchum Eggnog?  Randle Oh, she   d make it and it would be so good. Oh yes  Course, I   d sneak  around and they   d put a little liquor in my eggnog sometimes. Not  much, you know, just enough that it   d make it taste good. (Laughs) Yes,  my dear, I   ll tell you, but there   s nothing like living on a farm. It   s  really healthy. Very healthy. Now, you won   t believe this, but we would  go down to the   we had a well. We   d take our milk, we didn   t have a  refrigerator back then, at that particular time. We   d take our milk and  put it in a jug, put it on a rope and let it down into the well. Tie it on the  outside of the well. That was to keep it cold. That was the coldest milk,  the coldest milk you ever tasted. It would be so good.  In those days, I think we had purer food, even for the livestock. Now  days, they   ve got so much chemicals and things in it that it   s not good.  In those days, everything was pure. We   d go down to the creek, you   d  better not do it now. If we wanted a drink or felt like we needed a drink,  we   d just take our cup and go down and get us a drink of water. You  can   t do it now. You better not. I told them,    You   ll wake up dead.     (Laughter)  She   s the one that told me,    Grandma, you got a whole lot more to do.  God is not through with you yet, you got a lot more to do.    I told her, I  said,    I don   t know.    I said,    Well, if he just give me strength,    I said,     I   ll do it.    I said,    Just give me strength, give me health and strength  and I   ll do it.    She   s given me more courage, and she still does.  Sometimes, sometimes you feel a little bit,    Aw my goodness,    and  she   ll come along.    Grandma, I just think you   re doing wonderful.  You   re doing better than we   re doing,    such and such a thing, you  know. That gives you a lift you know. It   s just natural for you when you  get older to feel sometimes,    Oh I   m just tired. I don   t want to do that.  I   m just tired.    That   s just natural. I   m telling you now if you ever get  to a hundred you   ll say,    Oh she told me that.    (Laughter)  8  Finchum What do you think your secret is to living this long?  Randle Hard work and clean living. That is what I tell everybody. I worked  hard in the field. I worked hard at the house. Then, when I got older,  and come to town to get me a job, I worked hard there. I had sense  enough to go home and sleep when night come. I didn   t try to stay up  all night long and prowl the streets and drink. I didn   t do that. I   ve  never been a drinker. Now, Momma always had it at the house, just for  medical purposes. Daddy would always have a gallon behind the door.  We knew what it was and what it was for. None of us bothered it. Mom  would put it in our   she   d make maybe a little hot toddy, she   d call it,  at night time when we had colds. She   d give it to us. That   d just perk us  up you know. Keep the colds away. We all knew what it was for. We  never bothered. Liquor is one of the best things that you can use, if you  use it right. It   s one of the worst if you don   t use it right. I found that  out years ago. There   s nothing wrong with liquor, but it   s the way you  use it.  Finchum Would she mix something with it for her hot toddy?  Randle Well, sometimes she   d put it in a bottle and put some lemon juice in  there and sugar and different ingredients. She   d give us a spoonful of  that, now and then. That   d be our cough medicine and what have you,  tonic we   d call it. She knew how to do it. She knew a lot of things to do  that kept us going. Now a days, it   s just opposite. (Laughs) Just the  opposite.  Finchum Did she have other home remedies?  Randle Well, yes she had something called acifidity. Now, that was a germ  killer in those days. She would take that and put it in the bottle and she  would put the whiskey on that. She would give us some of that. That  was our, what would she call it? Well, it   d keep the germs out. (Laughs)  We were pretty healthy though. She always kind of kept us healthy.  Then, she   d make what you call black draught. I guess you   ve heard of  that. In the drugstore you   d have   it   s kind of a, well you   ve seen senna  leaf haven   t you? It   s kind of a ground up like senna leaf, ground up  fine. She   d take that and make a tea out of it and she would put whiskey  in that. That   s to kill the taste of it. She   d put a little sugar in and  everything. That   s to make it go down easy. That was for a laxative.  Old people had a lot of remedies that they would do, kept us going.  Kept us going.  Finchum Did she sew much?  Randle Yes, she made all of our clothes.  9  Finchum Had a treadle machine?  Randle Yes, one of those machines. You   ve seen them, huh?  Finchum Uh-huh.  Randle Yeah with the treadle, and you put your foot on there. That   s where I  learned how to sew, on that machine. Darla, have you ever seen a  sewing machine with a treadle on it?  Granddaughter Yes ma   am.  Randle That   s the kind of machine Momma had. It was a Singer.  Finchum A Singer     Randle That is when the Singers where first out. She taught us how to sew.  Then, after we started to school, we got a little bit along in grades, we  took sewing in school. That way we learned pretty well. I sewed pretty  good. Right now I don   t do too much of that. I   m just kind of, of course  we have the electric machines. We don   t have the treadles anymore. I  said I wanted to find me another treadle, just to keep it as a souvenir,  you know. I bet you   d have to pay a million dollars for it, if you found  one. That is how we learned to sew, on an old Singer, treadle Singer  machine.  Finchum Where would she get her fabric?  Randle Oh, at the dry good stores. They had stores like they have now that sold  dry goods. Fabric stores they call it now, but we had them in those days.  That is where she   d get her fabric from.  Finchum Would she do quilts as well?  Randle Yes, she taught us how to piece quilts, different patterns. I had a lot of  patterns for quilts, a lot of pretty patterns. I don   t have any of them now  though, (laughs) but I had them then. She   d teach us how to piece those  together, and then put them together. Then, make a quilt top out of it.  Then, she would get a lining, I think she called it. What was it that she  called the lining? Something like a sheet, and put it in the frame. She  would put cotton in between there, and then she put the quilt top that we  pieced on top of that. Bind it down all around. Then, we   d quilt it.  That   s how we made quilts. Of course we   d have our needle and thread,  and then we   d quilt it. Oh, we made some of the prettiest quilts. People  don   t make quilts that way no more.  10  Finchum Did her frame come from down the ceiling?  Randle Sometimes yes. She   d have it coming from the ceiling, most of the time,  sometimes she   d have it on the chairs. Most of the time it   d be coming  from the ceiling. I   d say half of the time. You   ve seen them, so that   s  the way we learned.  Finchum Well when you came to Tulsa, where did you go to school?  Randle Booker T. Washington. Well, now before I went to Washington, I did  go to Dunbar, Dunbar Grade School. Then, they moved back to the  country. (Laughs) My dad was a mover. I went to Snake Creek School,  and when we moved back to town then I was in high school, and I went  to Booker T. Washington.  Finchum Did you graduate from Booker T.?  Randle Yes, 1937.  Finchum That was my next question.  Randle (Laughs) Yep, 1937, sure did.  Finchum Did you have a favorite subject?  Randle English was my favorite subject. English, uh-huh. I loved that. Of  course I had several subjects that I liked, but English was my favorite.  Finchum Did you play sports?  Randle Well yes, we played basketball. Played basketball, but I never went on  the team and traveled. I just played at school. Oh, those old days.  (Laughs)  Finchum Well, how would you get to school?  Randle Sometimes we lived close enough to walk, and when we didn   t, we rode  the school bus. We had a school bus pick us up, just like the buses we  have now.  Finchum Did you have to work during high school?  Randle Yes, I did. After I came back to Tulsa I had a little job I did after school  and on Saturdays and on Sundays before I went to church. I did work,  yes I did.  11  Finchum So church was an important part of growing up?  Randle Yes, oh yes it was. I stayed with my grandmother part of the time. Of  course, she was a Christian you know, and    You must go to church and  Sunday school,    you know. We had to do that. I enjoyed it though. I   m  grateful for her to keep us in church and Sunday school. Otherwise, I  don   t know what I would have been like. It was quite enjoyable.  Finchum Your grandmother?  Randle Yes.  Finchum What was her name?  Randle Her name was Mary G. Benningfield.  Finchum Benningfield?  Randle Benningfield, uh-huh, long name. Yeah. It took   I know you   ve seen  the Big Chief tablets. It took a whole line across that to write my name,  Lessie Evelyn Benningfield, way across that, a whole line.  Finchum Once you graduated from high school, what did you do?  Randle Well, I took a few courses. They had what they called Extension from  Langston, and I took a few courses there. I got me a job and just went to  work. I had other sisters at home, so I saw a way to help Mom take care  of them. I just went to work. I had my nice little job. I always worked.  Finchum Doing what? What was your job?  Randle Well now I   ll tell you what, various jobs. I worked in homes, domestic,  and of course I babysat, all that sort of thing. Then I worked at the  library a while. Oh, I just had different jobs. I can   t remember all the  jobs I did have, but I worked.  Finchum You stayed busy.  Randle I stayed busy. See, I knew my mom wasn   t able to help me like I  wanted to be helped. Dad, they had those other kids. They had four  more at home. I felt like I could take that off of them.  Finchum Were you the oldest?  Randle I was. Uh-huh.  12  Finchum Were you bossy?  Randle No, they won   t tell you that. They will say no. I   d say,    I   ll tell Mom,     and let her handle it. (Laughs) I wouldn   t tell Dad too much. Dad  wasn   t much on whipping, but when he did   he whipped me one time  in my life, and I didn   t feel like a man should touch me in that respect. I  fought him. I fought my dad. Yes I did. He just got to thinking about it,  he was spanking me. He was spanking me, so I just fought him. I guess  he got kind of angry, so then after he took his hand and spanked me and  that wouldn   t do it, he took his fist. He forgot that I was a child. He was  thinking, I guess, that I was an adult. He was going to hit me with his  fist, and Momma told him no. I would   ve fought him back. I would  have. She stopped him. After that, he never touched me. He never  whipped me but that one time. I learned that whatever he told me to do,  I would go ahead and do it. I didn   t want that encounter anymore. We  got along just fine after that. I never   and that grew up in me. I never     I don   t care who the man is, I don   t want him touching me.    Don   t  touch me in the way of violence. Don   t do that, because you will get  hurt.    (Laughter)  Finchum So your mother would be the one that would discipline from then on?  Randle Oh   .yes.  Finchum What did she use?  Randle Switches.  Finchum Switches.  Randle Oh yes. She   d go out there to that peach tree and get her one of those  limbs and cut all the leaves off of it. (Laughs) Sometimes she   d get two  of them, and when she got through with you, you knew what it was  about and you wasn   t about to do that no more. She was small, not  much bigger than I am, not much bigger than I am. But that little lady  could hit so hard. Oh, she could whip. Man, oh man, when I   d see her  coming with those switches   the bad part was she would make me go  get those switches. She would make us go get the switches.  Finchum She would make you go get it?  Randle Yeah, I   d bring a little thing down there.    Go get me a switch.     (Laughs) She meant business. She meant business, but she was sweet. I  wouldn   t take anything for her.  13  Finchum What was her name?  Randle Her name was Katie, Katie May. Well, they named her Kitty, but after  Dad and her got remarried, Dad renamed her, Katie, Katie May  Benningfield. (Laughs) That was her name.  Finchum And his?  Randle His name was George Washington Benningfield.  Finchum George Washington     Randle I don   t know who named him, but that was what his name was. His dad  was George Washington. He was a junior. I never did see his dad,  because he was dead before Momma and him got married, but that was  his name. Now I saw his mother. I saw Dad   s mother, but I never saw  his dad   s daddy. Oh my goodness. Whoosh. I get to thinking sometime,     My lord, my lord. It   s been a long time.    A hundred years isn   t nothing  to sneeze at. (Laughs)  Finchum You   ve seen a lot, haven   t you?  Randle Oh I have.  Finchum Were you here in Tulsa when they had the race riot?  Randle Oh I was  I was quite small, but I remember a lot of the things about the  race riot. I remember the people coming to our house and pushing us  out of the house. We had to get out of the house. We had to leave. We  walked on out to Mohawk  Park . I   m right alongside them, tagging  along. On our way out there, the soldiers came along in a bus and  picked us up. They had to call in the soldiers it was so bad. What they  would do, they would go into the stores and pick all the food and  everything out of the store they wanted. Then, they   d set the stores on  fire, and burn the stores down. That is what they did.  Finchum They being who?  Randle I guess you   d call them, I don   t know what you   d call them. Maybe a  bunch of people, come in, I don   t know maybe called, hoodlums.  (Laughs) I just call them hoodlums. That   s what they would do, so they  had to call the soldiers in, the authorities of the town called the soldiers  in. They came in and chased them out of here.  Finchum Well, when they picked you up, where did they take you?  14  Randle Well, we went out to the fairgrounds. They took us out to the  fairgrounds. They had cots and hot soups and what have you, out there  for the people.  Finchum How long would you have to stay there before you could go back?  Randle Well, I think we might have, we might have spent the night. I don   t  remember. I think we might have spent the night out there. Then came  back the next day. It was something else to think about. Some of it I   ve  forgotten of course being so long. I do remember going out to the  fairgrounds. They had the little cots out there for us to lie on and rest  and sleep. Oh man, I tell you. It was quite a day. I never want to see that  again. No, no, no, that was awful.  The thing of it was, I don   t know why they were looking for all the  men, but they were looking for all the men. They were   I don   t know,  but they killed a lot of men. They had a flatbed truck. They tell me that  they killed those men and stacked them on the truck like you would just  sardines, and took them down to the river and threw them in the deepest  part of the river. That   s what they told us they did with them. I didn   t  see them do that. That is what they said they did with them. It was  terrible. It was terrible. They killed all the men.  They came out to our house, and we had a loft up there. They had a  cover, you know, pulled back, and they looked up in the loft. They  looked up to the loft, but they were afraid to take the cover off because  they didn   t know what was up there, looking for men. They thought  they were hiding in the loft. I don   t know why they wanted to take the  men. I never did learn why they wanted to kill the men, but they did. It  was senseless to me. I don   t see anything     Finchum Well, did your father go with you to the fairground?  Randle My father was still in the country. I was up here with my grandmother  when that happened. My father and mother was still in the country, still  at home in the country. The next morning, after all this had happened  and got cleared away, my dad hooked up his wagon and team. He was  down in Bixby, you know where that is. He hooked up his team, and he  and Mom got in the wagon and came to Tulsa. They had heard about it.  He had been to Bixby, and he heard about the riot. They were coming to  see about us in the wagon. They came up here in the wagon. Now, it  seems like it is a hundred miles or more, since we got cars. That   s the  way they traveled. That   s what they had to do, because not very many  people had a car in those days. Oh boy, you wouldn   t believe it. You  could see it yourself and you wouldn   t believe it. It was something else.  Really something. I never want to see that again. I never want to see  15  that again. It was so foolish. I don   t know what in the world the riot was  all about anyway. It just sounds so foolish to me. I just never could  make any sense out of it. That   s what they did. That   s what they did.  Finchum You would   ve been about eight or ten, somewhere along in there.  Randle Yeah, along in that area.  Finchum Well, when did you get married?  Randle Well, how old was I went I got married? In my thirties, I guess I was,  about thirty-two, three, or four, somewhere along in there. (Laughs)  Finchum A little older     Randle Yes, just a wee bit older.  Finchum That wasn   t in your big plan?  Randle No, I had plans for being a single girl all my life. That   s what I   d  dreamed of. I had an aunt who was a school teacher. She   d never  married. I kind of thought that would be a happy life. I kind of planned  on that. It didn   t happen that way. I met, I guess, the man of my life I  guess. He was a good person. We got married. Of course, we lived  together for a few years. Then, the Army came along and took him. So,  didn   t have a very long marriage life at the time. Then, he came back  from the Army. We picked up where we left off. (Laughs) Oh dear, that,  I haven   t had very much of a sweet life, I tell you. Had ups and downs.  Finchum What did he do for a living?  Randle He worked at the Oklahoma Steel Casting Company. He worked at the  steel mill right there.  Finchum What was his name?  Randle Warner Randle.  Finchum Warner.  Randle Warner Randle.  Finchum We know you had children. How many did you have?  Randle I had five.  16  Finchum Boys? Girls?  Randle Two girls and three boys. That   s my oldest daughter up there. (Gestures  to photograph) She was a naturopathic doctor, herbal doctor, is what she  was. Her name was Wanda. Of course, then after her was a boy, then  after him was the one that you saw in here. Then, another boy. Then,  the last one was a girl.  Finchum Every other     Randle Well, I had the oldest was a girl and the baby was a girl. Three boys in  between. Five kids, five lovely worry warts. (Laughs) I wouldn   t take  nothing for them though.  Finchum Did you have them at home or in the hospital?  Randle I never went to the hospital until I was a hundred years old. I took my  hundred year birthday in the hospital.  Finchum How did you manage that?  Randle Well, it just came about I guess. I was up there, one of my kids was in  the hospital and I was up there with them. I guess it must have been the  one that   s here. I guess I just got exhausted, I guess. He tells me that I  had fallen out. I don   t remember that. They tell me I had fallen out.  That   s why I was in the hospital, and I had my birthday in the hospital,  one hundredth birthday in the hospital.  Finchum Well, did you at least get cake?  Randle People came from all around. The hospital, the room was full of people.  They had another reception room there. They had all kind of food and  all kind of presents. Oh it was just   I walked in,    What   s going on?     (Laughs) It was grand, it was grand. I enjoyed it very much. Yes.  Shaking, shaking, I just counted   I said,    My goodness     But I  appreciated it, because like I say, a hundred years isn   t to be sneezed at.  (Laughs)  Finchum Well, hopefully this next one will not be in the hospital?  Randle I hope not. I   m trying to keep it from being in the hospital. I   m really  trying.  Finchum Well, do you have anything on your bucket list that you wished that you  could do that you didn   t have time or whatever?  17  Randle Did I what?  Finchum Do you have something on your bucket list, your wish list of things you  want to do?  Randle Yes, I tell you what I want to do. I want to have my house remodeled.  My being away from it and all that, there is not a great lot to be done. I  need a floor in the kitchen and in the bathroom. The bathroom and the  kitchen need to be redone. That   s about it. I need that done very badly. I  was out there day before yesterday. My son stays out there, to keep it  you know. I looked at the floors and I said,    Well, I   ve been in that  house since 1980.    I said,    You know, it   s time to have it remodeled  now.    And it is. I had it remodeled one time. You know it   s time again.  (Laughs) It   s really time again. That   s what I wish could happen. If I  could get that done, I   d be all right. The kitchen floor and the bathroom  redone over. That would be just about what I   d like to have done.  Finchum Well, have you traveled any?  Randle Yes, when she  Wanda  was alive, I traveled with her. We went  overseas once or twice. All around America we   ve traveled. Like I say,  she was in the herbal business, and we traveled with our herbs. Nature   s  Sunshine herbs, you might   ve heard of them. That was what she was  with. Yes, we traveled quite a bit. I said,    I guess I won   t be able to  travel anymore. I don   t have a traveling buddy anymore.     Bishop Where is your most favorite place you traveled to?  Randle Hawaii.  Bishop What did you like about Hawaii?  Randle Oh, I like the way they do their little dances. Then, I like their food. I  just like the place. I just like it.  Finchum Did they get you to do the hula?  Randle No, we watched them do it. We watched them. It was really pleasant. I  enjoyed it very much. Yes, yes, yes.  Finchum So, on a typical day, how early do you get up?  Randle Well, since I haven   t been feeling so well, I don   t get up very early,  about nine maybe or sometimes ten. I just lie down and rest. Try to get  my strength back again. As you might guess, I   m not as strong as I was  when I was twenty. (Laughs) I try not to overdo it.  18  Finchum And about what time do you go to bed?  Randle I try to go to bed not later than nine. I try not to go to bed not later than  nine. Sometimes we stay up and play dominos. Now this is a nice place,  but it is a lonesome place. It is lonesome. It   s quiet back here and  you   re not interrupted or anything, and that   s a problem. Nobody  comes, (laughs) not unless you invite somebody. It is just so quiet, and  so   not that I like a lot of racket, but every once in a while you like to  see somebody. (Laughs)  Finchum What do you do during the day? What are some of the things you do  during the day?  Randle Well, when I wake up, I get my reading done. I have a book, well, let  me see. I thought that was it, but it   s not. Let me see, I tell you, I do a  lot of reading. Let me show you what it is. See, this is one of them here.  It   s a little Christian book. Uh-huh. Then, here   s another right there.  Uh-huh. Yeah, the daytime books, the book that I keep all my   see, it   s  a daily reading is what it is.  Finchum Do you have to wear glasses?  Randle I don   t wear glasses. I think I need some though. I think I do.  Finchum I think it   s great that you don   t have to.  Randle I did wear glasses once upon a time, but when I finally got to where I  didn   t need them anymore, they disappeared.  Finchum You hear pretty well too   Randle I do very well at times. (Laughs)  Bishop You read a lot of books on religion?  Randle Yes, that   s what these are.  Bishop What religion are you?  Randle I   m a Jehovah   s Witness. That   s one of the books. This is it. This is  Return to Jehovah.  Bishop You keep up on things?  Randle I try to. (Laughter) I try to keep abreast of things. I sure do.  19  Finchum Well, were your parents Jehovah   s?  Randle No, my parents   I was brought up a Baptist. We got where there wasn   t  a Baptist Church. We moved where there wasn   t a Baptist Church. I  feel like this, religion is religion. Some are stronger than others perhaps,  but religion is religion. If I can   t get to this church, I   ll go to that one.  The closest one. Anytime I can hear about God and his work, and learn  more (you know we never get through learning), I just go do that. I   m  not partial. Like I say, some religions are stronger, probably, than  others, but they   re all pertaining to God. I feel like anytime I can learn  anything more about God, I   m there. I   m willing to learn.  Finchum Did you teach classes when you were younger?  Randle I taught Sunday school when I was younger.  Finchum Did you sing in the choir?  Randle I did. I did that too.  Finchum You can carry a decent tune?  Randle I can   t carry a tune in a bucket now. (Laughter) Oh shoot, but I used to  sing. I sung soprano when I was younger. They all thought I was doing  quite well. Sometimes they wouldn   t   if I couldn   t be there, they  wouldn   t sing certain songs, you know, I led them. I don   t do that  anymore. That   s a thing of the past. I don   t do that anymore.  Finchum Play any instruments?  Randle No, I   when I was younger, I played the piano a little bit, took piano  lessons, but I wasn   t very good at that. I love music. I love music,  almost any kind.  Finchum Well, would you and your husband go to dances?  Randle We didn   t go too much. He didn   t go to dances too much. We kind of  stayed around home and entertained ourselves. Now, we would go to  the movies. He loved movies. That was mostly     Bishop What theater would you go to?  Randle Well, they had a Dreamland Theater here. That was our, that was the  most one that we went to, the Dreamland Theater. They had another     20  theatre, two more theatres, but we seldom went to them. Dreamland was  our main theater. Yeah.  Finchum Would you ever travel to Boley?  Randle I think I went to Boley one time. I think I went to Boley one time. Uh-huh.  She, we made a lot of trips around though. We   d have herbal hours  and what have you, you know. I tell you, you would be surprised. You  would be surprised at the people who really need, really need that help  with herbs, and they did. You know to me, I   d rather have an herb than  have these chemicals they   re giving us now. The herbs were grown out  of the ground. I think God   s giving a lesson in that. What they do now,  they spray those, I guess herbs or whatever it is, with most anything,  then they take them and grind them up. They put them in capsules and  things and give them to you. Oh my goodness, it   s something to think  about when you think about it, really. Now, the herb, they don   t use  their chemicals on it. They grow it from the ground. They preserve it.  Put it up in the   really, I   d rather have it. I   d rather have it. I would.  Bishop Do you live alone?  Randle Me?  Bishop Uh-huh.  Randle No. I have my own house out there, but I live with my son. He   s been  sick too, had a stroke and everything. I came down to kind of be with  him. I don   t like the idea of him being by himself because when he first  got sick by himself, it was in my house when he got sick and fell out. I  think if I hadn   t been there, I don   t know if he   d be around or not today.  We found out he   d had a stroke.  Bishop You are still taking care of him?  Randle Yes, you   re right.  Bishop A mother is a mother to the end.  Randle Yes. I always say,    When are they going to take care of Lessie?     (Laughter) I always say,    When is my turn coming?    Always a mother,  always a mother. Don   t care how old or how   well I tell you, I miss  mine even as old as I am. When she went away, I said a lot of times,  things would happen, I   d say,    I   ll ask Momma.    Then,    Oh shucks, I  can   t ask Momma. She   s not there.     Finchum How did you discipline your kids? Did you send them for a switch?  21  Randle Oh, I usually had switches already, and if it wasn   t a switch it was a  strap. (Laughs) I didn   t have to do too much whipping except for the  oldest son. He was different. I had to kind of stay on him. This one here  was a crybaby. (Laughter) (Crying noises) The youngest one, the  youngest son, he was always on the go. Always on the go. I didn   t have  to do too much whipping with him. One thing about him, he would  never tell me a story. He would never lie to me, the youngest one. They  would tell me something, the others would tell me something, and I   d  say,    Paul did that happen?       No, Momma that didn   t happen.     (Laughs)  Bishop If you ever wanted the truth, you went to the baby?  Randle Yeah, I   d ask him, if I knew he knew about it.  Granddaughter Grandma, you didn   t talk about my momma.  Randle Huh?  Granddaughter You didn   t talk about Momma.  Randle Don   t talk about your mother.  Granddaughter I said you did not.  Randle Oh, your momma, oh I never had any problems out of her. I said I  didn   t have no problems out of my girls. I didn   t have any problem out  of the oldest one because she, well really, her momma was my sister   s  daughter, but I adopted her when my sister passed, so she was the same  as my daughter. She was always a very obedient good child. I never had  any problems out of her whatsoever. Never did. Of course, I didn   t have  any problems out of her either, that one up there  Wanda .  Granddaughter Tell her name  Randle Her name was Doris, Doris Jean. That gave me three girls and three  boys. My son and I were talking about this this morning. I said,    You  know, God has really been good to me. He brought me through with  these six children.    Plus, my sister had a child that was three weeks  younger than her  Doris . I nursed both of them at the same time. Well,  her doctor said her milk wasn   t good, but he said,    You can nurse him.        Oh my goodness, I got one already.    He said,    You can nurse him.    I  had enough milk for both of those children. So, I nursed them together.  He lives in Denver. He comes back every now and then, and I told him  about when he was young, how I nursed him. He was like,    No wonder  22  I keep coming back.    (Laughter) He   s a mess. He is a mess. Sweet  child, just a very sweet child.  Finchum You have a really good sense of humor.  Randle Well, I try to have because I found out if you do, it   s a lot better than  not having one because you can get stuck behind seriousness. I   m  serious about a lot of things, but you can get too serious. That will make  you sick. That will, it will make you sick. I found that out so I try to,  you know. Goodness knows, I don   t need to be sick anymore.  Finchum Laugh when you can.  Randle Yes. Laughter, I think, is a very good medicine, if you can laugh.  Sometimes, I used to when I was younger, I would just be grinning all  the time. Some of the children asked me,    What are you laughing  about?    I said,    Just because I can.    (Laughter) I used to have a  beautiful grin. I had good teeth and all that kind of thing. I   d just be  smiling every      What are you smiling about? What are you laughing  about?    I said,    Just because I can.    (Laughs)  Finchum Well, who taught you how to drive?  Randle Well, I   ve forgotten who taught me, but I didn   t drive too much.  Finchum When did you give it up?  Randle Well, when I had my oldest child I guess. I guess. Then, I got someone  to teach them how to drive. Every one of them knew how to drive, and  I   d buy a car. Let them   really and truly, all of them had their own little  cars. I have bought twelve cars in my life. Twelve cars.  Finchum That   s a lot.  Randle It is. I was telling them yesterday, I   ve got the certificate to ten of them.  Two of them, the last two, I don   t have. I don   t have, I don   t know what  happened to them, but I   ve bought twelve cars, twelve cars. I wanted  them to have transportation, and so when they got big enough to drive, I  didn   t have to drive. They   d take me where I wanted to go. (Laughs)  But, I wanted to have transportation. I always wanted to have my own,  because sometimes, you know, people have other things to do. They  don   t have time to take you places you want to go. I felt like it was  easier to get a driver than it was to get a car ride with somebody. I tried  to have a car available. I tell you, oh man, I   ve been through it. I have  been through it.  23  Finchum Well, when your husband was in the war, did he write letters back to  you?  Randle All the time, all the time, all the time.  Finchum Did you keep them?  Randle I kept them for a long time. Now, I don   t know where a lot of that stuff  is. I guess it kind of got throwed away after so long a time, I guess. We  moved and a lot of time every time you move, you lose something.  (Laughs) He always wrote to me. He always kept in touch.  Bishop What about the Great Depression? Do you remember the Depression  times? Did they affect you any?  Randle Yes, I kind of remember not having things that we were probably used  to having. I remember the food shortage. That   s the most thing that I  can remember, the food shortage. It came upon the time when we didn   t  have meat like we used to have, the hogs and the cattle and things like  that to kill. We   d have to substitute. I remember Momma making a big  pan of gravy and a pan of biscuits, so we had biscuits and gravy. We  didn   t have meat because we, I don   t know, something happened. It  seems like it just got among the livestock and just kind of killed them  off. We just didn   t have it anymore, like we used to have. I remember  that. That was a bad time too, didn   t have any meat you know. But we  made it. Momma did a lot of canning and preserving and what have  you. We made it. I remember that biscuits and gravy. (Laughs) Pretty  good too when you   re hungry.  Bishop You just preferred the meat with it?  Randle Yeah, I   d like to have a little piece of meat (laughs) or a slice of bacon  or something.  Finchum How often would you get a new pair of shoes?  Randle Well, we kept in shoes. We weren   t so hard on our shoes, we kept in  shoes. I can remember having a pair for every day, wear them for  school, and a pair for Sunday. Those were the lace up type at that time.  That   s what they had. Later on, of course we got slippers with buttons. I  look back on my school time, and I say those were the good old days,  those were the good old days. Right now, sometimes, sometimes we  wonder. I guess everybody have those times. Sometime I wonder,    Lord  how did we get in this fix?    (Laughs) Shoot.  Finchum Well, back in those days, for school you had to wear dresses?  24  Randle Yes, we did. We girls wore dresses. We didn   t wear pants in those days,  like in my early days. Of course in later days, we wore what we wanted  to wear as long as it was decent you know, in later days, but back in the  early days, no, we didn   t wear anything but dresses was all. We made  our dresses. Mom made all of our clothes until I got big enough to sew.  I remember her making a little dress one time for me. It was a little  gingham dress. It was a little orange check, medium check. She put  little sashes on it and I tied them. Oh I was just   (laughter) oh lord, I  think those were the good ole days. We just didn   t know it. (Laughter)  Finchum How would she do laundry?  Randle Oh she had a washboard and tub. She had two tubs, of course. She had  one to wash. The other one, you rinsed in it, put a little bluing in the  water. I don   t know if you   ve seen bluing.  Finchum It   s been a long time.  Randle Uh-huh. Put a little bluing in the water makes the clothes clean. We   d  wash them on the washboard, the rubboard, with the soap. Then we   d  wring them out and put them over in this tub. We   d rinse them in that  tub. Sometimes we   d rinse them twice. Sometimes we   d rinse them  through the clear water first, and then we   d rinse them again through the  bluing water. If they were kind of soapy, we   d do that you know. We  had the prettiest laundry. You   d go by the countryside and see people  with their clothes hanging out on clotheslines. They   d be so pretty and  white and look so beautiful. So, we didn   t miss anything. (Laughs)  Finchum Then iron? Ironed everything?  Randle Yeah, we had some irons. We would iron it. We would heat our irons  on the stove most of the time, and then, later on, electric come into play,  we   d have electric irons. That was   back in those days, we had those  irons that we heated on the stove. You could do the most beautiful  laundry with that. Some people say,    My goodness, I don   t think I   d  like that. That   s too much work.    (Laughs) Well, that   s all we had at  that time.  Finchum Would you do it outside in the wintertime too?  Randle No, we   d do that in the house. We did that in the house.  Finchum The washing?  25  Randle Oh, the washing yes. We   d do the washing in the kitchen usually when  it was in the wintertime. No, we wouldn   t do it outdoors in the  wintertime. We   d do it usually in the kitchen, because that   s all we had,  a kitchen and then maybe have a little living room, then the bedroom,  that   s all we   d have. That   s what we   d do, do it in the kitchen. We  managed. We managed. We managed.  Finchum In your lifetime, what do you think is the biggest invention?  Randle Well, I don   t know what I would say. Oh, I guess, I just really don   t  know what I would say with so many things. I guess maybe learning  how to, I don   t know what would be the   there are so many things.  Finchum Electricity came along     Randle Yeah, electricity came along. That just solved a lot of problems. A lot  of problems.  Finchum Refrigeration and indoor plumbing.  Randle Refrigeration was really one of the biggest ones I guess. We could save  our food now. Sometimes we   d cook enough for the next meal, and we  could put it in the refrigerator and save it until time to fix the next meal  and take it out and heat it up, and have another meal. Refrigerator, I  imagine refrigerator was probably the biggest one. We could still cook  on the cook stove. I think that refrigeration would be it.  Finchum After the summer we   ve had, they   d say air conditioning.  Randle Well, you mean in those days?  Finchum You wouldn   t have it in those days.  Randle Huh?  Finchum You didn   t have it in those days. Air conditioning?  Randle No, we didn   t have air conditioning in those days. Somehow or another  we managed to make it through. No, we didn   t have air conditioning in  those days. Later on, we got the fans. They came first. Then, the big box  air conditioning. We had that. Then, of course, the ones like we have  now. It seems to me like we did better then than we   re doing now. It  does. It seems like we did better then than we   re doing now. I don   t  know.  Finchum We get a little spoiled. We get a little spoiled.  26  Randle We are, we are very spoiled, sure enough.  Bishop Do you remember the first time you voted?  Randle First time what?  Bishop You voted?  Randle Yes, I remember, let me see, I don   t know how old I was then. I  remember registering to vote, and then we voted. I was, course I was  grown. I remember that. I don   t know. No, no, it   s been such a long,  long time. Some of the things I   ve forgotten.  Bishop Well, when history is written, what would you like it to say about you?  Randle Oh lord. (Laughs)  Bishop How do you want to be remembered?  Randle I don   t know. I just don   t know what I   d like to be remembered for. I  just don   t know what I   d like them to say about me. I really hadn   t  given much thought to it. No thought to it really.  Granddaughter I   ll tell you.  Randle Huh?  Granddaughter I   ll tell you.  Randle All right.  Granddaughter The greatest grandma that ever lived.  Randle That   s my girl. (Laughs) You say what hon?  Granddaughter The greatest grandmother there is.  Randle Why thank you. That   s, well     Granddaughter That   s it.  Randle Well, that   s it.  Bishop Did you ever think you would make it to one hundred?  27  Randle No, no. I never thought.  Finchum No parents or siblings made it?  Randle Yes, we have a grand-uncle that made it to a hundred and five. Course  my mom and dad didn   t make it to a hundred. I think Mom was eighty-two  and Dad was ninety-two I believe when they passed on. I think that  was about it. Yes. My grandchildren and my great-grandchildren   now,  I have grands, great-grands, and great-great-grands.  Finchum How do you keep up with all of them?  Randle I don   t. I can   t. I can   t. (Laughs) I can   t. I tell you, I wouldn   t take  anything for any of them.  Finchum They keep up with you?  Randle No, they   re usually away from me. They don   t hardly get to come over  here very much unless we give some kind of a get-together. They all  love me. Every time they see me they come and    Grandma.    That  makes you feel good, I tell you. Uh-huh. I never dreamed that I   d live to  have great-great   I never thought it.  Finchum Are any of them named after you?  Randle No, none of them are named after me.  Finchum No Lessies?  Randle No, I had never thought about that. No, none of them are named after  me.  Finchum They could use it for a middle name if nothing else.  Randle Well, I tell you, the next time I think one of them is going to have one,  I   m going to say,    Name them Lessie.    (Laughs) I   ll do that. I had  never thought of that, really. (Laughs) That   s an idea   Finchum Well, is there anything else you want to add before we close?  Randle Well, I don   t know. I don   t know. Darla?  Granddaughter Yes.  Randle Is there anything else you can think of to add?  28  Granddaughter Just to continue living your long life.  Randle Huh?  Granddaughter Just to continue to live your long life.  Randle Oh, just to continue to live my long life.  Finchum Aiming for a hundred and five? A hundred and six?  Randle Or a hundred and ten, I wouldn   t care. I told them,    I wouldn   t care if I  got two hundred if I can handle myself. I don   t want to be in anybody   s  way because everybody has their own stuff to do.    Now days, it takes  all your time, almost, to do what you got to do. You don   t have time for  it. I don   t want to be in anybody   s way. I   ve always been independent.  Took care of myself, and others of course. I don   t want to ever have  nobody do anything. As long as I can take care of myself, I don   t care  how old I get. It wouldn   t matter at all.  Granddaughter That   s right.  Finchum Well, we thank you very much for talking with us today. It   s been a  pleasure.  Randle Well, I   m glad. We thank you for being over.  Granddaughter Yes, thank you guys.  -------  -------
