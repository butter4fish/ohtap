Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Will Hall] side.  We'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Mayme Jaunita [Shelvin] Hall, M-A-Y-M-E, J-A-U-N-I-T-A, Hall, H-A-L-L.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: You got me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you get us close to it?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Well, you were born in 1916.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: About how old was she when you were born?
Speaker 2: I was the third child, so, and she was a small-town schoolteacher, so I would, I'd say she would have to be twenty or thirty when I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, so maybe 1890 or thereabouts, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, okay, all right.  Now, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: No idea.
Speaker 1: Okay, was she born in Texas or--
Speaker 2: In Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it Yoakum [Texas]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It was another town?
Speaker 2: Somewhere else.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well--
Speaker 2: You upgraded when you got to Yoakum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Yoakum was a better situation than some of the others?
Speaker 2: Much better--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --railroad center, jobs, money market, industry, an economic hub.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: My mother's side, Priscilla Shelvin was a gifted entrepreneur.  She was born a slave, but she immediately put her children into school and sent all of 'em to school, all of 'em to college, though she had no education.  And memory serves that she worked for a white family in Houston [Texas], so she sent her children to college because the whites sent their kids to college.  And so my Uncle Elijah [Shelvin] and my mother, Mayme, went to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your, your, Priscilla Shelvin was your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Priscilla Shelvin.
Speaker 1: Right, she was your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And she was born during slavery?
Speaker 2: Born during slavery.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she would have had to have been born in the 1860s at least, I guess to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, at least.
Speaker 1: --have been born, yeah.  So what colleges, what college did your mother go to?
Speaker 2: Probably Guadalupe [College, Seguin, Texas]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Guadalupe and--
Speaker 1: That's G-U-A--
Speaker 2: G-A-U-D-A-L-U-P-E [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was Guadalupe a black college?
Speaker 2: Black, religious college.  Southern Baptists started putting colleges all over the South.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any, are there any stories from your mother's side of the family about slavery, or about Reconstruction, or about what it was like in those days?
Speaker 2: Like what?
Speaker 1: Well, stories of things that happened to people, you know, good times or bad times or--
Speaker 2: My grandmother evidently was--found favor with a wealthy white family in Houston or something.  And so she would work for them and then come back to her family, and in turn pick up their idealism from their children to use on her children.  And so she sent her last two children to college.
Story_ID: 288044
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Mayme Shelvin Hall] talk about growing up at all to you?
Speaker 2: My mama was, my mother was a genius.  She came out and started teaching in the rural sixth grade school or fourth grade school, whatever the county would allow.  And she taught all over southwest Texas.  In every village she had taught somewhere.  So when we were growing up, we had, we went back to Yoakum [Texas] because that was where my father [Will Hall] had his business, but we went to school all over southwest Texas.  Everywhere mother taught school, we went to school, Westhoff [Texas], or wherever else she was teaching school, and we constantly went to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was your mother's personality like?
Speaker 2: Very, very scholarly, very brilliant, very studious, very strict, very erudite.  She was, she and her brother, Elijah [Shelvin], were, would have been rated I suppose as geniuses if they'd had a good chance--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --profoundly brilliant people.  He came out with a system.  And some of the kids that he turned out and went to high school, and went to major colleges, they asked where did they learn their mathematics from, and they learned them from E.J. Shelvin in that little one-room schoolhouse.  They were borderline geniuses.
Speaker 1: Now is there, now a lot of people, you know, say their relatives are smart, you know, but you're saying that they, you think they were geniuses.  Is--
Speaker 2: Borderline, yeah.
Speaker 1: --is there, is there, is there any stories you can tell us about how--
Speaker 2: No, I mean the kind of mathematics they did, he dealt in was the kind of stuff that when they went to school at accredited colleges, the colleges were amazed that they had had this kind of instruction coming from one-teacher schoolhouses.  And E.J. Shelvin later became principal of some kind of junior college and principal of a high school.  If they had had any chance, any training, any doors to open, they would have gone on to the top.
Story_ID: 288045
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Will Hall.
Speaker 1: Okay, Will Hall, is it--
Speaker 2: It's as simple as that, eight letters--
Speaker 1: Will Hall, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --eight letters.
Speaker 1: Okay, Will Hall.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  He was older than my mother [Mayme Shelvin Hall].
Speaker 1: Okay, so, say maybe 1880 or 1885?
Speaker 2: Do the best you can.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right, okay, and he was, was he born in Yoakum [Texas]?
Speaker 2: Not hardly, Hallettsville [Texas]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Hallettsville.
Speaker 1: Hallsville?
Speaker 2: Border line, Hallettsville.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And well, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: They were landowners.  His father owned forty acres of land, that I have some kind of claim to some of it.  And they were doing quite well as long as farming was prosperous.  His mother was the genius in the family though.  Renetta Hall [ph.], she opened up the largest hotel in Yoakum, Texas, and a rooming house.  And I used to pump gasoline in her filling station as a boy.
Speaker 1: So she had a rooming house and a gas station?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: That's, that's--
Speaker 2: --and a hotel.  And all of the traffic that flowed through went to her hotel.  Had she had any kind of franchise, of course, she would have gone on into big business, but no, it was not to be.  It was amazing that she could have that much enterprise and build it in--Yoakum at that time was booming.  It was a railroad hub.  And the roundhouse was in Yoakum, so they had to bring the engines back to Yoakum to get them ready to run on the Southern Pacific Line [Southern Pacific Railroad; Southern Pacific Transportation Company].  And skilled black men, who did the work on the engines, had to have housing, and that meant they had to have good housing for those men, the level of income they had.  And built a whole thriving black economic community with good businesses on Front Street in Yoakum, Texas--
Speaker 1: Now that's something that we've, you know--
Speaker 2: --112 East Hochheim Street.  And when the, when I had got in college [Bishop College, Marshall, Texas], they started talking about integrated communities, that blacks live with whites.  And I said, "What do you mean?"  They said, "Well, blacks don't live with whites."  I said, "Well, Zack [ph.] Sheckels was white with blue eyes, and he lived right across the street from me.  I was at 112 East Hochheim Street, and I've been the same color all my life.  So what do you mean they don't live with blacks?"  And he said, "Huh?"  I said, "Yeah, he's still there."  But, you know, this segregated pattern was not solid all over the South, and the Southwest was, was different from the South anyhow, the stuff that they couldn't do or couldn't go to, Yoakum and Cuero [Texas], Victoria [Texas], San Antonio [Texas].  Go, the further you went west, the more civilized it became.
Speaker 1: Okay, but East Texas was more like the South then, right?
Speaker 2: More like the South--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the further you got east, the tighter it got, the more intense the black pressure, the more rigid the lines.  So by the time I was principal of the school in East Texas, they would tell me where I couldn't park my car on the streets.  I had to park over on the railroad tracks.  And of course, I was jumping the fence to park my car where I wanted to.  I bought my own license coming from southwest Texas--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --two different, two different worlds almost.
Story_ID: 288046
Speaker 1: What do you know about your father's [Will Hall] growing up?  I mean how did he grow up?
Speaker 2: He became a barber, very, very talented, ran the rooming house for his mother [Renetta Hall (ph.)], had several brothers, and they were the Halls.  And when they had the parade on the 19th of June [Juneteenth], which is still celebrated in parts of the South, he was the grand marshal.  He rode the horse that pranced and had the painted feet.  And he was Mr. Will Hall, white, black, Mexican, everybody--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --had the biggest, one of the biggest businesses in town--
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) until the crash came.  And when the crash came in '29 [1929] and closed down the railroad shop, the whole thing went boom.  All the industry moved to Houston [Texas], left Yoakum [Texas] on the rocks.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in 1929, when the stock market crashed--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it was, caused the end of Yoakum as a popular--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it, the money was gone; the shops closed; payroll was gone.  People went southwest to Kingsville [Texas] and, or to Houston or to San Antonio [Texas], went to Yoakum.  The economy was, was blown.
Speaker 1: You were about thirteen years old then I guess, right, about thir- yeah.
Speaker 2: I remember the [Great] Depression though, a dollar a week if you could get it.
Speaker 1: So did the black businesses all close up, you know, basically after the stock market crashed in--
Speaker 2: Black businesses folded with everything else.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The barbershops, a cluster of businesses that you had on Front Street, they had no customers who had any money.  They couldn't get a haircut 'cause they couldn't pay for it.
Speaker 1: Let me go back a minute and talk about Juneteenth.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You said your father was a grand marshal in the Juneteenth parade on June the 19th (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --every year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what you know of the history of Juneteenth?
Speaker 2: Very little.  The only thing I know about it, my daddy was a parade marshal.  He'd have a horse that pranced, and he was a skilled rider.  He headed the parade.  They paraded downtown Yoakum, and it was expected and protected.  It was Juneteenth for Yoakum.  He was Mr. Will Hall.  He was a major entrepreneur, one of the strong businessmen of that small community until the economic crash hit.
Speaker 1: Okay, but in terms of what is the significance of Juneteenth?  What does it commemorate?
Speaker 2: It was the emancipation of the blacks from slavery.  Juneteenth, that was when the blacks were emancipated, free at last, free at last.
Speaker 1: And that's when that part of Texas got the news, right?
Speaker 2: That's when Texas got the news--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --June 19th.
Story_ID: 288047
Speaker 1: Is there a story that you know of how your parents met?
Speaker 2: How my parents met?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: How my parents met, I have no idea.  Will Hall was the most popular thing in Yoakum [Texas].  His mother [Renetta Hall (ph.)] ran the biggest boardinghouse.  She had some sons who were dashing.  Mayme [Shelvin] Hall was a redhead black woman whose mama [Priscilla Shelvin] sent her to college [Guadalupe College, Seguin, Texas].  While the other people were going to cotton fields, Mayme went to college.  And what else is there to be told?  Will Hall looked over and saw Mayme and decided that she was to his liking, I reckon.  And when I knew anything, they had bought 112 East Hochheim Street.  All of us were born in the same house.  We lived right across the street from the mayor of the village, which when I studied sociology later in college [Bishop College, Marshall, Texas], was unexpected, not allowed legally, and didn't happen according to what they said, but it happened in Yoakum though.
Speaker 1: Okay, the mayor was the white man that lived across the street?
Speaker 2: White man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His name is Sheckels.  He ran the ice plant, S-H-E-C-K-E-L-S.  He had a son named Zach, and we used to shoot marbles together, Zach Sheckels.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now that's a--
Speaker 2: --the kind of prejudice that you ran into in East Texas, I never knew, I never knew that.
Speaker 1: Now that's a, Sheckels is a German name, right?  And--
Speaker 2: Right, Yoakum is a German town, Yoakum, Yoakum, German town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My dad spoke German and also English.  They came from those farms out there.  We owned the land.  And his sister went further east, and bought up the land, and went into cattle.  They did quite well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any other stories from your parents that have been passed down that, you know, about life, you know, before you were born that you can tell us?
Speaker 2: Any other stories about your parents.  You know, I suppose you and your skills have picked up the, you picked up the skeleton.  You've done a nice job.  You picked the pieces and made me pull the meat out off the bones.  They ought to give you a five cent raise.
Speaker 1: At least, right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 288048
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of what?
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights, the sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights, smells, sounds of?
Speaker 1: Growing up, growing up.
Speaker 2: Of growing up.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Not in the, not in Yoakum [Texas].  Yoakum was--when they flooded and my wife [Lucy Lewis Hall] came from Cuero [Texas].  And she said, "Oh, they're flooding, they're flooding; everything's being washed away."  I said, "Not in Yoakum."  She said, "Yeah."  I said, "Not in Yoakum."  So I had to call long distance to a friend of mine so that my wife could hear from Yoakum.  Yoakum is a city set on a hill.  There wasn't no way for Yoakum to flood.  Those Germans built it on a hill, and it couldn't flood, Yoakum.  The creek couldn't rise that high.  Now Cuero and that other land that was down near Guadalupe [College, Seguin, Texas], they could flood but not Yoakum.  Yoakum was on a hill.  And so I talked to Ms. Jameson [ph.] in Yoakum.  She said, "Oh no, Reverend, we're high and dry."  And then my poor wife in Cuero, they got washed out.  All the land is still left, but the house got wiped away.
Speaker 1: Now, sir, how do you spell Cuero?
Speaker 2: C-U-E-R-O; it's Spanish.  When you get to that line where the Germans met the Mexicans, then the languages change.  So, being a Christian, I learned to cuss in Mexican and fight in German.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what I was asking you was to describe for us, you know, what it looked like in your neighborhood when you grew up, what it smelled like, and what it sounded like.  What were the sounds, the sights, and smells in, you know, in--
Speaker 2: In Yoakum?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Ain't no sights and sounds.  I was in the white neighborhood, but the white neighborhoods don't have no sights and sounds or smell.  The creek doesn't rise in the white neighborhood.  The creek rises in the colored neighborhood or in the flooded areas the creek rises.  But if you were able to buy land that was high, the creek didn't rise, you know.
Speaker 1: Sir, what did your neighborhood look like?
Speaker 2: Green grass, painted houses.
Speaker 1: How big were the houses, and what were they made out of?
Speaker 2: Wood, insulated, and when the, when paving came through, our street got paved.  Will Hall's house one, you want a plush number, 112 East Hochheim Street, Yoakum, Texas.  That's right, right downtown.  You could walk to work in six minutes.  He got the land because his mama [Renetta Hall (ph.)] owned the biggest hotel in town when he was a boy, and had money.  And the railroad shop was booming.
Speaker 1: Now sir, was the hotel integrated?
Speaker 2: I have no idea, but I imagine they bought gas, whoever wanted to buy gas, bought gas from the old, from the C pump gas and rented rooms and served meals.  And she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you think she basically had a--
Speaker 2: --she was an entrepreneur.
Speaker 1: --black, she had a black clientele in the hotel mainly--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and well, then you had the railroad shop and with all those jobs, those highly-skilled, good-paying jobs.  And you know, money's coming in, and the railroad is going, Southern Pacific [Railroad; Southern Pacific Transportation Company] is booming.
Speaker 1: Now sir, do, how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: Me?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir?
Speaker 2: One each.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where do you fall?  Are you in the middle or at--
Speaker 2: I'm at the bottom.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're the baby brother, I guess.
Speaker 2: Who winds up picking up the load for everybody.
Story_ID: 289395
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about two stories we talked about during the break.  One is a story about what your mother said she was doing to educate--your grandmother, right--
Speaker 2: My grandmother.
Speaker 1: --said about educating her children.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what is that story, about the cotton and the head?
Speaker 2: That they wanted her to take Mayme [Shelvin Hall] out of school so she could make some money.  And my grandmother said she was gonna put Mayme's cotton in her head and not in the sack, that she's gonna send her to school and let her learn something so she could come back and do something, where everybody else was sending our kids to the cotton patch to scrap cotton or to pick cotton 'cause it was instant money.  My grandmother, Priscilla [Shelvin], who probably never weighed over eighty-five pounds, wet with three aprons, and four kimonos on, and two pair of high-top shoes, but she had an insight, and she sent her kids to school while the others were sending their kids to the cotton patch to make their dollar a day and dinner.  And turned out, she was the one who was wise.
Story_ID: 289396
Speaker 1: There was another story about Will Hall's brother having killed a white man.  Now what, what about, what do you know about that story?
Speaker 2: That one is lost in ghosts and mist andshadows.  You don't know who the brother was.  He got, mixed up on who did it or how it was done, where did he go.  The closest thing that I got to it was that they decided that one of the Hall boys killed a white person.  And so they got Will Hall to make him stand trial because he was a Hall, and the case went to trial.  And my daddy said he was innocent, and the jury, with the exception of one white man, said he was guilty.  And the one white man hung the jury down to the last that Will Hall was innocent and spared his life.  But if the other brother was guilty, he never came back.  And tradition says he changed his name, and we never met him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he left town and never came back?
Speaker 2: No, he changed his name--
Speaker 1: Changed his name, okay.
Speaker 2: --wrote it under another name, whatever.  But we never, we never, we never, never heard, never, never (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --heard tell of him--
Story_ID: 289397
Speaker 1: What kind of a little boy were you growing up?  What did you like to do, and what did you do?
Speaker 2: My brother [Willie J. Hall] was an extrovert and an athlete.  And, he could do everything.  I was nearsighted and wore eyeglasses, couldn't half see even with the eyeglasses and was always falling down over something, or not seeing something.  And I don't know how, I don't know he did it, but we didn't have a car, and we'd have to go to church on Sunday night.  And the church was about eight blocks away from the house.  And I'd go to sleep at the church, and brother would get me by the hand, and I'd wake up the next day in the bed.  We didn't have no car, so it meant that I'd walk home asleep, and somebody put me to bed.  So, I don't know how you do that one, but it worked, it, psychologically it worked.  That's a matter of the advance psych, psychology I suppose, eight or ten blocks, small town, quiet.  If there'd been some bad dogs or some shooting, people with pistols, I suppose I'd been running, but it was a quiet village.  And my brother was wide awake, and he was strong.  Next question.
Speaker 1: Okay, I was asking you what did you like to do, and were there any things that bothered, I mean in addition to the things--well, tell us the things you liked to do.
Speaker 2: I liked music.  I liked music.  I, my sister [Viney Mae Hall] was a musician, and I was copying after her.
Speaker 1: Was she a singer, sir, or what did she play?
Speaker 2: Pianist.
Speaker 1: She played the piano?
Speaker 2: Yeah, of some sort.  And I finally got a chance to go off to school that taught skills, which helped me go to college 'cause in that, in the school in Austin, Texas [Texas Deaf, Dumb and Blind Institute for Colored Youth; Texas School for the Deaf, Austin, Texas], state capital, I learned cleaning and pressing; I learned piano; I learned choral music, voice; and I learned lots of arts that I never would have seen in the typical colored school in Texas.
Story_ID: 289398
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you tell us the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: Grade school would be the Westhoff Elementary School [Westhoff, Texas].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what, what was the name again?
Speaker 2: Westhoff, W-E-S-T-H-O-F-F.
Speaker 1: Oh, Westhoff, okay.
Speaker 2: Wherever mama, where my mother [Mayme Shelvin Hall] taught school that's where we went.  She took us where she was.
Speaker 1: So you went to a variety of schools?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, she would change schools every year or two, and she took us wherever she was teaching.
Speaker 1: So what, what grade school did you finish at?
Speaker 2: Elementary?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Elementary, I probably finished elementary school, I probably finished Asbury Elementary [Asbury High School] in Yoakum [Texas], but I left there, left there and went to DD and B in Austin [Texas], where I picked up all of my crafts and skills.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of the school in Austin again?
Speaker 2: DD and B.
Speaker 1: DDNB?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and there--
Speaker 1: Do you know what, do, do you know what that stood for, DDNB?
Speaker 2: DD and B, [Texas] Deaf, Dumb and Blind Institute [for Colored Youth; Texas School for the Deaf, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had the musicians who came in from Ohio.  You had the skilled vocalist, Ann Grant, from New York.  We had the best music department outside of a black college in the whole State of Texas.  We sang for state legislature every two years, had the strongest budget.  And you learned piano, learned tailoring, learned carpeting, learned, and in fact, the whole ball of wax was available if you studied.
Speaker 1: Now did they consider you blind at that point or--
Speaker 2: Handicapped.
Speaker 1: Handicapped, okay, 'cause you were visually impaired, basically.
Speaker 2: Visually impaired.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had bad eyes, and I could get in.  And it made the difference then when I hit the ground.  I had some skills that I didn't know that I had.  And later, that later got me through college [Bishop College, Marshall, Texas], 'cause when I decided to go back to college and finish, I went back as a press, a wool presser in East Texas, 350 miles away.  And I got a job pressing wools for ten cents an hour, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that good in those days?
Speaker 2: That was money.  I finally went up to thirty-five cents an hour, and I knew I was rich.
Story_ID: 289399
Speaker 1: Now, let me go back to high school [Texas Deaf, Dumb and Blind Institute for Colored Youth; Texas School for the Deaf, Austin, Texas] for a second and--
Speaker 2: Come on.
Speaker 1: --just ask you about some of the teachers.  You, you mentioned some of them, but, in the music department and how good they were.  I mean--
Speaker 2: The Bledsoes, the famous Bledsoes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what were they famous for, the Bledsoes?
Speaker 2: Music, instrumental music, came out of New York, and the Grants, Helen Grant and her sister [Ann Grant], vocalists.
Speaker 1: Helen Grant?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Bland from Ohio.  We had--
Speaker 1: Not--
Speaker 2: --we had--
Speaker 1: --James [A.] Bland?
Speaker 2: Lemuel Carlyle Bland [ph.].
Speaker 1: Was he related to the famous James Bland?
Speaker 2: He was a pure classical musician.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when radios were impossible to find or couldn't do, Anthony Boyd Crawley [ph.], who was the principal of our high school, could build a radio, so he'd just build radios on the campus.
Speaker 1: Anthony Boyd Crawley, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, but it was an amazing collection of--I think the reason for it was that, here was a pocket where the system let a black man become superintendent of the school, but he could invite his faculty from anywhere in the country.  And he invited the best faculty he could get for the money available from anywhere in America.  And he invited 'em from New York to Ohio to everywhere.  And we sang every two years for state legislature, and never got our grants turned down.  We had the best music department.  And the music that they did is the kind of stuff that I haven't got my choir up to yet, and that's been a hundred years ago.  Mine still won't go black boogie and boogie woogie.  And I say what about concar de la TTR [ph.]?  And they look at me like I just left the boat in Mississippi somewhere.  But it was the difference in exposure.  And you keep trying to raise, oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good, and they wanna stomp and say thank you Jesus, thank you, Jesus, to hard rock.  Well, they're subject to their environments.  And if all they hear in Chicago [Illinois] is hard rock, then this is the only thing they think is class.  And when I got here, there was one kid who was trying to go to college, one kid.  And I said that don't make no sense, one kid out of all these folks, a houseful of folks.  And I said, "No that'll never do," and I got on the warpath.  "Why can't we?  Why can't our kids go to college?"  "Well, the West Side or whatever, they're poor."  I said, "Ah, come on, you spend more money than that on homebrew."  And Jodie [ph.] and all the rest of it--and this year we had seventeen kids finish college from the same little corner.
Speaker 1: From, from this church [Friendship Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --good schools all of them, stretched across.  Graduating from four-year accredited colleges, and I just said thank you, Jesus.

Speaker 1: Sir, let me take you back to high school [Texas Deaf, Dumb and Blind Institute for Colored Youth; Texas School for the Deaf, Austin, Texas] for a second and--
Speaker 2: Do your best.
Speaker 1: Now did, when you were in high school, did you participate, did you have clubs in high school and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you, were you the member of any of the clubs in high school?
Speaker 2: Everything available.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Music, scholarship.  I thought I was gonna be a genius once upon a time, until I met you, and then I decided I missed it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Thank you.  It's an exaggeration.  But let me, so when you were in high school, you were playing the piano, and you had a scholar--
Speaker 2: Everything.
Speaker 1: --your music schol- you were doing most everything, did you run for class office?  Did you have class president and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I was everything.  I was a brain when I was your age.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a brain.  I was a brain.  I was, I knew I was going somewhere.  I was raring to go and in a hurry to get there and wondering why I hadn't already made it.  And then came the [Great] Depression, and there wasn't no more money.
Speaker 1: So what year--
Speaker 2: Then I went to work for--what did I go to work for, six dollars a week, six dollars a month?  Let us starve to death and decided that I was gonna starve to death anyway, so I may as well go to college and starve; hitchhiked 350 miles, got a ride to Bishop College [Marshall, Texas]; paid thirty-two dollars to get in and was broke and couldn't get in the dining hall, had to wait until Monday, the dining hall opened up.  And they opened up Monday, I paid my thirty-two dollars and didn't even both about registration.  I went straight to dining hall to eat.  I made the whole weekend on peanut butter and jelly, ah, come on.  I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Thirty-three [1933].
Story_ID: 289401
Speaker 1: Okay, 1933, and then you, you started college that same year, or did you--
Speaker 2: No, Lord, no.  Yeah, I started college, but I didn't make it.  I didn't make it.  I started, but I didn't get nowhere.
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The bottom fell out.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: The economy died.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you start Bishop College [Marshall, Texas] in thir--1933?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Forty-four [1944].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had to work before you--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --had a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: I'd starved, good little dollar a day at dinner, compress five hundred pound bales of cotton, cutting down trees, ten cents an hour, typical whatever is available for black folks that nobody else wants.
Speaker 1: Okay, when you--
Speaker 2: By the grace of God.
Speaker 1: Well, when you went to college, you, when you finally got in college, did you know what you wanted to be, what you wanted to major in?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd made the turn in the road, and that was a miracle.  I was sitting up in the church in Yoakum, Texas.  And I had an uncle, one of the--gifted man.  He passed by me, and I'm sitting in the back of the church house.  And he looked at me, and he had a pamphlet in his hand.  And he took the pamphlet out of his hand and put it on my shoulder and kept walking, never said a word.  And I said, "What did he give me that old book for?"  And I took it; I didn't throw it in the trash; I took it and went home.  And it was "Building a Standard BTU," [ph.] by T.C. Gardner.  I can still read the writing on it after all these years:  "How do you build a BTU [Baptist Training Union]?"  T.C. Gardner out of Dallas, Texas.  And I had nothing else to do.  The Depression was on, starved to death anyway, so I went back to reading.  And in six months I'd built a strong youth group at one of the local churches.  And in two years I'd built two youth groups in the whole village of Yoakum on both sides of town.  And by the time I got back to Bishop College, I was in the youth leadership.  And three of us were in college equally poor, [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Marvin Griffin, Harold Thompson [ph.], [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Shelvin [Jerome] Hall, starving to death and poor and nobody to back us up; so, didn't have no money, so the pretty gals wouldn't pay us no mind, so we had to go the library and work.  We had the jobs, and we worked on the campus, picked up clothes to keep from starving to death, and wound up making the honor rolls.  And at the end of X amount of time, he's the biggest thing in Austin, Texas, Ebenezer [Baptist Church].  I'm fifty years in Chicago [Illinois], built it from the ground by African design.  [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] Bell Tower when Chicago said we want no part of [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.], but King was welcome to Friendship [Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --because of the fact of my being here, and I'd gone to Selma, Alabama, three times.  So it's been a matter of where you take your chances and what you believe in.
Story_ID: 289402
Speaker 1: When you were in college then, were you then considering becoming a reverend?  Were you, were you determined on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --becoming a reverend.
Speaker 2: --yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, by that time, I didn't hit the storm, and I came out as a math professor.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --'cause wasn't nobody gonna call me to be no pastor.  I looked too young.
Speaker 1: So you majored in math at--
Speaker 2: At Bishop [College, Marshall, Texas].
Speaker 1: At Bishop, okay.
Speaker 2: Math and science and everything.  There wasn't nothing else to do, and the pretty girls weren't gonna pay me no attention, 'cause I was broke.  And I was too poor to afford good clothes, so I had to study.  I mean we were professional students, took all the honor, every things, [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Marvin Griffin, Harold Thompson [ph.], Shelvin Hall [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Shelvin Jerome Hall], three poor boys.  And, and Marvin came up this year from, from, from Texas, brought his choir and his folks.  But I mean when you ain't got no money, the pretty gals ain't gon' pay you no attention, so you ain't got no clothes, no money, no, so you study.  And we took the honor, took the, took everything, graduated magna cum laude and all that other kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: So what year did you graduate from Bishop?
Speaker 2: What year did I graduate?  The year that, same year I got concord.  About what year did I graduate, Lucy [Lewis Hall]?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Forty-four [1944].
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-four [1944], that's my bookkeeper.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you graduated in '44 [1944], 'cause I, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Hit the ground running.
Story_ID: 289403
Speaker 1: So what happened after you graduated from Bishop [College, Marshall, Texas]?
Speaker 2: I went to work teaching school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Coached the basketball team, didn't know nothing about it, and Boy Scout master, didn't know nothing about it either, but they had a shortage, so they had to pick up with me while I learned (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now where did you--
Speaker 2: And it--
Speaker 1: --where did you live?  Where did you go?  Did you stay in--
Speaker 2: I went to Carthage.
Speaker 1: Carthage, Texas?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Carthage, Texas, A.L. Turner [Anthony Luther Turner] was kind to me, gave me a chance, a hundred dollars a month teaching school.
Speaker 1: Okay, and who was it that gave you the chance?
Speaker 2: Professor A.L. Turner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was head of the music department, and head of the Boy Scouts, and priest at everybody's funeral in town because there was no other priest who was ordained or licensed in the whole village.
Speaker 1: So were you ordained at Bishop when you were there?
Speaker 2: No, I got ordained afterwards.
Speaker 1: Afterwards, okay.
Speaker 2: But when you're in a little town that ain't got no preachers they take whatever's available. So I was everything.  I was scout--I was the, I was everything, everything but rich--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a hundred dollars a month teaching school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Come on, I'm hot now.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you didn't have to worry about the war [World War II, WWII], right?  You didn't have to--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  What is that, white man speak with forked tongue?
Speaker 1: That's what they--
Speaker 2: You heard that one before.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: That if you're in a registered, accredited school of religion you're exempt from the draft, don't you believe it.  They wrote Bishop College for me to report to Cuero, Texas, 370 miles away, and I'm a student.  And I went, I said, "Thought I'm exempt if I'm in an accredited school."  They just said report.  That was my wife's [Lucy Lewis Hall] hometown, where the nice white people are.  So I got my suit, my steamer trunk.  I loaded it up.  And they told me how stupid I looked, taking that whole trunk, 'cause you know you're not--I said no, they're gon' send me back.  I said no, they aren't.  They say oh, okay.  I took my steamer.  I went back to my wife's hometown.  I reported, since they said come.  They sent me to San Antonio [Texas], and they examined me: feet, good, good; teeth, good, good; hearing, good, good; understanding, good, good; nose, good, good; ups--what do you mean the ups?  Can't see.  Well, I told 'em before I that I couldn't see, wearing eyeglasses--can't use 'em.  I said, "Well, I tried to save you money, told you I'd volunteered for the last eight years.  Y'all don't listen to nobody who's black."  And so they had to turn around and send me all the way back to Bishop College.
Story_ID: 289404
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wanted to go back I guess again to 1944, and well, to back to when you started building those youth groups with the Baptist Training Union.  Now, you became the president of the Baptist Training Union in Yoakum [Texas] is what I hear.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was disorganized.  It was disorganized, so I just started a youth group, and then they looked one day and then it was gone, just like that; like Topsy [ph.], they just closed.
Speaker 1: But you knew what you were doing because you had a copy of the manual ["Building a Standard BTU," (ph.) T.C. Gardner] and (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I didn't know what I was doing either, but they didn't know I didn't know.  So, the [Great] Depression was on, and it was better than getting drunk, so I just went ahead and started doing something positive.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about how you were called to the ministry.  I mean could you tell us how, what, events led to you being ordained as a minister?
Speaker 2: Nothing.  No little white man walks out on the front porch of glory, says, "Hey, you, I need you," no, no.  You just have a feeling or a need that something ought to be done, somebody ought to do it, and you're somebody, so why shouldn't you be doing it.  Now you've got these idiot youngsters out there doing nothing worthwhile.  They ought to be going to college; ought to be building strong, decent Christian families; they ought to be living moral lives.  So, why wouldn't somebody go tell 'em that, what they ought to be doing? And if you're somebody, and they're somebody, then why not you?
Speaker 1: So you felt a need to step up and do something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, step up to the plate.  It's your time to bat.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so you say well, yeah, if it's my time, right, may as well quit ducking.  You wonder why somebody else didn't do it.  And you try it one time and (laughter), and God, God is a strange trader (laughter).  I wanted a car badly.  And I told Him if He gave me a car, I'd take the church anywhere in the world, anywhere in the world.  If He gave me a car I'd get, I'd take the church anywhere.  So, no.  I went shopping, and he opened up the door, and Anthony Luther Turner co-signed a '39 [1939] Ford, black one.
Story_ID: 289405
Speaker 1: Okay, I got my car.  And there were churches all out in the trees, two miles out, three miles out, big churches, five hundred members, all like that, all in East Texas, in those pine trees, loaded with folks.  I got called to the church.  How far you think it was?  Come on, you're a pro; see what you know about God.
Speaker 2: I don't know, five miles away.
Speaker 1: Five hundred miles away.
Speaker 2: Five hundred?
Speaker 1: I was in East Texas, and I get called to the church on the other side of Houston [Texas].  I said, "Now, I thought I had a deal."  It might not be five hundred, let's say 350, same thing.  But it took me all night Sunday night, all night to get back to Carthage [Texas] to teach school Monday morning.  But I had told the Lord if he gave me a car I'd take a church anywhere.  So, 350 miles away--now Texas all--I just knew He was gonna give me one two miles out or five miles out, some reason.  No--he gives me one that takes all night Sunday night to drive back.  So my wife [Lucy Lewis Hall] jumps in the car, and we fight the road all night, no shoulders, no bridges, got to be at work Monday morning, getting a hundred dollars a month for teaching school 'cause the church is paying twenty-five dollars a week if it doesn't rain on the Sunday that is pastoral day, and it's my first church.  I said Lord, okay, okay, all right, so I took to church, I started fighting that 350 miles every two weeks.  I had got a broadcast, only broadcast in the county, 'Shine On Me' is the theme song.  Seventy thirty in the morning I had to be there, twenty-five dollars a week if it didn't rain, became one of the best voices in southwest Texas.  Church house had never been painted, painted the church house; no phone in the church house, put the telephone in; no office, put in an office--all the way from East Texas to southwest Texas.  You learn that God drives a hard bargain.  He could have killed me, but he didn't.
Story_ID: 289406
Speaker 1: Can you tell us the story of how you met your wife [Lucy Lewis Hall]?
Speaker 2: It's almost like getting that first car.  I went to California looking for my wife; I went to Houston [Texas] looking for my wife; I went to Victoria [Texas] looking for my wife; I went everywhere looking for my wife; I went to Bishop College [Marshall, Texas] looking for my wife.  I hunted, I hunted.  Finally, I was president of the DeWitt County [Texas] institution.  Ernestine said, "I won't be there this summer.  I'm doing graduate work.  And my baby sister will be secretary in my place."  I said, "You ain't got no baby sister."  She said, "Yes, I have."  I said, "No, you haven't 'cause I went to junior college with you and it was you and Erlene [Lewis], Erlene and Ernestine."  "I do have a baby sister."  "No, you don't;" "yes, I do;" "no, you don't."  "I do have a baby sister."  "If you got a baby sister, drag her out and let me see her."  "All right, Lou May, Lou May, Lou May."  Well, her grandma was about this tall, and I'd take nothing away from her.  She was about five feet tall with high-heeled shoes on, five feet tall maybe.  Her mama about five feet one maybe, with high-heeled shoes on, the big sister, five feet two maybe with heels on.  I said boy, a house full of midgets.  Here comes another midget.  So I said drag her out if you got a baby sister.  Let me see what she looks like.  And I aimed at five feet three, five feet four maybe, being generous.  "Lou May, Lou May, what you want?  Come here."  And somebody walk to the door, and I looked.  I said no, and I looked again.  I put on my glasses, said no.  The door was full of woman.  I said, "I don't believe it.  Where you been all this time?"  I asked her would she marry me that same day.  I said, no point in me wasting no more time.  I went back to East Texas teaching school, came back in December and got married sixty years ago.  And they, and he all lived happily ever after just like that--I had gone from California to New York.  She was back in the kitchen.  I said, "Now that ain't right.  (Unclear) after all that hard work that I put in.  That's the way it happened.  God just--there the woman was, black, and beautiful, and cocky, and conceited, and brilliant, um-hm, and I'd been hunting all over everywhere.  I don't see how I could have missed her.  I knew everybody else in the family.  There she was in the kitchen.
Speaker 1: That's a good story.
Speaker 2: That's a beautiful one.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That's a classic.
Story_ID: 289407
Speaker 1: Can you tell us the hairbrush story?  Now, what's this story concerning this hairbrush?
Speaker 2: Everybody has a fetish or something that they hang on to.  In the bitterness of the [Great] Depression I made five dollars a week, I think six dollars a week when I got a raise.  And I got a high school diploma.  Dick is making eight dollars a week.  He's white and a dropout.  Frank is making eleven dollars a week.  He's a white dropout.  The top boy was making seventeen dollars a week.  He's a soda jerker, seventeen dollars a week.  And I'm making six dollars a week.  I'm not gon' steal.  I refuse to steal.  So I said, "Well, when I go back to college, I ought to have something to take."  So, I paid down on my hairbrush, probably costs a dollar and a quarter, maybe, and I drilled a hole in the handle, that wherever I went I'd have something to show that I was trying.  I worked good road; I trucked cotton; I cut down tree.  I worked eleven hours a day.  Finally I decided I was gonna starve to death anyway, said I may as well starve to death going to college.  Told my daddy [Will Hall] I was going back to college, Bishop College, Marshall, Texas, 350 miles away.  He said, "I got a friend who's going up north.  He'll give you a ride part of the way.  He'll give you a ride to Fort Worth [Texas]."  I said, "Thank you, sir."  He didn't have money, so he couldn't get me, he couldn't give me any money.  I'd saved up thirty-two dollars, which was entrance fee to Bishop.  I caught the man with the truck.  He dropped me off at Fort Worth, said, "This is far as I go, 320 miles away from Yoakum [Texas]."  I said thank you.
Story_ID: 289408
Speaker 1: There came along another guy in a pickup.  I stuck out my thumb, said, "I'm going to Longview [Texas]."  I said, "I'd appreciate a ride."  He gave me a ride to Longview, far as I go.  Another guy came.  I stuck out my thumb, trying to get to Bishop College in Marshall, Texas; that's where I'm going.  I got there, it was on a Sunday, and the dining hall was closed.  I hadn't had nothing to eat.  And so I learned you can make it on oatmeal if you can't have nothing else.  I bought a hot box of oatmeal, cooked me some oatmeal.  Monday morning I went to mess hall, paid my thirty-two dollars entrance fee at Bishop College.  And the second thing I did was go in the dining hall and eat three meals.
Speaker 2: Three?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I ate, I ate, I ate.  I was starved to death.
Speaker 2: Now, now you told us that story earlier, but you didn't tell us about the three meals, about you know--
Speaker 1: I ate, I ate--
Speaker 2: --but--
Speaker 1: --I ate, I ate, I ate.
Speaker 2: But the hairbrush, the significance of the brush is that you--
Speaker 1: The hairbrush was the symbol that I had hope, I still hoped to, hoped to make it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so that hairbrush with a hole in the handle and wherever I've gone--Swan Island, Portland, Oregon, my hairbrush with the hole in the handle, I hope to make it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I hope I can make it.  I don't have much of a chance, but I sure hope I can--
Story_ID: 289409
Speaker 1: Now I wanted to ask you about the German prisoners of war in that part of Texas, I mean in--do you have any stories about the German prisoners (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --of war?
Speaker 2: I haven't got nothing.  They were, they put the German prisoners of war--here was a white El Campo [Texas] here with the German prisoners of war, and here was the nigger section.  So they put them closer to town, close to the post office, and they put the niggers, as simple as that.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what's the significance of the distance?  I mean we don't really know what, I mean--
Speaker 2: Prejudice.  They were white, and it strung out, you know, that even if they were prisoners of war, they still were to be preferred to the niggers.  I had to, I had to fight in El Campo.  And I said, "Why can't we get our mail delivered?  We in the village like everybody else."  The postmaster said, "We'd deliver you your mail, but the houses ain't got no numbers on 'em."  I said, "Oh, no, they ain't got no numbers on 'em."  Okay, I became president of the ministers' conference.  They didn't have no conference, so I just made myself president, and I bought some numbers.  And at the ministers' meeting with Bell [ph.], and I gave the men numbers for their houses--put it on your house--then I went back up to the postmaster and said, "We got numbers on our houses.  Now why can't our mail get delivered?"  "Huh?"  "Yeah, we got numbers on our houses.  You said the reason we couldn't get a number--," so then the mail started coming, being delivered in the colored section to our houses.  You know, it's been a long journey, yeah.  I mean, all along the way, every time--if you went to a cemetery, for colored cemetery, and it rained, you bogged down in the mud.  And I say why come?  If you go to a white cemetery they don't bog down at the same cemetery.  So I went raising hell about that.  We finally got some gravel road to the cemetery.  That was before [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].
Story_ID: 289410
Speaker 1: Now this was in Texas you're talking about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In El Campo, Texas.
Speaker 1: El Campo, okay.
Speaker 2: That's my first church.  And I said, "No, you can't do that.  Why come we can't have some decent something?  Why can't we?"  And finally the word came down from the pipe that the good white folks were gonna have me run out of town or killed.  And I had a broadcast, and on race relations week, Sunday I talk about freedom and equality and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And--I had some Uncle Toms in my church.  They said, they gon' run him out of town.  They gonna, they gon' kill him.  And I said, "Now, white man is a bunch of things, but he ain't stupid."  They say, "What you mean?"  I said, "I got a new car."  They say, "That's right."  And the Negro had been there a hundred years was still driving a [Ford] Model A.  Model A, yeah.  And I said, "Now I owe a note on my new car.  Yeah, that's right.  I said now the white man might be prejudiced, but he ain't crazy.  Who gonna pick up the note on my car if he runs me out of town?  Negroes been here a hundred years.  He ain't gonna bother him and he's still driving a Model A."  I got back in next week and the deacon say, "Reverend, you're gonna hear that the white folks gonna run you out of town?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "But don't bother about it.  We already talked to 'em."  I said, "Oh."  And everything's all right.  I said thank you.  I went on back to my broadcast 7:30 Sunday morning.  I stayed there until I resigned to go to Corpus Christi [Texas].  So the matter of race relations and running scared, and getting out on limbs, somebody, I mean somebody has to wash the dishes.  Somebody has to wash the dishes or else the dishes gonna get all smelly, and the kitchen's gonna stink.  So when the [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] thing came to Chicago [Illinois], I said, "If I went to Selma, Alabama, three times with Dr. King, how come you think I ain't going now because he's coming to Chicago?  That don't make no sense."  If I thought he was right in Selma, why wouldn't he be right in Chicago?  And they said but if you go, you ain't gon' get nothing.  I said, "Well, let's put it this way: I didn't leave Texas to come to Chicago to shine shoes."  If there weren't some ladies here, I'd tell you the rest of what I said, but--
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter)--
Story_ID: 289411
Speaker 1: So I went back to Selma, Alabama, three times with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  And do you know that it took thirty-five years for the local paper to finally say one preacher from Chicago [Illinois] went to Selma, Alabama.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The front page said thirty-five years later.
Speaker 2: Were you the only one from Chicago that went?
Speaker 1: That's the only thing that the--don't you have that copy?  It was in my office there--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Shelvin [Jerome] Hall only one responded when King, when King made the appeal.  And I was president of the [West Side Baptist] Ministers Conference, all these bad (unclear) who acted like they'd kill a dead stump.  But they weren't killing a dead stump.  They were hanging on to their job, that slot that they had.  [Mayor Richard J.] Daley had it sewed it up by virtue of everybody's on the payroll, and told him I wasn't planning, I won't pick no cotton in Chicago.  I picked my cotton.  I've shined my shoes, and I quit that in Texas.  I wasn't bootleggin' no more liquor.
Speaker 2: Now when did you leave Texas?
Speaker 1: Fifty years ago.

Speaker 1: So you were in El Campo, Texas, until what year?
Speaker 2: I was only out at El Campo about a year and a half before I came to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause you said you went to Corpus Christi [Texas]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --after El Campo, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --El Campo, Corpus Christi for a sing and a dan- song and a dance--
Speaker 1: Now were you inspired by, I mean, any civil rights leaders in Texas to--I mean did you have an association of people that were trying to work on civil rights activity in Texas, or were you kind of by yourself?
Speaker 2: I think Bishop College [Marshall, Texas], Bishop College was the nucleus for my charge--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that the best black brains in America came to L.K. Williams Institute [Lacey Kirk Williams Institute, Marshall, Texas]--
Speaker 1: L. K. Williams Institute?
Speaker 2: --and met annually on campus of Bishop College.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The best--
Speaker 1: And who were some of those brains?
Speaker 2: Oh Lord, you name 'em, if they were brains at all in America, and major pulpit (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, what about, say, Alain Locke, or W.E.B. Du Bois, or--
Speaker 2: Not at that level, but--
Speaker 1: Not at that level?  They were--
Speaker 2: They were the L.K. Williams [Lacey Kirk Williams] and the J.H. Jacksons [Joseph H. Jackson] and the--
Speaker 1: J.H. Jackson?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the--
Speaker 1: The reverend or--
Speaker 2: All of 'em the reverends.
Speaker 1: Okay, all the--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, all of 'em reverend, reverend doctors, scholars, and preachers (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Was [HistoryMaker Reverend] Gardner Taylor in that group (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Gardner Taylor--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --ran against J.H. Jackson.
Speaker 1: So this, the L.K. Williams Institute was--
Speaker 2: Was a cross section of the best preachers in black skins in America.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were they part of the National Baptist Convention?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, the National Baptist Convention.
Speaker 1: The largest black organization in the world at--
Speaker 2: There you go.
Speaker 1: --that time and still is now, I guess, I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, all right.  Dr. King's father [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] involved in that too?
Speaker 2: Old man King, I don't think he ever really got involved.  I don't remember the old man ever getting involved.
Speaker 1: Was Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.] involved?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think eagles ran with pelicans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you can take that one whichever way you want to.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he would been to, he would have been like flying too high to be involved at that point, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Sandy [F.] Ray.
Story_ID: 288067
Speaker 1: Now how did you wind up in Chicago [Illinois]?  How were you called to Chicago?  I mean who--
Speaker 2: Pure miracle, another pure miracle.  I was at St. John [Baptist Church] in Corpus [Christi, Texas], huge church.  And I was having a moral crisis on the theological difference with a strong nucleus in the church where I was.  And I was not gonna give down, and they wouldn't, they couldn't afford to back up.  And it was gonna come to a head, and--
Speaker 1: Now what was the nature of this theological crisis?
Speaker 2: The matter of the integrity of the pulpit.  And I was for purity of the pulpit, and they were wanting to pollute it, and I was not for that.
Speaker 1: Pollute it in which, what way, what way?
Speaker 2: In practice, homo (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did they wanna--
Speaker 2: --homosexuality and whatever other aspects.  And I thought that the Bible taught against it.  And they were not pleased with me, and I was not happy with them.  I went to a meeting, and I knew I was in a dilemma 'cause the forces that were against me were well entrenched.  And it built up to, for a show of force.  I asked them a direct question: how many of them wanted to follow somebody who they been, who's been God called to lead or those who wanted to follow somebody who had not been called by God to lead and wanted by a handful.  But I knew that that was only temporary.
Story_ID: 288068
Speaker 1: I went to a meeting in Florida, I reckon it was, somewhere, and it was hot.  And I met an old friend of my father [Will Hall].  And it was steaming hot, and he was sweating.  I had bought a new car, and I said, "Dr. Graham [Reverend S.H. Graham], would you like a ride?"  He's wiping sweat.  He said, "Be glad to."  He got in.  My car was air-conditioned.  Like an old-timer, he looked it over--this is nice.  By the time I got him to his hotel he said, "There's a good church [Friendship Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] that's gonna be vacant in our neighborhood.  Your daddy did me a favor when I was a young man, and I'd like to recommend you."  I said, "Yes, sir."  But he's riding in my new car on a hot day.  So, what else you gonna tell me?  He didn't pay me cab fare.  So he got out when he got to his hotel.  I held him to rights.  I said yes, sir, respect that I owe to an elderly leader, S. H. Graham at Greater Union [Baptist Church] in Chicago [Illinois].  He got out and went on his way.  And a month or so later I got a letter that he was asking him to invite me to come up to preach. And I came up and preached.  It didn't do nothing.  They gave me a hundred dollars.  I flew up from Corpus Christi [Texas].  And I said well--but then they turned back around again after that and they said, "Are you coming to the convention in September?"  I said, "Yes."  They said, "Well, would you like to preach for us in September?"  I said, "Be glad to," and I left.  That time, it was free to them 'cause I was coming up to the convention (laughter).  And so I preached.  And they said, "Can you stay over Monday night?"  I said, "I doubt it.  My, I've got some delegates with me."  "See if they can stay over."  All right.  I asked the delegates could they stay.  They said yes.  I stayed over Monday.  They had a church meeting, and they gave me the letter of call on Monday, and that's fifty years ago.
Story_ID: 288069
Speaker 1: You started at Friendship Baptist [Church] here in Chicago [Illinois] fifty years ago.  Now how did you like Chicago after having lived in Texas so long?
Speaker 2: I didn't come here to like Chicago.  I came here because I thought that it would be good for my children, that they'd have better educational opportunities.  Corpus Christi [Texas] was good, but it's still southern, you know.  I just had the feeling that it'd be better for my kids.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: They're gonna have to grow up; they're gonna have to mature; they're gonna have to make life choices.
Speaker 1: Did you find conditions better here in Chicago?  Were they better for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, conditions were better.  You had more options that--I mean I was in [North] Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois].  I didn't know nothing about Chicago anyway, but I was in Lawndale, and I stayed in Lawndale awhile.  But we had always had our own house, and so we went house hunting.  Maywood [Illinois] had started changing.  And we went by a house, and the guy said, "You can find a mortgage, you can buy this house if you can get a mortgage just like that."  We went back and found a mortgage, 424 South 17th [Avenue] in Maywood, bought the house, stayed there until we paid the mortgage off.  Kids went to Proviso East [High School, Maywood, Illinois], which was a strong school at the time, strong school.  Then after that they let it go down.  Now they're tightening it back up, but it had been college prep before.  And my daughter [L. Priscilla Hall], who is a supreme court justice in New York City [New York, New York], finished Proviso East.  And when she got ready to go to high school, they sent her to terminal lanes.  They didn't know her mama.  And Lucy [Lewis Hall] went to school and said, "You have our Priscilla in such and such a lane."   And they went sputtering to explain why they had her in such and such a lane.  She said, "But I didn't tell you my daughter wasn't going to college.  You didn't ask me."  They transferred her, put her in college prep lane.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that you found racism here, but it was, there are also opportunities, but there was racism in Chicago as well, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Story_ID: 288070
Speaker 1: You got here in 1955.  And 1950s, I guess '55 [1955], '56 [1956] is when the Montgomery Bus Boycott took place, 1956, in Alabama.  Were you paying close attention to that when you were here [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you know [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. King, Dr. King was a guest of our church in Chicago [Illinois].  That's how we got the citation upstairs, that--
Speaker 1: When did you first meet Dr. King?
Speaker 2: When I first met him--I have no idea.  I mean you meet him long distance.  You're an unknown, and he's famous--
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: --he and Ralph Abernathy, all of those, and you're still an unknown, so you don't go clambering.  But when he came to Chicago I was president of the West Side Baptist Ministers Conference.  And he was in [North] Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois], and I was president of the West Side Ministers Conference of Chicago, which was--
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, I just wanted to--
Speaker 2: --Lawndale.
Speaker 1: --find out first, like when you first met Dr. King, when you first met him.
Speaker 2: Well, that's what I'm talking about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: By virtue of my being president of West Side Baptist Ministers Conference and Dr. King living in Lawndale, then I asked him did he need some extra security, you know, 'cause he's a stranger, and thugs don't know nobody.  He said "Oh, Shelvin [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Shelvin Jerome Hall]," he said, "if the cats know that you coming in at such and such a time, the cats will take care of you."  I said all right.  I just didn't want nothing to happen on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] that we would be slothful in what we should do as a Christian.  He said, oh (unclear) so he was at Friendship [Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] at least three times when the rest of 'em were running from him.  I went (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, can you--
Speaker 2: --to Selma [Alabama] three times.
Story_ID: 288071
Speaker 1: Can you explain to us why, what the situation was and why these pastors decided that they didn't want to be associated with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Real easy.  How much money you got in your billfold?
Speaker 1: Not much.
Speaker 2: I didn't ask you that.  That's the reason; that [Mayor] Richard J. Daley had built a machine.  My daddy [Will Hall] was an independent businessman, and we lived across the street from the mayor of the village [Yoakum, Texas]. We'd been free blacks.  We didn't know that was the term for it.  But we'd been free.  You don't buy us.  You don't buy us.  And when I got here they said, "If you want to go anywhere, you know, you have to get in line or whatever, this, that, and the other."  I said, "No, I didn't leave Texas to pick cotton, shine shoes.  I didn't leave Texas for that.  I came to Texas [sic. Chicago, Illinois] because I'm looking for a better life for my children, and myself, and my family.  I don't plan to chop Mayor Daley's cotton, to shine his shoes."  And they said, "You ain't gon' get nothing."  I said, "Well, if I don't get nothing, let me go back and pick cotton in my patch.  Let me go back and pick cotton in my own patch, not in somebody else's patch.  I didn't come north to pick cotton."  And to his credit, when one day they asked if he had any respect for any black pastors in Chicago [Illinois].  He said, "Two: that fellow named Ball or Hall or something, and somebody else," that even though he didn't like me, he respected me.  And--
Speaker 1: This is Mayor Daley you're talking about?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he ran--I mean he ran it the way the fellows let him run it.  They would say, "Well, we found out that you, you having it kind of tight.  Your notes are high.  You can get two hundred dollars a week, you know, to help on your expenses."  Well, I said, "No, I didn't come up here to pick cotton.  If I, if my three hundred folks can't take care of me, let me go back to teaching school again."  I reckon that's my daddy.  He was independent, and my mama [Mayme Shelvin Hall], she was independent from her grandma.  But, no, no, no, I'm through picking cotton.
Speaker 1: Sir, now who, who offered you money?  I mean was it the--
Speaker 2: The machine.  They, they--
Speaker 1: Was it the precinct captain or the--
Speaker 2: No, no, they, you're not gonna know who it is.  They're too intelligent for that, and they, it's too smooth for that.  You're not--then, then, oh no, they'd destroy themselves.  Somebody who finds out--well, the way it worked with one fellow, they checked out what his bills were.  And his bills were running two hundred and something dollars a week, and his church was only raising a hundred and something dollars a week, so he's going in the red.  They found out what his debt was, and they said, "Well, if you do such and such a thing, then every Sunday in your mailbox you'll find X amount of money just like that.  Nobody does nothing for you, nobody seeing nothing coming to you.  It's just there, and that's free money."  But getting out of it is where the bite comes in.  And the guy said to one of 'em, "Suppose I want out of it?"  And the fellow said nothing.  Ain't no door out.  But I, mine was loud and clear and all.  I don't plan to shine no shoes.  I've already picked my cotton.  I'd rather be free and hungry than to look like I'm doing something, and I'm still shining shoes.  No, I won't do that.
Story_ID: 288072
Speaker 1: You went to Selma, Alabama, three times, right?
Speaker 2: At least.
Speaker 1: And the Selma crisis was in 1965.  Now I think from what I read, that you knew Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] at least in 1963, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --by '63 [1963], and that he had actually been to Chicago [Illinois] at least once during that period of time, and then that you went to--now, were you part of the SCLC?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And was there a branch here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there'd, there'd been branches, but when you got an umbrella thing like [Mayor] Richard [J.] Daley had, they can't grow.  You're gonna have to kill 'em.  Just don't nourish them; you know, just don't nourish.  I had the West Side Federation [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], strongest thing in town.  Every church from here to Halsted [Street], if you know any of Chicago, and when we would say let's do something for the schools or whatever and we needed two thousand, five thousand, whatever kids, I had the Catholics, the Lutherans, the Baptist, the blacks, the whites, West Side Federation.  And okay, it clogs the machine.  What you think they did to me?  They just simply got the major structure of the governing party of those dioceses to transfer me into other cities.  And you looked around one day: Bill Farr [ph.] is gone; the next guy is gone; and all the fellows you had in the West Side Federation that you could depend on have disappeared.  And you got another bunch of strangers that know not Joseph.  Then you gotta start all over again; that's subtle.  They haven't done nothing to you.  They just get 'em transferred out, get 'em transferred out.  And the old Mayor Daley could do it here.  He had the power.

Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Observing is Judy Nemako [ph.], Mrs. Lucy [Lewis] Hall, and Deacon Charles Simpson.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] The Reverend [Dr.] Shelvin Jerome Hall, pastor of Friendship Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: Sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date, hard as you worked me, I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: I think it's the 3rd of June.  Would you agree with that?
Speaker 2: If my wife says so.
Speaker 1: Do you think it's the 3rd of June?  Is that okay?  All right, 3rd of June, 2005.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Friendship Baptist Church, 5200 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, now we're picking up on an interview that we started two days, on the 1st, and so I'm gonna, I think we left off at 1963 or thereabouts.  And by 1963, you were here in Chicago, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: And you were pastor of Friendship Baptist Church (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 288074
Speaker 1: Can you tell us how you first, when did you first meet [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.?
Speaker 2: I possibly met him first in Selma, Alabama.  A call came out from the National Council of Churches [National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA] for men to come from all across the nation to support Dr. King.  And I was in serving as president of the West Side Baptist Ministers Conference [Chicago, Illinois].  And I made the appeal to the conference to see how much support we could get.  And to my great surprise, I got two responses, Dr. J.M. Stone [Reverend J.M. Stone], pastor, Stone Temple Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois], and Reverend Shelvin J. Hall [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Shelvin Jerome Hall], the only two that said they would be willing to go to Selma, Alabama, to support Dr. King.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: And so we went.
Speaker 1: Now you were sort of surprised at that, right, that, 'cause you thought that they were a lot, you know, lot tougher than that, right, or they were a lot, more aggressive?  There would be more people who would be willing to go?
Speaker 2: I was disappointed.  I had heard the stories that you always hear of the men who come up from the South and how heroic they are, and what challenges they face, and what courage they have.  And this was the first major opportunity we had to really show some support for the outstanding leadership in America for our own people.  And I couldn't understand how we could refuse to go.  And so, some other friends of mine, we went to Selma three times: Lew Kreinberg, blond Jewish guy; Father Daniel Mallette from St. Agatha Catholic Church [Chicago, Illinois]; and myself.  We went three times, and here the appeal came to black Baptists to show, and it was disappointing.
Speaker 1: So, so your group was the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] group.  Were there any black Baptists from the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] that went to Selma?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  When the report was written up, for some reason, the black Baptists could not support Dr. King, whatever the reason was.
Story_ID: 288075
Speaker 1: We were discussing earlier before we started the interview that it might, that you suspect there was political complications, considerations that kept some of the reverends from giving their support to Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 2: It could have been, sir, it's, Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois] a big city.  And you're more urbanized than I am, so I rely on your urban experience to tell me what happens in big cities.
Speaker 1: Well, you had some observations you shared with me about the--how helpful the [Mayor Richard J. Daley] administration was in getting some pastors started.  And some of them, they seemed to be, they seemed to project in their mind that they were gonna lose their support if they went against the administration.
Speaker 2: It could have been.  You, you never know what's involved in the operation of many churches who might be struggling or might be up against it or might be having difficulties.  But if you can't look at their books, then you really don't know what they're up against.
Speaker 1: Now, you were, you told me a while ago upstairs that somebody warned you that you may, you may not make out so well financially if you didn't, I mean if you went, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir, but I suppose that was the difference.  I had suffered eleven years trying to go back to college, and I had hitchhiked three hundred miles to get there.  And I got there with exactly thirty-two dollars, which was what Bishop College [Marshall, Texas] required to register for the dormitories, and to pay your meal ticket.  And the day I got there, the mess hall was closed, and so I couldn't get any food.  I made it on oatmeal all day Sunday.  But bright and early Monday morning when they opened up the registrar's office, I was either first, or a hard second in line with my thirty-two dollars to pay my money to register as a student and to get a meal ticket.  And I went straight in and paid my thirty-two dollars and headed straight for the mess hall, and I ate like eating had gone out of style.
Story_ID: 288076
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about Selma, about what happened when you went to Selma, Alabama, in '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Selma, Alabama, we slept on pianos, on top of pianos, no beds, slept on pallets on the floor.  We were marching before that down the road, and, and they say clear the highway.  The night riders are coming through.  And we had to get off the highway and get off in the mud and let the night riders go through, and then we could get back on the highway.  But that was just a maneuver.  If you had been through any type of Boy Scout, whatever, you know how to obey orders.
Speaker 1: Now, who were these night riders, and were they actually riding on horses, or did they, or--
Speaker 2: That was the term they were using to tell you that.  It was a possibility of hostilities, and to avoid it, that we would yield the road to them to avoid confrontation.  We didn't go down to fight, we went down to support Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you march the whole way from Selma to Montgomery [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was, what's the most memorable part of that experience, as far as you're concerned?
Speaker 2: I suppose getting to the bridge.  What's it called, Pettus Bridge?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, the Edmund Pettus Bridge [Selma, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Yeah, getting to Pettus Bridge.  Before you, when you got to Pettus Bridge, I reckon if you were a singer, you'd sang how I got over, that you hadn't got killed, or stoned, or the night riders hadn't shot you, cause rumors were running ten miles a minute.  But you were grateful for your life and for your existence and that God had taken care of you and brought you safely to that point.  And so you went back again and again just to be a witness that you believe God is able.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did you, what did the marchers do when they got to Selma--I mean to Montgomery rather?
Speaker 2: When our party--when we got there we were tired, and we went looking for somewhere to sleep.  And we had to sleep on top of pianos or on the floor or wherever, no housing.  I mean the housing was long gone.  We were just there.  We were Boy Scouts with no tents.  We were there as witnesses that we believed that Dr. King was right.  And therefore, we ought to do our best, to put our bodies on the line; that we believed and we supported Dr. King.
Story_ID: 288077
Speaker 1: Sir, were you ever in any physical danger yourself?
Speaker 2: How would you know?  If they said they're shooting a--there are night riders going through, you wouldn't stand up and say take a shot at me.  You'd simply stay in your position.  And the one time that I felt a sense of insecurity was that they said that they're shooting, they're shooting.  And I said well, where is [Reverend] J.M. Stone?  He was an old man, which is where I am now.  And I say where is Stone, 'cause Stone was the only man who came to volunteer to stand by my side in Selma [Alabama].  I said, "Where is Stone?  He's an old man.  He can't run fast no more.  Where is J. M. Stone?"  And I'm looking and hollering, "Where is Stone?  Where is Stone?"  And trying to find J.M. Stone of Stone Temple Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois].  And while I'm hunting from Stone, a breeze passed by, and I found out in that breeze was Stone was part of the breeze.  He was outrunning me.  And I said, "Well, he hadn't lost the agility of his limbs."  He was gone.  And I said, thank God.  He can still move, 'cause don't gonna come back to Chicago [Illinois] and tell Stone Temple I take their pastor down to Selma and got him shot and he was dead, they would have had me run out of town or something.  So I was glad to know that he was alive and running, and I felt better.
Speaker 1: How old was he then, do you know?
Speaker 2: He had to be in his sixties going up for seventy, 'cause I was fifty going up for sixty.  J.M. Stone, marvelous man.
Story_ID: 288078
Speaker 1: In 1966, I guess latter part of '66 [1966] and '67 [1967], Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] actually came to Chicago [Illinois] to demonstrate for fair housing.  And he stayed in [North] Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois], and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --your church was pivotal in that stay, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --here in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us how that, what led up to Dr. King coming to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we heard that he was coming, and we made him welcome to the West Side, as president of the West Side Baptist Ministers Conference [Chicago, Illinois].  And Friendship Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois] opened up her doors that they could use our facility at no expense.  And the money raised would go completely to SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] for, if I believed in him in Selma, Alabama, it would be strange that I'd suddenly lose confidence in him because he traveled from the South to the North.  And so we were glad to just be consistent, that we believed that Dr. King was right, that if we were entitled to human rights as people, at least we all could stand up and ask for it or let somebody else know that we know when we're being deprived.  And when he was having a difficulty of getting somewhere else to go, we said come on to the West Side, and he came readily.  And the biggest rally of the whole thing north was when we had, had no place big enough for the crowd.  Father Dan Mallette [Daniel Mallette] at St. Agatha [Catholic Church, Chicago, Illinois] pulled the Catholic school--Lew Kreinberg of the Jewish Council [on Urban Affairs, Chicago, Illinois] pulled it, pulled the Jewish, and I pulled the Baptist and the blacks.  And we crowded Douglas Boulevard until the buses didn't have nowhere to run from north to south on both sides of it--brought in a pickup truck, PA system on the outside.  And Dr. King had to come through the church, Friendship Baptist Church, come through the inside and then come outside to the platform to where the stage was improvised, where the mic was, and to get to the thousands of people who had come to hear him, and it was history.  It, I reckon the thing of chagrin was that one of the magazines looked at it, and they said, "Where is the church?"  And all they gotta do is go around to the front and shoot a picture up high and there way up high, forty feet high, was a great big sign saying Friendship Baptist Church.  But they didn't even go around the front.  They just said, "Where is the church?"  And they shot the blank wall.  Thirty-five years later an apology came, and they, from another source, admitted that the church was standing, and the name of the church was Friendship Baptist Church.  But you had to wait thirty-five years for the apology.
Story_ID: 288079
Speaker 1: Who was part of Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] entourage in those days?
Speaker 2: His regular team, his regular entourage, the guys from Chicago [Illinois], the guys from all over who floated with him, his personal friends, 'cause you couldn't go picking around new fellows 'cause then you'd have to test 'em and try them.
Speaker 1: Wa--
Speaker 2: He didn't welcome us in because he didn't know us.  We asked him if he needed extra security, and he said a strange thing.  He said, "Thank you, Hall [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Shelvin Jerome Hall]," he said, "but if the cats know you're coming in, the cats are the best protection in the world.  So the cats on 16th Street are the best security you can find, if you let 'em know you're coming in at twelve o'clock or at one o'clock or whatever.  Those are the best security.  No need to get the conference to do that; the cats on the streets will do it."  Those are--
Speaker 1: And so the brothers--
Speaker 2: --Dr. King--
Speaker 1: --hanging out on the street were the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he said that's the best security in the world.  And the cats on the street didn't kill him.  The cats on the street didn't kill him.  Cats on the street were wounded when he got shot, and they tore the place up.  They tore it up.  They tore it up.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any stories about Dr. King's visit here that stand out, or are there any good stories that you remember?
Speaker 2: You ought to have my daughter tell you that one.  He had to come through an old Jewish synagogue that I was in at that time, and then come inside to the study.  And then my desk was on the east side of the first floor level.  And my daughter, who is Justice Shelvin Louise Marie Hall [HistoryMaker Shelvin Louise Hall] now, she would trail me wherever I went.  She should have been about four years old.  So when I went in my study, there my daughter was trailing me, and there Dr. King was trailing her.  And he got in the study, and he said, "Shelvin."  And she turned around and looked.  And he caught her about her hand, and whatever it was he said to her, it's lasted forty years.  Wherever she's spoken all over America and all across the world, the charisma of Dr. King seems to have touched her.  You should hear her.  She's something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's something.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did--I mean did things change in [North] Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois] as a result of Dr. King's visit?  Do you think that--
Speaker 2: Not, not readily and not rapidly, not in a hurry, gradually, slowly.  Housing changed.  You have to remember that the most powerful administrator of cities in the nation was ruling Chicago, [Mayor] Richard J. Daley, and from the White House [Washington, D.C.] to your house (laughter), Richard J. Daley had clout.  And if the whites start rallying, and he had given an order, shoot to kill, the whites cooled off.  And of course, with that kind of authority, the blacks are not even gonna, didn't nobody wants to get killed.  They thought he was powerful.  That would take some time.  And so twenty, thirty years later, it began to change, and housing began to come through, and improvements were getting made.  And the community housing development in Lawndale now must have easily three hundred, five hundred, a thousand units of housing new from the ground Cecil Butler and his conference had built from Cermak Road to Roosevelt Road, decent housing in that same area; shopping mall; the first black bank on the West Side, Community Bank of Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 288080
Speaker 1: Now, when was Community Bank of Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois] established?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: When was the Community Bank of Lawndale established?
Speaker 2: I should know.  I was on the board.  But timing, I can help you out--
Speaker 1: But that was after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] left, right?  Was that after?  Was that in the '70s [1970s], or--
Speaker 2: Ask my computer wife [Lucy Lewis Hall].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Have to get off the tape.  She can tell you.  Her brain keeps up with (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Community Bank of Lawndale, do you know when it started?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: Community Bank of Lawndale, when did it start?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Six--seems like it was close to the '70s [1970s], '69 [1969]--
Speaker 1: Judge Hall can find it for you.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: She'll get it.
Speaker 2: Okay, but it was, it was after Dr. King was assassinated, or was it before he was assassinated, or--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Before he was what?
Speaker 2: Assassinated, killed.
Speaker 1: Before Dr. King was--
Speaker 2: Was it before the riots or after the riots?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Before he was (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, before he was killed, before they killed Dr. King, before they killed him.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Before they killed him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, was it before or after?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  No, the bank was there already [sic.], before they killed him.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Yeah, that makes--okay.
Story_ID: 289537
Speaker 1: You were telling us about how a consultant from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] came in to help you start the Community Bank of Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois].  He was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --here to tell you how to do it or how to go about it.  And what was--now you say you, you'd meet early in the morning to talk about it?
Speaker 2: Five o'clock in the morning.
Speaker 1: Well, who was meeting?  Who was meeting?  You and who else?
Speaker 2: It was core, it was just a core committee of men who were concerned about having a black bank on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], [HistoryMaker] Elzie Higginbottom, Cecil Butler, Shelvin Hall [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Shelvin Jerome Hall]--what was the other guy name, the guy who came in as first president?  What was--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Jim Hadley [James Hadley].
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Jim Hadley.
Speaker 2: Jim Hadley, Larry Covington [ph.], you know, just guys who were interested in starting a bank.  And we'd meet at five o'clock in the morning and then break and go to our jobs.  And we brought the guy in from Philadelphia to tell us how to do it.  And then ten years later he's coming back to see if we're still alive.  And then he makes a confession that our bank is alive and going, and they haven't got one yet, haven't got a black bank yet in Philadelphia.  (Laughter) And he taught us how to do it.  That was, that was weird.
Speaker 1: Can you remember his name?
Speaker 2: No, but it wouldn't be hard to get.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause--
Speaker 1: Well, that's good, that's good.
Speaker 2: --Janet Jamieson or somebody was over in (unclear) Cecil Butler, who is still tied in with--would know his name.
Story_ID: 289538
Speaker 1: You were the first black chairman of the board of the Midwest Community Council [Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that should be right.
Speaker 1: How did that happen?  Tell us about Nancy Jefferson and the Midwest Community Council and your involvement with them.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) there's time for a change, and there I was--a local church interested in community and pushing and shoving and hollering and whatever.  And I don't think I have nothing unusually nice just to, there, had a strong church, black.  And they decided to let me be chairman of Midwest Community Council.  Interesting thing, though, was that I came in as chairman, and that was the year that the queen, Queen Elizabeth [II] came to America and to Chicago [Illinois], and there was to be a landing.  And Midwest Community Council was gonna get two seats for the queen's landing.  And the fellow who had been there awhile decided that he ought to have two seats.  And I said, "That wouldn't make sense since I'm the president now.  If you were president, would you give away both of your seats?"  And he turned slightly pinkish.  I said, "No, you're the executive secretary, so I'll give you one, and I'll take one."  So when the queen landed, I'm sittin' front row center for the landing of the queen.  I don't know what she looked like, bad as I can see, but I was there.  They wrote the names down.  I reckon my name ought to be some kind of Hall when the Queen Elizabeth came to Chicago.  So incidentally, you know, things just happened like that.  Try the next one.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, well, tell us about Nancy Jefferson.  What are your, do you have any reflections on Nancy Jefferson?
Speaker 2: She was at the forefront of black leadership, brilliant, extremely brilliant, extremely brilliant, intelligent, got to be at the top because the institutions at Midwest, in Midwest Community Council, you had six white banks in Midwest Community Council.  And to run Midwest Community Council at that time, you had to know your As and Bs and your X, Ys, and Zs too.  Nancy was an extremely brilliant and aggressive and competent person.  I--gradually the neighborhood changed.  Gradually the six banks disappeared, but Nancy's mark had been made.
Story_ID: 289539
Speaker 1: Who else were some of the leaders [on the West Side, Chicago, Illinois]?  There were so many leaders.
Speaker 2: Well, I asked you about some.  Now I don't know all of them, of course, but I know--
Speaker 1: Come on.
Speaker 2: Did, did you know Dr. Bobby [E.] Wright at the--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, Bobby Wright, yeah.  Keep going.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, what do you, do you have any, any comments about Dr. Wright?
Speaker 1: Not really.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Rachel [R.] Ridley?
Speaker 1: Hmm?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Rachel Ridley.
Speaker 1: Rachel Ridley came and made a splash, influential.  You had so many people who were cluttering the scene until Cecil Butler got there and pulled it together, the GLCC, Greater Lawndale Conservation Commission, and started the housing, a huge housing complex, and a bank, shopping mall.  It's, strange enough, it's highly in demand even now, though completely surrounded by blacks and in a black area.  But there's still an appeal for the slots from the outside, two banks in there, at least.  The housing thing is in trouble, but it's strong, at least a thousand units.
Story_ID: 289540
Speaker 1: We got the date for the founding of the Community Bank of Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois].  It was founded June 20, 1977.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that's about nine years after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated.  And so it's part of the rebuilding effort of [North] Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois], I guess, to rebuild it?
Speaker 2: To rebuild what?
Speaker 1: Lawndale.  I mean the founding of the bank was, was that part of the rebuilding effort in Lawndale?
Speaker 2: No, we had been working on the matter of getting the resources together and the names and the numbers.  But nobody came in from the outside to help us do it.
Speaker 1: Well, the man from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], the only person--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he was hired as staff, but he didn't bring any resources.
Speaker 1: Okay, so nobody brought any money or anything--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: --to--
Speaker 2: No, we put up our nickels and dimes and twenty-five cents.
Speaker 1: So was it was a true community effort then--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And when they sold it out, they paid us off and did whatever they, whatever you can do with banks, merge it and sell it and whatever.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it doesn't exist anymore at this point?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: The Community Bank of Lawndale (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --it still exists?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, good.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It changed hands, but the Community Bank of Lawndale is still going.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One time it had two branches.
Speaker 1: Now what about--I know one of the entities here in Lawndale is Bethel New Life [Chicago, Illinois], Mary Nelson's Bethel New Life, so.
Speaker 2: Not in Lawndale.
Speaker 1: It's not in Lawndale but in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They're north.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  West Garfield Park [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: --Mary Nelson.
Speaker 1: They're in West Garfield Park, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mary Nelson--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --very, very dominant, very dominant, very brilliant--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --very competent.  The last thing she did was to get a copy of everybody's shoes that had walked through to raffle them off as a fundraiser.  You wouldn't have won that one.  I think [HistoryMaker] Warner Saunders won it, TV celebrity.  His shoes were size 16, so I don't think you, I don't think you come close.
Speaker 1: I'm close but not--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --not quite.
Speaker 2: Warner Saunders, TV star.
Speaker 1: Right, now he's from the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He grew up near here, right?
Speaker 2: He started probably west and migrated, whatever.
Speaker 1: Now did you know George [W.] Collins?
Speaker 2: George Collins?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Did I know George Collins and George Collins's wife?
Speaker 1: Yes, [HistoryMaker] Cardiss Collins.
Speaker 2: Cardiss Collins--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: --and Cardiss Collins' son.  Yeah, keep on.  You want to name any more Collins (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I don't know anymore, so I (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, a plane crash, and out went George and in came Cardiss.  Cardiss used to be a member here [Friendship Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois].  Her picture should have been on the wall here somewhere around here, right over there behind your head.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I know the Better Boys Foundation [Chicago, Illinois] is also an institution here in Lawndale, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 289541
Speaker 1: Now, I wanted to ask you about the National Baptist Convention.  We were talking about that upstairs.  And what was your--you're a lifelong member of the National Baptist Convention, right?
Speaker 2: How do you do that?
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know.  What do you mean?
Speaker 2: What is a lifelong member?
Speaker 1: Well, it starts when you're a baby I guess.  But no, I think you started when you were probably a minister, right, in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I just, I was just waiting for your definition of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell me how long have you been a member of the National Baptist Convention?
Speaker 2: Ever since I could afford it.  So let's say fifty years.  Okay, how is that?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right, now, we go from there.
Speaker 1: All right, now, during the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] days, during the Dr. King days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the head of the National Baptist Convention was Joseph H. Jackson, Dr. Joseph H. Jackson.
Speaker 2: From Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Olivet Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --one of the great preachers that God put breath in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Silver-tongued orator.  He and [HistoryMaker Reverend] Gardner Taylor would bump heads, bump heads, and bump heads.  Now go ahead, next question.
Speaker 1: Next question is, Dr. Jackson, according to what I've read, 'cause I wasn't here then, opposed agitation for social change on the part of his church members.  He didn't want the church involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: According to what I heard.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did that create any problems for you, being in Chicago (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --with the--
Speaker 2: No.  See, see, the beauty of my church [Friendship Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] is that we have local autonomy.  Nobody pays my dues for me.  If I don't pay my dues, they don't get paid.  And by virtue of me paying my own sets of dues, then, what's that, taxation without representation is tyranny?  I think you historians told me that one.  And so, if I'm paying my taxation, then I have the right to vote whatever way I want to.  You can be president, but what's that got to do with me voting the way I want to.  So I'm voting for Skabotchio [ph.], and that's the way it goes.  If you convince me that you're a better man than Skabotchio is, I'll vote for you.  If you don't convince me, then next, try again next time; see if you can make it.  And Dr. Jackson, a very eloquent scholar, very brilliant man, his stance on Dr. King I didn't agree with, but I agree with the convention.  And I suppose essentially I agreed with the philosophy of the convention, I would stay in the convention.  But I still support Dr. King.
Story_ID: 289542
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They wonder why I would stay in the convention and support Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, especially because it split, the National Baptist Convention split off in '61 [1961] into, well, another organization was formed called the Progressive National Baptist Convention with [HistoryMaker Reverend] Gardner Taylor as president.  And Dr. King's supporters mostly were in the Progressive National Baptist Convention.  Did--were you tempted to split off?
Speaker 2: No, no, I didn't go with no split.  I don't think I ought to divorce my wife [Lucy Lewis Hall] because she ain't sixteen no more, you know, for richer, for poorer, for better, for worse, in sickness, in health.  No, I ain't gonna quit.  I ain't gonna quit her 'cause she ain't sixteen.  So I stayed right here, other people, other group, whatever.  Don't run; you don't have to jump.  No, but that, that's the freedom that you have as a Baptist, that I can vote the way I want to vote and, and sustain what I want to sustain, with a certain amount of freedom.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you never had any negative feedback for being a Dr. King supporter in the National Baptist Convention?
Speaker 2: What, what kind of feedback, if I'm paying my own way?
Speaker 1: Well, I mean did, nobody, I mean did, were you criticized by those in the National Baptist Convention for--
Speaker 2: Try it again.
Speaker 1: Were you criticized for supporting Dr. King by the other members?
Speaker 2: I don't think I spent no time on that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I'd probably get criticized for the way I preached or the way I don't preach or, or being married to a black woman instead of a high-yellow woman.  What am I gonna do, quit?  I'm a quitter?  Go get a high-yellow woman?  No, I ain't gon' do that.
Speaker 1: So, for you it's a question of loyalty and sticking with--
Speaker 2: I think I have the right, I think I have the right to be free.  I don't think I belong to you because I'm committed to your denomination.  I don't think I belong to you.  That's where we differ.  I belong to God.  I belong to God, and so my commitment is to him, to do what's right to the best of my ability.  And I thought Dr. King was right, over Dr. [Joseph H.] Jackson.
Story_ID: 289543
Speaker 1: Now tell us about the development of this church [Friendship Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], 'cause we were talking about that upstairs, about how you moved out of the old synagogue you were in, and built a new church.  How did that happen?
Speaker 2: Oh, we moved out another old one, older than the synagogue.  It's, it's still there too, at the corner of Damen [Avenue] and Washington [Boulevard], an old red brick church house sitting right on the corner, nowhere to park, next to the housing project.  And, but you know, communication is hard to come by in a black community.  I was president of Midwest Community Council [Chicago, Illinois].  And word started coming down the pike that the area was gonna get rezoned.  I went to the powerful boys who had the thousands of members, and said the word has come down the pike that the area is gonna get rezoned, and they gonna clear it out for the [Chicago] Bulls to play basketball, be nothing left but the church houses; the people gonna be all gone.  I'm president of Midwest Community Council.  The white bankers are on my board.  I told the big, black Baptist preachers who had the thousands of members the word was coming down the pike.  Oh no, oh no, no, no, no.  The word is coming down the pike.  It's gonna be zoned.  Oh no, no, no, it, it's getting cleared out.  It's getting rezoned.  The paperwork's (unclear) oh no, no, no.  I bought some land in an old synagogue in [North] Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois] and moved.  Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, go back over there now, it's empty church houses; people are all gone.  Now you explain why I ain't never been charged with being mulatto, you know, high yellow.  My nose is shaped wrong.  I'm black.  Why couldn't they believe that the area was getting rezoned?  Because somebody black was telling them.  There was change.  The whole thing is gone.  And if they have church over there, pure commuters.  But they had warning and warning and warning, projects, basketball, good for the city, so they said.
Story_ID: 289544
Speaker 1: Oh, I was asking you about the development of the church [Friendship Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois].  And when did you start the process of building the new church?  And you were telling me upstairs about the design of the design considerations.
Speaker 2: I looked at the Greeks and everybody else's.  They made their marks.  And when they moved out, somebody said such and such a kind of folks were here.  And I said well, what do they have for Africans?  What do they have that say that Negroes once occupied the land?  We're not Scottish Arabians; we're not Polish; we're not Indians [Native Americans].  What do we have to say that once upon a time, we inhabited the turf?  Oh no, oh no, you don't want to do that.  I said, "Who else has a landmark for us?"  So they grabbed, and pushed, and charged.  Finally, I ran up on an architect [Weese, Seegers, Hickey Weese, Chicago, Illinois] who could get the gleam of what I'm trying to say, that if Eskimos can have an igloo, and the Indians can have a teepee, why can't Africans have something?  Say here's where some black men came by and made a mark.  Look like something ought to say something: there was one time some black men came through here.  And then you go back and look at history, and here's a history of the African who has built the pyramids.  They've lasted for centuries.  Let's do it.  Oh, you don't want no pyramids, oh no, no, oh no, no.  I don't know.  Why can't we?  Well, nobody (unclear).  Why can't (unclear).  Okay, now we're gon' build it, and now if you want your name in the building, it'll cost you a thousand dollars.  He got to be out of his cotton picking mind.  He's gonna take our money and go back to Texas and dig him an oil well.  He's gonna be rich and live happily ever after with our money.  Well I said, "But I haven't taken it yet in twenty years, so, I'm getting a little old to be moving now."  (Unclear) so, got my architect, got my design, a dream, and then went to work.  Every day I'm here.  Every day I'm here, not some day; every day I'm here.  And the contractor was a primetime architect--
Story_ID: 288089
Speaker 1: We looked at the design [for Friendship Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois].  It went back to the pyramids, and it's gonna be ugly; it's gonna be; ah, it's gonna be ugly; it's gonna be awful, ah, da, da, da, da.  We heard it every day, every day we're here.  And it's gonna be ugly.  If you want your name on the wall, we got ten marble slabs.  Get your name on the wall, it's gonna cost you a thousand dollars.  And don't wait until all the space is gone and then be ready, you holler and cry, dah, da, da.  You ain't gonna--, "Oh, I'll tell you what he's gonna do.  He's gonna take all our money and go back to Texas and build him a--dig him an oil well.  And he's gonna die rich, and we gonna die poor," la, da, dah, da, da.  So we kept on working and kept on working, and then came the day of the entrance.  And we come in, and two hundred cars line up.  And everybody else is saying, "What is that funny-looking place down there?  And look at there, they got a new funny-looking place.  I ain't never seen no place that look like that."  Well, this was your first time dealing with Africans, but they've been building pyramids for ten thousand years.  It's part of African culture.  And then amazing thing happened.  We got one of those Chicago [Illinois] winters.  And a Chicago winter, they're I guess warm everywhere else and freezes in the churchhouse.  And winter came.  And then the heat went up as it usually had done all the other eighty years, and it decided to go out the window, but there wasn't no window up there.  And the heat settled back down and stayed in the house, and my gas bill went straight on down and on down and down.  And they all lived happily ever after, sweating in the wintertime, simple as that.
Speaker 2: So the design turned out to be a practical design, you know, to conserve energy and as well as--
Speaker 1: The whole ball of wax.
Speaker 2: --yeah, as well as--
Speaker 1: Air conditioning is in your favor, and heating, never even dreamed of it.  Nobody else told you nothing.  You have to get out there and try it yourself, and then find out that the Phoenicians and the Africans knew something about heat control that we hadn't even heard tell of.  So if you do that, and you get rich, I want my cut (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you'll be--
Speaker 2: I think that--
Speaker 1: --put 'em, you--
Speaker 2: --the designers were like Reese, Hickey and Reese [sic.], right?  You said the, the people that put it together were Reese, Hickey and Reese?
Speaker 1: Weese, Hickey and Weese [Weese, Seegers, Hickey Weese, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Weese, Weese.
Speaker 1: Weese.
Speaker 2: Okay, Weese--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Hickey and Weese, okay.
Speaker 1: Those were my architects.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I was the designer though, 'cause I had to contend, and then the thousand dollars started coming in.  And then I said, "If you want to get your name on the wall, the marble is all gone.  It still costs you a thousand dollars."  And instead of it taking us twenty years to pay it off, by the grace of God, we paid it off in three and half years.  And I haven't gone back to Texas yet to enjoy those oil wells that they said I was gonna have soon as I got all of that money.  Here I still am.
Story_ID: 288090
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you about the riot in 1968.  I know after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated there were riots on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].  Can you remember what you were doing during the, when Dr. King was assassinated?
Speaker 2: No, after it was--I was in a four-story Jewish synagogue.  My wife [Lucy Lewis Hall] has a coronary condition, and she said under no circumstances is she ever going up to the fourth floor, no, no circumstances--
Speaker 1: There you go, thank you (laughter).
Speaker 2: --under no circumstances.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the bullets started going off, and the fires started lighting up on Roosevelt Road.  And I went up to the fourth floor to look out the window to see how far it was going.  And I said, "Well, my poor wife, I know she's downstairs hovering in a corner trying to duck bullets," 'cause she said she ain't about to go up on no fourth floor.  And then I felt something in my right side. I didn't think I was bleeding to death.  And I felt it move again.  That was my wife all the way up the four floors.  And I decided she and George Washington need to get together and promise to never tell another lie.  She had run all the way up to the fourth floor 'cause she was scared to stay down on the ground floor.  They were shooting everywhere.  I don't blame her much.  I was already up there.  But I was so high up you could look over and see the fires going everywhere.  And the mixed report came out--mixed report came out after every, every kind of riot like that.  Did somebody profiteer off of it, or was it just really a riot?  Did somebody want to get rid of some old real estate and as a good land clearance chance, to get rid of old real estate and build some new stuff?  All kinds of rumors.

Speaker 1: What is your spiritual philosophy?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what is your spiritual philosophy?
Speaker 2: My spiritual philosophy?  Which aspect, human or divine?
Speaker 1: Well, both, I guess.  How do we fit into the--I mean what, I guess what are your spiritual beliefs and practice in terms of being a reverend, you know, today?
Speaker 2: I don't know how that would rise.  I don't know how that one would rise.  My spiritual philosophy, I can quote you a number of verses.  And I don't know whether that's what you're asking for or not.
Speaker 1: No, we're not really necessarily asking for that.  We always ask this question of theologians and ministers, you know.  We ask them what their spiritual philosophy because we want to know, I guess, what it is.  And they usually have one.
Speaker 2: I have discovered that God is true to his word.  He may not come when you want him, but He's very punctual.  He--this year I've seen an apology from the press for something that happened forty years ago on the editorial page.  This year an apology comes on the editorial page.  And you look at it--this year I've seen adjustments made, that God is in no hurry, that He comes in his own good time, and if I wait on Him and trust Him and believe in Him, He will do what's right.  He'll do what's right.

Speaker 1: Now sir, do you have any, do you have any thoughts about black theology?
Speaker 2: Of course.  Come on, next shoe.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Next shoe.
Speaker 1: Next shoe?  No, I just wondered if, 'cause in the late '60s [1960s], the same time that [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was here in Chicago [Illinois], and during the time of the riots and all that, I mean, black theologians like [HistoryMaker] James [H.] Cone and other people were writing books on the black church and black theology.  And I just wondered if you had any opinions about, you know, black theology and where black people should be going in particular in terms of, you know, building their churches and what directions we set and tones we set for church and for spirituality.
Speaker 2: That's what I'm talking about, that if people, not just black people, but if people would only be fair with God, if people don't be fair, if people would only be fair with God, now you don't have to have it in black theology and white theology.  But if people would only be fair with God, instead simply wanting God to do special blessings for them, how couldn't they depend on Him and count on Him and trust Him?  Why can't they?  They can't change the weather.  You can cuss about the storm, but you can't make the weather change, you can't make the weather break.  If people would only be fair with God.  I think that's where our difficulty lies.  We want God to hurry up and do.  We want it done yesterday, and we don't know what His schedule is, and then forty years later God does it.  They had a song that they sang at our church [Friendship Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois].  It says He may not come when you want Him, but He's right on time.  He may not come when you want Him, but He's right on time.  I've learned that to be true.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: If we could get a little more justice, a little more justice--did you get the Chicago Tribune yesterday?  Did you ever go back and bootleg one, make you up one, or stick you up a gun and get you one?  The Emmett Till case, the front page, forty years ago, they're exhuming the body all over again, Emmett Till case.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, forty years later, fifty years later, exhuming the body, two of the men accused are dead.  How you gonna do that?  Come on.
Speaker 1: Were you--did you go to the funeral of Emmett Till?  You weren't here though in '55 [1955], right?  You weren't in Chicago [Illinois] in '55 [1955], right?
Speaker 2: When did I get here?
Speaker 1: In '62 [1962], I guess, right [sic.]?  It was '62 [1962], I believe, yeah, but you didn't, you didn't go to his funeral?  That was in '55 [1955], yeah.  But, do you remember Mamie Till and some of the people involved in the Till case?
Speaker 2: The, all of the names, I mean--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --this was a Mississippi trend.  And, but it's such an irony that history and men--and then you go back, and what are you really going to do now, how many years later, fifty years later?  What are you gonna do?  Two of the men are dead--the front page, Chicago daily newspaper, Emmett Till.  What are you gonna do, and why the conscience, why the business conscience of America is disturbed?  Something's wrong with it, something wrong, something wrong, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, I think they, they suspect there are other people involved and are still at large, you know--
Speaker 2: But even if there are, they're gonna be so old until you couldn't convict 'em.  You gonna be sympathizing with 'em.  The moral wrongness of the Till case is that the dual standard of America that if a white boy whistles at a black girl, what would have happened?  Nothing.  He's just being mannish.  But a black boy whistle at a white girl, and it becomes a capital offense, something wrong.  Now that's where, that's where fifty years later you, you're going back digging up conscience, fifty years later, sir.  Yesterday's front page Chicago, front page newspaper.  I don't see how you missed it.  When I saw it, I asked my daughter had she seen it.  Everybody else I contact, did you see it?  No, there's something wrong, something wrong, something radically wrong, and it wasn't theologians; it wasn't theologians.  If America can straighten out her moral standard, and murder is murder, killing is killing, not color.  If a black boy whistles at a white girl, is that guilty of murder?  Come now, something wrong.

Speaker 1: Sir, tell me, if, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Would there be what?
Speaker 1: When you look back on all the activities, and, that you've been involved in, and the things that you've done up until this point in your life, is there any major thing that you would go back and do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: That's a good one.  No, I, no, I think the reason that I didn't do it sooner was I wasn't ready to do it.  I was in Yoakum, Texas, living an impossible life that the sociologist would tell me I could not be living, that you don't have integrated communities in the South.  My daddy's [Will Hall] house was 112 East Hochheim Street, Yoakum, Texas.  And across the street was the Sheckels' home, Zack [ph.] Sheckels.  And old man Sheckels was mayor of the village of Yoakum, Texas, Yoakum, Texas, not New York.  I shot marbles with Bohemians [Germans] and cussed with Mexicans in Yoakum, Texas, to go to college to learn that black and whites don't grow up together.  They live in separate communities.  I said, "No, something wrong with that."  I'm from Yoakum, Texas.  The mayor lived across the street from me.  I know his boy.  They ran the ice plant.  And you gon' tell me they don't grow up together.  No, they stay in separate areas.  I said, "Something wrong, either the book or somebody else is wrong."  Coming from a confused background like that, and here is the whites, here is the Mexicans, here is the blacks on the same street, in the same block.  You learn to shoot marbles in Mexican and cuss in Spanish (laughter), and then to go to college and learn that they don't grow up together.  You say somebody got the game mixed up, somebody got something.  So you have to go through, have to grow up, have to fumble, have to try to go to junior college, have to try to get your marbles game straight, try to see where you're going; what can you do?  And one day at a little bitty church--I'm sitting near the back--a middle-aged man passes by me, and puts a pamphlet in my hand, and doesn't say a word, and keeps on walking.  It turned out he was an uncle of mine.  The pamphlet that he puts in my hand says, "T. C. Gardner: How to Build a Standard BTU," [ph.].  And I said, "I don't want that old book.  I'm interested in jazz music.  I want to catch up with Duke Ellington," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Why'd he give me that book? [Great] Depression was on.  I go home.  I read the book.  It says, here's how to build a standard BTU [Baptist Training Union].  I read the book.  I memorize the book.  Three years from there I got BTUs sprouting up all over southwest Texas.  I got to Bishop College [Marshall, Texas].  I get into youth work.  Oh, tell me about it--God, God reaches and gets you.  I don't think you do all of the getting at all.
Story_ID: 288095
Speaker 1: So you're saying that you just, that there's nothing you could change if, you know, anyway.  It just kind of--
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: You're trying to say that there's a plan for you anyway.  Is that what you're saying, that you wouldn't change anything if you could?
Speaker 2: I think I'd be stupid to try to change it.  I couldn't, I can't outthink God.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you--
Speaker 2: I thought, I thought--
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: --I wanted to be a Duke Ellington protege until I saw Duke Ellington sitting on the end of a horn case at the library auditorium in San Antonio, Texas, out of shape.  His belly was hanging all over his pants.  He was beating up a mean piano though, boy, and the crowd was grunting and sweating.  And I looked at Duke Ellington and said no.  I don't want to spend all my life going from one nightstand to another inhaling smoke and sweat, no.  No, I think I'd rather be where I am.

Speaker 1: When you look back on your life and everything that you've done to this point, what today would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: What today would I consider as my legacy?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: What today would I consider my legacy?  The education of children.  I've seen this church community [at Friendship Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] go from one child trying to go to college to seventeen in college in the same West Side of Chicago [Illinois].  And when my children of the church and community keep growing--I have a young lady who's getting married next week.  She came to the house, and she talked 'til when she could.  But at the tail end of it her continence changed, and she broke down and went to crying.  And I sent the young man to get some Kleenexes.  When I've seen people like this whose lives have been made better, and I know their background, and I'm fulfilled.  I'm happy that I don't have to have a Rolls-Royce or whatever, that God has used me to make somebody want to be a better person, and then to see 'em climb and to see 'em come from a background with no college, and they're college graduates, that's joy; that's a joy; that's a joy.
Story_ID: 288097
Speaker 1: Sir, tell us about your family, 'cause you have an interesting family because so many of your, well, all of your children seem to have accomplished something and your--you know, tell us about 'em, and a little bit about how you raised them, how you and your wife [Lucy Lewis Hall] raised them.
Speaker 2: My family?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: We're blessed.  We have three children: [L.] Priscilla [Hall], the older; Louise [HistoryMaker Shelvin Louise Hall], that you met, the middle; and Lewis [Hall], the scholar.  We got here, and they had an appreciation service, and they gave me thirty dollars I think.  I reckon it was that much.  And I said they gave me--that's for my installation, thirty dollars, ten dollars apiece for you to go to college on.  I ain't getting you out of jail.  I ain't paying for no abortions.  I ain't getting you out from getting drunk.  If somebody jumps on you and they're wrong, I'll come to your rescue but not if you start the fight.  You got a free call to me.  Don't ever use it if you're the cause of it.  This is to send you to college, ten dollars.
Speaker 1: Now what about your children?  Now they, you got two judges, right, and--
Speaker 2: I'm better than that.  I've got, my kids listened to the other kids in the neighborhood.  And the kids in neighborhood said, we do this and we do this and we do, ah, and they come back home--we lived in Maywood [Illinois]--and they said, the others at thirteen are doing such and such a thing.  I said, "But our fence is right here, and it stops here at our fence.  It stops at our fence.  You have fifty years to wear high-heeled shoes, fifty years to wear high-heeled shoes, so let's be a little girl while you're a little girl."  You know, you always you'll have one child who talks more than the others.  So one 'em said, "That sounds like blackmail."  I said, "Blackmail?"  She said, "Yeah, it sounds like blackmail.  The rest of 'em up and down the street can do such and such thing."  I said, "Well, frankly, I don't know how to raise nobody else no other way than the way that my parents [Will Hall and Mayme Shelvin Hall] raised us.  I don't know nobody--I don't know no other way.  And my daddy said it stops at our fence 'cause you ain't got no fence, but it stops at our fence."  And one of 'em said blackmail.  I said, "Well, let's agree.  Last time I looked in the mirror I looked kind of dark, so we agree that, can we agree that we're black?"  "Yeah."  "And the last time I looked at me, I was male, so let's call it black male, but that's what it's gonna be.  And ain't paying for no abortions.  I ain't paying for getting you out of jail when you did something stupid.  Then call it whatever you want to.  All right, are we together?"  "Okay."  That's what they did.  And to this day I haven't had to get nobody out of jail, to pay for no abortions.  They all have been married, whatever.

The next one [HistoryMaker Shelvin Louise Hall] is an appellate court justice in Chicago [Illinois] that you know more about than I do.  And the third one [Lewis Hall] is in charge of the scholar program for the State of New York, twenty-five million dollar scholarship.  Three out of three ain't bad.  My wife [Lucy Lewis Hall] gets all the credit.  She did all the babysitting, and all the car driving, all the Boy Scouting and all of the everything else, and all the hunting 'em up from newspaper routes, my wife, and all the answering all the questions, so give her a bow and three bows and three cheers, Mrs. Lucy Mae Hall.  She did the whole thing.  I just paid the bills when I had some money.

Speaker 1: Is there anything else before I ask the last question?  I have one last question, but is there anything that we have not asked you that you want to talk about that, you know, I may not know about?
Speaker 2: I would want to think that you ought to say to young black men: you live in a dual society, and what they say works for American doesn't work for all of Americans; that if he goes to Yoakum, Texas, from Chicago [Illinois], and he decides to whistle at the women, he'd get himself killed if he doesn't read the signs.  And nobody tells you what the books says; you learn it at the risk of your life or death.  I walked in the store as an older teenager, and I've been up, been around, been to Portland, Oregon, all the rest of it, feeling nonchalant and sophisticated and all la, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.  And then I went talking, and the clerk got quieter and quieter and quieter.  And pretty soon I looked, and she was gettin' redder and redder and redder.  And it happened it clicked, and the woman was getting ready to scream.  And if she had screamed one time I'd been dead, 'cause all those men with those Winchesters they keep, they're gonna come out shooting 'cause somebody did something to Safrina [ph.].  And then after I'm dead, they gonna say (laughter) he forgot the laws of the land.  And it dawned on me that she was about to panic, and I said, oh.  I changed gears.  I said, "Yes, ma'am, y'all sure do have a beautiful store here.  I don't see how you keep it so pretty and so clean."  And the color started going back down out of her cheek and out of her face, and pretty soon she was smiling again.  And I paid for that stuff and got out of town.  I could've been just as dead as Emmett Till if somewhere I had not learned the death signal.  Maybe in writing your book you ought to be able to say to them, there're still some landmines that will kill you, and you don't know they're landmines.  Because they say you're free, it doesn't mean that.  How you gonna get it off?  You're smarter than I am.  My generation, you simply back up and eat crow.  But eating crow and staying alive, you'll be around to be, help somebody else out.  That I think will be my epitaph.

Speaker 1: Yeah, he's on the end, right?
Speaker 2: The only thing, ma'am, is that when the people who are making the captions listen to this, they can't see you pointing.  So it's better to say, you know, either left to right, or say the woman with the hat is--who do we think that is, the woman with the hat?  We think that's?
