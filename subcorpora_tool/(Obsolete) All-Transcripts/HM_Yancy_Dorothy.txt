Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Put you in the mood. What is your favorite food?

Story_ID: 580003
Speaker 1: Let's go into your family background.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Who is your mother and when was she born?
Speaker 2: Oh my mother was Linnie Bell Cowser [Linnie Covington Cowser] and she was born on June 8th and I forget the exact year. I'm trying to remember. If she were living she would be ninety-two, she would have been ninety-two, her birthday this year. And my father [Howard Cowser] was born the same year, so he will be ninety-two on the 22nd of June, he's living.
Speaker 1: So tell me--and tell me your mother's name again and spell it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Her name is Linnie, Linnie Bell Covington Cowser. That's L-I-N-N-I-E, Bell, B-E-L-L, Covington, C-O-V-I-N-G-T-O-N, Cowser, C-O-W-S-E-R. So I guess that would be 1915, right? Yeah.
Speaker 1: And where did your mother grow up, where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother was born and grew up in Cherokee County, Alabama not far from where I was born. And she grew up, she lived there all of her life and that's where she died. She grew up on a farm and we always had a farm, and that's--she was a farm girl, I guess you would call it.
Speaker 1: What kind of farm?
Speaker 2: Well, my father had a farm and he planted corn, cotton, we had wheat and we had soybeans, we had cows and pigs. There were times when he farmed about a thousand acres. So we had a fairly large farm and he used to lease a lot of farm land. He owned about four hundred and some acres and then he leased the other land and he worked as a day--he worked for what they called then, Republic Steel [Republic Steel Company], which became LTV [LTV Corporation] out of Cleveland [Ohio] after all the various purchases that took place. But he worked in the (unclear) drawing department so he had a hard laboring job and he ran the farm. So he--he worked two jobs all of my life.
Speaker 1: And that was your?
Speaker 2: My father. And my mother worked on the farm with my father. And there were four of us as children. I had--I had an older sister whose name was Evelyn [Evelyn Cowser].
Speaker 1: Okay. Let me find out--so your mother grew on--grew up on a farm near there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, that's right. She was born--she--my mother and my father were born in the same county. They were born in Cherokee County. And somehow they met when they were teenagers. They met and they got married at eighteen, and they were the same age.
Story_ID: 580004
Speaker 1: So your mother [Linnie Covington Cowser], do you know her parents' names?
Speaker 2: Sure. Her mother's name was Zonnie, Z-O-N-N-I-E, Covington [Zonnie Covington]. And her father's name was Shaley, S-H-A-L-E-Y, Covington [Shaley Covington].
Speaker 1: Spell that one more time?
Speaker 2: S-H-A-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: That was her father?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Do you know when they were born?
Speaker 2: No, I don't. I don't know when they were born. I mean, I could go back and--and pull it out of the family Bible or off of the tombstones, but I can't remember. I know that my grandmother died, she was about seventy-three. And my grandfather was in his seventies. Now he was older--a few years older than she was, maybe by ten years or so 'cause she was his second wife and he had had children by his first wife.
Speaker 1: And they were probably born in the late 1800s?
Speaker 2: They had to have been born late 1800s, because my other grandparents [Electa Glover Cowser and Hurley Cowser], my father's [Howard Cowser] parents, were born lateen--late 1800s and I--I knew my great-grandmother [Alabama Adams Glover] from my father's side and she was born right after the Civil War.
Story_ID: 580005
Speaker 1: So your maternal grandparents [Zonnie Covington and Shaley Covington], they lived on a farm as well?
Speaker 2: They all lived on a farm. My grandparents, my great-grandparents and my parents [Linnie Covington Cowser and Howard Cowser] all were born on farms. As a matter of fact, my great-grandmother--
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Fronnie Alabama Glover [Alabama Adams Glover]. That was my father's grandmother who I knew very well. I have pictures of her. Fronnie Alabama was born on the farm that my brother [Howard Dale Cowser] and I own now, that my father before us owned, we bought it from my father.
Speaker 1: When was she born, approximately (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was born around the 1870s. She was born right after the war [Civil War] and somehow she received land from the Homestead Act [Homestead Act of 1862]. She, along with all of her brothers and sisters from my, my grandfather was--her father, her father was named Paris Adams, my great-great-grandfather. He's buried right in front of our house where we have the family reunion. And so my great-great-grandfather was the son of the plantation owner and after the war, there was a strip of land, a part of land in Alabama, a part of it had been the Spanish territory that was still unclaimed land. And so this black family were given a hundred and sixty acres for each child. They signed for the land and their--I have some of the deeds now where the stamp is on there from the president, because you had to homestead it. You had to live on it a certain number of years and pay a fee, and then the land was yours. And my brother and I own land out of the Homestead Act that we purchased because they--they agreed back in those days that they would only sell to each other. And so my great-grandmother, Fronnie Alabama, whose husband was named Lewis Glover somehow my great-great-grandfather, Paris, was able to get all of his children signed up for land. And so there's a swatch of land up the Coosa River that is the community where we were born.
Speaker 1: Up the Coosa River?
Speaker 2: The Coosa River, C-O-O-S-A. The Coosa River runs between--it starts in Georgia and it runs through Cherokee County [Alabama] into Etowah County [Alabama] and then it keeps going and it empties.
Speaker 1: So tell me about Paris, tell me his full name?
Speaker 2: Paris was P-A-R-I-S-H [sic.], Paris Adams. And his wife was named Adline [Adline Adams]. They're both buried in front of my, my--beside the church [New Bethel United Methodist Church, Ballplay, Alabama] that we all grew up going to church in and they're right beside the property that my brother and I own the farm. The family cemetery is there.
Speaker 1: He was the son of the slave owner (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A slave master, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Do you--do you know the slave master's name?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I've, I've started going back to look, but I know that they were related to the--oh gosh I'm trying to think of the name. He was a Adams and the family that lived up from my grandfather--my great-grandmother was--somehow they--some of these children also were children of the slave master because they grew up knowing they were children--that they were sisters and brothers, although some were black and some were white. And the--as a kid I remember taking messages for these little old ladies that look like little white ladies, but one was black and one was white. One was my great-grandmother whose name was Fronnie Alabama.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Fronnie?
Speaker 2: F-R-O-N-N-I-E, I think she spelled it.
Speaker 1: And so there were the white Adams and the black Adams?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember her sister's name. I'll think of it--Walker [ph.]. Their, their names were Walker. Bec- but they had--but they were connected to the Adams, but Walker became--was a plantation name too. Walker. And I just remember calling her Mrs. Walker.
Story_ID: 580006
Speaker 1: The reason I got to know Mrs. Walker [ph.] so well was she had a daughter who was very, very nice, her name was Naomi [ph.]. And she had a son whose name was Hugh C [ph.]. Now I don't know what the Hugh and the C stood for. But she had these two children, and Mr. Walker was dead by the time I was a child. But then--we lived on a dirt road and the newspaper man would not throw the newspaper at our house, but he would throw it at their house which was a little over half a mile from our house. And you know, when you're in elementary school there's a time when you had to do current events and so that meant you had to get the newspaper. And so every day I would walk down to Ms. Walker's house to get the newspaper and chat with her and talk, and I would carry messages for these little old ladies. And that's how I got to know her. And then after she died, I was told then that that was my [paternal] great-grandmother's [Alabama Adams Glover] half-sister.
Speaker 2: Now did you--could you tell them--could you tell that one was white and one was black (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They looked just alike. No, they both were very fair with, you know, this blonde, white hair that they had on those little things that they tucked around and they had--they wore these little caps. Because by then they were basically bedridden by the time I got a certain age. But I knew them when they could walk. But they were quite interesting little old ladies and they kept up with each other through, through us, through the great-grandchildren.
Speaker 2: Did they grow up as sisters?
Speaker 1: Evidently they did, but they didn't grow up in the same house. But they grew up knowing that they were related. Is this weird?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a part of the history.
Speaker 1: It's a part of the history. And as a matter of fact, it's funny because the property--Mr. Walker's property is still sitting between some of our properties. He was in the middle and he, he was considered to be a Negro lover. Of course they had another name for him, Hugh C, 'cause he would claim these relatives that other white folk had problems with him claiming (laughter). He was quite an interesting old fella. He was more of a redneck than anything else. He loved Bacardi rum. When I'd go home, I made sure I took him a bottle (laughter).
Speaker 2: And was he related to you at all?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was Ms. Walker's son (laughter). So, in--in their way they claimed their relationships going back from slavery, it was weird.
Speaker 2: And was that something that was embraced in that town [in Cherokee County, Alabama]?
Speaker 1: Well it wasn't a town. It was a rural community and we all knew and we all took care of each other. And when Mrs. Walker died, I remember my aunts going to help clean the house and do the things that you do for all the families to come and eat and go to the funeral and all that. We went to each other's funerals. It was slightly different (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) White or black?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And there was no distinction?
Speaker 1: There was a distinction, you knew you were white and they were white, and you knew you were black. We went to separate schools. My mother's best friend was a white woman whose name was, was Ally, Ally Baker [ph.]. And Ally had been a school teacher because she'd gone to college I guess a year or two. And white women were allowed to teach in those days when they didn't go very far. And she had children that were our age. My mother [Linnie Covington Cowser] and she had a child that matched, every child matched. And we grew up together having tea parties and the whole thing. And we went to each other's funerals, we were pall bearers, we were the whole thing.
Speaker 2: Wow, do you know--
Speaker 1: But we went to black schools and white schools, we knew what we were.
Speaker 2: Do you know any other dis- relatives on your mother's side going back?
Speaker 1: These relatives that were white were on my father's [Howard Cowser] side. I never knew--I knew my mother's relatives, but my mother's relatives were not as--she had uncles and cousins and all of this, but we never saw any of the white ones. We saw the white ones on my father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay, so let me get the lineage, make sure I have it straight. So take me through your mom, your grandparents back, just names?
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll give you my mother first. My mother's mother's name was Zonnie [Zonnie Covington] and her father was Shaley [Shaley Covington]. I don't know the names of the ones before that. But Zonnie's last name was--let's see I know what it was--I'll tell you in a minute, I just--
Speaker 2: Covington?
Speaker 1: Covi- she was a Covington, but she--her maiden name is what I was trying to remember. Because I knew her brothers so I know her maiden name, I just can't think of it right this minute. I'll think of it. But my father was the one that I can trace further back than anybody (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 580007
Speaker 1: Tell me your father's name again (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. My father's name was Howard, Howard Cowser. His father's name was Hurley Cowser.
Speaker 1: When was Howard born?
Speaker 2: Howard was born the same year as Linnie Bell [Linnie Covington Cowser], 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay. And his parents?
Speaker 2: His father's name was Hurley Cowser, H-E-R-L-E-Y [sic.]. H-U-R-L-E-Y and Hurley was married to Electa, E-L-E-C-T-A, Adams. She was Electa Glover [Electa Glover Cowser], I'm sorry, who became a Cowser, she was a Glover. And then her parents were Fronnie Alabama Adams Glover [Alabama Adams Glover] and Grandfather Glover was named Lewis Glover. And then I don't anything about Lewis' parents, but Fronnie Alabama, her father was named Paris Adams and her mother was named Adline [Adline Adams]. I have pictures of them. And Adline was born around 1818, somewhere in there. Because I go--I have to go back and look in the--in the records because the tombstones, at some point at the--after the turn of the century, I guess, in the '20s [1920s] or so, the little cemetery, the people got together and they made tombstones for everybody and they put all the dates of births and deaths on them. So you can just walk around and pick people out in the cemetery--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --where we have the family reunion. We have a family reunion every year and it's done the Saturday before the first Sunday in May and it's happened since, since, since right after slavery. Because not long after slavery, they built themselves a church and they, they got money and they bought, I think it was about three acres or whatever it was and they built a church, and it's a United Methodist church. And it's still there. It's called New Bethel Methodist Church [New Bethel United Methodist Church, Ballplay, Alabama]. And the cemetery is there, and that's how I know what's on the stones, because I grew up right in front of the cemetery.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: My brother [Howard Dale Cowser] lives right in front of the church.
Speaker 1: Okay. So Howard was your father?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. He's still living (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hurley was your grandfather. Okay, still living?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Electa, grandmother.
Speaker 2: That's right, that was--
Speaker 1: And which one of your grandparents is still living?
Speaker 2: None of them. My father is still--
Speaker 1: Okay your grand- your father is still living?
Speaker 2: --he'll be ninety-two in a couple of weeks.
Speaker 1: And your great-grandparents, Fronnie and Lewis.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. That was--that will be my father's great-grandparents--they would be his grandparents rather. 'Cause Fronnie and Lewis would be Electa's parents. I cannot remember Big Daddy Hurley's mother's name. I have a picture of her and his father, but I can't remember their names. I have it in a book.
Speaker 1: And so you brought me back to Paris and Adline?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Paris and Adline were the parents of Fronnie Alabama.
Speaker 1: And Paris--
Speaker 2: Now Fronnie is the one--
Speaker 1: --was the son of the slave master?
Speaker 2: Of the slave master and Paris was the one who got the land for all of his children after the war [Civil War] from the Homestead Act [Homestead Act of 1862].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And all his children were named Adams and then they all married these people with different names.
Speaker 1: Now was it unusual at this time to be in a position to buy the land?
Speaker 2: They didn't buy it. It's--
Speaker 1: Well the Homestead, through the Homestead Act?
Speaker 2: Well it had to be unusual because if you read the history of African Americans they were promised forty acres and a mule, and they didn't get it. But these black folk got a hundred and sixty acres and, and, and out of the Homestead Act. They got land out of the--the parcel of land that my brother and I own now, the piece--I own a farm and it actually goes back to the Barrington side of the family who was married to one of the Adams girls. So you have to understand, these children of Paris were in a position to get the land for their husbands too. See they--it became the--each family got some property.
Speaker 1: And they all farmed the land?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they all farmed the land.
Speaker 1: Amazing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 580008
Speaker 1: So tell me about your birth and early childhood. You were born in 1944?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: On the family farm [in Cherokee County, Alabama] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On the family farm, in a house my father [Howard Cowser] had built.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the house?
Speaker 2: It was a little four room house. It had an outdoor bathroom, it had a well, it was on a dirt road, and my father worked at the steel mill [Republic Steel Company], and he had started his farming. And by the time I was born, he owned twenty acres and he continued to buy property. And when I was twelve, I remember him buying two hundred acres and a house that was a ranch style house, it was like seven rooms and at the time, my sister [Evelyn Cowser], my older sister had gone to college. She was at Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and they were influenced by the Methodist church. I--I've always thought about the influence that the Methodist church had on my family, because my father, my grandmother and all of them were Methodist from the time they had started this. See, I have the original church deeds and they put Xs when they bought and when they built that church [New Bethel United Methodist Church, Ballplay, Alabama].
Speaker 1: What year did they build that?
Speaker 2: They built it in, it was around 1888 or before 1890 they built the church.
Speaker 1: And the family actually built the church?
Speaker 2: The families, yeah. The Adams family and those--those girls and the men, those offsprings and they have Xs. My great-grandmother's name is on there with an X. They bought--Fronnie [Alabama Adams Glover] is on there with an X. They bought this land and they, they had a church, and that was where they had the school. And because they had a school by the '20s [1920s] or so, they got a--a Rosenwald school. See Rosenwald [Julius Rosenwald] was prone to put schools in communities where people had already had a commitment to education. And so the school in our county ended up in our community. This little rural community, my father still--my brother [Howard Dale Cowser] owns the school now, it's sitting right there on the farm. And it--we all went there. I went there. We all--it was one room and we all went in the same room, six grades all in one room.
Speaker 1: What's the name of the school?
Speaker 2: It was called Savage Wood Elementary School [Cherokee County, Alabama] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Spell it again?
Speaker 2: Savage, S-A-V-A-G-E. There was a man named Mr. Savage who had a house right beside the school and they named the school after him. I never knew him, I just knew his house. 'Cause by the time I came along he was dead and the two story house was just standing there. Because my father eventually bought the land that the school was on.
Story_ID: 580009
Speaker 1: So how many students attended Savage Wood [Savage Wood Elementary School, Cherokee County, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Oh god, there couldn't have been more than ten or fifteen of us in the whole school, if it was that many. I remember it was the funniest little school. It had a--it had lots of windows and it had a little stage and a little doors would open out so we could have our plays. Then it was just one big open room with a potbelly stove. And then the bathroom was outdoors. And in the back--on the back there was this table where everybody had their own water glass and you brought your own lunch. And the water, you know, you went out to the well and you got the water. And we had a teacher and my first teacher was Mrs.--what was Tea's [ph.] real name. She got--she, she became my godmother. We called her Tea, but her name was, oh goodness I can't even think of--Jessie Wright [ph.] was her name. And so Jessie, she married a Wright but she lived over--came from the other little town and she lived with my parents [Linnie Covington Cowser and Howard Cowser] and she taught school. So she was the teacher for the whole school. Then after her came Miss Ivory [ph.]. And Miss Ivory, I forget who her, her--what her last name was, but she came from Cedar Bluff, Alabama because there was a whole bunch of children, brothers and sisters and they'd all gone to college, they went to Alabama A and M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama]. So Miss Ivory became my teacher. And I think she is retired now, and I know she is retired now, but she still lives in Rome, Georgia I understand. Then after Miss Ivory, we were all bused to the big school. They put us on a bus for twelve miles and took us to the school in Centre, Alabama, C-E-N-T-R-E. Now why they spelled it like the British, I do not know. But went to Centre Hi- Centre, Alabama to a school called Hatcher High School, but it was the elementary, middle and high school all in one.
Speaker 1: So tell me a little more about your elementary school years?
Speaker 2: Oh it was fun (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did you do at school? Did you have--
Speaker 2: Well, I--you have to understand, I left that school when I was in the first grade. What happened was, it was a school and if you were a kid in the community you could just go. And so I went when I was about two or so, yeah. And so an- any little kid could come to school (laughter). As I think back on it, it was before Montessori was ever thought of. And so what happened was, you were just sitting in your little section. And if you wanted to go where the third grader--the third grade person, might not be but one, was reading then you could go over there and work. Or if you wanted to go over and do math with the fifth graders or if you wanted to go and listen to what was happening in first grade, this lady could teach all of it at the same time. And then you could go help people, you know. And so when I was first grade, they closed the school by the time I got to first grade. So when I went to the school in Centre, Alabama, Hatcher High School, they didn't know where to put us because we were strange children. We had had different things at different levels. And so I stayed in first grade a couple of weeks and then they put me in the second grade.
Speaker 1: Now this was at Centre?
Speaker 2: At Hatcher High School.
Speaker 1: At high--Hatcher High School.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you were what, seven years old?
Speaker 2: I was--I was six.
Speaker 1: Six years old (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So my mother was not happy with what was going on in the class and so, I guess she went to visit because in a couple of weeks I was in the second grade. And so by the end of December, by December, that wasn't going to her satisfaction. And so I got shipped down to the third grade, and so at the end of the year somehow I went to the fourth grade and then I was stable. Well, all of us were at different levels because we had been able to study what we wanted to study.
Speaker 1: So you were how old and in fourth grade?
Speaker 2: I finished high school when I was sixteen. I was fifteen, I just turned sixteen. So I stayed at the same grade after that. So I had skipped several grades. But that first year at the big school was a little unusual because I kept moving from one place to another 'cause I was quite bored because we had done all that.
Speaker 1: Well what had you done, what kind of lessons?
Speaker 2: I don't remember. I just knew we knew how to--you know, we knew our multiplication tables, there were things that we knew. And I guess we knew it from just listening to the big kids and playing with the big kids.
Story_ID: 580010
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked math and I liked--I, I loved to read, that was, that was my favorite thing.
Speaker 1: What did you like to read, what books?
Speaker 2: Well, I loved to read anything. And I remember my favorite set of books, and you're probably gonna think I'm really nerdy now, was this set of Childcraft that the school [Savage Wood Elemenatary School, Cherokee County, Alabama] had. The little school had a set of Childcraft, I don't know who bought them. But when the school closed and my father [Howard Cowser] bought the school, we ended up with the whole set of Childcraft. And we used--I used to read all of the fairy tales and all of the stories. And then we would have, you know, they had that big long one, what volume thirteen and fourteen were the big long skinny ones, remember. And they had the--had all the wild animals and all this kind of stuff in it. And it was a really exciting book. And of course the story--the stories you don't tell those kind of stories to children anymore because the people got eaten up, you know. They had to--had to sort of make them socially acceptable in recent years. But I still--we still have that set in my parents' ho- house. But I used to just love to read anything. And then my mother [Linnie Covington Cowser] used to get Progressive Farmer, I know that's not gonna float your boat, but we used to--I used to read The Progressive Farmer, I used to read Reader's Digest, and then Reader's Digest had the books, novels that you could get. And then we use to get all the magazines and stuff. I, I, I would just read anything. But my favorite person that I loved to read about that my mother had difficulty with was Billie Holiday. I loved Billie Holiday. I thought she had the most beautiful voice in the world, but it was about the time that she was on drugs and my mother was just incensed that I wanted to read about this woman. So I would hide and read everything I could about Billie Holiday.
Story_ID: 580011
Speaker 1: And what were the teachers like at Hatcher High School [Centre, Alabama] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh we had--at Hatcher High School we had some interesting, innovative teachers. We had--the place was not built for any kind of school. We had one big long room that was an auditorium and they put partitions that you could see over. You know, what they have now for drywalls. They would have this drywall and they'd have these props on the bottom and the drywall went up, I guess, about six feet or something. And you know, you could look over them. And, and people were teaching in between drywalls. And then there were certain rooms that had walls. But the school was so crowded that was the way it worked. So sometimes you could hear all of the things going on in the next rooms and the teachers had two grades in a room sometimes. And so it was--it was sort of a madhouse, but we had some of the most interesting teachers. We had one teacher whose name was, was Mr. Luther Allen [ph.]. And, and, and white people called him 'Fessor, and I never understood that, but I realized later that was a slave term. Yes, right, they called him 'Fessor, instead of calling him his name. But his name was Mr. Luther Allen. And he didn't drive very good, but he always had a car where you had to change the gears and it would just take off and jerk, you know. So we loved to see him crank his car. But he was quite creative. He used to write plays about social events. And we would act these plays out and so he had something to keep us busy in that fourth grade classroom and third grade that was just so exciting. And we loved to put on Mr. Luther's plays (laughter). I don't know what happened to them, but they were wonderful plays. Then we had teachers--what. Then we had other kinds of teachers. It was just--school was, was interesting I thought. And then I had a--I had one science teacher that I thought was quite interesting. He had been taught by George Washington Carver. And that was interesting.

Speaker 1: Tell me about this area of north Alabama (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Alabama. Okay, it was an interesting little area along the Coosa River and it was next to, very near to DeKalb County [Alabama], Collinsville [Alabama], Boaz [Alabama], Albertville [Alabama] and, and Sand Mountain. Sand Mountain where black people never lived, had never lived, and Sand Mountain and Boaz and Albertville. And it, it, it--and they were rural areas too, farm areas. And they were what you would call Republicans from the Civil War Republicans. That they were that kind of Republicans. And so if you ever look at the politics of north Alabama, you'll find that it's different from the middle of Alabama or south Alabama. So I mean it--and it plays itself out in many ways.
Speaker 1: So they were Lincoln Republicans?
Speaker 2: They were Lincoln Republicans, many of them. And but, but them some of them were Ku Klux Klan [KKK] people. I mean they were all kinds of white people, but all of them were not the same. Is, is--I guess what I'm--what I'm really saying was segregation was the same. Segregation was consistent.
Speaker 1: Describe segregation in your rural area?
Speaker 2: Well, we had--you couldn't go--you had separate schools. You had--there were no restaurants, you know, you--they had a little side thing for you or whatever. They had separate everything.
Speaker 1: What do you mean a side thing for you at the restaurant?
Speaker 2: There was a--there was one restaurant that I remember 'cause my aunt worked in it. They had a door, 'cause I never got anything to eat there. But there was a place where you could go to the door and buy something. The Dairy Queens didn't have separate lines. You went to the same line at the Dairy Queen which I found to be--now I realize that was a little strange. You just went up to the line and got whatever it was in this little town.
Speaker 1: Were there any tensions at Dairy Queen?
Speaker 2: Well, bl- black kids went and got what they wanted and went on. I mean, no one ever hung around the place. But the drive-in theater was segregated. They had the back row for the black kids to park on. The movie was de- was segregated, the movie theaters because they had the upstairs for the black people and the downstairs for the white people and there was a stairwell that I remember. And the same family in town, their last name was Jordan, J-O-R-D-A-N. They owned both movie theaters. And then there was a store that had generally everything in it. And then there was a drugstore. You know, it was a basic little town with two banks, the Cherokee County Bank and then there was a bank that this white family owned, I can't even remember the name of it anymore. But my father didn't allow us to go to that particular bank. We went to it--something had happened. I think he had tried to get a loan as a young man and they didn't give it to him. And so he didn't allow us to go to that bank. And so he used the Cherokee County Bank.
Speaker 1: Do you remember how you felt as a child being a black girl growing up in Cherokee, Alabama [Cherokee County, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Well, my father was considered to be a fairly privileged black man. He owned lots of land and he con- based on what people had, in that area he was considered to have a few resources. Because he had new cars and he had a job. He didn't depend upon the people in the county for his job because he worked in Gadsden, Alabama. So he was sort of a Negro out of control. He was--he had a deputy sheriff thing, which I found to be very weird because he and the sheriff were very good friends. They--a, a--the sheriff and my mother [Linnie Covington Cowser] had grown up together, this white man. Her sister and my mother had grown--his sister and my mother had grown together. And so if we got in trouble or if anything happened to us, we simple said that we were Howard Cowser's children and it made a difference. And th- and I realize now that it--it was strange. I remember going into a store once, the drugstore and the pharmacist made a pass at me. I was about twelve years old and--
Speaker 1: A white pharmacist?
Speaker 2: A white pharmacist, there was only--white people owned all the businesses. I went in there to get something and he made a pass at me and I remember looking at him and said, "Do you know who I am?" And he looked at me, I said, "I'm Electa Cowser's [Electa Glover Cowser] granddaughter and I am going to tell her what you just said." He said, "Oh please," he begged me not to tell my grandmother because I think something would've happened to him. But it was a strange--they had--they had--they had lines that they drew when it came to certain things. Am I making any sense?
Story_ID: 580013
Speaker 1: Your parents, educated people?
Speaker 2: No. My father [Howard Cowser] was a ninth grade dropout and my mother [Linnie Covington Cowser] was a seventh grade dropout. They sent their children to college, but they didn't have the opportunity to go.
Speaker 1: And your mother, what did she do?
Speaker 2: My mother was a homemaker. She worked on the farm with my father and she raised four children [in Cherokee County, Alabama]. And there were times when things were really tight. That's why I'm not a Republican to this day. During the days of Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower], people were laid off work, the '50s [1950s] were horrible and my father was laid off as much as he worked at the steel mill [Republic Steel Company]. And they couldn't make ends meet and so he would do pulpwood, he would do farming, he would do whatever. And my mother would do housekeeping. She would do house cleaning for white women. Because my sisters were in college. I had one sister who'd gone to college in '52 [1952] and I had a sister who went in fifty--a, Carol [Carol Cowser Yarbrough] went to college in '54 [1954] and there were several years when there were two of them there together and my aunts were in college at the same time. And my father was trying to help my grandmother [Electa Glover Cowser] and everybody just had to do whatever jobs that they could do in that Eisenhower era, I will never forget it.
Speaker 1: Name your siblings in order and their years of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay, Evelyn [Evelyn Cowser] was the oldest, Evelyn Maurice and you know, I can't tell you what year Evelyn was born, but she would be seventy-three on December the 4th this year. That--I mean I always remember her birthday 'cause she made you buy her a birthday present and you couldn't give it to her at Christmas, you had to give her two things. Then there was Carol and Carol will be seventy on July 24th, so what year would that be? I don't know, I al- I get the years mixed up. And then, me in '44 [1944] and then my brother, is--was born in '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Howard, Howard Dale Cowser. He was born in '46 [1946], June 30th. It's sort of like they, they--my oldest sisters grew up together and my brother and I grew up together. There's this big gap between us.
Story_ID: 580014
Speaker 1: So tell me about your home life. What about holidays? You mentioned Thanksgiving, Christmas favorites?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. We always had lots of fun during those times. My sister taught both of us, my brother [Howard Dale Cowser] and I--she--the older one, when she graduated from Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] she came back home to teach. And she lived at home. So we went to school, we rode to school with her and she taught us.
Speaker 1: At which school?
Speaker 2: Hatcher High School [Centre, Alabama]. She taught at Hatcher High School. So by the time I got to the high school, middle school she was teaching 'cause she was ten years older than me and twelve years older than him. So we all got taught by her, except Carol [Carol Cowser Yarbrough], Carol was lucky. But we, we had Evelyn [Evelyn Cowser] and she was a hardnosed kind of a teacher. And--but--she--we had fun. She was also the basketball coach. She taught us football, she taught me football. She taught--
Speaker 1: So the girls played sports too?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we had a basketball team.
Speaker 1: That was early?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we had a basketball team and we played--we played basketball. We, we had a conference and then we would play the kids over in Georgia. We used to play the Georgia School for the Deaf [Cave Spring, Georgia]. We used to play over in Tallapoosa, Georgia and we played in Rome, Georgia. Those were the places in Georgia we played. They played one set of rules and Alabama had another set of rules. So it was fun going back and forth, but there were not that many black people in those towns either.
Speaker 1: Well how many kids attended Hatcher High School?
Speaker 2: Well, just to give you an example, there were seven kids in my sister's graduating class and there was seventeen in mine. So that lets you know that there were very few kids in this county [Cherokee County, Alabama].
Story_ID: 580015
Speaker 1: Now what about the white schools in town, what were they called?
Speaker 2: The high school was called Cherokee County High School [Centre, Alabama] and it was right downtown. And I don't know how many kids they had in it. But Anna Louise [ph.] and Mary Jane [ph.], the two--my two white partners, that's where they went to school. And the--there were some boys that I--I grew up with whose father was a farmer and he--my father [Howard Cowser] and their father used to share equipment sometimes. And my brother [Howard Dale Cowser] still farms with one of these boys, they share equipment to this day.
Speaker 1: How did you become friends with Mary Louise [sic.] and Mary Jane?
Speaker 2: 'Cause, 'cause their mother was my mother's friend and we used to have tea parties.
Speaker 1: And was that unusual in Cherokee [Cherokee County, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: I guess it was--people thought it was un- but I, I guess we thought it was normal. But, but it wasn't.
Speaker 1: You were describing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Even though it was segregated--we knew the segregation thing, but we had a relationship, we even went to revivals together.
Speaker 1: United Methodist revivals?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was another Metho- a white Methodist church over from ours [New Bethel United Methodist Church, Ballplay, Alabama], we'd go over there too when they had their revivals.
Speaker 1: At home, did your parents talk about race issues?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we talked about race.
Speaker 1: What did they say?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't remember very much. I just remember that the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] existed in this area and I remember the Jordan family. One, one of the--one of the boys was washing one of the Jordan boys' car once and he was looking in the trunk and he found this outfit, you know, the Klan outfit. So we knew he was in the Klan. Then once my brother and I were going to, to--I guess we're going to the movies or something, I was--I had to have been sixteen for, fo- to be driving, and a cross was burned about, I guess about five or six miles from our house. And I remember when we got where we going we called back and told our mother [Linnie Covington Cowser]. But when we were left at home, and we were, we always knew where the gun was. We kept the gun out and if I was home I kept the gun at the door. I, I, I mean I remember all of this. And you were just supposed to shoot, it was that simple.
Speaker 1: Well, a white person, a black person?
Speaker 2: It didn't make any difference who it was, you weren't supposed to let anybody in. Because, and I remember my aunt worked for the Jordans. You see these, these people owned everything. And my cousin, Charlotte [ph.], I us- I would go spend the night, this is my mother's sister. We'd go spend the night and she worked in Ms. Jordan's house. And I never will forget, we couldn't understand why we had to sit in the kitchen wherever she was. She would not let us out of their sight--and w- her sight, and when we grew up we realized that she was afraid that this man was going to say something to us or make a pass at us because they were young, there was some young boys in the house. When I say young, they were in their twenties. They had their own airplanes, you know. And I think she was afraid because we've talked about this late--you know my cousin and I. Because she just wouldn't let us out of her sight, what was this about? And then she finally told me what it was. That she was afraid that this man would say something to us. So I mean--and--and my cousin and I went to the library. You know, you couldn't go to the library, there was no black library, but we went to the library. And we used to read these books and at the end of the year the librarian would bring our certificate to the school about how many books we had read. And we'd get our little certificate. Now, so they--there were people who did things that were--that broke the code I guess you could say in many ways.
Speaker 1: And, and what was the code?
Speaker 2: The code was that black and whites were separated and segregated, that was the code.
Speaker 1: But your family was a little bit different?
Speaker 2: But, but there were people, I'm not, now I'm not saying the family, there were people in this town, some of them that were a little bit different in terms of the way they treated people. Because the librarian did not have to let us read the books, but we could re- we could check out the books. And black folks weren't supposed to check out books.
Speaker 1: And you knew that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And Charlotte had reminded me that there was a time that we would go to the library. See, she was older, so she evidently had figured out the system. And so there was a ti- she was three years older than me. There was a time we went to the library to get the books. Nobody was ever there, but it didn't cross my mind that anybody was ever going to the library. I just figured nobody went to the library (laughter).
Speaker 1: So that was a privilege (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But this lady had p- that was a privilege, she--we went at a certain time.
Story_ID: 580016
Speaker 1: Tell me about high school. I mean you were at Hatcher [Hatcher High School, Centre, Alabama] for a long time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, oh yeah, we went through middle school, high school. We had some interesting classes. I guess the most--the fun class I had, the one that I really liked the most was home economics. And I know that sounds crazy. But we had a home economics teacher who had graduated from Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and she used to take us to the, the, the state conventions and the state conventions were always at Tuskegee. So we went to Tuskegee every year and to Alabama State [Alabama State College; Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama] and we would pu- you know, would compete with the various competitions, the oratorical contest and whatever. And I remember getting some office in something. And she would always--we always had the latest outfits because she could run up an outfit in a minute. We all learned to sew. But the one thing that she was really a snicker about was the business of doing the menus and doing the mathematics that went with it 'cause she taught math in the home economics class I realize now. And she taught time management. There are things that I do now that I know Miss Cunningham [ph.] taught me how to do. She had a term that she used to call dovetailing. Well, dovetailing is just doing two or three things at one time, that's all and making sure that you--when you finish, that the di- all of the dinner is cooked and you didn't forget to cook the bread because it'd get cold if you don't have it ready at the end. So she made us plan everything we did that way so when you finished, you were finished with everything. And she applied it to everyday life. And I remember this business of the Amy Vanderbilt book ['Amy Vanderbilt's Complete Book of Etiquette: A Guide to Gracious Living,' Amy Vanderbilt] and how the table was supposed to look and all the things. And she made us do all the different meals and we also had to eat whatever we cooked. And then we had parties and she taught us how to do canapes. And she taught us how to do all the things and what you're supposed to wear for certain kinds of parties. Miss Cunningham was just a very interesting person. She even had this thing once, we all laughed at her. She had these steps you had to walk up and down the steps. And so we said, "What is this Miss Cunningham? What you--have you lost your mind, why are we doing foolish things like this," 'cause you couldn't look at your feet you know. She said. "Well one day you just might go to the White House [Washington, D.C.]," and we laughed at her. Well when I went back for my class reunion a few years ago, she was there and I said, "Miss Cunningham remember how you taught us to walk up and down steps and you said only a dumb woman looks at her feet? She's not well bred if she has to look at her feet to go up and down steps." I said, "I went to the White House and I walked up those steps without looking at my feet. And there was a woman there who had on the most gorgeous gown I'd ever seen who was stumbling up those steps." I said. "Miss Cunningham would wring her out" (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You learned etiquette?
Speaker 2: So, so there were things--there were things that we learned. We even had a debutante ball. There were things that we learned about how to function in society, as well as our classes. And to do--I mean like for example, if we were gonna do frogs, we had to go find our frog to operate on that bad boy. And I remember having to go catch my frog and take him to school so I could operate on him. I mean I'm sure that humane society now would think we were, but we didn't have any equipment. And so we were taught to use what we had.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the debutante ball?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was something. I remember my--I wore my sister's [Evelyn Cowser] dress that she had worn as assistant, she was the--there was one dress, I guess we all wore this dress. My sister was the assistant--what is the first, the second runner up for Miss--Miss whatever it is at Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]. My father [Howard Cowser] had bought this expensive dress. Then my other sister [Carol Cowser Yarbrough] was the runner up for the queen at Alabama A and M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama]. And so I wore the dress for the debutante ball. We just kept sewing it up, you know adjusting it in here. You know, you didn't have to worry about the other part 'cause there was all this tulle. And I--and I remember my father practicing the dance, do his little two step, and I remember this little thing, this debutante thing in the gym. I said now you know, now I look back, I mean you know, that was really weird because the little town had little cafes, nothing but little juke joints is what you call them now. But Mrs. Simmons [ph.] and Miss Cunningham decided there was gonna be a debutante ball, and so there was one.
Speaker 1: And was there a white debutante ball and a black debutante ball (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I never knew what the white people did when it came to their social lives, you know. I knew they had boyfriends and stuff, but I never knew anything about their social lives 'cause they had their little country club and whatever else. But we didn't interact.
Speaker 1: But you had your own version?
Speaker 2: We had our own version that was out of the book. That's right.
Story_ID: 580017
Speaker 1: And when did you graduate from Hatcher [Hatcher High School, Centre, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I graduated in 1960 when I came here.
Speaker 1: And was there political unrest late '50s [1950s] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we had had some issues in the '50s [1950s]. I remember, I guess we were--let's see, I was twelve. We were--it was in '56 [1956]. They--it was after Brown versus the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], they built us a new high school and we knew why we were getting this new high school. And it had a gym with no scoreboard and stuff. And we knew that the purpose of it was to keep us there. So I remember we decided that we were gonna buy a scoreboard. We were kids, students. And we decided we were gonna sell Coke. So went to Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, Georgia] and they gave us the Cokes, and we raised five hundred dollars as kids selling those things and we got our electric scoreboard that we wanted. But I remember being very curious, I guess by this--but before that I had been curious about what the white school looked like inside. You asked me what it was like. Well by the time we were about eighth grade I guess, eighth or ninth grade, Annette [ph.], Barbara Ann [ph.], Mildred [ph.] and I decided we wanted to see what the white school looked like inside. And so the one in Cedar Bluff [Alabama], we had the big May Day over in Cedar Bluff. And you could walk around, and so we walked down to the little town, it didn't have a red light, but the school was there. And so I suggested that we go in and look. So we went to the principal's office, I'll never forget it. I introduced myself, I told him I was Yvonne--Dorothy Yvonne Cowser [HistoryMaker Dorothy Cowser Yancy] and my friends. We told them who our parents were, we were so stupid and we told the man we'd come to visit his school and that I wanted to see his science lab because I thought I wanted to major in chemistry in college. Annette wanted to see--she wanted to see home economics or something. Barbara Ann wanted to see where they taught business, because she thought she wanted to major in--we already had our plans what we were gonna do when we went to college, oh yeah. We, we had big plans. And I don't think Mildred knew what she wanted to see. But all I know is the man took us around and showed us everything we asked him to show us. I'd never been so disappointed in my life. They only had a couple of microscopes, we had two. They had like three or something like that. And then they had a couple little sewing machines and a couple--they didn't have much of anything at this school. And we were so disappointed. And I remember talking about it all that afternoon. Well, we got to school the next morning and were we in trouble. The fathers that be had called the principal about these little black girls who were about integration. We hadn't thought about any integration, we just wanted to see what they had. I mean the school was brick and ours was a cinderblock, you know so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the name of the white school?
Speaker 2: This one was Cedar Bluff High School. This was over in a little town of Cedar Bluff. Called the principal, and he called us in and he wanted to know who had put us up to this. And you know, it had to be some outside agitator, right? Don't know we thought about it. And he finally looked at me, he said, "Just tell me who--." And I said, "Well I thought of it." He was very upset 'cause he was my mother's [Linnie Covington Cowser] cousin. And so he decided that we would have to be punished. And our punishment was to pick up paper that day. And I remember being so angry with him. We got our books and went outside 'cause we rode the bus to school and I remember we sat on the side of the building until the day was over and we caught the bus. I did not pick--I, I refused to pick up any paper for going to look at something I thought I had a right to see. And when I came to Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] I guess I was ready to protest. Because by the time I got here in 1960, the sit-ins had just started. And so I went to protest on Tuesday and Thursday like every other kid did.
Story_ID: 580018
Speaker 1: So at this time when you left Cherokee [Cherokee County, Alabama]--
Speaker 2: Nothing had been integrated. Absolutely nothing.
Speaker 1: And do you remember, you had mentioned seeing like a white woman and a black counterpart and they were sisters and these are relatives, was that a common thing to see (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. I don't know--I don't know if it was common. I just know that I knew after I was told, but I knew they had some kind of relationship, but I didn't know. But I knew that my great aunts and aunts and all would--they were very, very fair. 'Cause if you saw pictures of my [paternal] grandmother [sic. great-great-grandmother], Adline [Adline Adams], you would not believe she was a black woman. And--and same thing was true for my grandmother [Electa Glover Cowser] and my great-grandmother [Alabama Adams Glover], and my great-great-grandmother, they all looked just like white women.
Speaker 1: Did anyone pass in your family?
Speaker 2: Oh sure, I have cousins who pass to this day.
Speaker 1: And when did folks start passing?
Speaker 2: They always passed when they could.
Speaker 1: Was that something that was embraced or looked down upon?
Speaker 2: Well, people in the family didn't make them any difference if that's what you ask. I saw a cousin of mine once in, in--oh what, what is it--in Nassau [New York]. And I was getting ready to go across the room to say something to her and she gave me the look, I knew she was passing and I saw her with this white man so I knew she was passing. I went home and told my grandfather [Hurley Cowser] when I got back. But I had a cousin in Rome, Georgia who still lives there, Butch [ph.] passes whenever he gets ready, wherever he goes people just assume that he's a white boy.
Speaker 1: What does he look like?
Speaker 2: He looks just like a white boy. He does not look--he looks just like a white boy. He would have to make you believe he's black.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: And we--we're the same age and Butch has always passed when he wanted to pass. And he's always been black when he wanted to be black.
Speaker 1: So they would go back and forth across the color line?
Speaker 2: That's right. He went to a black high school. I mean he didn't try to pass as a kid growing up. He ended up passing when he left town.
Speaker 1: 'Cause at home everyone knew who you were.
Speaker 2: Everybody knew he was black and it was not--it was not an issue.
Speaker 1: Are there some relatives who passed for white and who kind of lost touch with you guys?
Speaker 2: I have no idea. I have no idea. Probably. I wouldn't be surprised.
Story_ID: 580019
Speaker 1: So you graduated from Hatcher [Hatcher High School, Centre, Alabama]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at the top of your class?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were your grades?
Speaker 2: I had all A's, I think I had one B, I--my sister [Evelyn Cowser] gave me a B (laughter).
Speaker 1: Were you valedictorian?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. I said my sister gave me (laughter) a B.
Speaker 1: Oh your sister gave you the B.
Speaker 2: I think she did.
Speaker 1: In what subject?
Speaker 2: What did I have from her was it a B, a C she gave me, it was in PE [physical education] I think or something, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did you wanna be?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause the worst grade I ever got was from her.
Speaker 1: You wanted to be a scientist, was that your dream?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, it was. And I came here and I, I thought I was gonna major in chemistry and I went to class and it was the dullest professor I've ever had. I went to sleep. I'd never gone to sleep in chemistry in my life. I went to sleep and at the end of the week I said you have to get out of this class.
Speaker 1: And when you say you came here, what year, and what college did you attend (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen sixty [1960], I came to Johnson C. Smith University [Charlotte, North Carolina] in 1960 from Alabama.
Speaker 1: And what was that transition like?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was difficult because my brother [Howard Dale Cowser]--my sisters [Evelyn Cowser and Carol Cowser Yarbrough] had been physically carried to college, my daddy [Howard Cowser] drove them to college you know, and the had their little footlockers and all, and they put their little stuff up in their rooms and left them some money and they went on back home. And my mother [Linnie Covington Cowser] was not keen on me coming here. I had been a kid who had been sick all of my life. I'd had rheumatic fever as a kid and I missed about six months out of school and I had to do my work at home. And my grandmother [Electa Glover Cowser] was very upset that I was even thinking about leaving any place within a hundred miles of home. That's my father's mother who was a very domineering woman. But she was very upset about it and my mother was not too keen about it. And finally I think she just gave in and decided I could go wherever I wanted to go. And so I ended up coming here. So she decided since I was gonna come to a North Carolina school, she had never been to North Carolina, she had no reason to come, I could get on the bus and come. And so she put me on a--she didn't even go to the bus station. My father took me to the bus station. I caught the bus in Rome, Georgia, changed buses in Atlanta [Georgia]--I changed buses in Atlanta and came to Johnson it was a ten hour ride. I will never forget it. I get here and I get my little stuff and I get a taxi and I get to school, and you know, I get myself together and I go to the business office, 'cause he'd given me a checkbook to pay my bill with. And her instruction to me was that I was to come home at Christmas and when school was out. If I got sick, I was to go to the doctor and I was to call her up and tell her that I had been to the doctor and what the diagnosis was. If I got hungry I was supposed to write a check and go buy some food. I was not to call her about any frivolous foolishness. And she would be here when I graduated and she never put a foot on this campus until I graduated in '64 [1964]. And I grew up real fast. I was sixteen and I grew up. I--I learned how to--I can travel--I learned how to travel the world by myself, 'cause she was determined if I was gonna do something like that, then I was gonna do it myself.
Speaker 1: And were--you were sick as a child?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What were your symptoms?
Speaker 2: I had rheumatic fever. When people had polio, I had rheumatic fever. Of course, kids couldn't come and see you because they thought you had polio too. But it was--it was really rheumatic fever. But you couldn't wal- I mean you were just stuck in the house. It was not--I had this horrible headache is the way it all started. It was not a temperature, it was--it was not pleasant.
Speaker 1: But you were still able to live your life and succeed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well the, the, the mailman became my best friend. The mailman, I lived on a rural route and the mailman liked me. And his sister was a person who loved to read. So she subscribed to every magazine there was. So what my mother didn't have, this lady had. And so he would bring me all of her magazines and every week he would bring me another pile, every week he'd bring me another pile. He was the nicest--nice little white man, I don't know his name anymore, but he kept me in magazines. He kept me busy.
Speaker 1: And so when you finally got to Johnson C. Smith and your dad had put you on this bus here, what was your first impression when you got to campus?
Speaker 2: Oh I was disappointed. Oh I was so upset. Because I had been to, well I had grown up on the Tuskegee campus [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] going there every summer. I had gone to Alabama A and M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama]--my sister had gone to Alabama A and M, so I'd gone there from the time I could remember. I'd gone to the AU Center [Atlanta University Center; Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] since I was like four or five years old. This was like nowhere. I mean, I said oh my god, what decision did I make 'cause I'd never been here before. I'd only seen a picture. So I had a little adjusting to do.
Speaker 1: It seemed country?
Speaker 2: Oh my god, well it was not country, the campus was so small. And there weren't that many people here, you know.
Speaker 1: How many students (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean there were like six or seven hundred students and they only had two dorms for women. I mean it was small. I mean if you consider the fact that--if you think about the AU Center and then you think about Alabama A and M which had several thousand students. Think about Alabama State [Alabama State College; Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama], you think about Tuskegee, this was a small campus.
Story_ID: 580020
Speaker 1: You had mentioned the Civil Rights Movement, so when you got to Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] how did that manifest on campus?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you have to remember now I came out of Alabama where the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was illegal. We had had the Montgomery Bus Boycott, but in north Alabama, nothing had happened, not in the north Alabama where I lived. After I left home, there was a movement in Gadsden, Alabama and my cousins were involved in it and then my cousins integrated the Cherokee County High School [Centre, Alabama] after I left home. And eventually my sister [Evelyn Cowser] taught at the white high school. But when I left home, everything was still segregated. And so when I came here, and, and, and I knew about the sit-ins, I immediately began to participate 'cause it made a lot of sense to me.
Speaker 1: What were the organizations?
Speaker 2: Well, we just had a student government here on campus. And I remember Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], you know, SNCCs [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], S--SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], SNCC and stuff like that. But we had a student organization. But see, I, I don't remember too much the stu- the, the SNCC and all that. I remember Dr. Hawkins [Reginald Hawkins]. There was a man here in town who was a dentist, who also had graduated from Johnson C. Smith Seminary [Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary, Atlanta, Georgia] and graduated from undergraduate school here. He led the movement in this town of students. And then we had student leaders, and I remember we had to go through this nonviolent training in the auditorium downstairs because you weren't supposed to spit back or hit back or anything like that. So I remember going through all of that before you went downtown to protest. But we used to go on Tuesdays and Thursdays, those were light teaching days. And the boys from Davidson [Davidson College, Davidson, North Carolina] would come over sometimes. But the Queens girls [Queens College; Queens University of Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina], I don't ever remember seeing them, although now they say they were in the movement. But I don't know anything about them. But I do remember the Davidson boys coming over. And we were--we were very active. We had Charlie Jones [Charles Jones] who was involved in SCL- was involved in SNCC, and Charlie ha- went on down to the protest in Mississippi and went on down to Albany, Georgia and places like that. And there were a few fellas out of the seminary, 'cause Charlie was in the seminary. It was--his mother was my English teacher. And Charlie used to write back letters telling us what was going on in the various southern towns that he was going, going through. And she would--we would go over them in class, in English class. And she would teach that along with 'The Iliad' [Homer] and 'The Odyssey' [Homer]. How she did it I will never know. Well, Ms. Jones was a wonder woman. She was considered to be a little fickle, you know, and quite avant garde, but she was one of the more exciting teachers I ever had. And she was fun and I kept her for two years of English, and I've always had the upmost respect for her.
Speaker 1: But she would teach the classics and then she would teach?
Speaker 2: And, and, and she would read Charlie's letters and somehow it would bring it into human rights and social justice. And we had--we had a teacher in religion whose name was Dr. Steele who believed that the Civil Rights Movement was sort of like God ordained. You know, if God was here, if Jesus was here he'd be in the movement too. And we had some very interesting religious--religion classes on social justice and the social gospel. Johnson C. Smith had an interesting social gospel that they taught at the seminary. And there's been a dissertation written on it about the social gospel that was taught in the seminary at Johnson C. Smith led by Algernon O. Steele. And it was--it was quite interesting because we knew that we were doing what God would've wanted us to do when we were protesting. And it was supported by the president and the faculty and everybody.
Story_ID: 580021
Speaker 1: So everybody was involved in the movement?
Speaker 2: Everybody wasn't involved, but everybody knew it was right. You know, some kids--some people never protest. But most people did, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And where did you protest? What did you do?
Speaker 2: Well we used to walk in front of the movie theater. And you know, you go down and then you had the money and you pass it back. And eventually the light-skinned ones would get in. We had one, Herbie Cunningham from Buffalo [New York], would always get in the movies. And then we had this boy from down here in Lancaster, South Carolina, he'd get in the movies. You know, you really didn't want them to be in your line because they would spend the money and you couldn't pass it back 'cause you didn't have any real money. And there was a boy named Cookie Douglas--Cookie Wright [ph.] out of Richmond [Virginia], he could get in. And Cookie Douglas could get in. We knew who the white Negroes were. We had them--yeah they were black, but you know, white folks thought they were light-skinned white people who, who were protesting that day, they couldn't turn them down. So they'd come out and announce we just integrated the movie or we just integrated whatever it was. Yeah it was quite interesting the way we did it. And I can remember getting--we got a call once, we were going down to Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] and they called and said they had integrated the night before. It's interesting to come back here to be a president of places that we--and, and get money from people that we picketed. You know, the Belk's and all that kind of stuff who are my big donors now. And the one place, the last time I marched, I will never forget it, it was in front of Presbyterian Hospital [Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center, Charlotte, North Carolina]. It was me, Clay White, and Mary White, just the three of us. And this man beat Mary. He knocked her down with her little sign, and that's when I lost it. Clay and I chased that man through an office building. As a matter of fact, the last time I saw him we were talking about it. I never picketed another day. I couldn't take it because I knew that I was gonna hit somebody. I couldn't--I couldn't do it anymore. And by then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You said the administrators were involved, who was the president at the time of Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: The president was--was Joseph Petty--not Joseph Petty, was Dr. Perry [R.P. Perry]. I can't remember Dr. Perry's first name. But let me see, Mary was a senior, I had to be a junior, and Clay had to have been a sophomore. So I must've been--I was a junior the last time. 'Cause Presbyterian Hospital had not integrated. And when I came back here as president, I got sick and I went to Presbyterian Hospital and I insisted on having a little tour. And this little girl wanted to know why, a little white girl. I said, "Because when I was a kid I couldn't come in here." And I--she said, "You couldn't?" She couldn't believe it. See, times have changed so that kids working in these places don't even know they used to be for whites only. 'Cause there was a black hospital in this town, which was poorly equipped and I was a patient there once. So I knew what was in the black hospital. So it was just fascinating when I came back to really see it's a wonderful hospital, Presbyterian is. But it was a hospital that excluded us.
Speaker 1: And this was a--this is historically a Presbyterian school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the hospital is not connected to the church. It's just named Presbyterian Hospital.
Speaker 1: Any other aspects of the Civil Rights Movement that you recall? You men- you mentioned Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], did he come on campus?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember Martin Luther King, Jr. was coming to campus. I didn't see him on campus. And I remember Malcolm X coming, and the day Malcolm X came I was sick. But we, you know, we had Odetta [HistoryMaker Odetta Gordon] used to come and do the--the--what do you, you call those things, the ballads that she would sing. We had lots of interesting people who came here. It's just that I, I remember some things and some things I don't remember anymore.
Story_ID: 580022
Speaker 1: Was this a special school [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well, it became special to me. It took me about, oh I guess I'd been here about two or three months and then I decided it was a good place for me. But for a while there I really wanted to transfer to Alabama A and M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama] where my friends had gone or down to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], because--or--or some place in Atlanta [Georgia], 'cause I, I just--it, it was just little. But then I decided it was all right. I mean I got to like the people and the faculty and the students. And it became like, you know, a home away from home.
Speaker 1: Were you in clubs, did you pledge?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I was--I, I, I was--I participated in the student government. I was in the international society, I was in the honor society, I was an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], I was in the--some of the honor things, Alpha Kappa Mu [Alpha Kappa Mu Honor Society] and stuff like that that we had. And yeah, I was--I was active in things and I was in the choir, the university choir. That was the part I loved the most, I think the choir 'cause we used to travel a lot and that was fun.
Speaker 1: Was there colorism on campus? Did people segregate light skin, dark skin?
Speaker 2: You know, I've, I've been asked that before but I didn't see it. I didn't see it. As a matter of fact, when I look at my sorority line, it was ev- every color imaginable is in the line, dark, light, whatever. And if you look at, at, at some of the others, it was the same way. I don't think that people--when I came here Miss Johnson C. Smith was a brown-skinned girl. She was a girl out of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and the one after her was brown-skinned. Then the one after her was light, yeah. But the--if you go back and look in years past in yearbooks you'll see a color difference just like you'd see in Ebony magazine and Jet. But by then, it was beginning to--evidently it had changed because they had elected a dark-skinned queen when I arrived.
Speaker 1: Were you part of the pageant scene?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played it, I did some of that. I was--what is Miss--what is it? Oh goodness, I was the attendant to the queen one year. I was the--I was some kind of little queen every year. You know, I, I think I was Miss Sphinx Club and something else. 'Cause when I go through the yearbooks I see them sometimes 'cause you know how you forget. You forget that stuff.
Speaker 1: Any other highlights from your time here as a student?
Speaker 2: Oh, I remember the one thing that I--one--one experience that I had really enjoyed was the Phelps Stokes Fund. The Phelps Stokes Fund was a fund that had college programs where kids met from black colleges [HBCUs] and they got to debate the issues of the day. And I remember being selected to go do that twice. I really liked it and when I got to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] I remember taking my kids in my class to the Phelps Stokes Fund program. We met down in--at Hampton--not Hampton, we met down at Tuskegee. And, and, and it--that I remember because you got a chance to have, have intellectual exchanges with students from other schools.
Speaker 1: What was your major?
Speaker 2: My major was history. But the person who took us on the Phelps Stokes Fund trips was Mr. Rippy [Coleman Rippy]. He was a political scientist. He was a--he was a lot of fun. A hardhead teacher, but we enjoy him.
Speaker 1: But you liked speech and debate (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, we, we had a--he was, he was good, he was good. And the guy who was head of the history department though was Stephen Klepka. Stephen Klepka was a Jew who had been in the concentration camps. I don't know if you realize it or not, but many black colleges ended up with lots of well educated Jews from concentration camps after they got to the United States. Yeah, there's been articles now written on it and there, there, there's--there's some research that's been done on how these Jews ended up on black college campuses, many of them.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any?
Speaker 2: The one I had was Stephen Klepka, he was my mentor. Oh he was special. He had gotten a Ph.D.--he had graduated from school in Eastern Europe. Of course the Ph.D. wasn't recognized here. So he went to Washington University in St. Louis [St. Louis, Missouri] and got a Ph.D. in European history and he came here and he was head of the history department. And he and I communicated for years. But he was a special, special teacher.
Story_ID: 580023
Speaker 1: What did you wanna be once you graduated?
Speaker 2: I didn't wanna be anything. I (laughter), I didn't.
Speaker 1: Did you have a dream?
Speaker 2: No I didn't. I (laughter) I--my dream was not to work (laughter). No, I'm not kidding. I changed my major four times. I started off in chemistry and I went to sleep. Then I switched to math and I got a C one semester and that just devastated me, so I said to hell with that. So then I switched to social science and a degree in social science, you know, you had some sociology and some history and some of that. You had a little--a lot of everything and a little bit of nothing, so you knew a bunch of nothing about nothing. And so my senior year, I don't know, I, I came to my senses and I said, you know, you better get a major and a discipline before you leave here knowing nothing. And so I got a major in history. And a--the one thing I knew I didn't want to do was teach. Because my sisters [Evelyn Cowser and Carol Cowser Yarbrough] and my aunts were all teachers and I was not gonna do that. But I took all the education courses just in case I had to. And so when I got--when I came back here my senior year, my dream was to go to graduate school, because I didn't wanna get a job. 'Cause I figured if I went to school I wouldn't hear anything about get a job. But I interviewed for jobs and got offered them, but I never told anybody. And so I went to--I--I got accepted at Ohio University in Athens [Ohio] and--'cause I was trying to get away. And that summer I went to Chapel Hill [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] because the Southern Education Foundation [Atlanta, Georgia] was trying to integrate southern schools--graduate schools. And you had fourteen schools that you could apply to. University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] was on the list, University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] and all, and a girl from here and I we picked Chapel Hill. I went there, that was the most miserable summer I've ever spent in my life. Went there, but I had been admitted to UMASS Amherst [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts], so I left there and went on to Massachusetts to school.
Speaker 1: How did you end up applying to UMASS?
Speaker 2: I just had a list of five schools. He told me--my mentor [Stephen Klepka] told me that in the fall when I came back to school that I needed to apply, I need to find five schools to apply to. And so we sat up, right here in my office, that hallway there where you see the secretary, that was where the work space was for the history department. And he had a typewriter. And we sat there and we did my applications for graduate school. And then he--we wrote the biographical sketch and all the things you had to do, and then my job was to take them home and I was to mail them with the fee at Christmastime. And so my mother [Linnie Covington Cowser] ga- gave me the money, I mailed them all off 'cause they were to be mailed before the end of the year. And so in the fall, I started getting responses--I mean in the spring, responses to where I was trying to go to school. And I decided that UMASS was the better choice because they gave me a research assistantship and full tuition. And so I had a little spending money, so I said this is not a bad place, I've never been to Amherst [Massachusetts] I might as well try it. I was always adventurous.
Story_ID: 580024
Speaker 1: And so I went to Chapel Hill [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] just to get aw- do the summer thing, because I didn't wanna work and it was a great opportunity I thought. (Laughter) And so, why not.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: But it was a horrible summer. It was the summer of '64 [1964] when they were looking for Schwerner, Chaney and all of them [James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner]. And it was--it was miserable. And Chapel Hill was a place where women had not gone there except when they were juniors and seniors, 'cause see they went to University of North Carolina at Greensboro [Greensboro, North Carolina] as freshmen and sophomores. Plus there were very few black people there and the professors were racist to the core. It was not pleasant. And even in the dormitories, the girls didn't speak to you. And you know, you didn't--they, they didn't, they treated you like you had the plague. I was so glad--
Speaker 2: So was that your first real encounter with racism?
Speaker 1: No, I'd seen racism as a child. I mean, I'd always seen racism. I--I don't remember when I didn't know racism.
Speaker 2: Well what are--can you give me some specific moments where you observed racism?
Speaker 1: Sure, when you went to Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] and you had to drink out of the colored fountain. And then you would sneak over to the white water to see what the difference was. So my da- my daddy [Howard Cowser] took us to Sears, that's where we got our school clothes. You knew that it was different because they had a black bathroom, colored bathroom and a white bathroom. So these colored signs were everywhere, even the doctor's offices. You--they had a back door or a side door for the same doctor. But you ended up on the same table. And see, I remember my father telling me the story of when I was a child. I had a urethral stricture that I was evidently born with. By the time I was about a year or old so, my urinary tract locked. And so he took me to the doctor in Centre, Alabama, and the man wouldn't touch me because I was black. And my daddy had to put me in the car, drive another twenty miles, he'd already driven twelve miles there. Had to take me twenty miles to Gadsden [Alabama] and the doctor's name was Dr. Graham [ph.] and he told me never forget it, and Dr. Graham did surgery on me on his table to get my urinary tract open. And I had to have this surgery off and on for years. And my father and my mother [Linnie Covington Cowser] made sure I remembered that before I left home in case I ever had a problem. And my father's position was that that man wouldn't put his hands on you. And they never forgot it. And I ca- I can go right to his office to this day. I know the house where his office was, 'cause my father always pointed it out.
Speaker 2: Your parents made you very much aware of injustice?
Speaker 1: Oh we knew, yeah, we knew. I'll never--you, you know how I knew. When we were kids, my father had bought this farm. I told you he bought those two hundred acres. The man from the bank came one night. It was--he brought MetLife [MetLife, Inc.], it was the Metropolitan Insurance Company [Metropolitan Life Insurance Company] out of Minnesota, remember. He brought them to the house so my daddy could buy insurance in the dark of night because he was not properly insured. And when my bo- father bought the farm, he could not sign for the farm. I never will forget it, it was two hundred acres, he paid six thousand dollars for it and a white man had to si- had to--had to buy it in his name and then later the name was transferred to my father. If he had died, we would've been homeless I guess.
Speaker 2: And also one thing I wanted to clarify--
Speaker 1: See that meaning there, that, that's--you see what--you understand this white relation and black relationship it doesn't make any sense. The man's name was Mr. Colley [ph.]. Mr. Colley, my grandmother [Electa Glover Cowser] worked for him. His boys grew up with me and my brother [Howard Dale Cowser]. As a matter of fact, my brother and one of the Colley boys still trade equipment. When my father couldn't buy that farm in his name, Mr. Colley bought it in his name and then as time passed and things died down, he signed it over to my father. But my father was paying the note. Am I making any sense to you?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. And your father also bought the school, the elementary school [Savage Wood Elementary School, Cherokee County, Alabama]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it didn't cost very much, it was only sitting on two acres.
Speaker 2: What did he do with that land and the building?
Speaker 1: My sister--well we, we still have, have the land, I guess. We, we, we still own the land. The building, my brother used it as a barn. And as a shed, he has his tractors on the side of it. It's a little red building falling down.
Story_ID: 580025
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well I'm gonna bring you back to your graduation from Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina]. And you went on--you went on to the University of Massachusetts Amherst [Amherst, Massachusetts]. How did you get up there?
Speaker 2: My father [Howard Cowser] put me on the train (laughter). He waved the train down (laughter). Have you ever heard of that before? Well, my father was a Mason. And the train came out of Birmingham [Alabama], I guess, and it didn't stop in Piedmont [Alabama] unless there was a passenger. And we had bought the ticket the day before and you had to wave the train down. So my father had this handkerchief and he did some kind of funny something. You know, he should've used Masonic signals. And the train stopped. And the black porter, I will never forget, came to my father and said, "Where's she going?" And my father says, "She's going to Boston [Massachusetts]," 'cause I was gonna have to catch the bus out of Boston up to Amherst [Massachusetts]. He said, "She's going to Boston." He said, "But it looks like she's going to be in Washington for a while. I don't know what's she's gonna do." The man said, "Well I'll take care of her." He said, "I have a nephew," and sh- he says, "I'll make him give her a tour of Washington, D.C., then we'll get her back to the train and put her on the train to Boston." That's what happened to me. That's true. So when I got to--to Washington the porter, had me wait with him while his nephew or whoever it was came. I look--I got to see Washington and then I went on--got me on the train, I went on to Boston and when I got to Boston it was in the middle of the night. I found a hotel room, spent the night and the next day I got a bus--a Peter Pan [Peter Pan Bus Lines] to Amherst, found my dormitory room or whatever. Then I went back to Boston and got my footlocker and stuff and took it back.
Speaker 1: And you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that's how I did it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You were getting a master's [degree] in what subject?
Speaker 2: History, history.
Speaker 1: And how many black students were in your class?
Speaker 2: In the history department there were none. There was one young man who was an undergraduate and there was me in the graduate school, was it. And I ended up with a roommate. I found--I saw one I was walking across campus a young black girl. We saw each other. Oh, so glad to see each other. Turned out she'd gone to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] and she had an apartment. And so pretty soon I moved out of my dormitory and we became roommates in the apartment.
Speaker 1: Were there other black students on campus?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: How many?
Speaker 2: There were--there were several older ones, Emanuel Shaw was in English, Somalia [ph.] was in chemistry, what's his name, Steptoe [ph.] was in economics. Yeah, there, there, there were a lot of older students, but the two of us, both of us were twenty years old. And so we were like their adopted child I guess. And so they would feed us, invite us over and cook. And we, we figured out how to cook before it was over and take care of ourselves.
Story_ID: 580026
Speaker 1: Now you were an honor student, you graduated Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] with honors (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And how did you find the social climate up north?
Speaker 2: Well I got called a nigger the first day, so it was--I found out it wasn't much different (laughter).
Speaker 1: Who called you that?
Speaker 2: Somebody driving by in a car. It was--it was a little unnerving, but I decided well so what. And I just kept on, on pushing.
Speaker 1: Were you still feeling the reverbation- reverberations of civil rights?
Speaker 2: Well, after leaving Chapel Hill [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina], you know, Chapel Hill at that point was segregated. Everything below the bus station was integrated--was segregated and everything above the bus station was integrated. The town was a div- had a dividing point. And it was an interesting strange kind of a town. The people didn't talk to you. I had friends who were undergraduates and a few graduate students, but I had had a professor who had come out of VPI [Virginia Polytechnic Institute; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia], and he was teaching Europe--I never will forget it, Europe 1815 to 1870. And he got on the Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964] one day, 'cause this was '64 [1964] and it was being debated in [U.S.] Congress. And this woman, I never will forget it, told him that the Civil Rights Act wasn't constitutional. And I remember telling him, it was. I said and it will be. I said is--, "A time will come when blood will run in streets and people like you will have to die before you understand." The man told me I had to leave class. I never will forget it. And I refused to move and the bell rang.
Speaker 1: This was at UNC or UMASS [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: This is at U Chapel Hill. I was so happy to get out of Chapel Hill [North Carolina], being called a nigger was minor.
Speaker 1: So at UMASS--
Speaker 2: You see what I'm saying. Being called a nigger going down the street was minor to what I had encountered there. There was one man at Chapel Hill who was the dean who was very, very understanding, I had a class with him. He's an older man and when you ask old Chapel Hill graduates, they all know his name. I just can't think of it now. But he was the kindest man to me, I'm gonna tell you what happened to me there. I was so nervous and so stressed, you know they had an honor code and you bought your blue books in the bookstore and you took them to class with you. I went to class and you put your name on each of the blue books. Well, I did the blue book and this was on a Friday. And then on Sunday night I'm studying and I realize I passed in the empty book. I still have my blue book with my test in it. So I go to class the next day and I told the professor I said, "I need to talk to you." And he says, "Yes, I do need to see you." And so I went to his office. I never will forget it. And I told him what had happened. He says, "I understand," he said, "but young lady let me tell you something." He shook his finger in my face, I was twenty years old. He says, "You had better grow up. You had better grow up, you better grow up." He said, "I believe you," he said, "because you're too scared to cheat." He says, "You're too scared." He said, "I'm gonna grade your paper, but don't you ever, ever do anything like that again 'cause you have to think and you have to be responsible." He said, "Nobody else is gonna give you this opportunity." And he was right. And that was the only person I had there that I remember being kind to me, you know, that was a professor type.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you did a summer there [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] and you went to UMASS [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts], and did you belong to any clubs, organizations?
Speaker 2: At UMASS?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: There was nothing to belong to as a graduate student. They didn't have anything.
Speaker 1: Was the movement alive there?
Speaker 2: We talked about it. There was--Emanuel Shaw was there and my--my roommate from--going to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], and all of us who'd come from the South, we kept up with what was going on in the South. And that's when I decided I was gonna go teach. That's when I decided what I wanted to do. Because I had some pressure in the department to go and work in government. You know, go work for one of the Kennedys or go work for something like that. And 'cause that was Massachusetts, you know, what else. I mean they were the most liberal people going down the pike in '64 [1964], '65 [1965] in that area. But for some reason I was influenced by Emanuel Shaw who had taught English at Albany State [Albany State College; Albany State University] in Albany, Georgia and he was there working on his doctorate. And he kept saying, "Dot [HistoryMaker Dorothy Cowser Yancy], they need you in the classroom back home." And I went to Albany to work.
Speaker 1: So, okay, and so at UMASS was there anything else pivotal for you, any other memories?
Speaker 2: No, the only thing we did was just struggle to, to pass and struggle to do work and struggle to get out. I just remember being happy to leave. I never went back to graduation. I've never been--I've never put my foot back on that campus.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Oh god it was just painful to even think about.
Speaker 1: Just the academics?
Speaker 2: No, just the--it's just like you were there but you weren't there. You know, you invisible. Am I making any sense? You invisible.  I had enough confidence to survive a year, but I don't know if I could've stayed much longer than that. I think it was just eaten to my very core. But I, I, I could hold on that much. I never--I never looked back.
Story_ID: 580028
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate and what did you do next?
Speaker 2: I graduated in '65 [1965]. I went to teach at Albany State College [Albany State University] in Albany, Georgia. I went down to teach with Emanuel Shaw. I followed him to Albany. And I, I, I discovered that I liked teaching. I loved it. I had an officemate who was much older than me. Her name was Troas Lewis Latimer. She had been a friend of Du Bois' [W.E.B. Du Bois]. And she taught me how to teach. I was twenty, twenty-one years old by then, and she was sixty-five and retiring. And she wore one of those wigs that you had to tie the string back and she wore these long (unclear) dresses. And she drove like this, you better get out of the way, you know. And we'd go eat fish on the night that you could eat all the fish you wanted at Howard Johnson. And I would drive because I was afr- afraid to ride with her. But I was--at first I was a little hesitant and I was scared. And she asked me, "Well what did you do in class today?" And I'd tell her. She'd say, "Well why don't you do this and why don't you try this." And every time I'd come back from class she'd critique what I had done. And I got to the point where I just loved going over, 'cause Mrs. Latimer was a wonderful teacher. And I decided I was gonna be a great teacher like Troas Lewis Latimer. She'd been a Jeanes teacher, you know, back during the--the New Deal and all when they had Jeanes teachers. So she really knew what she was doing. She was--she was just top, top cat.
Speaker 1: How long did you stay there?
Speaker 2: I stayed there two years and I got married.
Speaker 1: How did you meet your husband, what's his name?
Speaker 2: I met him there. Well it was a strange introduction. His name was Robert Yancy and are divorced now. But--but Emanuel was looking for a wife. So he was head of the English department and he had a vacancy in the English department. He and I were just very good friends. And so we said we're gonna hire you, hire a girl coming down here that you can find and maybe she'll be your wife. And so we insisted--let me finish, we insisted that all the applicants send pictures. And so, we picked her out, and I'll tell you about it in a minute. We picked--this was horrible (laughter).
Story_ID: 580029
Speaker 1: What was your husband's name and how did you meet?
Speaker 2: Okay, his name was Robert James Yancy [Robert Yancy]. And it turned out that he was the boyfriend of, of the woman that we were trying to develop a relationship with Emanuel Shaw, my good friend. We're trying to marry him off. So my job was to break up this relationship so he could date this woman. Her name was Jenny [ph.]. And Jenny was in the English department [at Albany State College; Albany State University, Albany, Georgia], and make a long story short, Robert and I ended up getting married, and Jenny married one of my students and Emanuel was wifeless.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) What was it about Robert?
Speaker 2: Well, he was fun. That, that, that, that was the one thing. He was fun. He liked fast cars, I love to race cars. We had--we had a few things in comma- in common. And there was really nothing else to do around there, you know, and he was one of the few people that you could date. And I saw some other people and I was dating another fella, but--was a dental school student at Howard [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington D.C.]. And well, I don't know Robert was just fun, we had a good time together.
Speaker 1: How long did you date him, when did you get married?
Speaker 2: We dated for a year and we got married in '67 [1967], and we got divorced in '92 [1992]. And we have a daughter, Yvonne [Yvonne Cowser Yancy].
Speaker 1: And when was Yvonne born?
Speaker 2: Yvonne was born in '72 [1972]. We got married in sixty--let's see we got married in '67 [1967]. She was born in '72 [1972], yeah five years.
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: Yvonne was born in Atlanta [Georgia], but she was conceived in Evanston [Illinois]. He was finishing his doctorate at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois]. And we were moving to--he was teaching at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and I was at Barat College [Lake Forest, Illinois] and so I moved to Atlanta, Yvonne was born in Atlanta. And I was teaching at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] when she was born.
Story_ID: 580030
Speaker 1: Somewhere in there you got your Ph.D., what year was that?
Speaker 2: Oh let's see, Yvonne [Yvonne Cowser Yancy] and I got that degree, we went to school together. Yvonne was born in '72 [1972] and I went to school in '74 [1974] and I finished it in '77 [1977], and graduation was official in '78 [1978] because when I finished my Ph.D. she graduated from kindergarten. We have a picture that we took together with her--with our robes on.
Speaker 1: Now how did you--what was the program at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, the--Atlanta University had a political science program and there was a woman over there who had been--who had worked with me at Albany State [Albany State College; Albany State University, Albany, Georgia], my first job. And she called me up one day and told me I should come over there and look at the program. And I explained to her that I wasn't interested in the political science that I really wanted to do history. And there was a professor at Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia] that I want to study on. His name was I. Bell Wiley [sic. Bell I. Wiley]. He was an expert on the Confederacy and southern history. And I. Bell retired, and so I couldn't go to Emory 'cause they had no names over there at that time after I. Bell Wiley left. I went down to Georgia State [Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia] and they called me a girl during my interview and I knew I couldn't work for them. And so I, I called her back. I said well, you know, I'm gonna come over and see. And it was a program where you could pick some things that you could do. And so I could make the political science piece work for me. I, I had a history--I had a master's [degree] in history and thirty hours past, but I could get a concentration in African American history there. And Dr. Bacote [Clarence A. Bacote] and all of them were there at the time. And I could do urban politics, I could do African politics, and I could do public pol- public administration, so I could make it work. So I created a program and I made it work. So Yvonne and I went to school.
Speaker 1: So you were pregnant?
Speaker 2: No she was born, she was a baby. I went to school when she was two. But, you know, you gotta pick kids up from school. She used to have to go to the senior seminar, the seminar everybody had to go to. And she went to the library, you know, she was in the bed, we would study. She was writing her dissertation when she was learning to write and all that. So we--we played school. Until (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was your dissertation on?
Speaker 2: I wrote on labor unions. The spectre of public sector labor unionism on the three mayors in Atlanta ['The Spectre of Public Unionism from 1966 to 1976: A Critical Analysis of the Labor Policies of the City of Atlanta,' Dorothy Cowser Yancy]. And--
Speaker 1: Which, which mayors?
Speaker 2: Oh I started with--gosh I can't even think of their name, Massell [Sam Massell], Ivan Allen [Ivan Allen, Jr.], Massell, and Maynard [Maynard Jackson]. I stopped in '76 [1976]. And I became a labor arbitrator as a result of my interest in labor relations, and it's been fun.
Story_ID: 580031
Speaker 1: Now going back to a historically black college [HBCU] after your sojourn at University of Massachusetts [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst Massachusetts], how was that?
Speaker 2: Going back to it?
Speaker 1: Well, Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I didn't--it was not a--it was not a big--it was not a stretch. As a matter of fact, I had some of the best professors I've ever had at Atlanta University.
Speaker 1: What were some of the courses you took?
Speaker 2: Oh god, I took black political thought, I took African politics, three or four courses in it. I took public administration, three or four courses. I took African American history three or four courses. I took--I took fifty some hours plus the dissertation. Plus I already had a master's [degree] and thirty hours past. So I'm over educated. I have a true interdisciplinary background. I can teach history or political science or public administration. Before I left Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] I used to teach in the business school [Georgia Tech College of Management; Ernest Scheller Jr. College of Business, Atlanta, Georgia]. I used to teach labor relations in the business school and I taught history and political science over in the history department. But I had--and I took my labor courses at Georgia Tech. So--I, I, I was a professional student. I went to ten schools. My daughter [Yvonne Cowser Yancy] said I should never show my resume because people would think that I'm bipolar or something. But I just enjoyed going to school. I went to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], I went to Northeastern [Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts], I went to--I went to lots of places, I just enjoyed going to school.
Speaker 1: At Atlanta University, who are the leaders in the Atlanta University Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] at that time?
Speaker 2: Mack Jones [Mack H. Jones] was probably one of the more prominent political scientist there at the time. Dr. Bacote [Clarence A. Bacote] was the prominent historian at the time. Those were the two--and Alexander--Alex Willingham was, was very good. But there were lots of good, good professors. I, I was, I was challenged. I, I really enjoy.
Speaker 1: What was your mission, you were studying history, political science, were you one some sort of social mission?
Speaker 2: No I guess I--well I wanted to be a better teacher, but I never saw a degree as a social mission. I grew up in a union house, my father [Howard Cowser] was a steel worker. And I always saw a Ph.D. as a union card, the right to work. I never saw it as anything different. It simply gets you in the door and then you have to be productive, you have to produce. And so in the field that I had selected in higher education, a Ph.D. was a requirement, not something you wanted to get, it was a requirement. A Ph.D. in a discipline. And I just decided to do certain things. I mean that's--it was just, it's--it was just a necessity to do what I wanted to do. It was a tool.
Story_ID: 580032
Speaker 1: Tell me about your work with the labor unions?
Speaker 2: Oh I've had some fun with them. I had worked with the unions and with management. For years I taught for General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] and the UAW [United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America; United Automobile Workers]. I guess I sent my kid [Yvonne Cowser Yancy] to graduate school and college off of my monies from that, at least that's what they used to tease and tell me. But from '86 [1986] to two years ago [2005], I taught labor relations for, for them in Region 8 and sometimes nationally. It was, it was, it was a great adventure. I used to go to all these little plants down in Delco Remy, down in Meridian, Mississippi and Orion [Alabama], Tuscaloosa [Alabama]. I ca- I go to class, get out of class, catch my plane and go teach my class and come back and teach my class at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia]. I had fun, I, I--then I'd do my labor arbitration and stuff. And I--if I could write a really good decision, one that was well thought and well write, it would--it could get published. And so, I used to do--sometimes I used to do training for the communication workers union [Communications Workers of America]. Sometimes I would train the shop stewards. And sometimes I'd do lectures for them. And I used to train the shop stewards if they ask me and I used to help them write their work rules and things for the City of Atlanta [Georgia]. And there was a time when I used to hear some of the grievances for the City of Atlanta. And I used to hear the grievances at Georgia Tech for, for the president when I was there, that was one of my committee assignments.
Speaker 1: How long were you at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], from what year to what year?
Speaker 2: I en- I, I, I registered January of '74 [1974] 'cause I took two classes that spring and then that summer I started taking a full load. I officially graduated in May of '78 [1978], but I defended my dissertation in '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: What were race relat- what were race relations like in Georgia at that time, Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Well, Atlanta was sort of coming into its own in many ways. Maynard [Maynard Jackson] had been elected to the mayorship I guess around '74 [1974], '72 [1972], '74 [1974], somewhere in there. And I got a chance to interview Sam Massell who had had a war with AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees]. And I got a chance to interview Ivan Allen [Ivan Allen, Jr.] who had stood in the street to block Peyton Forest [Atlanta, Georgia], blacks from moving into the neighborhood, remember. So I got to see (cough) a lot of things. And I saw the clash between Maynard and the unions when the unions had supported him for his--for his mayoralship, and he broke the union in '76 [1976] over a strike. And it was--labor relations were fairly interesting. Atlanta was a meeting confer- relationship. And so they didn't really have a contract, they had a memorandum of understanding which we--wasn't even a memorandum of understanding, it was just a collection of work rules that everybody else had. But they did have within it, and I'd helped to write part of it at one point, they had within it a grievance procedure. And so I had worked with the guy who had headed up labor relations for the City of Atlanta and my mentor at Georgia Tech, ha- the two of us had helped the city and others to write some stuff to make, make some sense in terms of worker protection. But I had probably more interest in the labor relations in Memphis [Tennessee], because Memphis and Atlanta have a lot in common, except Memphis really has labor unions. And the City of Memphis dealt with thirteen unions, the City of Atlanta only was deal--they only deal with the firefighters and the sanitation work, AFSCME, whereas Memphis has thirteen. And I have gone in and out of Memphis and compared them over the years. And there's, there's some great comparisons there.
Story_ID: 580033
Speaker 1: But Atlanta [Georgia] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But Atlanta, Atlanta in the seve- 1970s, schools desegregated, describe the kind of integration?
Speaker 1: When the schools desegregated in Atlanta they became black like they did in other cities. If you go into the school system in Atlanta now you might be hard put to find too many black children unless you go to certain neighborhoods.
Speaker 2: To find black children?
Speaker 1: White children, I'm sorry. Because basically it has become a black system.
Speaker 2: And when did you see that happening, in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 1: It began to happen in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s], it just gradually, gradually happened. And of course the private schools got bigger and bigger.
Speaker 2: Okay. And you entered (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) As a matter of fact, the City of Atlanta's public school system is much smaller now then it was in the '70s [1970s]. They probably have about fifty thousand students now. Back then, they had around eighty thousand students.
Speaker 2: But were you affected at all by the Vietnam War?
Speaker 1: Yeah. I had--when, when we were here in school, you know, you tried to stay in school to keep from getting drafted. And I remember when they were pulling out the, the numbers out of the hat, you know, to see what your draft number was going to be. My ex-husband [Robert Yancy] was in--at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] at the time, we were at Northwestern. I remember sitting there all night waiting on what his number was gonna be, what birthday they were gonna pull out of the hat for him. I think he ended up with three hundred and something. But if you did certain things you could get deferments. My brother [Howard Dale Cowser] went to the war. He didn't do well in school one semester and so therefore, he got drafted. I mean that's how it works. And a the--I had cousins who got killed. My best friend got killed on his way to Vietnam. He was a Marine [U.S. Marine Corps] and there was a plane that hit the mountains in San Diego [California] on his way to Vietnam.
Speaker 2: What was his name?
Speaker 1: His name was Harrison Wallace [ph.]. We were like brothers and sisters. And he, he, he just got killed. All of them got killed instantly, the whole plane load of Marines. But there were--I don't think there was a family untouched by the Vietnamese war. We had cousins, you had various people. You had folk who came back who were never right.
Speaker 2: Was the black professional community for the war, against the war, political?
Speaker 1: I was opposed to the war. I, I--the problem that I had with the war, and I was teaching, was that if you go back and look at the data there were too many blacks on the front line based on our percentage of the population here in the United States. And where I came from in Alabama [Cherokee County, Alabama], the draft was totally biased. Poor kids, black and white, and black kids got drafted. Wealthy kids, like--my--like, like President Bush [President George Walker Bush] went to the--to the--to the Guard [National Guard]. My brother couldn't get in the Guard. My father [Howard Cowser] tried. But you had to be a little rich white boy. Poor white kids and black kids, period, were drafted. The draft was, was, was unbiased when it came to them. It was very interesting, so it was totally discriminatory.
Story_ID: 580034
Speaker 1: Tell me about your years at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I went there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You started there when?
Speaker 2: Seventy-two [1972]. I was pregnant. I arrived five months pregnant. I almost had the baby in the bathroom on my way to class. It's true, my water broke. I didn't know what it was. Finally the secretary had to tell me I should go to the doctor, which I did. The only black people in the building were me, the secretary and the janitor, Mr. Brown [ph.]. And I always made Mr. Brown's coffee every morning. So I was making Mr. Brown's coffee and I couldn't stay out of the bathroom. And she told me to go to the doctor. I called the doctor, he said come right away. I said, "Mr. Brown, I'll be right back." I said, "And you finish this coffee, but I'll be back in a minute." I left my little lunch, didn't get back. You know, went to the doctor, four days later I have a baby. But Georgia Tech was interesting. I learned a lot of things there. It took a lot out of me, but I was the first black professor to be tenured as a full professor. And that was an interesting adventure. If it had not been for the students, I never would have survived. You know, everywhere you go there has to be something that grounds you. And I was grounded, my thing was to teach. And I was gonna leave when things got really hot and heavy there, and Dr. Bacote [Clarence A. Bacote], I had--had a meeting with him 'cause I was gonna go to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio]. And he sat me down and he asked me, he says, "Were you in the Civil Rights Movement Dorothy [HistoryMaker Dorothy Cowser Yancy]?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Did you protest?" I said, "Yeah." He said, "What were you protesting for?" I said, "So things would get better, you know, and you could go places, integrate places and be treated just like other people." He says, "Well, if you don't stay at Georgia Tech, who's supposed to go." And I thought about it. And I decided I was gonna stay there and I was gonna fight them and I was gonna do what I wanted to do the way I wanted to do it. And so it beca- I had friends and we worked hard and we had good classes. But it was one of those pressure cooker atmospheres where you worked seven days a week. I used to go to work on Saturdays and Sundays. Yvonne [Yvonne Cowser Yancy] grew up going to work on Saturdays and Sundays. I mean--
Speaker 1: Your daughter?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we grew up. It was like a pressure cooker. If you missed a day you got behind, because it was a competition. You were competing with the faculty in order to get promoted and tenured, plus as a black faculty you had the issue of the black students. Black students will gravitate to you if you have any kind of empathy or understanding or if they identify with you at all.
Speaker 1: How many black students were there?
Speaker 2: Well, when I first got there, there were about ninety. By the time I left there were like about six hundred.
Speaker 1: Out of how many?
Speaker 2: By the time I left Tech, there were twelve thousand students. But about three thousand were graduate students. But--it, it, you know, I became the lady in the D.M. Smith hall [D.M. Smith Building], the black woman. And you know, it's funny, this past year the students have had me back and they've given me two or three awards, and I don't even know these students. But they said they hear about me and they hear about me from my students. But we, we, we--if it was time to protest or time to confront the administration, I did it. Because I figured I had nothing to lose but a job, you know, you can always find another job. And if it was right and the kids were right, I would always defend them. And the only thing I asked was that they do their work and that they do their very best. And most of them did.

Speaker 1: Did you know the political black families in Atlanta [Georgia], Maynard Jackson, Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young], [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond, the Kings (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Yeah. I knew them, but I was not one of those, you know, close friends of theirs. But I knew Maynard. Maynard's daughter and my daughter grew up together. They were in Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] together. I knew Andrew, and I don't really know Andrew that well. I mean I knew Jean [Jean Childs Young], his first wife, 'cause Bo [Andrew Young III] and Yvonne [Yvonne Cowser Yancy] grew up together. So, you know, it was those kinds of relationship. Children make people know each other, you know.
Speaker 1: So tell me about Jack and Jill?
Speaker 2: I was the president of the Atlanta chapter of Jack and Jill. And that in itself was an adventure. There's nothing like being the president of a hundred and some black women. I always wondered what would happen if all of that political acumen that they had had actually been exercised in the real political arena. Sonjia Young [HistoryMaker Sonjia W. Young] and I used to talk about how we could rule the world. And we would just step out there and take that chance.
Speaker 1: Andy Young's wife?
Speaker 2: No, that's Walter's [HistoryMaker Dr. Walter Young] wife, Sonjia.
Story_ID: 580036
Speaker 1: From Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], you were there how many years?
Speaker 2: Twenty-two.
Speaker 1: And throughout your tenure there, what did you teach?
Speaker 2: Well, I started off teaching American history and then I taught American politics, political science, the survey course. Then I taught urban politics. Then I taught comparative labor relations, and I taught labor relations over in the business school [Georgia Tech College of Management; Ernest Scheller Jr. College of Business, Atlanta, Georgia] and I taught African American history. I taught the survey and I taught 20th century.
Speaker 1: And you were an administrator as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for about five years I was the associate director of the school of social sciences and I decided I didn't really wanna do that.
Speaker 1: You, you liked being around the students?
Speaker 2: Well, I was around the students I just decided that I didn't--well as an administrator you get to hear everybody's problems, you know, you get to--it's, it's just a whole of distractions. And I just decided that, you know, I would just to prefer to teach and do my other work and not be--and do my research and deal with students and not, not deal with that. It just didn't--it didn't make a lot of sense to me at the time. But the president was an unusual person. He had sent me to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to the management program.
Speaker 1: Who was the president?
Speaker 2: Joseph Pettit [Joseph M. Pettit]. He, he was very protective of me in many ways. He sent me to the Harvard program. He sent me to Boulder, Colorado to a mediation program so I could get a certification. He sent me to the UN [United Nations] conference for women in Nairobi [Kenya]. He sent me all kinds of places. He used to tell me that what I had to do was to get every certificate that I might ever need. I just put them in the drawer. He said, "Because there's one thing you're gonna learn in this world Dorothy [HistoryMaker Dorothy Cowser Yancy]," he says, "white men were born to lead." He said, "Nobody ever sent me to take a course in management, but they made me a dean and they made me a college president." He says, "Women and minorities will have to prove, in this society they're still asking well what qualifies them to do that," he said, "no one ever asked me that question." He says, "So I want you to have all of your pieces of paper, so if you ever decide that's what you wanna do, you can go do it. When they ask you where you got a qualification just pull it out and hand it to them." He was very--he, he, he had vision.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. I--I'm still active in the Atlanta chapter of The Links in Atlanta [Georgia]. That's where my little membership is. Been there since the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Was--what was the role of Links in Atlanta and what is it?
Speaker 2: They do a lot of community things. There's a school that my chapter has worked with for--Co- Co- Coan elementary school--Coan Middle School [Sammye E. Coan Middle School, Atlanta, Georgia]. We've worked with that--those kids for twenty some years. And it's a very successful program. And then there're some other things that we do. But the Con- the Coan elementary school is probably the centerpiece of the program. We take them to colleges, we get them going. We've now started endowments so that we can help them go to college. But we work with them for a long time.
Speaker 1: Was your daughter [Yvonne Cowser Yancy] involved, was she in a cotillion, debutante ball?
Speaker 2: She refused to be in the debutante ball, which was fine with me. We took the money and went on vacation.

Speaker 1: What was life like in your home, holidays? You mentioned, again Thanksgiving, Christmas?
Speaker 2: Oh, my daughter said she grew up in a strange household, two Ph.D.'s, two college professors, which was probably an abnormal kind of a life. But we've always been--I've always been a big--I love to cook. So we have a big dinner on Thanksgiving. And Yvonne's [Yvonne Cowser Yancy] godfather comes to Thanksgiving dinner. He gra- he retired from Vassar [Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York]. As a matter of fact, this year will be our fortieth Thanksgiving dinner. And (laughter) yeah, we've been eating Thanksgiving dinner together almost every year since we taught together at Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]. Then there is my--my aunt comes--
Speaker 1: Who's that?
Speaker 2: My Aunt Mary [Mary Cowser Alexander], she lives down in Florida. She's a retired principal out of Detroit [Michigan] and her husband. And then Barkey, Barksdale [Marcellus Barksdale] who heads up the black studies program over at--at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and a few others. There's some odds and ends, and the people who don't have anywhere to eat. Beverly (unclear) she's hungry will show up to dinner with her sisters. And I always cook big dinner for Thanksgiving. And Christmas, I have a big Christmas dinner and then I go to Alabama and cook for my nieces and nephews. We have a good time cooking. As a matter of fact, all of us can cook and so, you know, everybody has to have their special dish, excuse me. And I, I, I like to cook. I'm the dressing lady and the turkey and all of that. And the tr- and the basic stuff. My mother [Linnie Covington Cowser] used to have this three days of cooking before Christmas, they have the big dinner. And I used to go home and help her do it. And after she died, I continued to do it. And so we--it's the thing that holds our family. I think food sometimes holds black families together and the food has held our family together. We don't--we don't have Christmas dinner on Christmas. We might have it on the 27th. We have it when most of the kids can come and my sister [Carol Cowser Yarbrough] and brother [Howard Dale Cowser], and whatever that--we do it that way now. But when my mother was living, it was always on the December the 24th.
Story_ID: 580039
Speaker 1: How long were you and your husband [Robert Yancy] married?
Speaker 2: Oh my god, we were getting ready to celebrate our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary.
Speaker 1: And you got divorced when?
Speaker 2: Ninety-two [1992], January 6th.
Speaker 1: Was that a turning point?
Speaker 2: Well, it probably was. It probably was. I probably would never have come here [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] if I hadn't been divorced. I, I wouldn't have. 'Cause I'd had opportunities to, to go other places before and I just never took them up on it. But when--I was on the board of trustees here and when the vacancy came up my daughter [Yvonne Cowser Yancy] was in graduate sch- in law sch- I mean she was at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois]. She says, "Why don't you apply for that job and stop complaining?" 'Cause I was complaining about this needs to be done and that needs to be done. And she said, "Shut up and go do it." So she--she kept on and I said, "You know, you might be right." So I applied to be the interim president on a Wednesday and the board met that Friday and I was elected. I planned to come here and stay about six months. So I took a leave of absence from Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia]. I mean, you know, I wa- I didn't need to go anyplace. I only taught two classes. I mean I worked six hours a week. Now stop and think about it. So, my brother [Howard Dale Cowser] had a bet that I would never come here. And he lost his bet. He said my sister--he said, "I don't have a stupid sister." He said, "My sister is brilliant, I know she's not going there." And so (laughter) he lost and we laugh about it now. But I came here and it was fun, it was different and I--it was fun. We were in the middle of a campaign and it turns out I love to raise money. I had a good time asking people for money. It turned out to be a passion I didn't know I had. And I, I wanted to do something about the buildings. I wanted to build things. I'd never built bui- buildings before. I never asked anybody for any money. Everything was new. Only thing I knew was academia. You know, I knew how to do a budget from doing my own budget, but that was about it. But I figured out that if I could balance my budget, I could balance this one, it's the same principle. So I just put my common sense to work and had a good time. Does that make any sense?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Had the campus changed since your years here as a student?
Speaker 2: Oh my god yes. Yeah it had changed. Dr. Perry [R.P. Perry] had built some buildings after I left and each president before had built something, but we had a serious deferred maintenance issue. And we had the need for a brand new library, we had the need for just all kinds of things. This building you couldn't ev- the pigeons were living up here in this building. The only place you could come to was the first floor. And it was just lots of work to be done. And, and lots of the academic programs needed to be ratcheted up, they were all right, you know, but they could, they could always use--the faculty needed things. They needed more faculty development. I mean there was just a need everywhere. More scholarship dollars. And so I just decided to pick away at it piece by piece, and I decided that I would deal with technology first because they didn't have it and I had never worked where they didn't have technology. I had to have it, I couldn't function without it. I said we're gonna put in a serious infrastructure here, and we did. And when I say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where was your daughter at the time?
Speaker 2: My daughter was at Northwestern and she convinced me to come here to work. And she said, "You need to go and work and if you decide you don't wanna stay there you can always leave, but you need to go. Just go and give it a shot." She encouraged me. I never would've come here if she had not. Then when the job was up to be the full president, once again she told me to apply. And she came for my interview. So we were interviewed together. And these other people interviewed as couples. And we were interviewed as she, you know, she's my--she says--she says, "They're gonna have their significant others there, you better not go in there by yourself girl." She says, "I'm coming." So she hopped on a plane and came from Northwestern and we did our interview.
Speaker 1: How did it go?
Speaker 2: It went great, I got the job.
Speaker 1: Did they offer it to you immediately?
Speaker 2: Well, they, they had a search. The search started in April, the applications were due that April. I was appointed interim in January. The search applications closed in April. They announced the presidency in October. Because I was prepared to go back to my job because I had just taken a leave. My house was still sitting there, I mean furn- all I had to do was just get a couple of suits and go back home. And it would've been a nice adventure, a nice, nice experience.
Speaker 1: Who again, who was the president preceding you?
Speaker 2: Robert Albright, Bob.
Speaker 1: And had he--did he pass on a wonderful adventure to you, had he done quite a bit of work and?
Speaker 2: Bob had done some things, but, and I--and I--I have a thing about past presidents. I think every president does what that president can do. And I think that the role of the person that comes behind them is to build on what they did and to ma- and have more added value and to take the school to another level. So, Bob had started--he had an idea of technology. He just had not developed it. But he had put fiber into the ground that went no place. And so with fiber, oh I had it going. I said oh boy let me grab this boy's idea and go on and take it someplace. So we built a major, major infrastructure and went laptop in time.
Story_ID: 580040
Speaker 1: So what year did you take on the presidency at Johnson C. Smith University [Charlotte, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well, I ca- I was elected interim president on Ju- January the 14th, 1994. And there was supposed to be a month or so between me and the president [Robert Albright] who's supposed to help me get this adjustment. Very much didn't happen because, you know, when a president is trying to leave they got to pack and go to their next job too. So I didn't really get the indoctrination that I was hoping for. But I started on March 1st by myself. And the election of the president was October the 7th or something like that of '94 [1994]. And so that was when I officially became the president, the interim was over at that point. So I guess as of you and I sitting here today, I've been here thirteen years.
Speaker 1: So that was an historic event, why?
Speaker 2: Oh it was historic because there'd never been a woman as a president here. This school was founded for men. It was founded for men in 1867, and women didn't come here until '32 [1932]. And the women who came, came from Barber-Scotia [Barber-Scotia College, Concord, North Carolina] for their junior and senior year and they lived off campus. So Barber-Scotia was a two year school and this was a place for them to finish their last two years. And then in 1940, of course the war [World War II, WWII], you have women coming in full time and they built a dormitory for women, Duke Hall [James B. Duke Hall]. So it was founded for men to be preachers and teachers, wh- that was a purpose. And when I came to school here in '60 [1960], women didn't have any administrative or leadership positions. You had a dean of women and you had a woman heading up the English department, which were typical women--jobs for women. That's the way it was. Men ran everything here. I never thought that there would be a woman president of Johnson C. Smith. It just never crossed my mind. I had a guidance counselor used to tell me I was gonna be the first president, and I used to ask her if she was on drugs. Her name was Mrs. Graham [ph.]. And we beca- we remained close friends all those years. And when I became president, she was one happy woman in Atlanta [Georgia]. She and I used to call each other almost every day. And when I was elected president, that was--that was the crowning moment for her.
Speaker 1: What other mentors did you have during that transitional period when you became president?
Speaker 2: Well, the person who probably helped me the most was Dr. Gloster [Hugh Morris Gloster], who was the retired president of Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] at the time. But he had some grants, I think it was through the Southern Education Foundation [Atlanta, Georgia], and it was some management kind of grants. And so I didn't have any money so he had a grant that paid him and then he would come up here and help me. He--the two areas where he helped me the most were in admissions and financial aid (cough) and recruiting students, and how you go about doing it. And he, he came up here twice and he stayed a couple of days each time. And if I have a question I can call him. And the other person that I could call was Dr. Scott [Julius S. Scott, Jr.] who had been president of Paine [Paine College, Augusta, Georgia], who went on to have an administrative position with the Methodist church. And he's been interim president at lots of places. He's been at Medical College of Georgia [Augusta, Georgia]. He's right now at Savannah State [Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] and all of that. But I had taught his son at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] and I could always call him. And there were other people that I could ask questions. Johnnetta [Johnnetta B. Cole] I could call, and I mean, you know, I got help--
Speaker 1: Johnnetta Cole (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cole--Johnnetta Cole. I got help from, from lots, lots of people. And you know, you just have to--the one thing you have to learn is if you know you don't know, you better ask somebody. There's no sense in co- you know, making a big mistake. If you make a mistake, make it with at least some kind of information.
Story_ID: 580041
Speaker 1: So, what was your plan of action when you got here, what did you wanna do?
Speaker 2: Well, the pla- when I got here, I walked into a capital campaign and the goal was $50 million. And so I had to raise the money. So I walked in and went to the capital campaign meeting and Ed Crutchfield who was the biggest banker in town head of First Union Bank [First Union Corporation; Wells Fargo and Company], and John Stedman [John B. Stedman, Jr.] who was the guru of fundraising here in town and the head of Duke Energy [Duke Energy Corporation] and Duke Power [Duke Power Company, Charlotte, North Carolina] at the time, and the head of the newspaper and the head of Lance [Lance, Inc.; Snyder's-Lance, Inc.]. That was my operating committee. I mean here are all these big dogs, you know, and here I am this kid who just walked out of the classroom. And so I'll never forget my first meeting. The--Ed Crutchfield was late. You know, Presbyterians are always on time. And then he looked at me and he says, "Well I don't know how we gonna tell the Johnson C. Smith story since Bob Albright [Robert Albright] has gone." And I remember looking at him, by now I'm really seething. I said, "Well I don't know what you are talking about, I am the damn story. And if I can't tell it, it can't be told. Bob Albright didn't go to Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina]." And he and I hit it off just like that. And we've been friends ever since. And he helped--we work together. We met every three months and we raised that money.
Speaker 1: How long did it take you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had sixty-three--in--in '98 [1998] we ended the campaign at $63.8 million. That's right.
Speaker 1: And you had more than doubled the endowment or?
Speaker 2: The endowment has gone from when I came here it was 13 something, and a few weeks ago it was 53 million, 'cause we just finished an--another campaign. It was 75 million and we've hit 80.6 million. So it's, it's, it's been interesting. So what you see around the campus, the new library, the new technology center, the renovation of this building, the track and academic complex, the renovation of the buildings, the air conditioning of all the dormitories. You know, the, the gr- I mean all the things you see around here are the things that we've done and the infrastructure. We've tried to, to improve upon what we found and just create a very good learning community, a place where students can come and learn and go out and be, be successful and main--major contributors to, to, to the universe. I mean, we, we wanna raise global students and I think we do that with our technology. I don't think our students would know what to do without having a laptop. They've all had one individually since 2000. And I think that's probably the, the connections that they made with the world is probably the best contribution or the major contributions of, of something I've given to them.
Story_ID: 580042
Speaker 1: Explain to us what you did with respect to those laptops. How did you get the money and who got them and?
Speaker 2: I raised it. We, we raised the money. We--well I'll tell ya. I had come out of Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] and we had technology. But students at Georgia Tech did not have laptops. But I had read about them and I had seen it and I had gone to a lot of programs or meetings, and we had put in--one of the things I did was, I developed the computer labs once I came here [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina]. So we had labs all over campus. And I developed a cadre of students called technical assistants, student technical assistants and I paid them out of the operating budget to run the labs and to keep the labs open, because I couldn't afford to pay adults, but I could afford to pay students. And these students then began to do A+ courses and various kinds of things, and we organized them. There's a national group, TLC--TLT [ph.] I think it is. I started sending them to the national conferences. 'Cause I decided that I could do with students what I couldn't do with, you know, people who were dyed in the wool technicians. And I grew a IT [information technology] group because we only had one or two. So there was a young man here who had graduated from college and Franklin [ph.] developed into a person that could really run IT. I sent him to get his M.B.A. I mean there're things that we did, I grew my program and we wired places and pretty soon we had two oh--oh--a computer for every two students with the labs. And then one day I was eating in this dining hall with the students and a kid walked in who had been a big troublemaker, and had become a star student and he had a laptop. His name was Ottega Mooney [ph.]. And I said, "Ottega what are you doing?" I called him O.J. I said--I said, "That's a cute little machine you got there." He said, "Yeah." I said, "Where did you get it from?" He says. "I can't tell you." I said, "You can't tell me?" He said, "Unh-uh," he said, "everybody should have one." He was being very catty. I said, "Everybody should have one?" I said, "Ottega how am I gonna do that?" He said, "You the president, you figure that out." He said, "That's your job." I thought about it, he was right. It was my job. So I decided I'd put together a committee. I went to a meeting and IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] and everybody was there. And I said, oh I see we can do that. So I started going to foundations and different people and I was raising money to do what I needed to do. I had no idea what I needed, but we had a plan and I had a strategic plan for technology done. It cost me $250,000, I'll never forget it. I said, if I don't have a plan I'm gonna mess up. So we had been making up our plan as we went along. And Frank Park [ph.]--there was a whole group of us, we used to meet all the time. And the kids would be in the basement and we'd order things at night, you know, we'd make it work. And after that I said, you know, we need to get this group together, we need to start thinking about a laptop initiative. And so we put together some faculty and some students, and Ottega was my main man on my committee. We brought in people, we interviewed Dell [Dell Inc.], we interviewed Osiris [Osiris Serverless Portal System], we interviewed Gateway [Gateway, Inc.], we interviewed IBM, and we came with what we wanted. We were still looking for money. And at the very end when we decided what we were going to do, we were gonna go IBM and we were gonna go live in 2000. We planned for over two years to go laptop and we needed the software, we didn't have all the software we needed. And UNCF [United Negro College Fund], from Bill Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III], got a major contribution of software from Microsoft [Microsoft Corporation] and we got some servers from Dell and some other things which helped me, 'cause it--we're talking about thousands--I mean millions of dollars that we had to spend on this program. Because it was about 3 million [dollars] just to get the machines. But we, we, we figured--I, I just figured out how to do it and we made it work. Does that make any sense? Because it, it was all of us in this together. And if--it was not a Yancy [HistoryMaker Dorothy Cowser Yancy] failure, it would've been our failure. And we made it work. And we gave the laptops to every kid, not just each class, 'cause Ottega came to me and said, "Dr. Yancy, you cannot have second class citizens on a black college campus [HBCU]." He said, "You cannot have the have and the have nots." And once again he was right.
Speaker 1: So every student?
Speaker 2: We gave them to every student, since 2000.
Speaker 1: Has that made a difference?
Speaker 2: Oh god yes. It has made a world of difference. These kids don't know how to act without the technology. They don't--they don't know what it is like to be in a school without a laptop. They never--you got--we've got students who have never been without a laptop. Ottega never got one. He graduated just before we brought them in. He works for IBM now though. He went on to Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia] and--got a master's [degree]. He was a er- early admit and, and he's out working.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where else did the technology, I know that this is the high tech campus [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] in general, so where else did you install technological advancements (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we did a lot of things. We have a faculty development program. We had to make sure the faculty was--had to be trained so they could use the technology. You can't incorporate it into the way you teach if you don't know how to do it. So we got money. We had grants to train faculty. They could do many courses, they could do presentations, we'd send them places.
Speaker 1: Like what, PowerPoint or what?
Speaker 2: Oh, they do more than PowerPoint. I mean they do interactive all kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Explain?
Speaker 2: Well, I really can't explain what they all do. They even have mini courses partially online, partially offline. I mean they have hybrid courses as they call them. They do lots of different things with, with, with the technology. And we've got a variety of kinds of software. We've got TrueOutcomes and a whole bunch of other things. We're putting in a new--a new system, Zander Bar Windows [ph.] which is gonna be our new operating system. But within it, we're gonna take advantage of the new advising module that they have so that students can get on time instant advising and, and--anyways--is--I--I think it's gonna be an exciting time. But I have a couple of faculty members who train other faculty members. We have a training center here on campus that is equivalent to any you'll find in Corporate America. It's--it--it--you know, you go and you can take a course. If you wanna go take a course in--in Word [Microsoft Word] or whatever it is, you can go take the class. They'll tell you when it's gonna be, you go take it. And John [ph.] who now runs my technology center, who I hired a few years ago was a trainer in Corporate America before he came here. And so we've always had a good thing. And the students still work and they do level one and level two maintenance on all the machines on campus. And they get paid and they have the lead student, and they have oh a thing about their performance and how long it takes them to do the turnaround service. They run it like a business.
Speaker 1: So this was the first HBCU [historically black colleges and universities]?
Speaker 2: It's the only one.
Speaker 1: To do what?
Speaker 2: To go laptop totally. We're still the only one.
Speaker 1: How does that feel?
Speaker 2: Well, I wish somebody else would do it. It, it--I feel that, that it would just be an advantage, that's, that's what I feel. I mean it's like I never gloated about being the only one, it's sort of embarrassing to be the only one because there are other schools where all the students do have laptops, you know. So I, I just wish that all of them did, because I think that's what you need to, to make students to, to develop the, the qualities that students have so they can go out and truly be competitive, world competitive. They need to have access to everything.
Story_ID: 580044
Speaker 1: Speaking of technology, I know the Virginia Tech situation happened recently and technology was a point of discussion about alerting students in that kind of thing. You've been president during several sort of tragedies, 9/11 [September 11, 2001], Virginia Tech incident [at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia]. What was the response here to that and how does technology figure in (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we had a meeting right away and we started looking at what kind of emergency plan we would have and my chief financial officers on the state planning committee. But the--there are several things that we're gonna do [at Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina]. One of the things we're gonna do is we're gonna put a bell in the tower. We have a, a clock tower here where you can hear forever. And it used to be used to notify the community when things happened. Back in the day when people didn't have telephones, they used this bell tower to tell them when people died, when they won basketball games, when they did anything. If anything that happened that this community of Biddleville [Charlotte, North Carolina] needed to know about, this bell rang. So now we're get--we're gonna get a horn, but we're also gonna get this software where we get the students' cell phone numbers when they come to school so you can give them the instant message when something has happened. There are these companies that are doing that now, but we won't do it until fall, 'cause when students register then we'll get their telephone number so we can do it. And, and it's not a matter having every students number, if you have enough numbers, the word will get out I think. 'Cause you're never gonna have every kid's cell phone number.
Story_ID: 580045
Speaker 1: What about different academic programs [at Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina]? What about international studies and foreign exchange?
Speaker 2: Well, we do have some international studies and we have students studying in Morocco this summer. We had a fairy- fairly active program. We had gone with Moscow State University [Moscow, Russia] and MGIMO [Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Moscow, Russia], and we had one with--in Japan and we had one at University of Al Akhawayn in, in Morocco [sic. Al Akhawayn University, Ifrane, Morocco]. And after 9/11 [September 11, 2001], kids got scared and so our program sort of went downhill. But it seems to be coming back. I have--the Moroccan kids came back this year. So the spring they came back to school here. And my kids have gone to Morocco and we're do something down in the Dominican Republic and some other places. The kids are getting interested again. And, you know, it's funny international relations is not as popular sometimes at maj- minority institutions. It's the idea of going away and going to these places and whatever, but kids were afraid after 9/11. My campus was hit pretty hard by 9/11. I had three kids whose fathers were killed--were fireman in, in the towers [World Trade Center, New York, New York]. We were the only black college [HBCU] where fireman were lost who had children in a black college. Then we had students who had--had folk in the, the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.]. And then we had all kinds of kids. We have a large contingency of kids from New York [New York] and the Washington, D.C. area. So we were pretty hard hit. And then one of my classmates was in the plane that, the one that, that crashed in Pennsylvania [United Airlines Flight 93]. He was taking his kids to a, a National Geographic thing out in California. And so, after that, we, we--our national--we had Arabic at that time. Our program lost steam. So now it's, it's a matter of gearing it back up. As a matter of fact, I was just having a meeting about that earlier.
Story_ID: 580046
Speaker 1: How has it felt for you to come back to your alma mater [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] as president?
Speaker 2: Well, there's been some interesting times. I, I don't think I would've ever have worked this hard for anybody else. The, the 24/7 has been something that I've, I've done, but I've done it because I wanted to do it and because I love to do it. I've seen a lot of my old professors, I've had to bury a lot of them since I've been back. That has not been pleasant, oh yeah, I've had to bury a lot of them (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who?
Speaker 2: Oh, I buried one last week. Mrs. Law [ph.], she didn't teach me, but her husband did. I've had Dr. Rippy [Coleman Rippy], Dr. Gatherwright. I mean it's been a lot of them, it, it's been more than ten, let's put it that way. And then the, the last one who taught me retired last year. And he teaches for me part time now. And so we have an interesting kind of relationship.
Speaker 1: Is that odd for them, was it odd for them to have you come back as the president?
Speaker 2: I think they were quite proud. I, I think they really were. Because I tell you something I did. When I got back, one of the old timers mentioned to me, you know, "We never get to see each other." I said, "You don't?" She said, "No." And I figured I wasn't gonna be around. I said, "You know, we ought to have a lunch. Let's have lunch and invite all the retirees." Well we did. And it was in '94 [1994]. And you know, we've had that lunch every year. And so I got to reconnect with all of them again. And it's just been--that part has been fun, but to see them sort of go away. The--one of the--one died about two months ago, Ms. Harris [ph.]. Ms. Harris was the secretary to the president when I came to school. She was the secretary to five presidents. She was a wonderful little old lady. She was ninety years old. She called me up one day and she says, "You need to come over." So I went over to see what she wanted. Of course she had tea and she had cake, and everything. She called me over she--'cause she wanted to give me ten thousand dollars before she moved to Atlanta [Georgia] to be with her sist- with her daughter. I said, "You know, Ms. Harris you are just a trip." She--and--she--she said, "But I'm gonna tell you my age." Now she'd never told me her age. She was legally blind. She said, "I am ninety so it's time for me to fess up," (laughter). So I've--I mean I've had those kinds of relationships along with the, the new faculty that I've gotten to meet.
Speaker 1: With your added responsibilities, are you still able to interact with individual students, small groups of students?
Speaker 2: Sometimes I, I get to talk to them. I mean I'll go out on the block and talk to them. I--and I talk to them some--and--the thing that I like about this--this day and age is if the student really got something to tell you and it's an emergen- they send me an email. You know, I email them back. "Can you come over here, go do this, go see this person?" I mean, it works. I mean, even the email as the kids--ca- you can email the queen. So we--you know, we communicate, you know.

Speaker 1: Were there any rituals in place when you attended this school that remain in place? Traditions?
Speaker 2: Well, the choir has it's, it's program at Christmas like it always did. I'm trying to think. They do some things now that we didn't do. They have--I'm trying to think of, what do they call it. They have the freshman--oh I can't even think of the name of it anymore, but it--it's when they say they're are Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] students or whatever it is. It's some kind of freshman ori- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Freshmen week?
Speaker 2: It's not a freshmen week, it's the thing that ends the freshmen week. We never had anything like that. So, I decided that okay we're gonna do this so let's make something out of it. So now they get a pin and you know, and they--you know, and all that kind of stuff. And there's something that I want to do. I discovered from Bunnie Jackson [HistoryMaker Bunnie Jackson-Ransom], Maynard's [Maynard Jackson] first wife. Her father [Burnell Hayes] graduated from Johnson C. Smith. See men in those days used to get a pin, it's a beautiful pin, has Johnson C. Smith on it, it's gold and it's like a lapel pin, but you can also wear it as a--around your neck. And she lost it and she was asking me for it. Well, that tradition is gone, it was gone when I came here. But a few--about two months ago I got something from an estate of a graduate who had died and his nephew had sent me the pin that he had found in his uncle's things. So now I have the pin and I think what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna get Joslyn [ph.] or someone to replicate the pin and I'm gonna start giving it to students. Because I think that would be a nice touch. Then the one thing that they do that they didn't do when I was a student, they give gifts to the graduates. We got a gift. When I graduated you got a Bible and you got the Duke [James B. Duke] indenture book 'cause you know Johnson C. Smith is a beneficiary of the Duke indenture, we were written in Mr. Duke's will. So we get 4 percent of--of the Duke Endowment [Charlotte, North Carolina] funds. That's what we got. But when I came they were giving the students a gift. And so I give them a gift at graduation, they get a gift at, at the reception at baccular [baccalaureate]. And I, I was--I, I reached a point now where I let them help me pick it out. So it varies. This year they got a, a, a block of, I call it plastic, I don't know what it is, but this building is etched inside. And they, they really liked that and it had the name on it and the date. And they've gotten things like rulers and you know, with Johnson C. Smith on it. It--it's--I always given them crystal, let's put it that way.

Speaker 1: Have you found yourself being creative with fundraising efforts [as president of Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. I, I guess you'd call it creative. I mean, you know, you write proposals and you try to figure out what it is that people want. We just got a gift of a half million dollars from BB and T Bank [Branch Banking and Trust Company] that I've got to announce. And that was--that was an interesting adventure. We worked on it for years. I mean, you know, fundraising is like friend raising, it takes a long time. You have to develop relationships. And eventually, you know, something happens. It's the way, the way, the way it works. And so, you know, you--you just have to figure out what the donor wants and whether it's something that you really need and can use, 'cause there's no sense in getting something that's gonna be useless to the institution.

Speaker 1: Are pageants a big deal here?
Speaker 2: Oh they have the homecoming thing, you know, the crowning of the queen is a big to do. I think every kid around here must be in it. They got Miss This and Miss That, and all of that and they, they, they do all that, and they have homecoming like everybody else. You know, Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] has probably the largest homecoming parade of any college. It is a community parade. We'll have 140 pieces. Downtown shuts down for the Johnson C. Smith homecoming. You didn't know that did you. The, the--that's right, the, the, the floats start at the overpa- underpass there at 77 [Interstate 77] and go all the way to Memorial Stadium [American Legion Memorial Stadium]. Every church, every beauty shop, everybody's in this parade (laughter). Our, our parade is a community parade, which I love. And we'll bring in about seven or eight bands, and of course we'll have Johnson C. Smith's band in the, in the, in the parade. So it's--it's like a homecoming kind of thing. So we have a rule, a car costs a couple of hundred dollars to get in the parade. A float is thirty-five dollars. So people make these beautiful floats and it's really nice. And you have the little bugle corps of the various little groups around here that are in the parade. So it's, it's nice. So homecoming is sort of like a community homecoming, but the students have a good time too. And they always have some kind of an act. You know, they have a dance or they have some kind of a comic and step shows and all that kind of stuff. And then the other--the next time the students have fun is Bull Fest. They have Bull Fest in April. Bull Fest is during the week when we have poetry week. We have po- we have a week of poetry and you know, we have poetry that the students do, we bring in poets and all that. So then the students also have games. So poetry festival [Worlds of Words International Poetry Festival] is something I started when I came to put with Bull Fest.
Speaker 1: I know at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] when I was there we had curfew and then Johnnetta Cole [Johnnetta B. Cole] got rid of it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They don't have curfew.
Speaker 1: Got up with the--did they ever here?
Speaker 2: Oh cou- of course. When I came here you had to come in at 7:30, the sun was still shining. Yes.
Speaker 1: And boys weren't allowed in your dorms?
Speaker 2: No, no. We had to be escorted to the movies by some upperclassman if you went with a date. Even if you went alone you had to be escorted. So yeah, it was that kind of bad.
Speaker 1: And how are--how are things now?
Speaker 2: Well, there're really no curfews. We do have some controls over freshmen I think their first semester or something. And they are not supposed to have cars their first year, but the freshmen will---there are some that will have cars because they need them to go to work. There're students who have two or three jobs. You can't tell a kid you can't have a car. I mean the kid can't go to work. You know, so you have to have some exceptions. But there--there're not that many rules. I mean, you know, according to the federal government when a kid's eighteen they're, they're adults. So what--it's not much you can do.
Speaker 1: What about the dorms, are they coed (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The students in the dorms--no, we don't. You know, the students have never asked for coed dorms. There were coed dorms here, there was one dorm that was coed at one point. And by the time I came it wasn't. But if you have--and we have an overflow of young men, we will take a wing and one of the floors in Greenfield [Wilbert Greenfield Hall] and put the boys on it. Now the new residence hall is built in the condos and each condo has six rooms in it. So you might have a condo of girls and a condo of boys and a condo of girls and a cond- you know, it, it, it might be that. But they never asked for coed dorms. I think they just wanna be able to walk around and be whatever, they just never have asked for that.

Speaker 1: What about famous graduates or famous donors?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess probably one of our most famous donors, it would not be like Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] or Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] or someplace like that. Our most famous donors have basically been white donors. Irwin Belk is one of our more famous donors, you know, Belk stores [Belk, Inc.]. I guess Mr. Duke [James B. Duke] is probably our most famous donor because was have received over $60 million from his will over the years. I would suspect he's probably one of the most famous donors at any--to any black school [HBCU] is James Buchanan Duke. He put us in his will in 1924 and we have gotten, yeah 1924.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the presidents went to ask him for some money and he didn't give him any. He wrote him a note and thanked him for the visit and two years later, Mr. Duke died. He had a mansion here in town along with them in New York [New York] and all these other places, you know, he had mansions everywhere. And in his will he created something called the Duke indenture. And the indenture is setup for what he perceived to be his causes in North and South Carolina. He believed in education. He believed in healthcare for children. And he believed in care for ministers in rural areas, you know, rural churches, rural ministers who didn't get paid anything. And so in his Indenture, he left 33 percent of it to Duke. Duke changed its name from Trinity College to Duke University [Durham, North Carolina]. He left 5 percent of it to Furman [Furman University, Greenville, South Carolina] because his foot doctor came from Furman, they say. He left 5 percent to Davidson College [Davidson, North Carolina], I don't know why because he's not Presbyterian, he was a Methodist. And he left 4 percent to Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina]. And no one has ever figured out why except for the fact that we had asked him for a contribution.
Story_ID: 580051
Speaker 1: The other major co- contributor of notoriety would be Mr. Johnson C. Smith who came from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], who died and had no children, he was Presbyterian. And in his will he indicated he wanted his money to go to a worthwhile cause. And his wife [Jane Berry Smith] spent it all here [Biddle University; Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina]. Because she too had had a visit from Dr. McCrorey [Henry Lawrence McCrorey], same president. And she decided that the boys here would be her project. And so she built the church. She built a dormitory. She built the science building. She built several cottages. And she built the gymnasium, the first in the--first gymnasium with an indoor track built on a black college campus [HBCU] in the Carolinas for her boys. Nothing was too good for her boys. And she built herself a house here on this campus where she lived when she came to visit. Because I'm sure she was shunned by the white community. But that's--those would be the major donors.
Speaker 2: Interesting.
Speaker 1: So it would be nice if I could name off some major black donors for you, but I can't. Not over a hundred thousand each.
Story_ID: 580052
Speaker 1: So you have been here at this university [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] for thirteen years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you're planning to retire soon?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that thought?
Speaker 2: Well, I plan to leave in June of 2008. I've just finished the big campaign, the 75 million one at 80.6 million [dollars], we'll probably hit 81, maybe 82 million by the end of the month. I--we've just finished our last SACS [Southern Association of Colleges and Schools] accreditation visit. We had a perfect score, I've gone through that twice. Very few schools have ever had a perfect score. We've just got a social work program reaffirmed for seven more years. We've just had the first national NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] Division II track meet here in Charlotte [North Carolina] on our campus, it has never happened before on a black college campus [HBCU]. And as Johnnetta [Johnnetta B. Cole] would say, "You leave when you're on a high." And we're on a high right now, "And leave when they still want you." And I've been here, by then, it'll be fourteen years and I think I've, I've, I've done my best and I've made a contribution and I need to just have some fun doing some other things. I'm sure I can have fun doing lots of things.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I'm a labor arbitrator so I'm gonna continue to hear my labor arbitration cases. I'll probably do some consulting. I might take another job. I don't know. I haven't made up my mind. But, you know, there's no no to anything until I look at it. I, I don't plan to retire, I'm just changing.

Speaker 1: And I know that you have been involved with the CIAA [Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the CIAA tournam- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tournament?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, the CIAA is the oldest black athletic conference in the United States. And at one time, it had all the black colleges [HBCUs] from Maryland--from Pennsylvania all the way down to Charlotte [North Carolina]. And over time, schools left and went to other conferences and then MEAC [Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference] was formed. And the CIAA now has about ten schools. I guess about--who had twelve, about I guess four or five years ago I was the first woman to be elected to be the president of the CIAA. And we've had fun, we've been able to grow the conference. We--we're known by our basketball tournament. And so I was able, with the help of a lot of other people, it took me years to get the bid accepted. Because we bid three times before we got it, but we brought the tournament to Charlotte. And the tournament has gone from nine thousand people to a hundred and sixty-five thousand people. The, the economic impact this past year was $27.8 million. It, it is, is the third largest tournament in the United States, black or white. And I've just been privileged to have had something to do with it. It, it's an exciting thing. If you've never been there, it's like a family reunion. People come from all kinds of colleges. As a matter of fact, 40 to 50 percent of the people who come to the tournament never went to a black school. Never went to a CIAA school. It is a happening as they would say. And it's just a place to be.
Story_ID: 580054
Speaker 1: Were you involved with, they have down here UNICEF [United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund] or is it UNCF?
Speaker 2: UNCF.
Speaker 1: Okay, they have a typo. UNCF, what was your role (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure. I was a president of the presidents. And I was always--I've been on the executive committee and I was a vice president. I've been on--I've been on lots and lots of committees for UNCF and I've gone around and made speeches for UNCF to raise money. But I guess the biggest thing was being president of the members, which is being president of thirty-nine presidents, which cannot--is not an easy task. As a matter of fact, I thought about it one day. I said you know, this is a hard job, but it's easier than being president of Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] (laughter).
Speaker 1: United Negro College Fund, a little easier than Jack and Jill (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right. (Cough) Yeah.
Story_ID: 580055
Speaker 1: You mentioned also your family reunion every year?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I have missed it now for the last three years--four years. It's--
Speaker 1: When you go back down to Cherokee, Alabama [Cherokee County, Alabama], what is that like, are you still seeing some white relatives, some black relatives?
Speaker 2: No, Hugh C [ph.] is dead now. His wife, I think, is living--I have to--and his sister, I think, is gone now. They moved to--eventually they moved to Chattanooga [Tennessee]. So I haven't seen any of them. I mean, I've, I've some of the ones who pass, if I go to family reunions 'cause they come to the family reunion. But the, going home is just like going home. I mean I go home and it's just like home. As a matter of fact, I can go home and sit on my brother's [Howard Dale Cowser] back porch and look at his garden, and go and I might get on the tractor 'cause he and I--my brother has a working farm, my brother's a farmer. I lease him my property. And he has his property, and so together he has a big farm. And I can go to the graveyard where my mother [Linnie Covington Cowser] and my sister and all of them are buried. And if I'm there a good two hours, it's like I've been grounded again. It's the strangest kind of a thing that sort of happens and it'll last me for a few months. I don't have to go back. I know who I am. I know where I came from. My mother always said never forget where you come from, never. And so I never tell you I'm from Gadsden, Alabama. I never say I am from Centre, Alabama. I say I am from Cherokee County, Alabama, 'cause that's where I'm from. The little town, the little community, the farm community that we grew up in was called Ballplay [Alabama], it was the name of it. 'Cause the Indians, the Cherokee and the Creeks, used to meet once a year and play ball for a whole week. And that's how the little community--but this community goes on for miles. So, it's not a town, there is no town. I mean there are towns, my father [Howard Cowser] worked in town. Our mail came from Gadsden. Our telephone came from Centre, Alabama. So we lived right on the county line. So it's like when I go home, I mean, everybody--I'm just to them I'm just Bonnie [HistoryMaker Dorothy Cowser Yancy], that's what they call me. And when they come and my--and my brother will be cooking, "Where's Bonnie?" "She's in the kitchen, she's cooking, where do you think she is." I mean, you--we, we just, we just cousins--we just family, you know.
Speaker 1: A large Native American population there?
Speaker 2: No. As a matter of fact, no, there're no Indians there that anybody knows about. There're black folk who are part Indian. My [paternal] grandmother [Electa Glover Cowser], my great-grandmother [Alabama Adams Glover], all of them were part Indian. But there are no 100 percent Indians around and nobody is on any register to check themselves. And nobody ever claims to be Indian, they tell you they--they're black. You know, everybody knows that everybody is mixed up with something, but you pick whatever it is you gonna be. And we were all told that we were black and that's what we picked.
Speaker 1: Is everybody in the family buried on the family cemetery (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Unh-uh. Some people were buried on all kinds of places. But, you know, you can come back there and be buried. You know, each family, the families who have rows and all this kind of stuff. And you know, you send money back home to do certain things, like when they were buying the stained glass windows, I remember buying a window. When they were doing something in the kitchen, I remember buying some, some towels, something for the floor. You know, you're always sending something back to the church [New Bethel United Methodist Church, Ballplay, Alabama] because it is the home church.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned your sister passed away, when?
Speaker 2: My sister died in '88 [1988] I think it was.
Speaker 1: Which sister?
Speaker 2: My oldest sister, Evelyn [Evelyn Cowser]. She had a heart attack. She was fifty-three. She had a heart attack. She was a school teacher. She had a heart attack getting in bed. She taught school that day, cut her grass, played for some church choir and died. My mother had a heart attack on the porch about ten months later and she died just like that sort of. So the women in my family die from heart disease, most of them.
Speaker 1: When you go back to Cherokee, Alabama, is it a different place then it was back in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Sure. Everything about it is different. You know, you see houses that--nice homes and nice things that you wouldn't have seen in those days. People have jobs that they wouldn't have had. They have cars that they didn't have. They have modern conveniences, I mean there's--there is city water as they call it now to the house. People still have septic tanks. But they have city water so no one is dependent upon their wells--
Speaker 1: How's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) anymore. They have Internet. They have--they have the things that connect you to the world. They have those dish--and they get all the channels, you know.
Speaker 1: And black people and white people?
Speaker 2: Black people and white people are still getting along. My brother's best friend is a white boy. As a matter of fact, they just finished putting a new roof on his house the two of them. They are awful (laughter). They are very, very close. They hunt together. As a matter of fact, my brother has a hunting blind. You know, those things that they call for deers, you know, you build a little thing and you got the blind where the deers come down. So my brother has one and, and, and his good friend, I can't even call his name, I call him a good ol' boy, he has one that he built for me as if I'm gonna shoot a deer. It's really for him so they can holler at each other from point A to point B. I mean they, they, they just help each other and they work together. And when my brother's child graduated from Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] with his Ph.D., he went up there in his, his truck with the big fat tires with his fat girlfriend and they had a good time, and my, my daughter [Yvonne Cowser Yancy] cooked for them. I mean, he's just--I can't even call his name for anything now, but he's just always around.
Story_ID: 580056
Speaker 1: Well now you are starting a new chapter of your life, as you look back, what are your biggest accomplishments?
Speaker 2: Well, I think one of my biggest accomplishment is raising a daughter who's sane and halfway successful. And she's a good kid. I, I, I, I've put a lot of time into that and I--and I'm very pleased with her.
Speaker 1: What does Yvonne [Yvonne Cowser Yancy] do?
Speaker 2: Yvonne is the head of HR [human resources] for Lincoln Financial [Lincoln Financial Group] in Greensboro [North Carolina]. She transferred out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to Greensboro about a ye- a year ago. She has an M.B.A. and she has all of her certifications in human resources, and she's, she's just a nice kid. And I, I really, I really like her, you know. She's a likable person, she's a nice person and she's fun. And she's caring. And I think that gr- rearing a well rounded child is, is, is something to be said about that. I, I'd like to think I had a little something to do with that. And I think that if I had to look at another accomplishment, it would be working very hard here at Jo- at Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] and bringing a little bit of notoriety to the place. It was a well kept secret and I think now more people know about it and they know that we have great students and we have good faculty, and they know that we exist. And I'd like to think that I've helped put them just a little wee bit on the map, because I think that's where they should've been all the time.
Story_ID: 580057
Speaker 1: And what, finally, would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, I've been asked that question and I've really not thought a lot about it. You know, I--when I left Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], I just left one day, I didn't go back. I went back two years later, my office was still there. And I went back and I packed my books. I, I--the students had packed them. And I took a moving company and I left. And I always thought about what my legacy was there and my legacy, I have concluded at Georgia Tech were my students. I mean, I've got success stories everywhere. And I think my legacy here [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] will be students. Because it's what they go out and do, and because it's like you're known by the company you keep, you're known by your product. I'll give you a story. I had a friend I used to drink coffee with every morning. He was a horrible old man. And he said that the worst thing that had happened in the Civil Rights Movement was that black folk had taken over the post office and the mail didn't ever get delivered on time anymore. He was from Chicago [Illinois]. He taught math. We drank coffee every morning and we would go at each other. And one day he told me, he said, "You know something Dot [HistoryMaker Dorothy Cowser Yancy], I met your daughter [Yvonne Cowser Yancy]." I said, "Yeah." He said, "And I decided I like you now." I said, "Why?" He said, "Because anybody who raised a daughter as nice as your kid gotta be a good person." And I think that whatever happens to us and whatever we do, our fate rests with these children that we create and that we develop and that we educate. And I think that that's my legacy. It's not buildings, it's not any of that other stuff.
