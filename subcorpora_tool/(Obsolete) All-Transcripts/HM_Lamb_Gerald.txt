Lamb [HistoryMaker Gerald Lamb] at his home at 8 Debettencourt Circle in the town of Oak Bluffs on the island of Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts.  The date is June 23, 2005.  The interviewer is Robert C. Hayden and the videographer is Neculai Burghelea.  Mr. HistoryMaker would you give me your full name and will you spell your name for me?
Speaker 2: My full name is Gerald A. Lamb, L-A-M-B, G-E-R-A-L-D initial A.
Speaker 1: Mr. Lamb what year were you born and where were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born in Elizabeth City, August 25, 1924.
Speaker 1: Okay Elizabeth City?
Speaker 2: North Carolina
Speaker 1: North Carolina okay I know that you are retired and we'll talk about your retirement years but how would label or designate your profession?  What did you do during your working life?
Speaker 2: My working career is, is a mixed bag but none the less an interesting one.  I have a career as a dental technician in Waterbury, Connecticut for several years, more than ten years and then ultimately after getting involved in politics an opportunity to help right the wrongs in the state Connecticut I entered politics in an interesting career as state treasurer of this state [Connecticut] for seven years and banking commissioner for a year and a half.  Subsequently, I joined Connecticut Bank and Trust the largest bank in Connecticut at that time as a senior officer and had a very interesting and rewarding and influencing career in banking.

Speaker 1: Before we go on and begin to take a look at your early life we have a few what we call warm up questions, People magazine-type questions to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --give people who will look at your interview a certain dimension of your personality.  And so I'd like to ask you what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food actually is seafood, and that's part of the attraction of living in New England because we do have a variety of seafood including lobster which happens to be one of my favorites.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year is summertime on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color would be navy blue.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: California is the state that I frequent most and my wife's favorite was San Francisco [California] and I love the San Diego [California] area.
Speaker 1: So you cover the state.
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: Last warm up question do you have a favorite phrase or saying that you use from time to time sort of a philosophical thought that is meaningful to you that you share with others?
Speaker 2: I share quite frequently this phrase that manmade obstacles are really bumps in the road to success and young people's eyes light up immediately because once they understand that what I'm really conveying to them, you may reach a bump but that doesn't mean you can't go over it to success.
Story_ID: 313974
Speaker 1: We want to start, Mr. Lamb [HistoryMaker Gerald Lamb], by taking a look at your family background, your family history.  As a context for later understanding your growth and development as a teenager and as a young adult and ultimately your entire career.  So we're going to start with your mother.  Would you give us your mother's name and where she was born and when she was born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Addie Shannon Lamb and she was born in Elizabeth City, North Carolina probably in the 1896 period of time.  Records weren't completely accurate at that time but as close she could ascertain that would be her birthday.  She was a housewife and perhaps in many ways a visionary because she was ahead of her time.  For instance, although I had two sisters and two brothers quite often the boys including myself would complain about having to wash our own clothes or wash dishes because we would call that girl's work.  My mother always insisted there is no girl's work, there's no boy's work just work and you are going to learn everything and I'm grateful because my wife couldn't cook at the time we married (laughter).
Speaker 1: Where did your mother grow up?
Speaker 2: She grew up in Elizabeth City or the outskirts of it on a farm.  Seventh grade was her educational background and then she subsequently married and of course became the mother of five children.
Speaker 1: Did she share with you stories of her growing up years in the Elizabeth City area and on the farm?  Did she talk about her childhood and teenage years to you?
Speaker 2: Yes she did frequently and her reference always was family history.  Image was important to her because although we were poor with a one-income family she felt that clean clothes, a change of clothes, a proper attire was important that you can be poor but yet still respected.  She insisted that we should not anything to demean the family name and so I grew up with that thinking.  Whatever decision I made I wanted to make absolutely certain that I did not denigrate or demean the family name.
Speaker 1: Any stories that you told you about her growing up, her memories that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: Yes one of them was quite interesting and we were shocked to hear it for the first time that my father [Thomas Lamb] had actually been her seventh grade teacher because at that time in our community you could be a teacher if you had graduated from high school.  So he became after high school her seventh grade teacher.  It is my understanding from her that the romance doesn't start until five years later.  I hope that was ca- was the case (laughter).
Story_ID: 313975
Speaker 1: How do you remember your mother [Addie Shannon Lamb]?  She passed at age eighty-nine, you told me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eighty-nine.
Speaker 1: How do you remember her, what was her personality like, what are your memories of your mother as a person?
Speaker 2: As a person her mannerism was somewhat reserved because at that time men were always the spokesperson for the family but really as matriarch of the family she was the glue that held us together.  We listened to her more often than dad [Thomas Lamb] because he was away teaching school and frequently his job required him to be away for a month at a time because he couldn't afford to spend the money on transportation.  So as a supervisor and provider of the family she was everything to us and really in many respects molded each of our characters.  Now admittedly although we were a close-knit family, all of the personalities of my siblings are different.  My younger brother [William "Duke" Lamb] was outgoing, jovial and carefree, my older brother was more reserved and felt someday that he would teach school and perhaps on a public school level and become a principal that was his ambition although he never quite made it.
Speaker 1: This is Harold?
Speaker 2: Harold
Speaker 1: But he did teach?
Speaker 2: But he did teach for many, many years and retired as a career school teacher.  My older sister--to look in the mirror she was an attractive young lady, had a cadre of friends and boy admirers.  She really didn't have a goal other than to look good most of the time.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Ruth and so it was for my mother to really guide her into a career.  So after high school she moved away to New York and married subsequently a few years later.  My younger sister even in high school knew she wanted to get married and have children and interestingly enough she was the mother of ten children.
Speaker 1: And her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Beulah.
Speaker 1: What year was Beulah born?
Speaker 2: Beulah was born in 1921.
Speaker 1: And Ruth who was a little older was born what year?
Speaker 2: 1916
Speaker 1: Okay thank you.
Speaker 2: Beulah interestingly enough since she wanted to get married and wanted to be a mother is the mother of ten children.  Now obviously we always said she was an excellent mother because she not only nurtured the ten children but she insisted that they all complete college and interestingly enough they all own their own homes.
Speaker 1: Are they all living now?
Speaker 2: All but one is living now.
Speaker 1: Wonderful
Speaker 2: And most of them in the Elizabeth City [North Carolina] area.  She's still alive and she's the convener of holidays and Christmas and Thanksgiving and almost weekly they have a get together.  They are sort of a self-contained entertainment group, large family.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your youngest brother.  You mentioned the oldest and you had one more brother.
Speaker 2: One more brother and he decided that he wanted to become a career schoolteacher but he became a vice principal and as vice principal in the issue of corporate punishment to one of the students.  One of the board members really felt that he had gone too far, stepped over the line and so he decided at that date to change his career profession.  He went into government service as United States postal clerk and remained throughout his working career.
Speaker 1: His name--did we get his name?
Speaker 2: His name was William Lamb commonly affectionately known as Duke (laughter).
Speaker 1: Duke, okay. And the year he was born?
Speaker 2: The year he was born was 1926.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 313976
Speaker 1: We're gonna come back and talk about your family and special times in your home so we'll come back to the family.  Let me stay with your mother's [Addie Shannon Lamb] history for a little bit.  Tell me about your mother's parents.  Did you know your maternal grandmother and her name and maternal grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yes I knew them well.  My maternal grandfather was John Shannon and he married Marge Boone Shannon was my grandmother.  My grandmother lived with us as an invalid for eight and a half years and so she had an early influence upon my life because although she was bedridden most of the eight years, she would always call us to the bed and talk to us and tell us that we should be good and should respect what my mother told us and that we shouldn't be noise--we shouldn't be as noisy as we were.  With five children in a small house it was difficult to be quiet.  She also insisted that because of the other automobile traffic and she was born in the year where they had the horse and buggies that we shouldn't play in the street.  So after the crops were harvested in back of our house we would go out in that field and play until the next planting or in our backyard.  She really had a tremendous influence on trying to mold character in us and not to be noisy, to speak correctly, to, not to yell from one room to another and she insisted we should learn the proper etiquettes at the table.  As you know if given our own choice we probably would have eaten with our fingers rather than a knife and fork (laughter) because it was more fun and we could throw things across the table at each other.  We were a fun loving family.  After the grace was stated where everyone had to repeat a bible verse at each meal and everyone had to be at the dinner table for the evening meal everyday unless you were sick or in the hospital or away on vacation but that was a ritual for us.  So after our bible verses then we could begin conversation and if someone didn't speak during the dinner my mother would say, "Gerald I haven't heard from you," because I was the quiet one, "Don't you have anything to contribute?" and usually I would very quickly of something that happened to me during the day and then she would say fine because I want everyone to learn to participate in these family discussions.  What she was doing I suspect was making extraverts out of us rather than introverts because she didn't want--she said she really didn't trust people who sat back and didn't speak.  She wanted to know what were you like and she could ascertain whether you were a good person or not if you--if she conversed with you.  So that was an interesting dimension for us early on.
Story_ID: 313977
Speaker 1: Did you by chance, or do you know anything about your maternal grandparents' parents, your greats? Did you--
Speaker 2: Yes my grandfather--maternal grandfather was a farmer active in the Baptist church.  He liked to go down to the country store and sit for hours, he could read so after--although he couldn't afford to read his paper he uses someone at the store would leave there and he would read it and then he engaged in conversation.  My maternal grandmother was quiet because she was mixed Cherokee and white--Caucasian race and I'm not certain whether it was her Native American heritage that made her quiet or whether she just felt out of place in the African American community or what.  So she would talk to us as individuals and talk to us as a family but on the outside said very little.
Speaker 1: You said that your maternal grandfather, John Shannon right?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: Was a farmer?
Speaker 2: Farmer
Speaker 1: What did he grow? Do you know--?
Speaker 2: A mixed crop usually vegetables, collard greens, potatoes, sweet potatoes and white, turnips because it was a source of food supply because he had no other income so he used this growth of the vegetables as a source of food supply.
Speaker 1: Did your grandparents the Shannons talk to you about their early life--their growing up at all their parentage?
Speaker 2: Very little, very little but I got to know my mother's six brothers because they lived to be significant ages and her one sister who really virtually wanted to adopt me when I was young, in fact I lived with my aunt for two years because we didn't have enough bed space in the small house we lived in and since she lived across the street she told my mother that I could come over and live in her extra bedroom.  My mother realized after two years that this was not right because I was living superior and better than my siblings.  So she insisted I should come back home and live as the others did.  My aunt remained very close to me over the years; in fact I remain very close to them although they've moved away to New York City [New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 313978
Speaker 1: Let's move to your father.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Would you give me his name and the year he was born and where he was born?
Speaker 2: My father, Thomas Lamb was born in 1896 in Elizabeth City, North Carolina.  He was the son of a farmer, Martin Lamb who owned 172 acres of land but only eighty of them were farmable because the others were wetlands.  He had tremendous influence over my life--personal life because he always insisted if you want to be respected you must own something, you must own (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are you talking about your father now?
Speaker 2: No my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Grandfather okay the farmer.
Speaker 2: We spent two weeks every summer on his farm harvesting crops and always sort of getting to know him.  He insisted that my brother and I when we grew up we had to own something because he said if you own something land or a home you get respect otherwise you don't get respect.  One of the most interesting stories that I ever heard was a neighbor came over to visit him and said, "Martin you always have a good crop. God is good to you, and how do you do it because I'm farming similar land and my crops just aren't as good.  Do you have some special technique?"  My grandfather said, "Yes my own personal farming technique." And he neighbor said, "God sure is good to you" and my grandfather said, "God is good to me for providing the health and strength to do the farming.  God, although he is the overseer of all that I have, I do the work. So with God's help I'm able to produce an excellent farm."  So as I thought about it over the years, I've always said yes there is a God and whatever we accomplish we do it with his help but we must be the one to do it.
Speaker 1: Your grandfather Martin, right? Martin Lamb?
Speaker 2: Martin, yes.
Speaker 1: How did he come to own 172 acres do you know?
Speaker 2: I'm told that initially he came from Virginia as a slave and ran away and since most of the land was swamp land that was the ideal place to live.  So after a while he went to the County Seat this is according to his story and said that he had been left this land and they recorded it in his name.  So we often question well did you pay money for it, he said, "Well I contributed money to the county government," so it was like a land grant or land gift to him and they were happy to have someone living on that land because half of it was swamp land.
Speaker 1: Was this within Elizabeth City boundaries or outside (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Outside of--
Speaker 1: Outside.
Speaker 2: --Elizabeth City boundaries, about six miles away.
Story_ID: 313979
Speaker 1: Tell me more about your father and then we'll also talk about his mother but tell me more about your father, Thomas--
Speaker 2: Lamb.
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Dad attempted to be a farmer and school teacher and fortunately he was a better teacher than he was a farmer so he lost his farm early on and we moved into the city during the depression [Great Depression].  Since teachers at that time in the segregated schools system served really at their whims of the superintendent of schools.  He was the sole authority in hiring and firing and so he changed jobs several times.  Sometimes as far away as eighty miles away and would only come home once a month.  As later in life he taught seventeen miles away and he was dedicated that it really impressed us because when his automobile wouldn't start, he would walk the seventeen miles to school to teach and walk back.  He did that more than once and we could tell he was tired when he came home but he was in excellent physical condition so if he had to go back the next day he would walk again the seventeen miles.  Start early in the morning--
Speaker 1: How early do you remember?
Speaker 2: Five o'clock in the morning
Speaker 1: And he would walk from your home in the Elizabeth City area and where was this school?
Speaker 2: It was called Newland, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Was it elementary or high school?
Speaker 2: It was elementary.
Speaker 1: What was his educational background that he was ready to teach and what was his schooling?
Speaker 2: His school was high school when he initially became a teacher.
Speaker 1: How was he educated to become a teacher?
Speaker 2: In the elementary schools and the county schools and some segregated schools and then in high school in Elizabeth City, North Carolina.  He taught for more twenty years as a high school graduate and with a growing family ultimately received his bachelor's degree from Elizabeth City State Teachers College [Elizabeth city State University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina] and would you believe it Bob he didn't received his master's [degree] until he was sixty-nine years of age from Columbia University [New York, New York].  I had the privilege of attending that graduation ceremony and it was wonderful to see dad smiling and could you believe it I also saw tears coming down from his eyes as he marched down that aisle.  I had never seen my father cry before so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So he started teaching following high school graduation.
Speaker 2: Following high school graduation.
Speaker 1: Then he went to Elizabeth City State College?
Speaker 2: State college part time over eight years to get his degree.
Speaker 1: Now in addition to being a teacher, did he move up in educational ranks?
Speaker 2: He became a principal of an elementary school, in fact several of them.  One in Manteo, North Carolina, one in New Bern, North Carolina and one in Newland, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: How do you remember your father, very briefly, his personality what was he like as a father and a person?
Speaker 2: Very strict disciplinarian and now that I have matured and as I reflect on the past, he had to be because he wasn't there all the time.  So he sort of set the standards and parameters on how we were to act.  Remember boys sometimes are full of mischief and three in the same household without a father for much of the month he had to set rules and guidelines on what we're supposed to do and how we were to do it.  My younger brother [William "Duke" Lamb], I guess because he was the youngest was more rebellious and I remember as he attempted to run away from home once he didn't realize my father was in excellent physical condition and he caught him less than a half block away from home.  He didn't do that again (laughter) because my brother knew he could not out distance my father.
Story_ID: 317458
Speaker 1: You talked about your paternal grandfather Martin [Martin Lamb] tell me about your paternal grandmother, your father's mother, what--her name and what you know about her year of birth and place of birth.
Speaker 2: Yes, my paternal grandmother I really didn't know, she died before I was born.  Her name was Charity Lamb; I don't know her maiden name because I really never knew her.  My grandfather was a large stocky man, and so I suspect she was probably large in size also, because all of my father's siblings appear to have the height but that's as much as I know about her, and I regret I didn't know her, because I think she has horrendous influence over my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Why do you say that?
Speaker 2: Well, because he was always kind to us and although he was busy he would answer our questions about the chickens and cows and the vegetables and why he had to plant seeds and how they grew and how much attention must be given to plants.  He gave my brother and I a significant amount of time during those two weeks during the summer.  He always thanked us for coming to see him; he didn't realize it was really a pleasure for us to be there.  He didn't discipline us as my father [Thomas Lamb] did because we were almost comrades or friends according to his estimation and his attention that he gave us.
Story_ID: 317459
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories of growing up in North Carolina in the Elizabeth City [North Carolina] area?  How far back can you remember as a child?
Speaker 2: Probably four years when we moved from the country into the city.  My father [Thomas Lamb] had purchased a house for nine hundred dollars, would you believe it, and it was a small house, and we were curious where we were going to sleep, because there were only two beds and we had five children and two adults in the house, but my mother [Addie Shannon Lamb] had said, "You will have a place to sleep, you will have a place to stay and this is our home.  It's not only my home, your dad's home, but it's your home, and we hope you forever remember it."  So I was impressed with the way she, a very modest home, began to hang pictures on the walls of those that she could find or claim from gifts from other people and although it was modest, we felt very good about it because we had street lights on the streets, when early on we had lived in the country and there were no street lights.
Story_ID: 317460
Speaker 1: --I was going to ask you to compare the country neighborhood and your country home particularly with the home in the city.  Let's go back to the home in the country. What was that like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the country. The home in the country had three bedrooms so we were more comfortable, but it was in an open field midway the twenty acres of land that my father [Thomas Lamb] attempted to farm, and so our nearest neighbor, although we liked to go over there because they had fruit trees in the yard and we were always welcomed to the fruit, they had no children.  So we had to go a long ways to find children to play with.  Since there were five of us we sort of learned to play with each other in our own style in games, a ball that was used by most of us or a rubber tire for a swing on a rope or something of that type.  An interesting childhood because we went to see our grandparents, maternal grandparents [Marge Boone Shannon and John Shannon] every weekend and we had dinner with them during my first four years of life.  If we stayed overnight we slept on the floor, because they too lived in a very modest house.  So recently a nephew of mine was married, and his wife had heard so much about me that she didn't want me to visit, and so he finally asked her why and she said, "Because we don't have an extra bedroom, we don't have any place for him to sleep."  He said, "My uncle will be just fine, he grew up sleeping on the floor, he'll sleep on the floor; I want him to come and see us."  So I came, I slept on the floor just to prove to her that I'm as human as she is.  If you can live in these modest surroundings, so can I.  That was a point that my mother [Addie Shannon Lamb] often stressed.  She didn't want us to get from whence we came, she wanted us to know everyone, and during the Depression [Great Depression], although we were poor we didn't realize that we were poor, because everyone was poor.  In fact, on the street that we lived on, six of the families were on welfare; we couldn't be, because dad had a job.
Speaker 1: This was in Elizabeth City [North Carolina] now?
Speaker 2: Elizabeth City.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 317461
Speaker 1: Going back to your father's [Thomas Lamb] early farming years outside the city [Elizabeth City, North Carolina]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the twenty acres that you said he had was that part of [paternal] your grandfather's [Martin Lamb] acreage?
Speaker 2: No, that was separate.  As a school teacher, he had purchased that on his own because remember his father believed you have to own something to be respected.  So he didn't think that dad or his brothers, his siblings would have respect unless they owned land and so he insisted they all own land and homes.
Speaker 1: So he was farming and teaching at the same time.
Speaker 2: The same time which meant that he couldn't be there the appropriate time to farm anyway.  He couldn't give it the attention that it really needed and deserved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I understand.
Story_ID: 317462
Speaker 1: Okay we're now in Elizabeth City [North Carolina], you're four years old, you're in a new home in the city, and you had street lights tell me more about that neighborhood and your neighbors.  And how do you remember that neighborhood?  Early neighborhood.
Speaker 2: The neighborhood was interesting because when we moved in there were three white families and four blacks and we could play together but we couldn't go to school together, or to church or any of those things.  All of us were poor; the three whites were on welfare, three blacks were on welfare; we were not.  My mother [Addie Shannon Lamb] during that time had an interesting concept, because in the food basket and chains that the government were issuing to people on welfare at that time, the black families who came home with just potatoes and cabbages and greens and other vegetables; there was no meat, turkey or ham, or any meat.  She would buy vegetables from them with cash, so they would have money to buy meat.  So it was a really happy community in that respect: we shared everything.  They had authority over us to beat us if we did something wrong, the families living in the neighborhood.  Although all of us didn't turn out all right, because one boy in the neighborhood ended up with life in prison for murder, most of the children were okay.  They became adults, married, either moved away because there is no one other than my great nephew living in the neighborhood now, who bought our old homestead from my sister demolished it and built a new house, because it was waterfront property.  We didn't realize how valuable waterfront property was.  We grew up 150 feet from the river, and it was an interesting life.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the river?
Speaker 2: Pasquotank River.
Speaker 1: Pasquotank River.
Speaker 2: That was the name of the county [Pasquotank County, North Carolina]. And since we couldn't swim, because swimming wasn't required in high schools at that time, so we could sit on the banks of the river and fish or crab but didn't go out in boats at all.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 317463
Speaker 1: How did your parents [Addie Shannon Lamb and Thomas Lamb], if they did, explain the segregated schools situation?  You played with white children, but you weren't allowed to go to school with them.  How was that explained to you; how did you understand that at that young age?
Speaker 2: Well, let me give you two perspectives.  Both my mother's side, because she did the initial explanation of saying that the schools are separate, you can play with them, but you must play outside of the household; she didn't want to us to go inside particularly since there was male and female children in the neighborhood, and she didn't want, at least the three sons to be in the household with white females.  She explained it this way, that, "We know that this is the way it is, but remember, we have our own teachers, and they love you, they care for you, and they're going to teach you all that you need to know to get along in life.  So it will be a benefit to go to a school where people love you," and believe it or not that became a fact.  Early on, we knew that our teachers--since we knew them, my parents were friends of theirs--that they really cared about us and would insist that we should learn.  My father took a different perspective.  Since there was a state teachers school [Elizabeth City State Teachers College; Elizabeth City State University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina], historically black college [HBCU] in town, he would whisper this always, "I know that whites control and own everything, but we're smarter."  Now, we interpret that as growing up as that we actually are smarter.  I thought genetically we were smarter but that isn't what he meant.  What it meant was there are more blacks or African Americans attending college in this community of five thousand than there are whites, because they have to travel seventy miles away to get an education and most of them are too poor to travel that seventy miles.  So there were more African Americans with bachelor's degrees than there were whites.  So later on, when I questioned my father, he said, "Oh, I don't mean that we're smarter because we're black, we're smarter because we have more degrees.  They control everything; they own everything, we work for them." For instance the bank president, all of the bank presidents in that town, three community banks were high school graduates.  My brothers were college graduates but they couldn't get a job as a teller.  It's an interesting (laughter) dimension of life at that time.
Story_ID: 317464
Speaker 1: Now, since I grew up thinking that we were smarter, I assumed that we could achieve and therefore, although dad [Thomas Lamb] didn't have the finances to send us to college when the war came, World War II [WWII], I enlisted in the United States Coast Guard with the understanding I would save my money and go to college, and I knew at that time I wanted to be a pharmacist, because I'd traveled to Norfolk, Virginia as a young person and a pharmacist, an African American, was wearing a white coat and everyone called him doctor, so I assumed that he must be smart.  So my intention was to become a pharmacist.  I didn't do that, but life has many changes and as you know most careers change anyway once you graduate from college.
Speaker 2: How did you happen to go to Norfolk?  You say you went to Norfolk and you saw this gentleman.
Speaker 1: Well, my mother [Addie Shannon Lamb] and--my father had this sister who through marriage ended up owning a drugstore in the black neighborhood, and although she wasn't a pharmacist, she could be the (unclear), she had to hire pharmacists to work for her.  It was there that I saw this African American in this white jacket and people were ad- called him doctor, Dr. James [ph.].
Story_ID: 317465
Speaker 1: You talked about almost weekly visits to your [maternal] grandparents' [Marge Boone Shannon and John Shannon] home but what were the special holidays, special events within your home with your parents and your brothers [Harold Lamb and William "Duke" Lamb] and sisters [Ruth Lamb and Beulah Lamb]?  What were the days of the year that you remember especially sharing with them?
Speaker 2: The days of the year that were special were really--they're multifaceted in this respect, Thanksgiving and Christmas obviously, but everyone's birthday became a special occasion, and that birthday had to be celebrated usually on that Sunday nearest to your birthday.  Well, we knew would have an above average dinner.  Dinnertime on Sundays was 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon every Sunday in between church service [at Union Chapel Missionary Baptist Church, Elizabeth City, North Carolina], because quite frequently mother [Addie Shannon Lamb] and dad [Thomas Lamb] would go back to church at five o'clock for evening service.
Speaker 1: Tell me about those special birthday dinners what was served that was different?
Speaker 2: The difference was the individual whose birthday it was had an opportunity to select the meal, to determine what you were going to cook, providing we could afford it.  For instance, we never had lobster and of course my mother didn't like lamb, so no one ever selected lamb, although she was married to a man, Thomas Lamb (laughter).  She frequently said as a joke she had as much lamb as she ever wanted in her life, therefore she didn't like it, and I think personally she just didn't like it.
Speaker 1: What was your choice for dinner on your birthday; do you remember what you--?
Speaker 2: Fish, usually, because we couldn't afford lobster or shrimp, so usually dad would buy fish, and since it was his favorite he often smiled at my birthday, because he knew we were going to have fish even on Sunday and usually in our community you didn't have fish on Sundays; if you had anything else, chicken was the favorite on Sundays.

Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of your growing up in Elizabeth City [North Carolina]? What sights, sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: The sights would be rivers and lakes, because we lived so close to the river [Pasquotank River], and so whenever I pass a river or lake I look at it for a long period of time.  The surroundings, whether the surroundings are park lands or whether they are dirt roads, and the reason that my mother [Addie Shannon Lamb] insisted that we had to live on a paved road when we moved to Elizabeth City, because the people who lived on dirt roads were considered poor, and although we were poor, she didn't want to be perceived as being poor, because my father [Thomas Lamb] had a job.  But rivers are the most scenic and as you look around my home, most of these pictures are waterfront--rivers and (unclear) cliffs which is adjacent to the sound, so I've always been fascinated by that.  The reason for joining the [U.S.] Coast Guard because we have a small African American Coast Guard station [Pea Island Lifesaving Station], all African Americans. The Collins family--and I don't remember his first name [Herbert Collins]--was chief of that rescue, because it was in the Outer Banks [North Carolina] that rescue station, and therefore when I joined the Coast Guard, I joined it because of that reason, because they had--wore uniforms, and they were respected because they were the saviors for those people who went fishing and were boat capsized and so forth.  Again that was always near the water, and I had the chance to revisit Manteo [North Carolina] where my father had been principal of the elementary school there several years ago.  I was fascinated by this surrounding, the water, and saw the old Coast Guard station there manned by African Americans.  That was the only one in the nation ever that was manned completely by African Americans.
Speaker 1: Any sounds or smells that you remember particularly related to your daily life?
Speaker 2: We've always been fascinated by music, because my father purchased a piano for my oldest sister [Ruth Lamb], and although she never learned to be a professional pianist, she did play quite often, and I was always fascinated by that sound of music, and even today I will turn the stereo on while I'm reading, because my chair is adjacent to the stereo, and I turn it on softly and read at the same time.  Smells, I like the smell of seafood and baked bread.  My chief friend who served with me in the [U.S.] Navy was at Cape Verdan, and he was the baker on the ship, and he knew how from Truro, Massachusetts, he really was an excellent baker.  So as a young man I learned to appreciate the smell of baked bread not so much the sweets or appetizers because we were not a sweet or appetized type family.  My mother believed in the basics, you had to have your vegetables or you couldn't have meat (laughter), that was a must in our family, and she always insisted we should have two vegetables for a balanced meal.  If you have a potato then you must have collard greens or spinach or something, or peas.
Story_ID: 317467
Speaker 1: What other memories do you have about growing up as a youngster? Any other memories you wanted to share with us that we haven't touched upon?
Speaker 2: The neighborhood [in Elizabeth City, North Carolina] was, as I said was convenient, we could walk to town because dad [Thomas Lamb] always took the car with him, and there was no public transportation.  So, with a six mile radius, you could reach almost every destination in town.  So it was always interesting to walk around and to see the sights.  The chief of police as we grew up lived two blocks away, and I remember, as we were growing up, we learned how to pitch pennies.  The closest one to the wall would win all of the pennies, and we didn't realize but the chief of police, Chief Mandarin [ph.] has seen us pitching pennies.  So he didn't arrest us, he stopped by my father's house and said, "Tom, I think your boys are associating with the wrong people.  I didn't say anything to them because I thought that you would know best how to handle this, but they were pitching pennies behind that old burned out factory, and I don't think this is good for them to learn gambling at such an early age." And dad said, "Well, chief, I appreciate your telling me; I don't think it's going to happen again.  You can be assured that I will take care of this situation." And he did (laughter).  Corporal punishment was the issue of the day, because although he's a teacher, he was a strict disciplinarian, because morality and morals were a strong point in our family: you didn't steal; you didn't lie.
Story_ID: 317468
Speaker 1: My mother [Addie Shannon Lamb] always asked you three times whether you were telling the truth and quite frequently my younger brother [William "Duke" Lamb] would on the third time say, "Well, that wasn't exactly true, mom, but it was almost true."  But I always told the truth, because I was the quiet, timid one, in fact although I'm outgoing now and meet people easily, I was almost introverted until I reached the fourth grade and could in many sense been a slow learner, but I met an interesting individual in my sixth grade in school who had tremendous influence over me. [HistoryMaker] George Haley, the brother of Alex Haley became a classmate, and we began to vie as to who could get the most A's on our report card, and we remain friends to this day.  His parents [Bertha Palmer Haley and Simon Haley] would allow him to come to our house and play, and since they lived on the college campus [at Elizabeth City State Teachers College; Elizabeth City State University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina], his mother and father both were faculty members of the college and we could go on campus to visit him.  Prior to that my grades were average but not good, but once George Haley and I became friends, and we began to vie on who could get the most A's on our report cards, I became an excellent student.
Story_ID: 317469
Speaker 1: Before we move into your elementary school experience and high school [P.W. Moore High School, Elizabeth City, North Carolina] tell me about church life with your parents [Addie Shannon Lamb and Thomas Lamb] and your brothers [Harold Lamb and William "Duke" Lamb] and sisters [Ruth Lamb and Beulah Lamb].  What church did you attend and how were you involved in church and your family?  Was that a significant part of your growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes it was indeed.  Early on, we were a church-oriented family.  My grandfather [Martin Lamb] was a strong member of that church, one of the organizers of the church, paternal grandfather.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Union Chapel Baptist Church [Union Chapel Missionary Baptist Church, Elizabeth City, North Carolina] and my maternal grandfather [John Shannon] was a strong member of that same church and one of the original founders.  My father was clerk of that church, or secretary as they would call it now, for forty years.  So, it was a must that we go to church every Sunday and quite frequently have lunch prepared, so that we could remain for the second service.  We were baptized in a river, Pasquotank River.  We had to wade out up to your waist to be fully doused below service--surface to be fully baptized, and since his brothers, six of them, became Baptist preachers, it was always a part of our history and life to be religious and to attend church.  My younger brother [William "Duke" Lamb] said that once he became an adult, he was never going to attend church again, he did but he said that we had enough church to last us for a lifetime.  I never took that position although I stayed away from church for a long period of time, and actually until my wife [Verna Grier Lamb] and I married, and we had our daughter [Genero Lamb], because we felt that we should have some church affiliation for her sake, since it was a part of my history and a part of hers.  Now, she had become a Presbyterian in Georgia and there were a few or no Presbyterian churches in Connecticut, and I'm not certain there are any Presbyterian churches there now.  We had to decide what church affiliation we were going to have.  I was Baptist, and she said they're all right but let's wait and see and we'll visit.  So, we visited Baptist churches and a close friend that I'd worked with on integrated housing in the city, Waterbury [Connecticut] because we were still a segregated community even in Connecticut--Waterbury, Connecticut.  So, I was part of a development for developing integrated housing.  This young man an Episcopalian said, "You know, Maudy [ph.] and I, my wife and I would like you and your wife and daughter to come to church with us because we have two daughters and we like it. Why can't you attend church with us?"
Story_ID: 315062
Speaker 1: Mr. Lamb [HistoryMaker Gerald Lamb], you were telling me how you were introduced to the Episcopal church.
Speaker 2: Oh yes. Friends of our who were working on integrated housing construction in this city, Waterbury [Connecticut], and who lived not too far away stopped by the afternoon one afternoon, white couple, Marty and Reese Smith [ph.] and they suggested that they would like us to attend church with them some time because "We like you and you appear to like us and we spend time together and we're doing some interesting things at church and we'd like you to attend."  So I looked at my wife [Verna Grier Lamb] and she said, "Why not?"  So, we attended service, and after service during the coffee hour, we learned that the young couples there were interested in the same things we were: an integrated society, a better society.  They had changed from a manufacturing town to a more intelligent community, and they made us feel so welcomed.  In fact, they had an outreach program to recruit minorities, because they wanted the church to reflect the community, and so since they were involved in the same things that we were involved in and wanted to improve the community and move from a blue collar or factory oriented town, we decided that we liked the atmosphere.  Once I was in the Episcopal church and became a member of the governing board of that particular church, St. John's [St. John's Episcopal Church, Waterbury, Connecticut] in Waterbury, Connecticut.  Later subsequently in my life, as state treasurer of the State of Connecticut, the bishop of Connecticut felt that I should be a representative at the general four year convention of the Episcopal church because he felt that I would have something to offer.  That was a delightful experience because we were in the beginning of the Episcopal church looking up on the idea of ordaining women as priests and although it required sixteen years to accomplish that.  Obviously I was in the forefront of that because my philosophy has always been that we should have an equal society. Male and female, black, white, Hispanic, Jews, Christians, whatever. That this should be equal.  So obviously after the first convention I attended the second convention four years later and became recognized and I was elected to the church pension board handling all of the retirement funds of the Episcopal priests and staff people.  And ultimately spent six years on the executive council, the management group of the entire Episcopal church in this country.  So it was an interesting experience and life for me and I got to know the regional differences and I recognized as you must recognize that although it was one Episcopal church the Southern Episcopal members did not have the same philosophy as the northern sector of the Episcopal church or the western sector.  So we've always--the conventions were very diverse, controversial but refreshing to know that we could meet as a group and agree to disagree and come back four years later and rehash the same topic and eventually right in my opinion did prevail with the required time.  The church moves very slowly, very slowly and so I found that frustrating at times because as my daughter [Genero Lamb] can tell you I'm an action oriented and to some degree I've never understood the females because they like to talk about things when I'm an action person and I frequently say to my daughter, "Yes I've heard you talk about it, when are you going to it?"  But that's a part of her culture and her mother's culture was the same way.  Now that stops you from making a number of mistakes if you do things spontaneously.  My wife and I sort of balance each other in that respect because I can walk into a store--men's store and buy four suits in twenty minutes, she couldn't it would take her twenty minutes just to enter the door and browse in that first section.  But--so in that respect it was good.
Story_ID: 315063
Speaker 1: We'll come back to church in your later life and so on after we get you here on the island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] even.  Let me go back to Elizabeth City [North Carolina] and let me ask you about the beginning of your formal education.  How old were you when you started school?  What school did you initially attend?  Tell me about those elementary school years.
Speaker 2: Yes that's a very interesting era.  We didn't have in a segregated school system a kindergarten, we started out in first grade and this particular school was a teacher training school built across the street from the teacher college--teacher training college [Elizabeth City State Teachers College; Elizabeth City State University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina].  Very interesting, all black faculty and the student body of the college across the street were all black.  My mother [Addie Shannon Lamb] had trained us early on that it was a good school because it teaches care.  They were all black and we knew them as--since my dad [Thomas Lamb] was in that field of education and therefore early on as adults we respected them naturally.  So even in the first grade--my first grade teacher had horrendous impact on me. Her knowledge, in fact, when she would walk in the room with grace and poise and culture that you didn't see in young people, I was impressed. And throughout my elementary school each of those teachers left an imprint or mark on my life for a number of reasons.  They were all different but they all seemed to have that commonality of caring and insisting that we do well. And I can remember in the fourth grade one day I didn't do my homework and my fourth grade teacher said, "For this time since it's your first, I want you to take this note home to your mother." And I knew my mother would learn that she had given me a note because they knew each other.  So the next day she said, "What did your mother say?"  "She said she would talk to you but she told me this will never happen again in our family.  Everyone must do their homework and so we will forever do that."  There was an interesting dimension to my elementary school since it was across the street from the teacher training school, early on we were able to see and hear historical figures in our life.  For instance, at ten years of age I saw and heard and met A.G. Gaston the wealthiest black in the United States at that time.  Etta Moten [HistoryMaker Etta Moten Barnett] who gave a supreme sense, a superb demonstration of poetry for us.  The most outstanding one was her not only her delivery as a poet but her very action and poise and I'll forever remember it.  The poem was called 'Jump Back Honey Jump Back' [sic. 'A Negro Love Song,' Paul Laurence Dunbar] and each of the renowned African American figures who would visit that college the college president would insist that some students come over to hear them to sit in the audience.  The teachers usually assigned those children who had good grades so since my grades were good I was almost invariably included in the group.  The auditorium or gym could usually accommodate a hundred of us but it was seven grades that had to be divided between the seven grades.  But since I was always included early on I knew that we could achieve if we wanted to and although we couldn't become a bank president which I knew we couldn't at that time in a segregated society that whatever we wanted to pursue we should pursue it because some day my mother always said tomorrow will be better.  Even as a bank president I remember recalling her saying, the banker president's name was Eyelet--Mr. Eyelet [ph.], she said, "Someday you may be even a bank president," and I hadn't even thought about banking at all.  We were cutting Mr. Eyelet's grass and my mother picked this up that's why I knew about banking because obviously a bank president although as a high school graduate couldn't cut his own grass; he had too much prestige (laughter).  So we did it for him for would you believe it thirty-five cents.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Story_ID: 315064
Speaker 1: So that was one of my early training and all of the teachers insisted that if you want to get ahead in life you have to be educated.  Beginning in the fifth grade, Mrs. Jenkins [ph.], she said she didn't allow us to use any of this; we were called colored at that time, any of the slang words in her class.  She insisted that we should learn English, the proper English and what she would do was put her finger up in front of her mouth if you use a slang word and we knew the signal was to go back and repeat the sentence because slang words weren't permitted or colored expressions of any type.  So early on I knew that I had to learn proper or appropriate English and that has helped particularly as I entered government and politics where early on I did my own speech writing and had to make my own speeches, it was important to use appropriate English particularly when you are putting it on paper.  So that early training and guidance of insisting that we should learn appropriate English served me well over the years.  Some of the interesting things about it, my brother who was at that college [Elizabeth City State Teachers College; Elizabeth City State University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina] as a student had difficulty getting an assignment over there as a training teacher because he had siblings in class and they wouldn't allow him to teach his siblings.  I assume that they didn't want him to teach his siblings because they thought he may inflate our grades, I'm assuming that's the reason 'cause I couldn't think of any other reason he couldn't be my--couldn't practice teaching my grade.  So my brother was in the third grade, I was in the fifth, my sister was in the seventh so he had to be excluded from those grades and then when they learned that I have first cousins in two of the other grades they said that he shouldn't teach them either.  But they finally located him--he did his practice work in the sixth grade sandwiched in between us (laughter).
Story_ID: 315065
Speaker 1: The most influential persons in elementary school, was it a friend or teacher or--?
Speaker 2: The influential people really were both teachers and students.  There was a camaraderie, we teased each of course if you had a failing grade which was probably not the humane thing to do but we did tease so that everyone aspired to improve their grades.  Teachers care and since they knew my mother [Addie Shannon Lamb] and father [Thomas Lamb] we knew that they would hold conversations with them other than parents visiting schools.  My parents always insisted on visiting the school and participating in parent/teachers association at least my mother because since dad was away.  But the teachers really insisted and we knew they were going to have conversations with my parent that we should perform well.  And so as a result of that, all of us were inclined to make better grades than most students.  My older brother [Harold Lamb] was valedictorian and I don't recall whether--I know I was in the top three members of our graduating class and I'm not certain who the valedictorian was.  But those were interesting years, interesting dimension because we were always invited over to the college [Elizabeth City State Teachers College; Elizabeth City State University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina] and the college professor, Dr. Byes [ph.] had children of his own who were friends of my siblings--my older siblings and so to know the college professor and be able to meet him and for him to stop and chat with us was an important dimension in my life although I was shy.  My younger brother [William "Duke" Lamb] would always stop and introduce him and talk to him and then he would insist that I share in the conversation in some way.  So he was a tremendous influence in that respect.
Story_ID: 315066
Speaker 1: You said that your elementary school took you through grade seven.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you have a middle school or junior high experience, or did you go right into high school at that point?
Speaker 2: Right into high school at that period of time.  It was called P.W. Moore High School [Elizabeth City, North Carolina], segregated of course.
Speaker 1: Was it affiliated with the university or not--the college [Elizabeth City State Teachers College; Elizabeth City State University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No. No, public school system.  I was always told that they were paid less than the white high school teachers in comparable school districts but none the less the principal of the school, Dr. Anderson [ph.] was a friend of my father's [Thomas Lamb].  Throughout my life I didn't have just my parents' guidance but friends of my parents because they were their friends as school teachers.  The high schools insisted that all of the boys should learn trades so we had a carpenter's shop, we had to study agriculture since we lived in North Carolina and would you believe that I won a statewide contest on judging farm produce although I never lived on a farm.  But my [paternal] grandfather [Martin Lamb] would show and identify the good products, potatoes or collard greens, corn so I learned from him how to identify.  My high school agriculture project was to raise a pig or hog from birth and I did successfully from birth to four hundred pounds.  We over fed and so I received a B for that because we over fed the pig (laughter).  You're only supposed to feed them once a day and we fed them twice a day because we loved visiting the pig my brother and I.  But none the less that taught me a lesson because if the pig is too fat then there is not enough lean, the pork is all fat.
Speaker 1: Was the pig residing in the high school area or was the pig out in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had to walk to the pig out in the suburbs which was very--not too far away, it was walking distance.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the subjects that you studied, academic subjects of the high school.
Speaker 2: Well they were similar to the whites.  The problem was we didn't have the labs--research labs, we had to share books because there were never enough books throughout elementary and high school.  So that once a week, for instance, I could bring home a biology book or a chemistry book or an algebra book.  We had to rotate them throughout this class and so all of that was cumbersome.  We really had to concentrate and my mother [Addie Shannon Lamb] permitted us to spend more time in that subject matter when we had the book because we knew it may not be available until the next week (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I see.
Story_ID: 315067
Speaker 1: So you were in high school [P.W. Moore High School, Elizabeth City, North Carolina], let's see, we're talking about late '30s [1930s]. Born in '24 [1924], six--
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1942.
Speaker 1: From the high school?
Speaker 2: From high school.
Speaker 1: Okay who were the influential people at the high school any particular teachers or students that were particularly influential in your--
Speaker 2: Yes Mrs. Suggs [ph.], she again was a history, literature and English teacher and she insisted that we should learn real English she called it, real English.  None of the things you picked up, the bad language you picked up over the years, none of the stories that we had to write and she insisted that we write stories--learn how to write stories because she said it forced you to dream a little.  What do you want to be in life?  If you were a sea captain how would you treat your crew?  If you were a farmer how would you schedule your planting season?  She was always asking us to write essays.
Speaker 1: Very practical kinds of things.
Speaker 2: Very practical kind of thing and she also was aware that the things you see or do you maintain them much longer than the things that you hear and so she would rather--she said, "Today I'm going to spend ten minutes to introduce you to a subject and I want you to write about it," and then she would review the material and the next day come back and say, "Now let's discuss them, let's talk about them."  So everyone would have to stand in front of the class and make a presentation and really the questions came from her and from the students--fellow students and they were interesting sometimes because at times you had the dilemma, you were perplexed; you're not certain why you included that.  Her idea was always you must be creative in life; you must be creative to understand and to overcome obstacles in life because unless you're creative, you probably will not be successful.
Story_ID: 315068
Speaker 1: And the interesting thing about that even in my adult life and senior banking career I became--since I had become creative early in life through her influence I was a problem solver in Connecticut Bank and Trust [Connecticut Bank and Trust Company].  If there were a problem with customers, employees, a major customer I was always called upon to solve the problem.  That wasn't my legitimate duties or identified duties but the chairman always insisted or called me to solve the problem. And we--because I had a multifaceted cultural background for instance, one of the things that we were going to be boycotted by a Hispanic family once or the Hispanic families in Hartford, Connecticut because one of our branch managers had a Hispanic woman, welfare recipient arrested because she had come into the bank and insisted that he should cash her check with no identification and he didn't know her.  Since she was being rude and he was of Hispanic culture, she was an embarrassment to him.  So he knee jerked without calling me because I was the regional supervisor and he called the police.  Well the Hispanic community was incensed.  This poor woman on welfare was arrested and they blamed the bank.  So the chairman received the letter and he called me in to solve the problem.  I said to Walter [ph.], "Yes I'll take care of it." And he said, "Just like that? How are you going to take care of it?"  I said, "Oh Walter you have never asked me for details before but I'll give them to you.  The first place is wind chill factor four below zero in Hartford, Connecticut; we're not going to have five hundred Hispanics parading in front of the bank or demonstrating in this kind of chill factor weather.  We will probably have six to ten and my plan is to invite them in for coffee and donuts and talk about this situation.  In the meantime I will call the chief of police and tell him that we're not going to press charges and to drop any charges that he's considered that should resolve the problem."  So he smiled and he said, "How did you know this?"  I said, "I know the culture, they are from Puerto Rico and Mexico accustomed to warm climates.  You are not going to have five hundred Hispanics parading in fifteen--ten to fifteen below zero weather, it just won't happen."  I said, "Any more than if it's raining you won't have African Americans demonstrating in front of the bank, it's part of our culture, we will not demonstrate in the rain."  So after that I guess he assumed that since I was multifaceted in experiences, I became his confidante and consultant on how they handle disgruntled board members and that type of thing.  For instance Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], in the early years I could come to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] on Thursdays because we have a board member Robert Willis [Robert Willis, Jr.] who lived in the east shop [ph.] and he insisted since he was chairman of the audit committee very strong, strict disciplinarian and outspoken board member that he should have his written material for the board members early so he could review them.  As a result, I had to bring his material to him so I always had a long weekend on board members and they met every month because I would bring his material, he would look at it, thank me and said, "I hope you have a nice weekend," and so it was like an unwritten rule that he was going to see me for a long weekend once a month.
Story_ID: 315069
Speaker 1: That early training of being original, creative and to really analyze the situation for instance my chemistry teacher, Mr. Harris [ph.] always insisted if you're going to arrive with the right chemical formula, you must first analyze what you're dealing with. All of the elements because if you mix the wrong chemical, you can have an explosion.  So before you conclude and determine what you're going to do, you're going to analyze completely.  So I began to even today analyze everything until I have all of the facts worthy of making a decision.  At that point I can make a decision because I've analyzed it properly.  I've ascertained all the facts I needed and as a bank lending officer it really stood me well to analyze this situation.  For instance there were customers that I really made character loans because on a sheet of paper financially they may not look as if they could repay their loan but with the strong character features I said, "Well I think I can take a risk here." Because unless you take some risks you don't make any money in banks because it's easy to say no.  I taught all of my officers who were lending officers at that time under my jurisdiction to be creative.  The thinking was, let's find out how we can make this loan rather than to say no and reject it.  Maybe you need an endorsement, a signature, maybe you'll need a collateral on the house or you need to reach an agreement contract firm that you can deduct from the pay if you must in the future that way you don't refuse the loan.
Story_ID: 317470
Speaker 1: Mr. Lamb [HistoryMaker Gerald Lamb], as you move through high school [P.W. Moore High School, Elizabeth City, North Carolina] and were about to graduate, do you have any thoughts or ideas about what you wanted to be, what you wanted to do following high school, did you have dreams or aspirations?
Speaker 2: Yes, early on I had visited my [paternal] aunt who lived in Norfolk, Virginia, who inherited a drugstore from her husband and she had employed a pharmacist and since everyone addressed him as Dr. James [ph.] I said that would be an interesting career to work in a drugstore as a pharmacist but the war [World War II, WWII] came and dad [Thomas Lamb] had indicated he didn't have enough money to send me to college at that time so I suggested that well, maybe I would after high school join the United States Coast Guard and save enough money to go to college afterwards.  Of course the thinking was that since I didn't want to be a teacher and I wouldn't attend a local college that I would stay in New York [New York] or Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] so I could attend a larger university and become a pharmacist.  My idea was to attend Columbia University [New York, New York] but in 1946 when all of the G.I.s and veterans were returning back to the college campus there was an oversupply of applicants at that time and although I had finished in the top three in my class it was in a segregated school system.  So Columbia did not accept my application but in the interim I decided to enroll in a technical school anyway so that I wouldn't become stale and rusty as a student.  But since I left high school to join the Coast Guard that was an interesting career and early on the regional recruiting office was in Norfolk, Virginia again just an hour away from my home [in Elizabeth City, North Carolina] and I was able to enlist at that time--wartime as an apprentice seamen.  Historically blacks were only allowed to be cooks or what they called mess attendants or servers for their officers in the [U.S.] Navy but you had to be a part of the food services.  When I arrived for induction into the United States Coast Guard in Curtis Bay, Maryland or Baltimore, Maryland the chief on duty said that I was going to be assigned to the cooking school.  I told them I didn't want to be a cook.  He said, "In the Navy you don't decide what you want to do, we decide for you and you're going to be a cook."  Well I was very surprised and disgusted and really wished I hadn't joined the United States Coast Guard but the next day I sat down and wrote the president of the United States a letter, President Franklin Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] a letter telling him that I joined as an apprentice seamen and wanted to be an apprentice seamen and didn't want to be a cook.  I never received a response from the letter but two weeks later I received orders of command to go to Aberdeen, Maryland to become a chemical warfare specialist, a three month training course. And so, I assumed that my reason was the letter that I sent although no one ever told me that because the president didn't respond and I'm not certain whether I expected the president to respond but I wanted someone to know I was angry and disappointed.  Well after three months of training as a chemical warfare specialist I was sent to Alameda, California training station to train recruits on how to take care of themselves in the event that chemical were used against us in war time.  I taught for two years in Alameda, California new recruits including such movie stars as Cesar Romero, Gig Young and several lesser known movie stars, but it was an interesting experience for me.

Speaker 1: So I had a chance to attend, since I was fascinated with English, a semester at University of California in Berkeley [University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California] which was just a few miles away freshman English or literature.  Then the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and its good work were curious why all of the non-cooks who happen to be African Americans were never sent to sea, we were on land base.  So Walter White, president of the NAACP insisted that we should be given that same privilege as white to go to sea as the white non-cooks were.  They assembled 130 of us in New Orleans [Louisiana].  Various ranks, I was a first class seamen at that time and others were radio men, electricians, engineers, crewmen, communications specialists and they didn't know what to do with us or at least know when indicated what to do with us.  So we spent five months there but I learned that their plan was to disseminate us aboard ship, no more than three of us on any given ship but at least two so that we would have a companion.  So Taylor Red [ph.] from New Jersey was assigned to my ship and we became close friends.  So the captain and the executive officer strategically placed us that same shift to go offshore at the same time and to return at the same time.  I didn't understand why but I do now because during my career on this ship on the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific quite frequently I was threatened that I was going to be thrown overboard by the whites.  Remember we were still in segregation at that time and they were serious about it at least I deemed them to be very serious so that when I left the ship, Taylor Red always left and there was an envy because as the instructor for chemical warfare training, I didn't have to stand duty at night on the ship and look for obstacles or doing any of those chores.  My job was to keep the equipment handy, prepared and ready and to perform classes on the six destroyer escorts in our flotilla.  So I didn't have to do the deck work and all of those things as a first class petty officer and so I'll admit there was some envy because even the chief boatswain's mate insisted that I should be given some additional duties but the captain said no.  I think the captain said no because he was from Brooklyn, New York and more attuned to the idea of where the direction we were headed on integration.  But it was an interesting time.
Story_ID: 317472
Speaker 1: I spent most of the time on destroyer escort duty escorting ships to Europe, (unclear) and Londonderry Ireland, Glasgow [Scotland] other English seaports.  The troop ships obviously had to be protected because a German U-boat, a sub with it and there was sometimes five thousand people--troops on a single ship, one of them carried ten thousand and quite frequently we were the flagship so we would have to do advanced duty where you travel out there alone.  You were really sitting ducks if a sub wanted to bomb just our destroyers or the Germans were smart enough not to do that that would alert them they were in the area.  They want to get the big one, the ship with five thousand or ten thousand troops so they didn't bother us.  After the war in Europe ended we were assigned to South Pacific, very interesting duty.  What the [U.S.] Navy called search and seizure duty to search the South Pacific Island to Gilberts [Gilbert Islands] Caroline [Caroline Islands] and other South Pacific islands for stranded or deserted American soldiers who might be there.  The interesting part about it that there were some stranded Japanese there who didn't know the war [World War II, WWII] was over.  So quite frequently we were targets and shot at by Japanese soldiers and we had to respond to see if there were Americans captured or living there and we did find some unusual persons.  For instance we located a white female who we assumed was Amelia Earhart who had gone down in the Pacific as a flyer.  They later ascertained that it wasn't and the confirmed it with tests later in life particularly that now we have the techniques for determining your DNA.  It was not her but this white female was absolutely berserk, mental, a cannibal.  Defied us we had to capture her and hold her down to bring her aboard ship to rescue her because she was deranged because she had lived on this island alone, providing for herself eating berries or raw leaves or other tropical fruits.  By this time I was assigned duties as an assistant corps man pharmacist because we only had one and he was shot and they knew he had to have a backup and although I knew nothing--no medical training at least he was there to advise of what we should do if we had any accidents or any people that were shot and we did.  Several, I don't know maybe a half a dozen or more seals were shot during this search and seizure unit, very interesting time.
Story_ID: 317473
Speaker 1: So you left the [U.S.] Coast Guard what, 1946?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-six [1946].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what came next in your life?
Speaker 2: Well, not wanting to be a school teacher so I didn't return to Elizabeth City [North Carolina].  I went to New York [New York] because I felt that I could enroll in Columbia University [New York, New York] since that was the school at that time for graduate studies for African Americans from North Carolina since the University of North Carolina didn't admit us.  So I applied but with a multitude and horrendous number of applications from veterans in 1946 from all over the country for the New York schools.  I didn't get in so in the interim rather than to become a stale student I enrolled in a technical college as a dental technician and as you would suspect a total stranger that I met a dentist in a coffee shop suggested that I should go to Connecticut and work for his brother and his father who owned a dental laboratory.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the dental school that you attended in New York?
Speaker 2: Kerpel, K-E-R-P-E-L-L [sic. Kerpel School of Dental Technology, New York, New York]
Speaker 1: And where was that located right in the city?
Speaker 2: Right in the city, 62nd Street.
Speaker 1: And how long was the course of study?
Speaker 2: A two year course.
Speaker 1: And you were there for two years?
Speaker 2: Two years I left in May as a graduate and joined this family owned business in Waterbury, Connecticut.  The first week I was there I met my wife [Verna Grier Lamb] although my intentions were to stay in Connecticut only one month on a trial basis but after meeting my future bride I decided it was worth staying and the family I worked for were good and they treated me as equal.  It was a job and the community seemed to welcome me because a dentist, Dr. James Lee welcomed me into the community and into his family life because we had something in common.  I was a dental technician, he was a dentist. And during my dental career studies, I worked with some of the students for people on Long Island [New York] who were the breadwinners at that time.  A Dr. Utz, U-T-Z and his wife had been friends of Dr. Lee growing up and so as it happened the week that I left New York I told her that I couldn't work for her anymore because I was moving to Connecticut so she said, "Where in Connecticut?" I told her Waterbury, Connecticut.  She smiled, she said, "Well I have a good friend in Waterbury, Connecticut, I'll give you my name and my telephone number give this note to him and tell him to call me."  So the first day I was in Connecticut I called him and he said, "You know where my office is located?"  I said, "Yes I've past it on the bus" and he said, "Good because you're going to my house for dinner tonight," and he became my very best friend.  I didn't know that he had a relationship early on with this lady when they were in high school and college and he became my mentor.  He insisted that I should be active in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and I should take the NAACP leadership training.
Speaker 1: His name?
Speaker 2: James Lee, Dr. James Lee, Sr. and his wife and my wife became great friends and to this day his wife (unclear) and I are friends because I was administrator and executive of his estate when he died.  She claims I influence his sons to finish dental school at least two of the three and the third one joined the corporate--American Brass Corporation.
Story_ID: 317474
Speaker 1: You said that when you early--came to Waterbury [Connecticut] you met the lady who was to become your wife.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What is her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Verna Grier, G-R-I-E-R [Verna Grier Lamb].
Speaker 1: And where was she from?
Speaker 2: She was born in Connecticut, lived in Connecticut all of her life, went to school--elementary school and high school there.  She went to Morris Brown [Morris Brown College] in Atlanta [Georgia] for college because a big trained movie famous football player.  That's an odd reason to attend a college but she had read about him in the black newspaper--the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] at that time.  So she wanted to go to the school he attended.  So after four years there she found a job in Georgia and stayed there.  So although I hadn't met her in May, she went back to teach for a full year in Georgia in September.  So as we grew in friendship and continued to date I asked her if she would marry me and later she talked about well she didn't want to teach in Georgia anymore because she was underpaid so she applied for a job in Long Beach, California and was on the eve of taking that when I suggested well you can't do that because you have your master's degree from Southern State University [New Haven State Teachers College; Southern Connecticut State University, New Haven, Connecticut] and you're certified to teach in Connecticut why don't you stay here because I have a job here.  She said, "Well in Waterbury they don't hire--," we were colored at that time "--coloreds in Waterbury school system."  I said, "That's odd. No time?" and she said, "No we don't have any colored teachers."  So the next day I called and it's interesting the superintendent of the school who I had never met but I had learned and ascertained his name, Dr. John Gilmartin and I introduced myself as [HistoryMaker] Gerald Lamb, fiancee of Verna Grier who was certified to teach in Connecticut but it was my understanding you don't hire coloreds teachers.  So he questioned my name again so I thought he was trying to intimidate me by that time I was an adult and couldn't be intimidated so I said, "Gerald Lamb, Gerald, initial A Lamb."  So he said, "Well what was your fiancee's name?" So I said, "Verna Grier," and he said, "Send her down tomorrow morning to my office to sign a contract."  So she went down and she signed a contract.  Now it was three years later since we had--I was in the private sector and he was an academic, I had no contact with him, a young man short in stature, non-distinguishing said--walked up to me and introduced himself as John Gilmartin.  Not using his title but he said, "You and I had a conversation several years ago and I want to thank you for sending me one of my best if not the best teacher we have in my public school system, Verna Grier Lamb."  Then I remembered he was the school superintendent.  So we chatted for a while and I said, "Well thank you Dr. Gilmartin. I want to thank you for giving her a job and thank you because she's really enjoying the school assignment and you were kind enough to give her the grade that she asked for."  He said, "She's superb."  So after chatting for a few more minutes, casual conversation he said, "But as an aside, for your information I searched through twenty-two years of applications and no black has ever applied for a teaching position which was puzzling to me."  But when I talked to my wife I asked her, "Why didn't you apply?" She said, "Well they didn't have any hired there so I assumed they didn't hire us."  I said, "Next time don't make that assumption; ask."

Speaker 1: What was the size of the African American population in Waterbury [Connecticut] at this time?  We're talking about mid-20th century now, about 1950 roughly, right?
Speaker 2: Ten thousand and they remained about the same, even today.
Speaker 1: African American?
Speaker 2: African American.
Speaker 1: Out of how many?
Speaker 2: One hundred and ten thousand.
Speaker 1: Oh that's similar to New Bedford [Massachusetts] okay about ten thousand.
Speaker 2: But remember it's a factory-oriented town.  We had no institutions of higher education at that time until I became involved in politics.
Speaker 1: What were the major industries that were employing (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Brass and copper, Scovill Manufacturing [Scovill Manufacturing Company; Scovill Fasteners], American Brass [American Brass Corporation] and Chase Manufacturing [sic. Chase Brass and Copper Company].  My mother--step--wife's [Verna Grier Lamb] mother and father both worked for the brass industry and one of the reasons we had this ten thousand migration, most of them came from North Carolina, Gates County [North Carolina], South Carolina and a small town called Saluda [South Carolina] and Georgia, Americus, Georgia because Waterbury had the reputation with these three major manufacturers you can always find a job.  Usually the people were hired two days after they applied and so it was an interesting era.
Story_ID: 317476
Speaker 1: When were you and Verna Grier [Verna Grier Lamb] married? What year?
Speaker 2: We were married in 1950 and were fortunate enough to have a daughter after four years, 1954 born.  Delightful child, Genero Lamb.
Speaker 1: Would you spell that first name for us?
Speaker 2: G-E-N-E-R-O and she grew up.  We had--my wife's doctor had-- the father of eleven children and had insisted that was our first of eleven for us.  Well it didn't happen and although we had hoped for more children it didn't happen.  So she has always been sort of isolated so we would always reach out to friend--families with children so that she could have some playmates and it worked well.
Story_ID: 317477
Speaker 1: As a dental technician, very quickly what was the nature of your work?  What did you do as a technician?
Speaker 2: Manufacture prosthetics for your mouth.  I was never the master technician because I didn't have that kind of dexterity, in fact should have been in any of the technical anyway but I did do some of the bookkeeping and office management and since I did that I was always a consultant for the laboratory the dental chair.  As a result, you know, I wore a suit and tie because I never knew when we were going to be called out.  Most of the dentists would introduce me as Mr. Lamb [HistoryMaker Gerald Lamb] who is a consultant in dentistry they'd never tell the background or what because it made them--it made the customer at ease because they'd say, "Gee I'm having two people taking care of me, a consultant."
Story_ID: 317478
Speaker 1: General manager, Waterbury Dental Laboratories [Waterbury, Connecticut] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's correct.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. What was next in your career?  Where did you move to next and why? And why?
Speaker 2: Well I remained at the dental laboratory but an unusual thing happened.  After leadership training in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], I became involved in that organization in our community center, Pearl Street Neighborhood House [Waterbury, Connecticut] in almost every other endeavor.  Fund raising for United Way [United Way Worldwide] and other things and my wife [Verna Grier Lamb] with her own professional career allowed me to do that as she took care and managed the family.  In 1959 a gentleman with three colleagues came into the office.  His name was John Iorio, I-O-R-I-O the owner of an eyelet manufacturing company in Waterbury, Connecticut came into the office and asked if I was doing the trial balance of the books and asked if he could chat with me for a moment and he had three people with him.  So I said yes and I ushered them into the office and they were chatting and he said he wanted to run for mayor of the City of Waterbury because he thought he could do a better job for the city than what the current mayor was doing.  So I said, "Well how does that affect me?" And he said, "Well you're known in the community."
Story_ID: 314033
Speaker 1: You were telling me that Mr. John Iorio was a candidate for mayor in the city of Waterbury [Connecticut] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and he appeared in your office at the dental laboratory one day.
Speaker 2: Right. And he asked me if I would become a member of his ticket.  He wanted to run for mayor on the seat on the board of aldermen and I didn't want to say no outright so I out of courtesy I said, "Let me think about it," because I really had no intention of getting involved in politics.  I loved the civic involvement and doing things for people but the political mechanism I had no experience but on the way out and interesting happened.  The owner of the firm that I worked for met them and he said, "Who were those fellows?" as they left, departed.  I said, "They're politicians, why?"  He said, "Oh I was just curious." And he said, "What did they want?"  I said, "They were asking me to run for the board of aldermen, but don't worry I'm too busy, I told them no."  So he said--a half hour passed and he said, "Gerry [HistoryMaker Gerald Lamb] were those Democrats or Republicans?"  I said, "Democrats, why?"  He said, "Good you'll run, I'm a Republican, you be a Democrat it's good for business." And I said, "Jimmy I'm too busy, you said we can't afford to hire someone to help me, I'm too busy."  He said, "Hire someone part-time first but run. It's good for business." And believe or not as president of the council every time they mentioned my name it was good for business.  He had enough vision to know that it would be good for business because the press always mentioned his business when they mentioned my name.  Now, ironically, John Iorio, who wanted to run for mayor, lost, but I won.
Story_ID: 314034
Speaker 1: So you went to the chamber (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The board of aldermen.
Speaker 1: In nineteen-what?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959]. And as fate would have it when John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] ran for president the Sunday before his election he came to Waterbury, Connecticut where one hundred thousand people were in the green--in the city--center of the city waiting for him because Catholics were 92 percent of the population in Connecticut.  They came from New York, Westchester County as well as Massachusetts down to hear his final speech.  They waited until two o'clock in the morning to hear him.  Since I'm president of the council in line to be mayor I got a chance to meet John F. Kennedy, Jr. and the Kennedy entourage.  Shortly thereafter I went on the list as one of the White House invitees.  In fact over the years when the Shah of Iran came for the state--official state dinner my wife [Verna Grier Lamb] and I were invited to the official state dinner.  So it was an interesting situation.
Story_ID: 314035
Speaker 1: You were the first African American then to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On the board of aldermen.
Speaker 1: And to be the president pro temp also--
Speaker 2: Yes. And the first to be an alderman.
Speaker 1: --on the board. Uh-hm. What were the early years like in politics for you serving on the board?
Speaker 2: It was interesting because the public divided the two slates of officers.  We weren't a unified group on the board of aldermen.  There were the incumbent mayor's group or slate of officers, four of them and four of us from the new insurgent.  So the new insurgents took over the board.  The person who ran with me Attorney Mark Cuse [ph.] became the majority leader, I'm president pro temp.  So we became the leadership of the board of aldermen and we didn't always do things the mayor's way.  In fact the mayor quite often said that I'm not a team player.  In fact when I ran for state political office he told the state political chairman I'm not a team player.  He said that's one defect I have.  The state chairman at least had a long lunch conversation with me to ascertain whether I could be a team player and my answer to him was if it's not immoral or illegal I can become a team player but I won't cross that line.  My mother [Addie Shannon Lamb] gave me a very strong upbringing on morality and you know I'm going to get involved in anything illegal.  So the state chairman said well that's okay if those are the two exceptions you can become a team player, fine and I was.  The one request the state chairman made of me I had to tell him no because it was immoral.  I won't recite what it was (laugh).
Speaker 1: Your opportunity to move into elected politics as I sense it was rather abrupt. Happened like that, tremendous transition in your life.  What prepared you to make the transition as smoothly as I think you made it?  What had prepared you to jump into politics 'cause you didn't gradually come into politics, you were there.
Speaker 2: There quickly.
Speaker 1: How did you make that transition?
Speaker 2: I think it was years of leadership training and the NAACP and Dr. James Lee who had this vision; incidentally he was from Cambridge, Massachusetts.  He had this vision that we have to prepare the leadership for our next generation although he was fourteen years older than me we became close friends.  So the transition with that and my involvement in civic responsibility, taking leadership roles in our communities, chairman of the community center, president of the NAACP and other endeavors and the spokesperson in many instances for our community with city government and so forth.  My wife [Verna Grier Lamb] questioned whether I knew about government or politics and I told her early on well I can learn.  Well would you believe it, of the city council members without being bias or prejudice there was only one member that I respected and had a greater intellect than me (laughter).
Story_ID: 314036
Speaker 1: So you really enjoyed being an alderman and what was your next elected political office?  What happened next?
Speaker 2: What happened next was a group of citizens--African Americans from Hartford [Connecticut] Attorney Boce, B-O-C-E Barlow.
Speaker 1: I knew him.
Speaker 2: Okay. Came down from Hartford with three other men and asked me if I would run for the office of state treasurer because there was to be a vacancy this year.  So I said, "No I don't want to be a full time politician." And he said, "But we need you."  So I said, "Well why don't one of you run?"  So he sheepishly smiled and said, "We have skeletons in our closet so we can't run."  I said, "Well how do you know I don't have any skeletons?  He said oh we checked you out, you have a wife, you have a daughter and you don't have any girlfriends because we checked that out too."  I said, "But I don't want to be a full time politician, and besides I don't have the money to run and I want to be a winner if I run."  He said, "You're going to be a winner."  I said, "How do you know this?"  He said, "We have a plan, master plan."  So what I didn't know is his former law partner had told him that he was going to announce that he's a candidate in the Republican Party for attorney general, William Graham and that Boce Barlow has said, "Okay my candidate is going to run for attorney general." And the two of them had suggested imagine that both parties would shift us against each other and Boce said that's not all bad because we're guaranteed to have someone elected.  That's precisely how it happened.  Well the state of Connecticut decided, the Republican Party that that wasn't good guarantying a seat for us.  So they ran the next time this long time speaker of the house I against me but I won anyway.  In fact I ran the head of the ticket because I had established myself at that time as being a competent state treasurer; someone that was knew government and understood government and was influential in it.
Speaker 1: At the time that Attorney Boce Barlow approached you and you had been doing a lot of civic work had you been active and prominent in the Connecticut Democratic Party?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You had not.
Speaker 2: No. Because as an alderman in Waterbury [Connecticut], you know Hartford really took the lion's share of prestige at that time.  Waterbury was the fourth largest city but the mayor since they had a strong mayor's position always represented our city.  So that I had no prominent role other than I had recognition from the Kennedys.
Story_ID: 314037
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now did you have any contact with John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] following his coming to Waterbury [Connecticut]?  Did you have any--?
Speaker 1: Oh following that, yes we were immediately placed on the White House invitation list and invited to many receptions.  A student recently asked me, "How many times have you been to the White House?" And I said, "I really don't remember."  He said, "Was it three or four times?"  I said, "Maybe thirty times or more, I don't know."
Speaker 2: What were some of the fondest memories you have of going to the White House when Kennedy was president and secondly did you have any kind of private talks with Kennedy or meetings with him?
Speaker 1: The White House during the Kennedy administration was very interesting because they had people from the arts and entertainment.  As you know they were strong advocates of that, physicians, corporate executives and there was usually a cultural type arrangement where all of the races were mixing.  So my wife and I were there although we often said we shouldn't be there because we really shouldn't be--we couldn't afford it, we did it.  During one of those White House visits when Jacqueline Kennedy and John F. Kennedy, President Kennedy were the center of attraction.  As you are well aware the vice president and president cannot in those social affairs stand or be in the same area of the room for security reasons because you don't want both of them to be shot at the same time or harmed at the same time.  So my wife [Verna Grier Lamb] looked up and said to me that, "Lyndon [Vice President Lyndon Banes Johnson], LBJ and Ladybird [Claudia Alta "Ladybird" Johnson] are down there all by themselves, Gerry [HistoryMaker Gerald Lamb].  That's sad everyone was around the Kennedys, why we don't go down and talk to them?" And we did.  So my wife and I went down and talked to Ladybird and Lyndon, introduced myself and told them who I was and told them that I liked finances, bookkeeping.  So once I became treasurer and he became president he nicked name me "Money Bags" and we became great friends.  In fact Dr. Brimmer [HistoryMaker Andrew F. Brimmer] who became the first African American on the federal reserve board was my nominee and LBJ, Vice President Johnson called me one Saturday morning and told me that--when my wife answered the phone then she gave the phone to me and I said, "Who is it?" She said, "Oh I don't know, some guy who calls himself the president."  So when I picked up the telephone, he said, "Money Bags," and I said, "It is the president."  He said, "Tell your husband it is the president." And we joked about it and I said, "My apologies, Mr. President" and he said, "Well she didn't know."  So at any rate he said, "I want you to be the third person, Louis Martin from Chicago [Illinois] and the Democratic National Committee vice chairman is the first to know and you're the third person to know that Andy Brimmer is going to be appointed by me as a member of the Federal Reserve board."  So I said, "Thank you Mr. President."  He was an interesting person; we got to know him well.  In fact, so well that he deputized me as a special ambassador to Venezuela for the inauguration of Dr. Raul Leoni the first elected president of Venezuela.  My daughter [Genero Lamb] was excited because we were flying down in the president's plane Air Force One and one week later because they have a week of inaugural festivities for their president.  The Air Force One flew back to me; in fact, I have a picture of that plane and my meetings with President Johnson quite often.
Story_ID: 314038
Speaker 1: Tell me about your being with [President] Lyndon Baines Johnson?  Now, he has always been one of my favorite persons (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One of my favorites and easy to know.  In fact when we returned from the presidency and inauguration in Venezuela we were informed by my--one of my aids the chief protocol that we were--instead of reporting to the state department that next day on our Peace Corps efforts and so forth to report to the White House immediately.  So my wife of course was concerned we had done something wrong but with thirty two people travelling with me the chief of protocol and others advising me what to do I knew absolutely it was difficult to do something wrong.  Although we did sneak away to a private dinner without security people but when we looked out the window we saw the security people outside waiting for us so they knew where we were and were still watching us.  But at any rate when we arrived at the Whitehouse the president met us downstairs and he said--and I said, "Mr. President my wife and I will be forever grateful for allowing us to represent this great nation.  Can you imagine we were the spokesperson for this entire nation?" and he said, "Come with me boy," so I must have flinched or something and he said, "When you're president you can call anyone boy if you want to, I know you don't like it but I'm president."  So we rushed up to the sleeping quarters, his residential section up on the third floor sleeping quarters.  He said, "You see this picture over this bed?" It was the Lincoln bed and he said, "This is where the president of the United States Lyndon Johnson, LBJ was born so I'm forever grateful you people invited me to be president of this great nation it is possible.  So then we came back and he said on the way down the stairway and he liked to walk the stairway he said, "My apology for calling you boy, but in Texas we do that" (laughter).  So I got to know him over the years and the nickname didn't take with anyone else--no one else other than Lyndon--than President Johnson called me Money Bags (laughter).  It was his favorite pet name.
Story_ID: 314039
Speaker 1: The assassination of John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], 1963 or '64 [1964] was it '64 [1964]?  The assassination--how did that affect you, how did you feel at that moment?
Speaker 2: A shock, chagrin after all my wife [Verna Grier Lamb] and I had been invited to the White House and got to know him and Jackie [Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis] on a personal basis.  We said Mr. President but always we could hold a conversation with him.  Jackie was fascinated that my wife was a teacher so she always asked educational questions.  She also at that time had just one child [Caroline Kennedy] and we had one child [Genero Lamb] so that gave them a commonality.  So I sat there really just wondering what are we going to do.  I realized we had met LBJ [Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson], Lyndon two weeks earlier 'cause that's how quick it was but I didn't expect him to remember us, but he did and I think it's because he felt we cared enough to come down and talk to him, to Ladybird [Claudia Alta "Ladybird" Johnson] and to him.  So after being called to the White House several times after that by President Johnson, I said, "Well this country's going to be alright," because at least Lyndon although he wouldn't make a commitment 'cause his word was his bond, he didn't write anything down, wouldn't sign anything saying I'm going to do this but when he gave you his word, he delivered.  I learned this country is going to be alright and although he's from Texas, he's really not a racist because he was born he was born up poor living with blacks.  Although they were segregated as I had been. But he wasn't afraid of us and therefore it was--he was easy to talk to.
Story_ID: 314040
Speaker 1: Louis Martin at that time as vice chairman of the Democratic Party was always convening African Americans from across the country, and I always chaired those meetings during the Lyndon [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] years--the Lyndon Johnson years.  So that they didn't have a political squawk of who's in charge because remember now I'm the only democratic statewide elected officer in the country, no one else serving a statewide political office.  In Connecticut all the others like Carl Stokes from Cleveland [Ohio] always asked, "How do we do it?" because we have only six statewide positions and we have less than five percent of the population at the time I was elected.  How did you do it?  It was luck or timing or whatever.  But I enjoyed the campaigning because I was new at it and since I listened to my political mentor, Abe Ribicoff, I had some interesting situations.  As elected treasurer, I had some interesting situations because the country hadn't become accustomed to a black state treasurer so frequently on Wall Street when I was introduced to people if I were with two white colleagues my attorney general or my deputy treasurer someone would say well this is the treasurer of state almost invariably they would think one of them is the treasurer of the state.  I always would say well it happens all the time and they would get over their embarrassment.  Arthur Levitt [Arthur Levitt, Sr.] who was controller of the State of Connecticut of--the State of New York at that time had arranged a luncheon.  When they walked in he introduced my deputy as the treasurer and he was shocked and surprised and he should have known he was in politics but he didn't.  I think the reason for it was Abe Ribicoff as my mentor always insisted, "You're the candidate for state treasurer, you are a candidate for state treasurer who happens to be black.  You're not a black candidate." So people didn't know it across the country.  He didn't think a big deal should be made of that fact like he minimized the importance of being Jewish and governor of a primarily Catholic state.
Speaker 2: He was governor at the time you won your election?
Speaker 1: No he became a United States senator the same year.
Speaker 2: Oh he had been governor before.
Speaker 1: He had been governor for two terms, served in the Kennedy administration as secretary of Health, Education and Welfare [U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welface] it was called then and then came back to the state to run for United States senator because a cabinet position didn't give him the clout under Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy] that he wanted.
Speaker 2: Another person, of course very important in the civil rights legislation '64 [1964], '65 [1965] was Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.  Did you have any relationship or contact with Adam at that time or before? Did you--
Speaker 1: No but what I did is not direct contact, we used Louis Martin who was vice chairman of the Democratic Party because Adam had an unusual situation.  If there is any credit given to a politician, you wanted it to be him and I could defer to that as long as he gets the job done.  So Louis always said, "Okay this is what we decided, I'll take it to the congressman and that's the way we handled it.  And that's alright because throughout my life I never looked for recognition particularly even in the state of Connecticut because although I was able behind the scenes to do a number of things, I knew that we weren't significant enough force to really keep things the way they were going if the majority community wanted to change.  What happened is in the city of Hartford [Connecticut] at one time we had eighteen of the twenty seven public school principals and the Urban League [National Urban League] decided to honor those eighteen people and guess what, we're down to seven now because you do too much they take away from you and that has been my traditional philosophy.  You don't have to publicize what you do, just do it.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I had move to the Hartford area in the mid '60s [1960s] and was in education and so I met a lot of these principals.  I was quite surprised to see how many principals of color we had because in Boston [Massachusetts] we didn't have any.
Speaker 1: I know and that's why I--it was a mistake and I told the executive director of the Urban League that he shouldn't honor them but he said, "It's too late, I've already asked them; we have the proposal put together."
Story_ID: 314041
Speaker 1: Now if you talk to Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] he would say that I'm the person who made him.  He was executive director of the Voter Education Project and that's the name we gave it although what they did was to train the newly elected African American officials, sheriffs, mayors, city councilmen because some of us had never been to City Hall.  We couldn't vote and we only went to City Hall to pay our taxes if we owned property.  So, for instance when Medgar's [Medgar Evers] brother Charles [Charles Evers] was elected mayor of Fayette, Vernon Jordan called me and asked me if I would head up a team to train him because as mayor of Fayette, Mississippi he was a local judge, he had to run the City Council, he had never run a meeting, he knew how to bury you, they were in the funeral business.  So we had to train him in addition to that the city fathers destroyed all the records, burned them.  So we had to create a whole new government.  Since I had been presiding officer over the board of aldermen and knew treasury and investment, I went to the power company, electric company and they helped me restore the records.  Of course after that we moved to Alabama and other cities wherever there was an elected official to train them.  Eugene Austin was an auditor in Michigan and-his name wasn't Eugene, I've forgotten his first name-well we were all, fifteen of us were Vernon Jordan's team that trained the newly elected people.  That was very interesting and many times in the south they had to sneak us in at night and sneak us out at night because they were afraid we were going to be harmed.  But I enjoyed doing it because it was worthwhile doing.
Story_ID: 314042
Speaker 1: Briefly, how did your daughter [Genero Lamb] feel about your being an elected politician?
Speaker 2: Well her reaction initially was I thought she liked the attention because she came in at five years of age as board of aldermen and inauguration and those activities and then at eight years old as state treasurer.  But the recognition factor really became a defect.  She used to hide in the back of my car because it had an official four plate on it.  She would lay down so she didn't want to be seen because she knew whoever passed were going to look in the car and when I finally came home and told her that I was leaving government and going to take a job at Connecticut Bank and Trust she said, "You're going to take a real job?"  Because she never considered the political job--jobs a job.
Story_ID: 317479
Speaker 1: Mr. Lamb [HistoryMaker Gerald Lamb], would you talk about your seven years from 1963 to 1970 as the treasurer of the State of Connecticut.  What was that like and what were your responsibilities and what are some of your memories of that?
Speaker 2: Those were interesting years.  My responsibility--major responsibilities were to receive all resources funded in the State of Connecticut and in addition to that, abe- any abandoned property or assets.  Not only the tax revenue but the custodian or the pension funds which were horrendous and my joke when people would ask me, "How can you leap from being on the board of aldermen [in Waterbury, Connecticut] to state treasurer and handle all those funds?" And my stock answer was, "You just add a few more zeroes to it, the budget."  So it became sort of a comic or humorous introduction.  But none the less the investment of funds or the pension funds as custodian is very important and initially a New England mentality was not to do anything frivolous so you weren't allowed to invest in stocks and equities, bonds yes, treasury bills and treasury bonds, yes.  But I asked the legislature in fact, Lowell Weicker [Lowell P. Weicker Jr.] who became a United States senator later and was (unclear) at that time (background noise) if he would introduce since he understood finances, authorization for me to invest in stocks and bonds.  So he did and the legislature said, "Yes the pension funds would grow but it can't be for the incumbent's treasury, he's not authorized to do it but the next treasurer could."  They didn't anticipate that I would be the next treasurer so I did have a chance to grow the state retirement funds for teachers, state employees and state troopers in that respect.  Receiving the daily receipts and making all of the payments in conjunction with the comptroller of this state was very interesting because there were people because of the lag in the receipt of the voucher and sometime quite frequently I had to pair that with availability of cash there was sometimes a delay in meeting those needs.  So there were people who developed hardships and I would attempt to eliminate those hardships wherever possible.  If a small pharmacist, privately owned requested a payment in advance of the usual timetable, I would attempt to do it because a major chain outfit had no cash flow problem the small pharmacist might.  So I became the treasurer who, since I was younger, had invoked flexibility in the handling of government resources and that had never been done before because most treasurers were older gentlemen.  Because older, I guess, were considered honorable (laughter) and more honest.
Story_ID: 317480
Speaker 1: Early on, even before I was nominated [to be Connecticut state treasurer], the state political chairman had called me aside and asked me not to let him down by being dishonest by stealing and of course I was insulted because my family's strong integrity and insisted on strong morals.  I said, "Of course I'm not going to steal."  He said, "I know you don't have any money, you're not wealthy but if you need any money come to me, I'll lend it to you if necessary and if you can't pay me back I'll give it to you but please don't steal."  So that was always a thought in my mind. Well would you believe, it for twenty years after that I became the campaign treasurer for all the Democratic candidates after that, who campaigned for governor.  Governor Grasso [Ella Grasso], Governor Bill O'Neill [William O'Neill] because they knew of my strong integrity and I would not steal and of course there is nothing in the record that even suggests a tarnished record.  But that was a strong part of it.  Now Wall Street, I was a phenomena.  Everyone wanted to know me; most people were shocked that I was even entered a private club as you have many private clubs in the downtown Wall Street area but when they saw me walk in with the bond council, New York firm, there was always buzz.  Who was he, looking and staring at me.  And so that was unusual for them until they learned who I was.  One instance in New York that I vividly remember, I had just sold or issued a $100 million in bonds to build dormitories and do highway construction in the State of Connecticut because that was one of my responsibilities.  I walked out of the bonding company after doing the signatures with a check for a hundred million dollars in my briefcase and would you believe it four taxi drivers wouldn't pick me up 'cause they assumed I wanted to go to Harlem [New York, New York].  The thinking was I would rob them. When Dillinger [John Dillinger] or someone else white could have been there and yet they picked them up ten feet away.  I couldn't get a cab with a hundred million dollars.  Well my dentist said later, Dr. Herman said, "Well why are you here because if I had a check for a hundred million dollars I wouldn't be here, I'd be in Europe or someplace, living the life of Riley."  It was a--took a while for this country to acquiesce to the fact that I am African American, a pioneer.  Grove Park Inn [The Omni Grove Park Inn] in Ashville, North Carolina was hosting the annual treasurers' conference and I said, "Yes I'm going to attend."  So Grove Park Inn didn't know what to do, they had never desegregated.  So they called the state treasurer in North Carolina, Ed Gill [Edwin Gill] and asked him what to do.  He said, "He's a good old North Carolina boy, he's going to come and stay and you're going to serve him and you're going to treat him like me, you wouldn't mistreat me would you?"  So I integrated Grove Park Inn.  I had a chance to revisit Grove Park Inn last year and it was interesting because the father of the person who was welcoming people and the door opener I asked about his family whether any of them were still there and the young man said, "Yes."  His daughter is the deputy manager, assistant manager of Grove Park Inn.  I said gee we've come a long ways from a place I wasn't supposed to be to be the assistant manager of this resort.  That's why I say Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden] there's some interesting things that have happened for me in life.  Wall Street quite frequently I was misidentified by my assistant deputy treasurer, I had two of them or the counsel--general counsel who always went with me.  But it worked out okay.
Story_ID: 317481
Speaker 1: You finished your work as treasurer--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and what was your next position, where did you go in 1970?
Speaker 2: The governor of the city [sic. State] of Connecticut, Governor Dempsey [John N. Dempsey] at that time asked if I could come over to his office and of course you make time for a governor.  So I said yes so when I arrived he and the commissioner of banking were sitting there and the governor asked me if I would resign from the treasurership and become banking commissioner.  So I said, "Well why?" And he said, "Well Phil [ph.] is older and he's going blind and since you preside over--as a member of the banking commission--over all of the public hearings anyway he thinks you would be ideal and perfect for the position of banking commissioner."  So I asked the governor, "Well how long do I have to think about it because as a public servant elected I didn't want the people to think that I'm an opportunist leaving an elected position."  So he said, "By tomorrow at eleven o'clock I want to make an announcement."  So I went back to the office and thought about it and I said, "Well my banker is Walter Connolly, he's my friend, the banker," so I asked him, I said, "Walter--" who incidentally eventually became CEO of Connecticut Bank and Trust [Connecticut Bank and Trust Company] because he said I made him.  Our friendship and rewards from state government transaction, but at any rate I said, "Walter the governor wants me to become banking commissioner.  You know I'm not a banker; I'm not trained as a banker."  He said, "What's the problem? Take it." He said, "Then when you leave government when you join us I can slot you in a higher position."  I said, "Are you serious?"  He said, "Yeah you preside over all the hearings, you're familiar with banking, you do business with bankers every day of the year as treasurer, why not? Just sit on the other side of the desk." And that was interesting because it was not only personally rewarding but I enjoyed it very much.  It did convince me banking was the area for me and although the Connecticut Bank and Trust didn't offer me as much money as other banks they did say that I would be very happy working there and I was.  So as banking commissioner I joined the largest bank because I could influence banking.  At that time African Americans I think in the entire state we had two teller positions.  So as banking commissioner when I visit the banks I would ask, "Don't you hire any blacks?"  Well miraculously by the next visit they had found someone (laughter). And so, I opened up opportunities in banking but also in bank in general since we only had three regional presidents and I had one third of our region lending I had an opportunity to liberalize to some degree the criteria for loans because my philosophy was if you don't make any loans you don't earn any money.  So let's from day one, when someone appears seeking a loan, find out how to make the loan rather than to say no to it and it worked out well for us.  We grew and grew and grew from an institution of 2 billion [dollars] while I was there to 32 billion [dollars], you know, through acquisitions and growth.
Story_ID: 317482
Speaker 1: You were commissioner for a year. Was that your choice?  I mean could you have stayed longer or was this--?
Speaker 2: Well I'm not certain but I would think not and the reason for it when I called their Governor Meskill [Thomas Joseph Meskill] because you serve until March 1st so you have two months of freedom to find another job if you want to.  When I spoke to then-elected Governor Meskill from New Britain [Connecticut] and I had met him in my travels because he had been mayor of New Britain, Connecticut for two terms.  So I said, "Governor, this is [HistoryMaker] Gerald Lamb, at the moment the incumbent commissioner of banking and I would like to advise you that I will not be seeking a new appointment."  So he said, "Great because I really had no intention of appointing you, not because there is anything wrong with you but politically in Connecticut you appoint someone from your own party and I have a person if you're willing, I really, since he's a non-banker, I really would like you to help him make the transition."  So he called his name, Jim Hagan [James Hagan] who had been a public relations person at U.S. Steel [United States Steel Corporation] and had contributed heavily to his campaign. And Jim Hagan and I became close friends in fact, too close because on occasion when I would go to him to request something for Connecticut Bank [Connecticut Bank and Trust Company] he would say, "Well what do you want me to do?"  I said, "Jim I can't--I'm not supposed to make decisions for you, I'm requesting an answer."  So he said, "Off the record, what would you do?"  I said, "Jim there's nothing illegal or immoral about it.  Let me say that you know me well enough; I wouldn't make this request if it were."  In fact that subsequently was how Brown [HistoryMaker Howard Brown, Jr.] becoming commissioner there was one time when I told him not to do it.  I said, "It's not illegal but you're going over the line, you really shouldn't make this, this decision" and he didn't.  It would have helped the bank, but I said no.
Story_ID: 317483
Speaker 1: So then you become senior vice president of Connecticut Bank and Trust [Connecticut Bank and Trust Company].
Speaker 2: Connecticut Bank and Trust, very interesting because immediately they decided that since I'm a non-banker that I could go out to the University of Oklahoma [Norman, Oklahoma] and learn commercial lending.  They didn't want me to study commercial lending in New Jersey at Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] because they said that was too close and there would be too many Connecticut bankers.  We want you to be separate, you are our special trainee.  So I went out to the University of Oklahoma during the football season, great season it was for them and for me, studied commercial lending, came back was assigned to the regional manager of the bank at that time, Fred Hagedorn [Frederick C. Hagedorn] as his assistant.  I worked with him for three months which I think was a cruel action the CEO took but they reversed the position. They made me his boss and he was my trainer which was awkward so I sat down with Fred and told him what was happening, apologized for it and he said, "No I know it's not your fault."  I said, "Now I can get you reassigned if you want that elsewhere if it's an embarrassment."  He said, "No I like working with you, we can be a team, I know who's boss, you're it."  So we stayed together for the first three years as my assistant and it worked well.  Now my life in politics taught me this, that you can't micromanage anything or you shouldn't because you make too many mistakes, give them an assignment and hold them accountable.  This doesn't mean you don't have oversight, you do have that and that was my managerial philosophy and Fred Hagedorn understood that and he knew that I wouldn't micromanage him or any of the employees but I would hold him and the branch managers responsible.  No, but the big numbers you know $5 million loans obviously the buck stopped with me.
Story_ID: 317484
Speaker 1: You had a long tenure with Connecticut Bank and Trust [Connecticut Bank and Trust Company]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and as you moved into the '80s [1980s] and mid-'80s [1980s] and late '80s [1980s] what were your responsibilities before retirement?
Speaker 2: As you grow older then as you might suspect I was forty-five when I joined and usually you reach your stride in financial institutions by forty-five and at fifty-five the new breed sort of pushes you upstream.  Since I had not only horrendous influence with the governor as the campaign treasurer and Joe Lieberman had been on my campaign committee, I introduced him to finance as a United States senator the bank management decided that I would be much more valuable there heading up governmental relations but since I was a senior vice president they put government relations, community relations, foundations, employee relations, marketing, and human resource in essence almost an administrator officer of the bank.  But I looked at the chairman, Walter Connolly and said, "Well Walter I know you said this is a promotion but it doesn't appear--I'm not a line officer--it doesn't appear as if I have enough influence."  He said, "Gerry [HistoryMaker Gerald Lamb] when we give you more money it's a promotion."  I--he hadn't spoken of the promotion, the money he said, "When we give you more money which we are giving, it's a promotion." Well I accepted the position.  That was very interesting because as I left the bank he said, "Incidentally I had already thought it through, I'd anticipated what you said that there wouldn't be a promotion.  You now influence one third of the bank, now you're going to influence all of the bank and although on our organization chart you won't report to me, you will report to me.  You only have to please me," and that was the role.  For instance I was the only senior officer who used the limousine because when I had the fractured knee and to have to come in the bank on crutches, human resources said it was against our policy to come in the bank on marble floors with crutches.  He called the house and wondered why he hadn't seen me and I said, "Well I can't come to work because I'm on crutches that's our policy."  He said, "Oh did I ever mention we don't have any policies we can't violate; I'll send Joe Parr [ph.] my chauffer to pick you up tomorrow.  What time do you want to come to work?" He said, "No Joe will pick you up at nine o'clock." So when the rest of the bank saw me arriving to the bank in the limousine chauffeured by the CEO's chauffeur my influence just blossomed.  No one ever questioned it and I suspect you usurp the influence sometime to get things done or to influence the direction of the bank.  We were going to charge--on our master charge system not the twenty-five or thirty day/twenty-eight day use of the card without interest on it that we currently now enjoy.  We were going to charge from the day of purchase and as senior officer I told them no.  I would leave the bank, I think that's unpardonable.  No other institution does it and then they point out how much the comptroller of the bank--how much money it would bring to the bottom line.  I finally prevailed, we didn't and that still continued to the end of my tenure.
Story_ID: 317485
Speaker 1: You came to the end of this tenure, you retired, you were now sixty-five--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What did you do in retirement and when did you spend more time on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  I know you came here but what have you done in retirement (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I-I then retired to Martha's Vineyard at least all summer and most of the time six months.  I didn't change my official residence because I wanted to remain as a resident of Connecticut to help the other politicians of the Democratic Party.  So I began to enjoy Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts] and Martha's Vineyard but prior to that the development we're in now I had an opportunity to buy four acres of land, organize a corporation of five people, build four houses and sell the other units.
Speaker 1: This was before you left Connecticut Bank and Trust [Connecticut Bank and Trust Company]?
Speaker 2: Yes before I left Connecticut Bank and Trust and it was at the downturn of housing so second homes weren't selling.  One of the local entrepreneurs here asked to buy at discount and I said, "No."  So my wife [Verna Grier Lamb] decided she liked this house so we moved into it and to keep the corporation solvent and we sold off the land and the inter lots.  There were ten houses for lots and two lots for open space which was a still an open space in front of us.  Now financially it was not a success but two of the members, John Lawrence--Dr. Lawrence and I ended up with houses and we've enjoyed it since then.  So I was glad I did it.  My philosophy was at that time having visited Martha's Vineyard, we were buying older houses because we couldn't afford a new second house.  So I said at least if we build some houses, I would give them the option of buying a new house or a old house if they decide and as you know most of the home purchases then were from Boston [Massachusetts] or New York City [New York, New York] very few from Connecticut.  I was one of the first from Connecticut so it worked out well.  We didn't lose any money and I just began to enjoy it.  So after retirement there were so many demands on my influence in Connecticut which I no longer had.  Remember when you leave the largest bank in Connecticut you don't have that corporate influence of doing things, of getting jobs for minorities.  I was no longer campaign treasurer for the government so I didn't have that political clout and yet people were still making requests.  So I asked my wife if she would move out of Connecticut someplace her choice, a warmer climate.  So we looked at California, too far away from the action on the East Coast, Florida, South Carolina, Georgia since she went to school there, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and I told her, "This is as far north as I want to go, Williamsburg [Virginia]."  So she said, "I like Raleigh, North Carolina." So I said, "Why?" And she said, "Well you have a sister-in-law there, so I don't want to go to a town where I don't know anyone."
Story_ID: 317486
Speaker 1: So in Raleigh, North Carolina, Prezell Robinson [Prezell R. Robinson]--Dr. Robinson asked me if I would be interested in doing something at the Saint Augustine College [Saint Augustine's College; Saint Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina] and I said, "Well no I don't want to teach, in fact I'm not qualified to teach." And he said, "Well I could appoint you as an adjunct professor."  I said, "Let me think about it." In the meantime Dr. Matthews [ph.] was running the business division with seventeen full time professors and thirty part-time and none of them had ever worked in a corporation.  They were teaching theory which is great, real experience is different, as you know.  So she invited me to the campus for lunch and said she would like me to organize and start an advisory council for the business division and she had the blessings of Dr. Robinson, the president, so I did.  So we developed an agenda of internships and in that era during the '90s [1990s] corporations were really hiring the interns they weren't looking outside for employees.  So at that time we had six interns well when I left we had 132 interns because I organized a group of African Americans in corporations in the major employers in the Raleigh area and we held workshops for internships for faculty of Saint Augustine College as well as for the students and that worked out well.  For instance, IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] who hires fifteen thousand employees in the Raleigh area contributed fifty-two personal computers completely installed free because our advisory council asked for it and Diana Bing whose father helped design the personal computer was a senior engineer in IBM.  So Diana Bing on our committee was able to convince her boss to give the fifty-two personal computers to the college.  Of course they got a tax write off and that's fine and of course currently I guess they were hiring seven interns every year through her influence, Bristol Meyers [Bristol-Myers Squibb], Glaxo [GlaxoSmithKline] welcomed in pharmaceutical company where it was going to get interns in all of those.  How this happened was my wife [Verna Grier Lamb] liked to eat out because she hated to cook because she wasn't a good cook, I thought she was a good but she didn't.  We were having dinner and a young lady, minority waited on us and I said is this a well-paying job, I always ask that since I was always interested in getting promotions and I thought maybe she would be a manager or something someplace.  She said not really, in fact she said I don't like doing this because I have a degree from Saint Augustine College and I would like to join a corporation.   The very next day since my wife liked to clean house, she didn't want to move into a used house a house that was twenty years old because--without the exterminator coming in so this--
Story_ID: 317487
Speaker 1: Okay just finish up if you would about the internship program that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, at Saint Augustine's College [Saint Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina] we ended up when I left after nine years with 132 internships which was significant growth from six when we started earlier years but I'm assuming that program is still going forth but after my wife [Verna Grier Lamb] had passed my daughter [Genero Lamb] and I didn't need a ten room house in Raleigh, North Carolina and seven rooms in Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  So we decided to make Martha's Vineyard our legal residence since I loved this area anyway.  Her desire was to get back a host of people that we knew because she grew up here and it was the proximity to Connecticut and that worked well for her.
Speaker 1: What are some of your activities today Mr. Lamb [HistoryMaker Gerald Lamb] here in Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts] on the island?  I know you're active--
Speaker 2: Well I tried to retire completely but I guess my philosophy of instincts just won't allow it.  I'm active in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and of course I'm a new member to the First and Third Club, which is a retired businessmen's club on Martha's Vineyard probably all of them wealthy with the exception of me.  We enjoy each other for the camaraderie.  We meet twice a month, the first and third Thursday, no agenda, no mission, no objective but just for the camaraderie of knowing each other.  It's interesting since we're from all walks of life from the hard hitting business people to retired clergy or retired physicians, retired engineers, government officials and we try to avoid inducting people who are still working who might be entering for an agenda different from ours.  So I'm quite active there.  I don't hold any official position--government position because I believe philosophically that at a certain age the older people should move off stage and allow younger, eager, enthusiastic, creative younger leadership.  So I'm constantly looking for people who were where I'd been to help them and assist them.  So it's not unusual for me to sit with a member of the NAACP or some young person who just came here looking for a job as a teacher or otherwise to sit with them and counsel them short term.  Those are things I can do to pass along my experience both good and bad because my experience has been both.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you would like to add to this interview that I didn't ask you about?
Speaker 2: Well we've almost covered all of the bases, my working life, and government life.  I guess in a sense I was a workaholic and I can enjoy now relaxing.  I do a significant amount of reading basically history occasionally I will read a fun novel particularly if I know the author and I still like to travel, I still spend in the Virginia Beach [Virginia], Chesapeake [Virginia] area my winter months now, because old and cold don't really match too well but I enjoy that.

Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you've lived your life?
Speaker 2: If--the way I've lived my wife [sic. life] I feel good about it because it's always been helping someone else.  I really in no sense have I ever wanted to help myself, I wanted to earn enough money to support my family.  My wife [Verna Grier Lamb] and I quite early in life said that if only she earned five thousand dollars and I earn five thousand dollars it would be heaven because we didn't want to be rich and she knew at the early age I was helping people learn and trying to help them get jobs.  That's been rewarding to me personally and I've never looked for anything and of course politics that's the kiss of death to try to reward yourself anyway.  So with the political background I've always enjoyed helping other people and I still do whenever possible.  Now the one defect in my life that I do have, I regret in some sense that I never completed college and I don't like to advertise that I'm manmade.  Some people did in the old days, A.G. Gaston and others because I don't want the youth to think they can do what I did accomplish without an education because I don't believe they can.  That was one era where we were in a transition mode and if you were a decent person and had some smarts they didn't look harshly at your qualifications.  Although I felt completely competent and qualified 'cause I was qualified for every job I've ever had.  I don't want the new--the youth to think they can do it.  So therefore I don't parade in the fact that I'm a self-made person.  I always advocate scholarships, college, in fact my wife and I have assisted kids, unrelated kids and going to college financially because she as an educator felt very strongly about it and I supported that idea.  I hear from some of the students quite often, I won't reveal their names because it's up to them if they want to make it public.
Speaker 1: I know that you said you're still interested in travelling, you like to travel is there anything else that you still want to do that you have not yet done?
Speaker 2: No not really, not really.  I knew a native of India once and I think the expression is brahma [sic.] that means at peace.  I'm really at peace with myself and what I've done.  I do consider now that my daughter [Genero Lamb] lives with me and is so helpful that I didn't spend more time with her because in a sense I was trying to save the world and I really didn't spend all the time that I needed to with her.  Now she turned out okay because of her mother's [Verna Grier Lamb] influence and some modest influence from me but if I had it to do over, I would attend college, get an education and my wife was willing to support me because my aspirations after a while, since we are so controlled by law, was to go to law school and become a lawyer. In Waterbury [Connecticut] we had no African American lawyers and I began to appear before judges with the link with juveniles and plead for them and said that I would--they would be in my custody and I would help them avoid this type of legal conflict in the future until the lawyers complained and said to the judges that I should not, a non-lawyer appear before him because I was taking steaks off of that table.  So I stopped and my wife encouraged me to go to law school and said, "Do it," but I didn't because by that time the momentum was building and we were doing all right and since I wasn't aggressively looking for money things were happening to me that were interesting.  State office holding, this Connecticut Bank and Trust [Connecticut Bank and Trust Company] and I was able to do things for people in those position.

Speaker 1: Last question.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I want to be remembered as a respected person, for instance the president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] here or the vice president, Carrie Tankard [HistoryMaker Carrie Camillo Tankard] referred to me as a nice, old man and that's important because it brings to fore all the things my mother [Addie Shannon Lamb] and father [Thomas Lamb] taught me because image and respect was important to our family.  My father I never saw outside of the house even if he was emptying garbage in the backyard without a coat.  I wear coats and on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] people don't normally wear coats to church but I do it's a part of my heritage and background to be a coat--with a coat and looking respectable.  During the days for our community of the large hair, bushes and so forth I spent enormous amount of time with young blacks trying to convince them when they go to look for a job to eliminate this large hairdos because the majority of the community it was frightening, it was different from them and many of them agreed with me and did reduce the size of it anyway.  With several college graduates, for instance when I retired I got rid of most of my wardrobe.  I have very few formal suits and so forth because I gave them suits so they could look presentable for the interviews because I knew it was important.  I volunteered for fifteen years to do the interviewing for our management position in the bank [Connecticut Bank and Trust Company] because I wanted to make certain African Americans and other minorities had a fair shake at the jobs.  Those people who we did not hire and if I knew or found out the reason why we didn't hire, for instance some of them culturally didn't know--didn't have table manners and so forth.  For several of them I just call them aside and told them later, "We're not going to hire you but you will be hired if you brush up on these little things."  Eating with the appropriate fork or spoon and not eating with your finger--

Speaker 1: I do have one last question, 'cause you have kind of led me to it and this will be the last one.  What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community today and in the future?
Speaker 2: I'm hoping and it has always been my fond hope, now that we've made some inroads into corporate America that we own and control more businesses so that we will be employers.  If I were younger, I would become an entrepreneur now.  I know how it's done, I know it can be done and we have to do it.  The unfortunate part or dimension of integration is we lost our entrepreneurial spirit and most of those businesses even in the South and Virginia the black businessman, restaurant owner no longer exists.  Sure we have some barbers and a few people but we don't have those things that supplied things in our community.  Even some of our banks have been demised and we had insurance companies.  I think it's time to go back to it isn't an either or, it's both, two tracks, upward mobility and corporation, but entrepreneurship.
