Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [H. B. Barnum, Sr.] side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Alma, A-L-M-A, Cleo, C-L-E-O, Williams [Alma Williams Barnum].
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her birthday was July 20th, 1921.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Texas, but I'm not sure it was Houston, but Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you know about your mother's side of the family in terms of--how far back can you take 'em (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know, I know she came from a--my mother was a twin; I know she came up from a family of sixteen children, her--my mother was 4'11" and her twin brother Andrew [Andrew Williams (ph.)] was 6'2".  I know my--her mother--her--see, my great-grandmother had twenty-six children--four sets of twins; same father, same mother.  And that's about all I know about my mother.
Speaker 1: Are there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know, I know she went to Phillis Wheatley High School in Houston, Texas.  She wanted to be a dancer and a singer, but when she was fourteen, a young preacher came through, and I guess in those days, a preacher was the--you know, the thing, you know, so they got married when my mother was fifteen.
Speaker 1: Now, are there--before we finish your mother's story, are there any--is there any information about your ancestors going back further than your grand- did you know your grandparents, or--
Speaker 2: Not that I know--I, I knew my grandmother--my mother's mother.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Hattie [Hattie Williams (ph.)].  My uncle--I had a Uncle Darden [Darden Williams (ph.)]; I didn't know a lot of my uncles, but on my mother's side a Uncle Darden.  My grandfather's name was Lafayette [Lafayette Williams (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Now, now, were there any stories about how the family got to Texas, or were there any stories about slavery or Reconstruction or, or migration (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not that I know of, not that I know of, except that we're doing gene- was it genealogy?  We're doing that now, but I don't know at this time where, where the family originated from before Texas.  I know my grandfather worked on the docks in Houston.  I just used to go down to Galveston [Texas].  He was in Galveston, and my grandmother was just a housewife.  They lived at 1204 Meadow Street in Houston.
Speaker 1: You know what ward that is?  I know in Houston, the ward thing is--
Speaker 2: I think it's Third Ward [sic.].
Speaker 1: Third Ward?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 609246
Speaker 1: So your mother [Alma Williams Barnum] got married, left Phillis Wheatley High School [Houston, Texas], and did she move, or did she stay in Houston [Texas]?
Speaker 2: No, they moved to Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Whereabouts?
Speaker 2: A place called Campti [Louisiana], which is right outside Natchitoches [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: How you spell Canti?
Speaker 2: Campti, C-A-M-P-T-I.
Speaker 1: Oh, Campti, okay, all right, okay.  So, about--now, she was fourteen when she got married--fourteen, fifteen?
Speaker 2: She was fourteen, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--now, are you the youngest child, or--
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest son.  They only had two kids.
Speaker 1: Oldest son, all right, all right.  Okay, so you were the first born?
Speaker 2: I was the first born.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right, okay.  So this is about--okay, 19--how long were they married before you were born?
Speaker 2: I was born when she was fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so right after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, because--yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A little over a year and a half later because we were--my mother and I are fifteen, fifteen years apart.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother have any stories of growing up in Houston that she shared with you about Phillis Wheatley High School or, or the Third Ward [Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: No.  As, as--when I got older--older, you know, ten or eleven years old, she would tell me about the musicians that went to her school Illinois Jacquet and H.S. Sloan [Henry Sloan] who played with Hampton [Lionel Hampton], and--let's see, Jacquet, Sloan--and she would tell me that we--just wanted us to be something, or do something.  I think it's do something, because if you keep doing something, you'll be something (laughter).
Speaker 1: Is that the philosophy (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, Phillis Wheatley I know was famous for--I mean had a lot of really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, alumni, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, a lot of sparkling alumni from Phillis Wheatley.  It seemed to be a good school, a place that generated a lot of, a lot of celebrities and people of accomplishment, you know?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's the old Wheatley now, you know; that, that became E.O. Smith [E.O. Smith Education Center, Houston, Texas], I believe.  And so the Wheatley now is not the Wheatley that they went to, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And you said your mother wanted to be a performer?  Did she tell you what--about some of her aspirations in terms of that?
Speaker 2: She wanted to be a dancer and a performer and a singer--anything connected with the arts.  But, you know, at that time, I guess, without--with--being one of sixteen kids, that was, that was just a dream.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I guess when she married a minister [Barnum's father, H. B. Barnum, Sr.] that kind of killed the idea of being a secular performer I guess (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That--that killed the idea, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 609247
Speaker 1: Well, can you give us your father's full name, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's same as mine, Hidle Brown Barnum, Sr. [H. B. Barnum, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know his date of birth, but his place of birth was Louisiana, and probably Natchitoches.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that one?
Speaker 2: N-A-C-H-E-T-I-C--N-A-C-H-I-T-O-C-H-E-S [sic.], but it's pronounced, Nachitoches.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do you know very much about his side of the family, or how far back can you trace 'em (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He, he, he was a--my father came--I don't know how many in his family, but I know that his mother--his father had kids from two or three different wives because all of my uncles are like his stepbrothers or, you know, half-brothers, the last of which I lost a couple years ago.  But didn't know much about his family at all except his, his sister, who took care of us briefly when I was real little.  I didn't, I didn't really know, but I knew that she took care of us a little bit when I was say, one to two, two years old.  And he had churches all through the--through Louisiana, Louisiana, Texas.  He was a pastor that had about maybe eight or nine churches, and as I found out later, you know, he was very well respected.  He was a very educated man, had degrees from Chicago [Illinois], had B.A.'s and Ph.D.'s and stuff from Chicago, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wait a minute now; this is important.  Let's not breeze past it.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Where, where did he go to school?
Speaker 2: He went to school in Chicago--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: He went to school in--at Grambling [Louisiana Negro Normal and Industrial Institute; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Did he get his divinity degree in Chicago, or--
Speaker 2: He had divinity degrees, also philosophy degrees--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and--
Speaker 1: So he was quite a bit older than your mother [Alma Williams Barnum], you think, or--
Speaker 2: Reverend Barnum was probably eight years, ten years older than my mom.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Didn't know a lot about my father 'cause we, we--after--we'll get into that.  We left when I was three years old.
Story_ID: 609248
Speaker 1: Well, what, what happened?  Did your parents [Alma Williams Barnum and H. B. Barnum, Sr.] split up or something, or?
Speaker 2: Well, this is what I can really remember.  I remember we had moved to a place in Texas, and now I know the city was called Brady, Texas, where they had given him another church.  And I remember that we lived--the house they gave us was actually two boxcars, two railroad cars that we made into a house.  And I remember we'd been there--I remember picking cotton when I was three years old.  And when I say picking cotton, I remember going out with a bag, and being out there all day; not really doing anything--probably had more dirt in the bag than cotton.  And I remember the man gave me five pennies, and I went home and told my mother, I said, I said, "I made some money today, mother," and I showed her these five pennies.  And I remember she said, "Well, we're leaving."  And I don't know where she went, but that same night, while he was at church, she packed my sister [Billie Barnum] and I up, and we went and caught the--not Greyhound [The Greyhound Corporation; Greyhound Lines, Inc.]; what's the old bus line?
Speaker 1: Trailways [Trailways National Bus System; Trailways Transportation System, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Trailways--and we went to Houston [Texas].  When we got to Houston (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is 1939, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: This was about 1939.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We got to Houston late that night; we didn't spend more than twenty minutes there.  She left my sister with my grandmother [Hattie Williams (ph.)], and her and I went out on the highway and started hitchhiking, and she said she was taking me to California.  We--a guy picked us up in a small car, so it must have been a--I think it was a Willys or something like that.  He took us as far as Phoenix, Arizona and I--we stayed there a year.  So--I mean, I can remember that like, like yesterday.  I remember the man stopping on the highway and buying us a soda and a piece of chicken.  I never knew who he was after that, never saw him again--Caucasian fellow--and took us all the way to Phoenix.  I remember we got in Phoenix, we were standing on the side of the road, and my mother knocked on a door and told a lady we were, you know, we were hungry, and we stayed there a year (laughter).  And then, you know, we came to Los Angeles [California] after that.  Yeah.  So, we stayed in Phoenix a whole year.  And I don't remember much.  I, I don't think I was going to school yet.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were a little fellow (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was a little fellow.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were like four--three or four years old, I guess.
Story_ID: 609249
Speaker 1: And we got to California because my mother [Alma Williams Barnum], I guess, reading the papers and stuff.  20th Century Fox [Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation] was having a national contest trying to find a kid to dance with Jeanne Crain, and the movie is called, 'The Valley of the Sun Marches On'--Cornel Wilde--Cornel Wilde, Jeanne Crain--and I won the contest, so that got us to California.
Speaker 2: Now, had you--do you remember having any training as a dancer?  How did you pick it up?  Did you just kind of imitate what you saw?
Speaker 1: At that time, I had no training, but when the people came, I guess I was such a fool, they said, "This guy, (unclear) give him a job," (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know all little kids imitate a dance they see other people do, and sometimes they can really do it well, but how did (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't even remember who I might have imitated.  I don't--I just know that--I remember people laughing and they were taking pictures and the next thing I know, my mother said, "We won.  We won."  And we got on a bus and came to California.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So did--so now, it was a integrated audition?  Did they want just black kids, or did they want (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think there was--'cause they already had their little white kids, so--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --they already had them, I think; they were already signed to the studio, so they were just looking for--and I don't, I don't--I, I don't know if they were looking for a black kid or not.  I just know that I won, and they brought me to California, we did the movie.  Yeah, I see it every once in a while it's on TV.  It's really funny, it's only--it only lasts about forty seconds.  The kids are in an alley behind a theater or something, and someone is shooting dice and they get up and they dance and they--you know, and I did my little bit.  So then we were here.  The good thing, I think, that got me going was I could read.  Mom always--she, she, she would sit with me and learn how to read. I could write my name and everything.  And they had another audition at CBS; it was an audition for the Jack Benny show ['The Jack Benny Program'], and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now this is the Jack Benny radio show, right?
Speaker 1: Jack Benny radio show--Rochester Anderson [Eddie "Rochester" Anderson]--I'm trying to think of the, the guy who wrote, 'Amen' choral group.  Anyway, I went out and auditioned and I got a part, and my part was to be whenever they had the Beverly Hills Beaver Scouts, I would do the Rochester parts.  But because I could read, and most of the kids couldn't read at that age, I would be doing four and five parts on a show.  And it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, now tell us now--we--I don't--we've never--I've never heard the Beverly Hill Beaver Scouts.  Now, what was that, and what--
Speaker 1: The Beverly Hills Beaver Scouts was a little group that was in Jack Benny's neighborhood, you know and, and Stuffy Singer, who I just previously spoke to--plus, I'm trying to think of some of the kids.  Stuffy Singer and--
Speaker 2: So they're supposed to be a scout troop in Jack Benny's neighborhood (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: But what, what role would Rochester have in it?  I mean what--
Speaker 1: Well, they would--you know, there was a little black kid and three little white kids and they, and they were, you know--and they were--so--actually, it was like cutting back to Rochester as a kid, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was a flashback to--
Speaker 1: Sometimes, and sometimes it was just a straight up Beaver Scouts, but the people at 'CBS Playhouse' saw me, and so I wound up doing 'CBS Playhouse.'  Then, Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll saw me and I wound up doing 'Amos 'n' Andy.'  So I, I was doing three or four radio shows during this time, and I was five, six years old.  At present, I'm trying to research to get some of those old shows so we're doing a--trying to do a little documentary, so we're looking for those shows.
Speaker 2: Hm.  That's something, that's--yeah.  I know they, they--sometimes they play some of the old Jack Benny shows on public radio--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Ohio.
Speaker 1: Well, anytime you hear a kid's voice, it's probably me.  And during that time also with, with the radio shows going on, a man name Johnny Grant, who was doing the USO [United Service Organizations] shows, saw me, so I wound up opening all the USO shows with Johnny Grant, who was--became the mayor of Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], and we lost him last year.  He's one that's responsible for all those stars and everything on the board and everything, so--
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Johnny would--I, I became his little kid, so--
Speaker 2: Now, were they--did you ever do any of the 'Our Gang' comedies with Hal Roach and--
Speaker 1: No, no.  People wanna put me with the 'Our Gang,' but I was not with the 'Our Gang.'  We did do a show out here called, the 'Broomstick Buckaroos,' that was on every day on TV, and so people just assumed, or wanted to assume that that I was part of 'Our Gang.'
Speaker 2: Okay, so 'Broomstick Buckaroos' that's a lot like a live studio cow- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like a live studio show, yes.
Speaker 2: --where they show a cowboy movie or something, or where the--
Speaker 1: No, no, just, just kids, you know, just--that was just the name of the show; it was just kids--neighborhood kids.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I mean it was like--was it a--did it have a script, or like a audience participation, or--
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I don't even remember; I just remember the name of the show, and I remember we did it for about two years.  You know, at this time, my--the furthest thing from my mind was being in show business or being a star--any--anything to do with the show business, so I was doing things because it, it fed us.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that's the question I was gonna ask.  I mean did your activities basically feed your family?
Speaker 1: My mother and I, yeah.
Story_ID: 609250
Speaker 1: And during this time, we went out and we brought my sister [Billie Barnum] out, too.  We went back to Texas and brought her back with us, and we were all staying over on 21st [Street] and Central [Avenue] with a--with an old man and his wife who had a extra bedroom, and we stayed there for about a year, a year and a half.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Mr. and Mrs. Frye [ph.]; I remember them all the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So--now, were you able to go to school, like a regular school?
Speaker 1: I started to school at 21st Street School [sic. 20th Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California] on--which is right off of Central and 21st Street, and then we got our big break.  They had finished the projects, the projects called Aliso Village [Los Angeles, California] in the--in--and my mother [Alma Williams Barnum] was able to get one of the first apartments there.
Speaker 2: Now, for those who don't--contemporary people may look, look down their nose at the projects, but tell us about what the projects were like when you moved in (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Aw, man.  The projects was like moving to Beverly Hills [California] from where I was.  And we, we moved in--first of all, we had a upstairs and downstairs, my sister and I shared a room.  I was six and she was four, so we--you know--and my mother had her own room, and we had a downstairs, a living room and a kitchen, and that was like moving in Beverly Hills.  It was brand new; we were the first ones to live in our, in our, in our apartment.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I know a lot of the people I've interviewed, they talk about being the first ones in the projects and how they--how well everything went, he services were, were good, you know, in the beginning (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Aw, it was--I think the best thing about the projects was that people--you know, they say it takes a village to raise a child?  Everybody looked out for everybody's children, everybody would discipline you.  I mean I was bad, so I got more whippings probably than anybody in the projects.  But I got whippings from everybody in the projects.  Even today, the people that are still left, like Miss Pinky [ph.].  Miss Pinky would say, "H. B. [HistoryMaker H. B. Barnum], what you doing?  Come here, boy!"  You know.  And all I'd be saying while I was in my room is, "Don't tell my mama, don't tell my mama," 'cause I knew when I got home I was gonna get another whipping, too, so--but that's, that's--everybody, you know, worked, worked together, you know.  And nobody--you could leave your doors unlocked.  Nobody went hungry 'cause maybe this night somebody would cook or--and everybody could eat some of their food and--you know--I mean it was, it was beautiful.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and we didn't know we were poor; that's another thing, too, see.  And, and remember the word ghetto hadn't come about yet, you know, and some of the words we're using now weren't even--I mean related to anything we were doing, so we were, we were, we were satisfied, happy.
Story_ID: 609251
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Say it again?
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Some of the sounds of growing up was of course the good music that we, that we had.  Remember we're, we're now talking about right at the beginning of the rhythm and blues; rock and roll hadn't really come into play (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like early '40s [1940s], we're talking?
Speaker 2: Went to rhythm and blues.  My uncle, Jack Lauderdale--and when I'm say--I call a lot of people my uncles and aunties because that's the way it was.  He was not really my uncle, but his mother--his wife and my mother [Alma Williams Barnum] were best friends.  They were like four ladies who just really grew together that, that whole timing 'til they, 'til they all passed away; they were just really good friends.  Well, Jack Lauderdale started the first record company--first Afro American record company [Swing Time Records].  He had Little Esther Phillips, he had Johnny Otis, he had Mel Walker, he had Handsome Mel Williams, and it was his company that--of course, Dootone [Dootone Records] and Motown [Motown Records], they kind of put him out of business, but he had the first record company.
Speaker 1: What was the name of his company?
Speaker 2: God, what was Jack's company name?  I don't know; I can't even think of it.  I mean, I do know, but it's not in my head, but his name is Jack Lauderdale, and Jack--Jack was a entrepreneur, a real entrepreneur; he had apartment houses, he moved out the projects into his own house.  He had motels, he had--he had a lot of stuff; he was rich.
Speaker 1: Hm.  Okay.  So he was like--in the part of town you were living in, it was called--is that a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Aliso Village; it's East Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, East L.A., okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And basically it was 1 percent Afro American or 1 percent black, probably, probably 25 percent Jewish, because at that time, most of the Jewish people lived on the--in the Brooklyn Soto area [Brooklyn and Soto, Los Angeles, California], and then the rest was Hispanic. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're talking about over 60 percent, it was Hispanic.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, more--yeah, yeah.  And there was nobody on this side of the river; the river is kind of the dividing line, and there was nobody on this side of the river but basic Caucasian and a few of the blacks who had begin to make it like your Ella Fitzgeralds--not even Nat [Nat King Cole] yet.  Ella Fitzgerald (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did Rochester [Eddie "Rochester" Anderson] live over here?
Speaker 2: Rochester, yes, yeah; he lived on, he lived on Harvard--yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you--I, I mean before--I guess--well, I was asking you about sights and sounds and smells, but--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --finish that up, then I'll ask you about Rochester.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, the music was good.  I don't know what you mean by smells, but just the, the city was, the city was basically clean, you know.  Where we were, even though it was a projects it was, it was clean 'cause it was new, and we, we took pride in it.  We all cut our lawns, we--you know, we--I mean I used to go around--I had a little business; I'd go around cutting lawns and washing windows, and selling newspapers, and stuff like that, so, you know--and basically, the kids did stuff like that.  The--whatever bad news there was didn't even get to you 'cause by the time--and, and, and I was in the projects six years before anybody got a television set, and then only one kid had one.  And they would put it out on the porch at night, and there'd be three or four hundred kids sitting out on the ground looking at this little screen about this big (demonstrates) that you couldn't even see (laughter), and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, when you were on--this is a question here.  When you were you on the--what's it buckaroo--the 'Broomstick Buckaroos' show--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --could you see yourself on TV?  I mean did you have a TV?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have a TV--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, and I couldn't see myself on TV 'cause we did--remember the shows were live, and there wasn't--they didn't have the repeats they'd show, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I could see 'Kukla, Fran and Ollie,' and, oh, "Good night Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are," ['The Jimmy Durante Show'].  What's the guy's name?  Anyway (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Jimmy Durante, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, Jimmy Durante--well, you know, we--right--Jimmy Durante, Bob Hope, Red Skelton.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) "Good night, Mrs. Calabash'--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mrs. Calabash, yeah.  Red Skelton, you know.  And I knew all the little jingles and stuff, you know, from the TV.  That's how I did a lot of my auditions; I'd go in there and say, you know, "The curtain is ascending and we thank you for attending, so before we (unclear), and you--may we ask--remember to be loyal to your gasoline and oil when they see me (unclear) and toil, you'll be glad."  I knew all of the commercials and all the little songs and stuff, so that's how I did most of my auditions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 609252
Speaker 1: I was gonna--I was asking you about sights, sounds and smells, you said no particular smells you associated with growing up, huh?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, because the projects [Aliso Village, Los Angeles, California] was also near the stockyard (laughter), so there were a few smells (laughter).  We had the stockyard behind us, and in front of us was a place called the National--National Foods [ph.], which had--brought all the fruit in, but--one day they brought lemons, one day they brought oranges, one day they brought grapefruit, you know.  So they were right across the river, and then the trains came by so, you know, there was a--so then they brought cattle through and stuff, so they were--they--but nothing, nothing that was dis--unpleasant, just, just--was there, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  What about sights?  Any special sights?
Speaker 2: Well, going back and forth to school [20th Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California], there were much--you know, we went through a park every day; that was about it.  When we--when I, when I got about seven or eight, I began to go downtown a lot--downtown Los Angeles [California].  So, of course there were sights there because there was, there was about nine theaters; there was the Million Dollar [Million Dollar Theatre, Los Angeles, California], the Orpheum [Orpheum Theatre, Los Angeles, California], the Paramount [Paramount Theatre, Los Angles, California].  There were clubs like the Ebony Room [Los Angeles, California] and everything, and in these clubs where, I guess, my thirst for the music showed, we'd see Louis Jordan, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Sauter Finegan [Sauter Finegan Orchestra], Stan Kenton, Count Basie, Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan (unclear) theater.  So I, I made it a point to stay outside the theaters at night and listen to music--not for any reason, just 'cause it sound good, you know.  I never longed to go in there and be on the stage or anything, but just, you know, I was just--
Speaker 1: Now, this is as a kid, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was seven or eight years old.  In fact, I would take the streetcar and go down the theater, and come home at three or four o'clock in the morning, and for the first six or seven months, my mother [Alma Williams Barnum] used to whip me and, and tell me to come home.  Then she'd begin to find out that I wasn't doing anything wrong, but I wasn't coming home either, and then it became, "Well, just make sure you're home in time to go to school," and then I found out, many years later, that she used to give the streetcar man fifty cents, and a lunch for him and me, and asked him to watch me and take care of me and make sure I didn't--you know, nobody bothered me at night.  But at that time, nobody bothered the kids, you know, so--
Speaker 1: This 1944--'43 [1943], '44 [1944]?
Speaker 2: This is, this is, this is like 1943, '44 [1944], yeah, until--and, and this happened 'til I, all the time 'til I was eight, ten years old, eleven years old.  I used to get on the streetcar and just go back and forth, and back and forth. The Pico ran from East L.A. [East Los Angeles, California] over to (Unclear) and Pico [Boulevard], turn around and went back.  I'd get off sometime and watch the--and go and sit in front of one of the theater doors, you know, and backstage, and listen to the music, go get back on the streetcar.  I wondered why I never had to pay (laughter), 'cause the guys knew me, and they were watching out for me.  My mother, my mother worked three jobs, so she just paid the guy and, and I found this out later that she gave the lad fifty cents, and he'd watch out for me.  So, I just--
Story_ID: 609253
Speaker 1: Was your mother [Alma Williams Barnum] home at night when you--?
Speaker 2: No.  My mother worked the shipyard at night.  She worked, she worked, you know, days work, you know, the maid's work, most of the daytime, and then whatever she could pick up during, you know, after that.  She worked two or three jobs.  Yeah, at the same time.
Speaker 1: So you were still bringing in money--were you still bringing in money?
Speaker 2: Not yet; I wasn't bringing in money yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Remember I--yeah, I didn't start bringing in money 'til I got about thirteen, fourteen.
Speaker 1: Well, I know you were--early on you said you were in radio, and that sort of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I--yeah, but then--but you know what?  But remember, no royalties, no residuals, no nothing, and probably whatever we made wasn't paying us that much 'cause we were--you know, I guess we were--you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So once you did whatever once, and got paid, that was it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was it, yeah, yeah.  We always had nice clothes, we had, we had nice shoes and stuff, you know.  Our place was always clean, we always had new furniture, but I found out that the furniture was kind of--mother was kind of of a scam artist; I'll tell you about that later.  But we always had nice furniture, and my mother always had a car, you know, so--and a lot of people in the projects [Aliso Village, Los Angeles, California] didn't, didn't have cars, you know.  She always had a nice car.  So probably the money took care of that, you know.  And then my mother was giving all the time, you know?  She took care of everybody around--I mean 'til the day she died.  I mean, the day she died, we had an apartment house; we must've had nine tenants we hadn't paid rent in six months.  So whatever she had, she gave out, you know, so--and when I say she was a scam artist, it's really funny.  My mother would bring this furniture home from the Goodwill store [Goodwill Industries International, Inc.].  Now, I didn't know it was a Goodwill store at that time--bring this furniture home.  She would meticulously, you know, go over it and sand it down and, you know--what do they call it when you stripe it, you know, make--you know and everything.  And then she would borrow on it from like--maybe it was Pacific Finance [Pacific Union Financial]; I'll never forget those guys 'cause I hate 'em.  And then, three or four months later, they would come pick our furniture up, then we would get more furniture three or four days later.  So I just thought it was like we were buying new furniture, but each time she'd redo the furniture and make it look really nice, you know (laughter), and then they would--so I say my mother's a scam artist 'cause we had beautiful furniture all the time, and then it would be gone, then it would be ugly, then it would be beautiful, then be gone.
Speaker 1: So the finance company--I mean the, the, the loan people thought it was new furniture.
Speaker 2: Well, I know, but it was beautiful; I mean, you know, it was enough--I guess she probably went and bought it for a few dollars or something like that.  But whatever it was, I know she wouldn't be making the payments 'cause they kept picking the furniture up, and then we had more furniture (laughter).  I'll--after I--after--when I got a little older and my mother and I would--you know, like I said, we were very close; I used to laugh, say, "Mama, you really had some games going on," you know.  But, you know--but, but we ate every day, and we had food for the neighbors and we gave to charity, you know.  And we went to things that other kids didn't go to, you know; we went, we went down--sometime we went to the theater as--to go the theater downtown a lot, you know.  We, we'd go to the park and we'd take lunch for everybody, you know.  We'd take--she'd have, you know, four or five baskets of food, invited all the people--the people at the park; she'd feed them, you know, so.
Story_ID: 609254
Speaker 1: Well, let me just go back a little bit and pick up Eddie Anderson, Rochester [Eddie "Rochester" Anderson].  What kind of--did--you know--relationship did you have with him (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not, not any real close contact, other than on the show ['The Jack Benny Program'].  We did a few engagements away from the, the show itself, and he would take me, you know.  But that's--I didn't really know him that well other than I knew who he was and, you know, of course, he was a big star.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And he was a big star in those days (unclear)--
Speaker 2: He was a very big star.
Speaker 1: 'Cabin in the Sky' was on, I think, Turner Classic Movies a couple days ago, 'cause I was--
Speaker 2: Actually, my friendship with Nick Stewart stayed longer than Mr., Mr. Anderson because Nick and I remained friends for the next thirty years.
Speaker 1: Now, now, who was Nick Stewart?
Speaker 2: Nick Stewart was Lightning, on 'Amos 'n' Andy,' and he was also the originator of the Ebony Showcase Theatre [Los Angeles, California]--founder, you know.  Nick was a very talented and a very, very good actor, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd forgotten that, but that's--some other people have told me about the, the theater, the Ebony Theatre, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Nick Stewart, yeah--yes.
Speaker 1: That was pioneering--that was a--to think that--hear somebody playing Lightning, astounds the Ebony Theatre.
Speaker 2: That's right; he knew--he discovered people like Brock Peters and James Edwards, and people like that; so, you know--came out of that Ebony Showcase Theatre.
Speaker 1: Hm.  Okay.  Was that like the first black theater in Los Angeles [California] that you know of?
Speaker 2: I think so, I think so.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: I know that--I know they were responsible for a lot of people getting training--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and Nick was, Nick was just a super person.
Speaker 1: Now, what was Mr. Stewart's personality like away from the Lightning character?  Was he--what was he like?
Speaker 2: He was a very nice man and, and--but, but a little bit naive to, to business.  Nick thought because it was good, because it had quality, because it was honest, that people would accept it, and I, and I--even I was saying to him, "Mr. Stewart," I said, "you know, we have to do something a little different here because these--people aren't just buying it 'cause it's good, they're gonna buy it because we market it properly, 'cause we--you advertise right and everything."  And the theater died a horrible death, because he would just--because the quality of what he was doing he felt so strong in it.  And I can understand that, you know.  We all wanna think our work is good and--look, sometime it's, it's the marketing that has--it's, it's a team effort, you know.  Our part is the quality of the product.  Somebody else's part is the quality of the marketing, somebody else's--and he refused to let those other people pick him apart because he thought so strongly in, in the quality in what we were doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had some very good shows that just died because nobody came 'cause there was no advertisement.  He thought just because he put the word out, "We're doing," you know.
Speaker 1: What was the span of his theater?  I mean it ran from what year to what year?
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm gonna think it ran from the early '60s [1960s] to about ten years ago when it actually went into bankruptcy and the city took it over and rebuilt a, a brand new modern state of the art theater there that is now called the Nate Holden theater [Nate Holden Performing Arts Center, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's, it's later that he started the theater company--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --after the--I guess it was right after the demise of 'Amos 'n' Andy.'
Speaker 2: Right after, right after the demise of the radio show, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay--the TV show, 'Amos 'n' Andy.'
Speaker 2: Well, after the radio show-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because while the TV show was going on, it was not at that same location, but there was an Ebony Showcase Theatre that, that formed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It, it moved at several locations before it wound up on Washington Boulevard.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 609255
Speaker 1: Tell us about--now, you went to 21st Street School [sic. 20th Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and what--did they have much of a arts program there or, or in grade school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was, that was, that was my first grade, and during that time we moved into the projects [Aliso Village, Los Angeles, California], so I never finished--I finished literally one semester at 21st Street School, then I went to, to the projects and I went to Utah Street School [Utah Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California], and that's where I went for my--all my, you know, primary school years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What--did they have much going in terms of the arts at Utah Street?
Speaker 2: Nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't even think we had a play.  We had a little auditorium, and I don't believe that--I can't recall ever having done anything in the auditorium.  The earliest I can recall starting to, to get into performance was when I went to junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is Jefferson Junior High School?
Speaker 2: No, Manu- Hollenbeck.
Speaker 1: Hollenbeck, okay.
Speaker 2: Hollenbeck Junior High School [Hollenbeck Middle School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did they--did they have a music program?
Speaker 2: They had an orchestra--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they had a band, and a track team.
Speaker 1: Now, did you run track?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you run (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I played a--well, I--let's go back to grammar school 'cause, 'cause grammar school--I played football in grammar school.  We had, at that time, football that played at the Coliseum [Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Los Angeles, California].  We played bef- we played our first half before the program started, and we played our--during the halftime we played our second half.
Speaker 1: So this is the pee wee football--I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean, what was the league called?
Speaker 2: Boy, you--'cause now I can see--now I can see Pop Warner [Pop Warner Little Scholars, Inc.].
Speaker 1: So, so you played before--
Speaker 2: It wasn't Pop Warner then; it was just football.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I--and I--
Speaker 1: Remember the name of your team?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: We just had a--I can remember some of the players like Glenn Suttle  [ph.] and Sugarfoot Gamble [ph.] who, who at one time, had a world's high jump record, went to Jordan [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California] I can--Grand Gridiron [ph.].  I can remember guys, but I don't remember--oh!  We were the junior Dons.
Speaker 1: The junior Dons.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had two teams in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] at that time; we had the Rams [Los Angeles Rams] and we had the L.A. Dons [Los Angeles Dons]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and our quarterback on the Dons was George Taliaferro; he was the first guy to start throwing jump passes.
Speaker 1: Hm.  I heard of him, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Glenn Dobbs, George Taliaferro, all of them, Fred Gehrke--a lot of the--I remem- it'll come back.  So we played football.  So, so when I got to junior high school, if you were sports and in the orchestra, that took you out of a lot of classes, so, you know, that was--my thing was, you know, how many classes can I get out of?  Now, I was very bad.  I went through a period where I, I fought every day, and I can't think of--even today, I can't think of what reason there was, but every day I was in a fight with somebody, and I don't think anybody said anything to me; I, I don't know why it all started, but I used to fight every day, and I got a swat every day.  In those days, the teachers were able to take a little paddle and, you know, give you one, and I had paddles with my name on 'em.  A couple a teachers made me a special paddle 'cause they knew they, they knew they'd see me during the day sometime--if not today, tomorrow.  And--but basically, my grades were good, you know, and, and I didn't have any idea about what I wanted to do in the future other than I wanted to make a hundred dollars a week, 'cause I figured if I make $100 a week, I could get my mother [Alma Williams Barnum] out of the projects, and that was it.  I was--I, I, I ran track in school, I joined a couple of organizations like the, the L.A. DAPs, which is the deputy, Deputy Auxiliary Police [Los Angeles Deputy Auxiliary Police].  I was a wood craft ranger.  I never joined the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], I, I don't know why.
Speaker 1: And you played one on the radio--hm; and that's something (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I never joined the Boy Scouts.  In wood craft we used--I guess, at that time it was kind of big, and it was equivalent to Boy Scouts.  And I, I traveled a lot around the city because I--you know, like I say, I ran track and stuff, so I'd always go to meets, even went to all comer meets, you know, where they--where you just go and, you know, go to run.  I still do--I did that up until about two years ago; I used to go to all comer meets and run.
Speaker 1: Up to two, three years ago?
Speaker 2: About two or three years ago, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so you were still running track.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm, I'm gonna go back to--I keep telling myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, what did you run?
Speaker 2: Hundred, 220 [220-yard dash], yeah.
Speaker 1: Hundred, 220, okay.
Speaker 2: I ran a couple a marathons and stuff, and all, but that was--
Story_ID: 609256
Speaker 1: The only eventful thing that happened at junior high school, I think, was, was the swats because Mr.--our vice principal, Mr. Dyer [Van Dyer]--I would wind up in his office probably three or four times in a week where the teachers just sent me to the vice principal's office to stay there, you know, until school was out.  And he wouldn't swat me but he would always talk to me, and basically, what he was telling me, that "If you keep acting like you're acting, you're never gonna be--amount to anything and--," somehow, he would get around to talking about his high school, about--you know, if, if, if I was--if I would be a good citizen, that I could go to this particular school, which was Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles [California].  And there would always be like the any of us thing, you know--, "If you're good, you get this, but if you keep acting the way you're acting, you're not gonna be worth anything, and blah, blah, blah."  And that stuck with me because when I graduated, I refused to go to the school that I was supposed to go to.  Oh, you asked about smells and stuff, too.  The, the kids now--I mean my son [Daniel Barnum], who goes to school; he drove back and forth to school, and everything--we walked to school.  Now, a couple years ago when they tore the projects [Aliso Village, Los Angeles, California] down, I went over and took a piece of rock from my apartment, you know; I wanted to keep that as a keepsake.  And as part of what I was doing, I walked my route to school and back, which is six miles--never thought about it when we were kids (laughter). I never thought about it.
Speaker 2: Six miles?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  My mother [Alma Williams Barnum] couldn't afford to send me in a streetcar every day, so I gotta walk to school; that was the closest junior high school to us.  And a lot of kids road the streetcars back and forth, or their parents maybe took 'em before they went to work, or something.  But we walked every day--almost every day.
Speaker 2: Did it take you a couple hours?  Three hours?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: As I was thinking about it, we--school started at 8:15 or 8:30, we probably leave home around 7:00, 7:15, and be--and you're laughing and talking and you're there, you know.  And walking home, you know, the only time I had a--I really realized how far it was or how long it was, we had a incident where one of the kids got killed at school, and they chased me home (laughter), and I remember being very tired when I got home.
Speaker 2: Who chased you?  I mean--
Speaker 1: Well, they--like I said our, our population was a very low percentage of black, and very high percentage of Hispanic.  Well, there came a time they were gonna have a big fight, you know.  This, this happened a lot.  But mostly in, in, in those situations, a fight would be a fight, it would be over and--
Speaker 2: And this is in junior high?
Speaker 1: This is in junior high school because when you went up to Hollenbeck [Hollenbeck Junior High School; Hollenbeck Middle School, Los Angeles, California], it was basically all Spanish and, like I say, a few Jewish kids.  Herbie Alpert, Lou Adler--
Speaker 2: Herb Alpert, Lou Adler.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we, we went to junior high school with them.  We've been friends for a long time.  Herb Alpert, Lou Adler--let me try to think of somebody else that went to that school.  One of the guys I had a fight with was a guy name Don Jordan, who became lightweight champion of the world.  I'll tell you about our fight; we had a monumental fight one day.  I'm trying to think of some of the other kids that went to our school.  Oh, Bob Gibson--Bob "Hoot" Gibson [Robert L. Gibson], astronaut--flew the--flew (unclear) shuttle.  I'm not sure if he flew the Commander, or one of the shuttles.
Speaker 2: He was one of the original seven, right?
Speaker 1: No, he wasn't one of the original--no, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, he came on later on.  He was a French horn player.  And I think we had a few other people went to our school, too--it'll, it'll come back.  Anyway, Mr. Dyer would tell me about the school (background noise)--
Story_ID: 609257
Speaker 1: --Brooklyn.  Brooklyn, so--
Speaker 2: He was a photographer, so.
Speaker 1: You were asking me about Brooklyn and Soto [Los Angeles, California]--asking about Hollenbeck Junior High School [Hollenbeck Middle School, Los Angeles, California], and most of the Jewish people lived--and that, that was a little--you know--like Fairfax [Los Angeles, California] is now, that was the area, you know--yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Mr. Dyer [Van Dyer] would talk to me every day about Manual Arts [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California] and you gotta remember, this is a time before the freeways.  There was only one freeway in Los Angeles [California], that was the Pasadena Freeway [Arroyo Seco Freeway], which like it was the first freeway in the, in the world, and there was no 5 [Interstate 5] and all that stuff there; there was--all that area was just a
Speaker 2: Well, what is a Pasadena?  Is that the one--
Speaker 1: Pasadena is the, is the 110 [State Route 110].
Speaker 2: 110, okay.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  And that was the only freeway; everything else was--hadn't been built yet, so the area where all the freeways and stuff are--projects--that was all like a big hill where we played; that was our playground, that was our--we knew that like, like the general; we knew that like the back of our hands, you know.  And Mr. Dyer would talk to me every day as he paddled me, so when I graduated from school, I refused to go to my high school, which was Roosevelt High School [Theodore Roosevelt High School, Los Angeles, California].  I wanted to go to Manual Arts.
Story_ID: 609258
Speaker 1: Backing up just a minute.  Like I say, I used to fight every day.  Well, kids would fight and they would--you know, we could be fighting this minute, and the next minute we'd be playing football and, you know, having a ball.  So, you know, nobody thought about shooting anybody or anything like that.  Well--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, that--before the--we were interrupted the first time--I'm sorry to keep jumping around, for whoever's watching this right now, but you were telling us about the time when someone was killed and you had to run home (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm--yeah, I'm--this is all--it's all kind of related.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, all right, okay.
Speaker 1: So there was, there was supposed to be a fight after school on Friday, so--
Speaker 2: A fight between--
Speaker 1: The Mexicans and the blacks.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, we showed up with--all the guys we could muster was maybe twelve guys (laughter), and there must've been nine thousand Mexicans out there in trucks and stuff, you know.  Now, you must remember, we all go to school together, everybody's--but this is now gonna be a fight.  So I was trying to negotiate that we should wait until tomorrow, which would've been Saturday, when we could get more guys in the fight.  And there was one guy that was, you know, that maybe that was standing--maybe three of us standing here--guy name Phillip--we call him Potts [ph.].  Phillip was standing next to me, and one of the guys that was--that I was talking to, he was really cool; I mean we--, "We'll come tomorrow, we'll meet--," such as that.  But there was one guy in the back I think he--I hear, and I don't know to this day, that he'd just gotten out of jail.  He was kind of dingy anyway, in the head.  He pushed me, so knowing that I'm still outnumbered, I just kept my hands down.  Well, Phillip reacted to the push, and the next thing I knew, there was--something went past me like this (demonstrates), and actually caught part of my shirt, and it was a knife and it stuck right in his heart.  So, that's when I said--well we all start running and--god, I can remember like yesterday.  Phillip, Phillip (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So this is junior high school [Hollenbeck Junior High School; Hollenbeck Middle School, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 1: Junior high school.  Phillip Childress [ph.]--Phillip Childs- Phillip Childress.  Anyway, he, he tried to run and he died right there on the spot.  Well, that made the next couple of weeks--I mean, no black kids would go to school without their parents taking 'em to school, and--, "We're gonna kill all of you," you know--just one of those things.  During this time, we were--we--when we first--after, after a couple a weeks, we started walking home again, and we started walking in a group, so it maybe have been seven or eight of us walking in a group, and we got to the corner of 1st [Street] and Clarence [Street], which is right there at the--we're almost home now, and here come about nine cars, and they jump out, and they got us right there in the corner, up against a wall.  And Don Jordan, who they call Geronimo, he was, he was, he was half-black and half-Hispanic, but he was like the run--leader of the gang; I mean--and now people go back, literally, they'll remember him 'cause he--I mean this--when I say gang, it was a gang.  I mean gang.  So Don--he--they had us up against a wall, and they were talking about they wanna kill us and everything, and he walked on, he slapped one of the guys, you know and, and I just stood there, you know, then he walked--I remember Conwell Morton [ph.] was the next guy he slapped.  Conwell was eleven, probably weighed 260 [pounds], looked like a mountain.  He slapped Conwell, Conwell start crying.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, you know, we're all just--I mean the oldest kid there must've been fifteen, you know.  So, then he came to me, and when he drew back to slap me, I hit him.  Now, you know, like in all bully gangs and stuff, "Oh, you gonna get it now."  'Cause see, now, everybody that--even the guys with him, they wanna--they would like to see how tough he is, too, so they all back up.  "Oh, you gonna get it."  So we fought for about thirty minutes; we sit down and rested, then we got up and fought a little bit longer, then we sit down and rested again.  Meanwhile, I mean cars are going by, you know?  So, then we fought--the third time we got through fighting, after we got through fighting, he said, "You get on out of here," meaning me.  I took off.  Man, they beat the other guys up.  Man, they broke one of the guys' ribs and they beat him up real bad (laughter).  But they didn't kill him; they didn't kill anybody else, and the killing was just a--I mean that, that never happened.  I mean, I never saw anything like that in my whole time of growing up--people shooting each other or something like that, you know.  But that was really funny.

Speaker 1: So, now we're going back to Mr. Dyer [Van Dyer]; he's--we're talking about this--about Manual Arts [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California].  So, now I refused to go to Roosevelt [Theodore Roosevelt High School, Los Angeles, California].  I go sit in the office, I won't go to class, they call my mother [Alma Williams Barnum] and she says, "Well, he doesn't wanna go to that school."  They said, "Well, he can't go to another school because he doesn't live in that other area."  So, I say, "Mama, I wanna go to Manual Arts 'cause Mr. Dyer said I couldn't go there and everything, but I know I can go; I wanna go to that school."  So she said, "If you can get there, you can go there."  I said, "Okay."  The first thing I did, I went to Manual Arts, which was on 42nd [Street] and Vermont [Avenue], probably twelve miles, thirteen miles from where I lived--in a real nice part of town at that time; 42nd and Vermont was very nice.  This is a school of three thousand, three thousand students, probably twenty Hispanic, fifty black, rest, rest white, James Doolittle [James H. Doolittle], Kathryn Grayson.  That's, that's the kind of school; I mean it's really one of the most prestigious, prestigious schools in the country.  It's in a lot of books and everything--Manual Arts High School, the student government--I mean a really big time school.  So, I know I gotta have an address so I, I go on 42nd Street and I find a house, and I take the address; I go back to school and I, I register what--I live with my auntie; this is my address.  I go in to get--you know, get some classes, and at that time all the first year students had to take ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  Well, somebody was telling us, said, "Man, ROTC you have to march every day, you have to wear your uniform and everything."  I said, "I don't wanna do that; how do you get out of that?"  Said, "Well, if you're in the band, you only have to march once a week."  So, I went to the band director, Mr. John Ferrar [ph.].  I said, "Mr. Ferrar," I said, "I, I wanna register to get in the band."  He said, "What do you play?"  I said, "Violin."  He said, "We don't have any violins in the band."  But this guy was one of my mentors and one of the greatest people in my life next to my mother and--I mean he really--said, "We don't have any violins."  I mean he was really abrupt like that, you know.  I said, "Well, well," and, and then he said, "Can you carry a tuba?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  So he said, "Okay, I'll put you in the band."  So, I registered in school, I was in the band, and the first month went by really good, you know.  Oh--now, in order to get to school, like I said, my mother had worked two or three jobs.  Now, at this time, I'm not doing any of that other stuff; all that's over with and I'm, I'm just a student.  But in order to get to school, my mother said, "I can't afford this."  You know, 'cause to ride a streetcar, it's maybe fifteen, twenty cents.  She said, "You'll have to get to school on your own."  So, I hitchhiked to school every day for three years.  But it got so cool that I could be--if I met my ride like at 6:45, I'd meet the same guy, he'd take me right there to, to Figueroa [Street] and--to Santa Barbara [Santa Barbara Avenue; Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard] and Vermont [Avenue], and I just had to walk a block to school.  If I missed him coming home, I'd have a problem 'cause I'd be out there a long time hitchhiking.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She got a chance to work out at the base during the war? She just wouldn't do it.  Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm glad my mother [Alma Williams Barnum] did because I got so much information like, you know, like buying stocks and stuff like that what--that we never would have had access to.  So anyway I, I went to school [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California], I got in the band, and after about the first month, two things happened.  The first thing happened is I got called into the principal's office, Mr. Hahn [ph.], and he told me, he says, "Barnum [HistoryMaker H. B. Barnum], where do you live?"  And I said, "Oh, I--my--uh-I--uh--I'm--." There was a lady sitting there, she just start laughing.  So he said, "What street you live on?"  I say, "Oh, I live on 42nd Street."  "What's your address?"  "I--bo--I--bo--." I had forgotten that address, you know.  So, at this point I mean I, I, I know I'm in trouble but I don't know, I don't know what the situation is; I know I'm in trouble.  The lady says, "Well, is he a good student?"  So Mr. Hahn says, "Yeah, well he, he hasn't had any trouble here."  I, I had no fights, nothing, you know.  He say, "He's in the band, and he's in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps]."  She say, "Well, I'm his auntie then; he lives with me."  And I looked and that was the lady's house that I (unclear).  And what happened, they probably been sending correspondence to her house, and she was coming to school to find out, "Why is this coming here?"  You know, so that became one of my mentors, too.  So, anyway, the next thing that happened was--
Speaker 1: Who--did you get to know the lady?  I mean she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we--yeah; she, she passed about four years ago.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, is this a white lady?
Speaker 2: Miss Warren [ph.]--no, black--no, white lady--yeah, I'm sorry, yeah, a white lady.
Speaker 1: A white lady.
Speaker 2: Miss Warren, yeah.  So--
Speaker 1: So when you were growing up in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], you weren't in a segregated school or anything like that.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I
Speaker 1: Your school was always mixed.
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't find out about segregation 'til I was about thirteen when I was working my first band thing, you know--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that I really--I mean you, you knew, but you didn't know, you know, 'cause, you know.  But
Speaker 1: So high school, you're about--it's about what?  This is in the early '50s [1950s] now, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm, I'm only twenty-one, so we're--I'm just recalling this, just--history (laughter).
Speaker 1: I, I understand.
Story_ID: 609261
Speaker 1: So, the next thing that happened was (makes sound), that tuba I was carrying was heavy and cold--that old tuba, you know, and I only weighed 125 pounds.  So I went up to Mr. Ferrar [John Ferrar (ph.)], "Mr. Ferrar," I say, "I don't wanna play the tuba anymore."  He say, "Why not?"  I say, "Because I, I wanna play something else."  He say, "Well, you can't play anything else."  I say, "But I could learn something else."  He said, "How you gonna learn it?"  I said, I said, "Can I, can I take something home and learn?"  He say, "Yeah.  Are you gonna learn by yourself?"  I say, "Yes, sir."  He says, "What are you wanna learn?"  I say, I say, "What do you need in the band?"  He say, "We need clarinets."  I say, "Can I, can I take a clarinet home?"  He say, "Yeah, you can take it home."  He just laughed, you know.  About three weeks later, somebody else was carrying the tuba, and I was playing with the clarinets.  I mean I went home and just got that thing and looked at the book and (demonstrates).  So this began a whole thing with me because Mr. Ferrar, he would challenge me to things, you know.  Like, like he would say, "Aw, look, they need a--there's gonna be an opening in the all-city orchestra for French horn next semester."  I say, "Ooh, you think I could do it?"  He said, "Nah, you couldn't do it."  I say, "Well, can I borrow a French horn?"  "Yes, sir."  And next year, I was in this all-city orchestra playing French horn.  And that's the way I learned how to play different instruments; it was almost like, it was almost like somebody learning languages; I could learn instruments by myself, and I could've just played in the orchestra at school and then play in the all-city orchestra and, and I, I developed piano playing by just sitting down and learning, and it was, it was almost like a game, you know.  But I can see what he did--now I can see it; I couldn't see it then.  So--and I used to hate him 'cause sometime he'd make me feel--I mean he--you know, he'd say, "How do you think you're gonna learn that?  It takes people years to learn something like that," you know.  I say, "Well I--can I, can I take it home?"  I even took a bass home one time, and I didn't get home 'til almost eleven o'clock 'cause nobody would pick me up in--hitchhiking, you know.  So I had to wait 'til almost eleven o'clock 'til a guy on the bus--streetcar let me get on with the, with the bass.  'Cause when I was with people, you know, he would make it--so I really--I mean Mr. Ferrar was a guy that just, just drove me, drove me, drove me, and drove me.
Speaker 2: Now, how many instruments did you learn how to play?
Speaker 1: Well, in high school [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California] I learned how to play French horn, flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, harp, all--the percussion stuff was easy 'cause just a matter of (demonstrates), you know.  So, I could basically play anything that there is to play, you know.  So--and I got good enough where I could, you know, I couldn't do no, no solos, but if I had to sit in a section and play a part, I could do that 'cause I could read very good, you know--read the music very good.  So that, that kind of got me through school, you know--that and playing a little football, running a little track and stuff.  I didn't have to go to too many classes.
Story_ID: 609262
Speaker 1: So, did you--well, how did you do in football?  Did you start on a team, or did you--
Speaker 2: I started for a few minutes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You played back?
Speaker 2: A running--a running back, yeah.  And we played--I went both ways--played, played corner and played running back.  We had a--we won a champion- we won a city championship, Manual Arts [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California], yeah.  And I played--and then I began to form what I wanted to do.  I liked to travel, I liked to go places, so I said, "What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna come out of school and play professional football."  You must remember I'm still hitting about 130 [pounds] now (laughter), and I'm gonna become a presidential--go to the Federal Bureau [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and become a presidential bodyguard.
Speaker 1: Now, just to go back a little bit now, were you inspired--I know Jackie Robinson's from Southern California--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) Didn't--
Speaker 1: Did you know anything about him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew about him but I--that, that, that wasn't--I didn't really want to--my heroes at the time as far as football were Bob Waterfield--
Speaker 1: Okay; he's a quarterback for the Rams [Los Angeles Rams].
Speaker 2: For the Rams. George Taliaferro, the, the--you know; Fred Gehrke was a hero.  I loved the New York Yankees 'cause I, I had a chance to meet Elston Howard and Mickey Mantle so I, I was a Yankee fan.  I had met Bill Russell so I was a Celtic [Boston Celtics] fan, you know.  So I, I, I--my sports heroes--the music wasn't in any part of my world, other than I was doing it 'cause it, it, it gave me a chance to, you know, go on the road and go places and meet a lot of different people and, and make a few bucks [dollars].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what about Rafer Johnson?  Was he--was--he's about the same age as you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Rafer's 'bout the same age; I mean Rafer might have one year on me 'cause he--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he's my sister [Billie Barnum], my sister's boyfriend.
Speaker 1: Woody Strode would've been old--really?
Speaker 2: Oh, Woody Strode; I love Woody Strode, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think of the California athletes out here that come to mind.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm trying to think of who also, who also was--my mind was set on, you know, like this (gesture), and I was seeing this, and I was--
Speaker 1: Now, what made you think you could be a pro football player?  I mean, you know, were you--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was fast, I was tough.
Speaker 1: Were you one of the stars on the team when you won the city championship?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was kind of tough, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  I mean would you--did you get recognition in the city?
Speaker 2: Not as much as Jon Arnett and, and, and, and Roberts [C.R. Roberts] did, but I was on--I was there, you know.
Speaker 1: And Jon--and Jaguar Jon Arnett--
Speaker 2: That's right, Jaguar Jon, that's right.
Speaker 1: --of the Rams.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had a fast backfield, man; we were fast, you know.
Speaker 1: So, Arnett played in your back? Was he?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the boss.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  But you got some recognition and--
Speaker 2: A little bit, yeah, 'cause I would, you know, run back a couple a kickoffs and stuff, you know.  I was fast; it was, it was a sprinter, you know--sprinter speed.  Some of the juniors on the team were--I was a senior then--were like Earnel Durden who played at Oregon State [Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon]; he was a All-American.  James Bates who played for the Cardinals, the old St. Louis Cardinals.  His brother--his younger brother won the 440 [440-yard dash] Olympics.
Speaker 1: Hm.  So--and your--Rafer Johnson used to date your sister?
Speaker 2: Yeah; they went to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] together.
Speaker 1: Now what happened now?  Something tells me--there's a story behind George Taliaferro.  What happened to him?
Speaker 2: I don't know what happened to George.  I, I just remember 'cause the league disbanded.  I don't know the year, but you remember the--that was the--that was--we had, we had two teams here, and I think the leagues, the leagues merged.  This was before the American Football [American Football League] thing--before the Calif- so they merged; the leagues merged--all those teams became--and I think--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so he played in the--what, the All-American Football Conference [sic. All-America Football Conference] with the Browns [Cleveland Browns] and the rest of them.
Speaker 2: I think so, yeah.  And the, and the--
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know in the late '40s [1940s] they had what's called the All-American Conference with the Browns being the key team in that--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, I'm not sure; I think the All-American Conference might've still been what we call the NFL [National Football League] now.  I think it was--there was still another league.  I think the most--may--only eight or ten teams, but I know George--I remember George Taliaferro 'cause I remember he used to jump and throw that jump pass at 'em, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--now did you have any football offers from colleges, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I couldn't take 'em 'cause I couldn't--I had to work and my--you know, my--you know, and I could, I could, I could have--probably could have went to Ohio [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], I probably could have went to one of the California schools.
Speaker 1: Did they send you like a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --mail and--okay.
Speaker 2: --but I, I, I--by that time--when I, when I got--when I was thirteen, I started going out on the road and I started making eighty, ninety dollars a week, you know, playing music.
Story_ID: 609263
Speaker 1: So that was to get me through to get to the next level which would've been to get in the, the presidential situation.
Speaker 2: So you were--now, where did you get the idea of becoming a presidential bodyguard?
Speaker 1: Because that was, 'cause that was--that you traveled all over the world--'cause the president travels all the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But did you have any--was there any black example of that, or any example of that, that you knew of?
Speaker 1: No, on my--my mind was--remember, I was gonna make me a hundred dollars a week, I was gonna travel and see the world, and that--what better way to travel with the president, you know--that--you know.  And I take--I took the, took the exam for the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation]--
Speaker 2: The president at that time was Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower], right?
Speaker 1: The president at that time was Truman [President Harry S. Truman] when I was coming up--that--there's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: --Truman, then Eisenhower.
Speaker 2: Is that when you got the idea--when Truman--
Speaker 1: Well, I always--even young, I, I--young, I wanted to travel because even when I'd go--when I get on the streetcar and ride all over the place and see things, you know, I wanted to travel, I wanted to see what was, what was out there.  My mother [Alma Williams Barnum] had never experienced travel, but she read a lot, so she used to talk about different things, you know.  And then, and then the people I was working with like, like your Jack Bennys and those kind of people, talked about things and different countries, and stuff like that, so that kind of gets in you and I wanna see what's out there, you know--what, what else.  I mean I know there's more than what's here.  Not that I'm--I was very happy in my childhood in, in the projects [Aliso Village, Los Angeles, California], but I knew there was something else out there and I wanted to see it, and I didn't figure I'd--you know, I'd never had any yearning to be a star or nothing, so I figure what I can do if I was with somebody who was a star with, with some high level--and, and another thing, too.  I always--even when I didn't have anything, I always wanted to be--travel in good style.  One of the things I do now, no matter what artist I work with, the first thing we talk about is not my salary--what they're gonna pay me, how am I gonna travel?  I need first class air transportation; I need a suite.  Now, now we'll talk about the other money.  If you can't do that, then we don't even need to talk, you know.  I mean you, you know, just--and the only time I ever, ever, ever backed off of that is when on with Ray Charles and Joe [Joe Adams] says, "We don't give anybody first class air.  We don't give--we don't, we don't do that to our musicians."  So I said to him, "Okay, just give me what you pay for your coach tickets; I'll by my own ticket 'cause I wanna travel first class," but I wanted to work with Ray."  So that--you know, that--so even at a young age I wanted to--you know, if I was with the president or somebody high level like that, you know you're gonna be, you know, first class.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know you're gonna live good, you're gonna see a lot of things, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay, but those were your aspirations when you were on the verge of graduating from high school [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 1: That was just--that was my--
Speaker 2: --being a presidential bodyguard.
Speaker 1: Even, even when I was a little boy I wanted to travel; I didn't know by what venue yet, but I want--or by what means.  I, I wanted to travel, I wanted to, I wanted to get away and do things.
Story_ID: 609264
Speaker 1: Well, just tell us about graduation.  Now, you graduated in what year from Manual Arts [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: I graduated in nineteen fifty (makes noise)--1954.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a matador.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I was gonna go to school, and I was--and I'm thinking, you know, maybe UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], maybe even Ohio [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], even Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  I'm thinking all these schools, and I've got some letters here that say they'll, you know, what conditions I can come under, and--but I'd started traveling with bands, and I'd started singing with groups, and I'd started making a little money.
Speaker 1: Well let's--well, what was the first band you got with or singing group?
Speaker 2: I think it was Chuck Higgins.
Speaker 1: And this is while you were still in high school?
Speaker 2: This is when I was thirteen.  No, you know what?  I think the first time I went away from home was with The Robins.  I went to Harrah's in, in, in Reno--Lake Tahoe [Harrah's Lake Tahoe, Stateline, Nevada]--with The Robins, 'cause one of the guys got sick or got drunk or something, and they called me up in the middle of the night and told me that I could sing with the group.  Now, I had been, you know, practicing and stuff like that with them, and so I--
Speaker 1: 'Bout what year is that?  Is that--were you--are you still in high school?
Speaker 2: I'm still in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, in my early in high school; probably my first year in high school 'cause I know, I know I was like thirteen.
Speaker 1: Now, it says, it says--I, I got a note here; it says that you started singing at fourteen as Pee Wee Barnum.
Speaker 2: No, I--Pee Wee Barnum was before that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I start--that was, that was when I was seven or eight because I had a contract with Imperial Records, Lew Chudd.  Eddie Ray was the A and R [artists and repertoire] man.  I recorded as Pee Wee Barnum 'cause Sugar Chile Robinson and I were like kind of, you know, the same time.  He was, he was, he was really hot with his thing, and they were trying to make me, you know, in this little child star; I couldn't sing, though.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were about eight years old.
Speaker 2: I was seven or eight years old, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, you, you might find a picture on the Internet of me sitting at the piano at CBS, and that's during the time that I was doing a--yeah.  Oh, no, when I was thirteen I was--I wasn't singing at all, I was trying to play with, play with these bands and get as many gigs as I could.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're doing this all through high school--you're playing, playing music.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  That's a big part of high school we haven't talked about (laughter).  Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you--'cause you know, while I'm going to school, I'm playing at night at clubs, I'm sneaking in and out of clubs.  The big club here in town was called the Oasis [Club Oasis, Los Angeles, California]; I could go in there and play.  I'll tell you my Dinah Washington story.  When I was thirteen, I could go in the clubs and play; they'd put me in the back room until time to play.  I go out there and play and go in the back room again, you know.  My mother [Alma Williams Barnum] said, "Long as you're up in time for school you, you can do it."  'Cause she knew, she knew I was gonna do it anyway.
Story_ID: 609265
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever go to Fremont High School [John C. Fremont High School, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: No, I went to Manual Arts [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I see I got a note here about Fremont.  All right.  So--all right.
Speaker 2: A lot of people had me at Fremont, Jeff [Thomas Jefferson High School, Los Angeles, California], L.A. High [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California]'cause I used to run a--I would be all over the place.
Speaker 1: So, were you in a band with Ronald Barrett?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was in his own little group.  I, I had a band, too; I had a group called The Circats, H. B. Barnum and the Circats, and Ronald Barrett, Arthur Wright [Arthur G. Wright], Jimmy Benson, and Glenn Wade were the other members of the band.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  Now, did he go to Fremont?
Speaker 2: Arthur, Glenn and Ronnie went to Fremont.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Ronnie was a quarter miler.  One of the things about that band, we were all athletes.  Ronnie was an athlete; he ran the quarter in 220 [220-yard dash].  Arthur ran the mile, Glenn was a sprinter like myself.  We would go up to the cities, say like we were in Casper, Wyoming for a week.  We--to get advertising for the club, we would challenge the college track team to a meet, and we would win, 'cause we'd, we'd, we'd kill 'em in sprints, we'd kill 'em in the mile, we'd kill 'em in the long jump.  They'd win the pole vault and this--but we'd have more points.  And that would get--the club owners just loved it 'cause we'd go in the city and say, "The band--the H. B. Barnum Circats gonna be at--," you know, wherever the club was, "and, and they're gonna run a track meet against the--."  You know, and we'd go and we'd wipe 'em out, man.  So we were all--we just stayed in shape, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, H. B. Barnum Cir--now how do you spell the last, now what's--
Speaker 2: H. B. Barnum and the Circats, C-I-R-C-A-T-S.
Speaker 1: R-C-A--Circats, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  We played Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] and we played Tahoe and Reno [Nevada]; we played--
Speaker 1: So it's almost like circus but, but with cats.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The cats were in a band--in a musician--Circats.
Speaker 2: All that--Casper, Wyoming, Billings, Montana, Portland [Oregon]--
Speaker 1: So you were capitalizing on the name Barnum in the circus, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the Circus, that's right, that's what--yeah.
Speaker 1: H. B. Barnum Circats.
Speaker 2: And the Circats.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.
Story_ID: 609266
Speaker 1: Did this take a lot of time in high--now, you were really busy.  You sound like throughout your whole life, you were really busy.
Speaker 2: Since I'm growing up, I, I--my mother [Alma Williams Barnum] said if, if, if I--if--she said, "What are you doing?"  I said, "Nothing." Bap (gesture).  You better be doing something, you know.  For one thing, it'll keep you out of trouble if you're doing something, you know.  And if you keep doing something, something's gonna add up pretty soon, you know.  So that's what I'm, I'm--that's what people tell me, "You're always busy."  Yeah, I wanna stay busy--stay out of trouble.  I ain't never had no drugs, I never--I just start drinking about ten years ago, and so--being busy, you know.  I--and I--and a variety of things that I did, too, you know.  I would, I would--like I was just telling you, you know, off mic with some of the things I was doing, and all this was all happening at the same time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so after graduation from high school [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California], you were already doing gigs, so you just kept--
Speaker 2: In, in high school I was gigging.
Speaker 1: So you just kept, kept gigging.
Speaker 2: Just kept gigging.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Kept gigging.  I went on the road with--I mean I did one show for, for the Weinbergs [ph.] out of, out of North Carolina.  They were big promoters, and we did--we would do like ninety one nighters in, in ninety-six days, see.  And I
Speaker 1: Down south?
Speaker 2: Huh?  Oh, all over.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I mean we'd start in New Orleans [Louisiana] all the way to New York [New York] so, you know, we'd go all the way through--in Georgia, the Carolinas, you know--Tennessee.  And I would, I would be playing with--let's see, I would come on the--come on the stage with the band, play an opening number with Choka Campbell [ph.], see; it was a--it was the name of the bandleader.  I'd run offstage, change clothes, come back and play piano for Etta James.  I'd run offstage, come back and sing with The Five Keys.  I'd run offstage, come back and play with Bill Doggett.  I'd run offstage, come back and play with Little Richard, run offstage.  So I'd be, I'd be working many as fifteen (unclear) a show.  I'd be working with seven or eight of 'em, you know, and not knowing any business, I'd be making maybe one hundred dollars a week 'cause they--each one paid me a little bit, where probably I should be making that with each group.  But, you know--but it was, it was a learning experience.  Two things.  I learned how to do a lot of things, and also I met a lot of different people, so all these people have been around my life the whole time, you know.  You can ask almost any artist, and they see me and they say, "Oh, yeah, I know him," you know.  And hopefully, it's good all the time, you know, 'cause they used me.  But it was all right 'cause I was, I was enjoying myself and it was just furthering my cause, you know.  And I was having a good time, I was traveling.  I was traveling in good style.  Most of the acts with me when I--whenever we did stop at a hotel, would be sharing rooms; I'd always have my own room.  If I had to pay for it, it didn't matter, but I wasn't--that wasn't gonna be the end of my trip anyway, so I--this is--you know, I just built myself like that.
Speaker 1: So you always had your own room and had--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, so.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Story_ID: 609267
Speaker 1: Let's see.  So-- what were things like trav- did you do much traveling in the South--well, any part of the country.  These are the days of segregation, North and South a lot of times, so.
Speaker 2: The first time I really realized it and then after I went to Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] with the, with The Robins, then I went on the road with Chuck (Unclear), Jimmy Reed and Little Walter, and our first stop was Wichita Falls, Texas, and it was a all-white crowd, so we could not go out in the audience anytime during the show; we couldn't have anybody come back to the dressing room.  I remember filling up at a gas station in Sanderson, Sanderson, Texas, and I remember--and I--you know, being thirteen, fourteen years old, you don't--I mean you, you, you know there's segregation, you hear it's segregation, but you don't really know what it is, you know.  And I remember they were asking us--there's, there's some black guys on the thing, and they say, "Hey man, can you bring us something to eat?"  He say, "Oh, you can eat right over there."  So, he took off and ran across the street, you know, into the place where we--so we went in and sat down, you know.  And the waitress walked past us about four or five times, and then very nicely, she came and said, "You know, we can't serve you boys in here."  "Well, the man just told us."  "Oh, he's back there." Now, to me, that was kind of funny, you know, but I, I--it didn't--you know--and then when I start seeing, you know, colored and white drinking fountains and bathrooms, and coming and, and, and going into hotels--'course I didn't know about Hiltons [Hilton Hotels and Resorts] and stuff like that, but the hotels we go at, they were always pretty funky, you know.  Now, that don't mean they weren't nice, but they weren't--if I look back now, I'd say, "Boy, that was a terrible--I had my own room and stuff but it was just a terrible place to be, you know."  Encountered trouble a few times.  One time in Nashville [Tennessee].  And this is going up; this is up to '64 [1964] now.  We were playing in a Quonset hut, you know, a big fairground, big thing, a rope down the middle, and this is where they had a black and white audience, white people on one side, black people on the other side.  All of this to me was almost funny; it was--'cause I guess if you don't really live in it, you know that it's gonna be over pretty soon.  So I--it was things I, I could--I wouldn't--I wasn't ever afraid, I wasn't ever threatened or anything.  But what happened is somebody cut the rope in the middle of the dance hall, and everybody just start dancing together, and all of a sudden there was like a loud noise; somebody drove one of those big trucks into the side of the wall, and people just start running and screaming and coming--I thought I heard gunshots; I'm not sure I did, but--so I ran out and I jumped on the bus.  But I thought about it.  Say, if I run on the bus, somebody shooting, I better get under the bus, so I got under there with the baggage, and then I took a drumstick and I stuck it under the--the locks go like this (demonstrates), you know, so I stuck a stick in here (demonstrates) so nobody could pull the lock over from outside.  And then I waited, but I could hear all this commotion going on and stuff, and I was, I was, I was scared but I wasn't scared, you know.  I'm, I'm pretty cool under fire.  But then all had got quiet for a few minutes then I smelled smoke, and I said, "What?  I think this bus is on fire."  So, you know I'm--it's dark where I am, so I reach up and get the stick to pull it out and it broke, so there was only a little piece like that (demonstrates) in there and I can't get it out.  And I got my shoe off, I'm hitting it with my hand man, like that, and I'm yelling, and of course nobody's gonna hear me in there, you know.  And I'm thinking, this bus is on fire, I'm gong die, and then I got scared.  So, I got out, you know.  And that's one time I was kind of scared.
Speaker 1: Was the bus on fire?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  It was on fire, yeah (laughter).
Story_ID: 609268
Speaker 1: Another time I got scared--let me tell--I'm trying to think it's Chattanooga [Tennessee], I wasn't scared 'cause Chattanooga I was in a hotel room and I saw the police beat a guy and I guess, I guess he, he must probably was dead 'cause they--he wouldn't, he wouldn't fall down.  He just kept fighting at the police and they were beating him.  He was there--I was in a hotel
Speaker 2: Chattanooga police?  The white police beating a, a black man?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Chattanooga, yeah, yeah, a black man, and he was, he was a--but he had cut one of the policemen.  He cut--when he hit his mustache, and his, his lip was hanging like that, with a razor, and they were beating him.  If he'd fell--fallen down, they probably would've stopped, but he, he kept, you know, fighting and they just kept hitting him and, and, it very--sounded like that at first (stomps his foot), then it sounded like that (taps his foot) when they was hitting him, you know.  And I, and I--that was, that was very shocking to me.  Now, I made us all scared (laughter).  This is the bad side.  We were in--god, a lot of things happened in Texas.  We were in Texas one time, and all the guys--the band guys would meet the little girls, you know.  So, we were--it was five of us in a car pulling a little trailer on the back with all our stuff in it.  So they had finished the gig, and I guess this little girl was going to get friendly, so the guys were taking turns, right, with this girl in the trailer.  We, we sitting out there at one o'clock in the morning, and they, they--you know.  So now, it's my turn, but I don't--really don't--I'm, I'm like--the '50s [1950s] like--but I don't know why I even got in there, but as I got--well, the police came, but they had the back of the trailer and all the instruments sitting outside, so the police--, "What you boys doing here?"  I hear 'em talking.  "Oh, we just loading up, sir."  "Well, load up."  Now, I'm back in the back with this girl, you know.  I, I'm not--I got my clothes on and everything but--and, and they try to make small talk so the police would leave so they could take the back off of the trailer.  The police just sit there.  Seem like an eternity went by.  Now, I'm thinking, I say my mother [Alma Williams Barnum] said to me, "Now, I'm gone let you go, but you know you can be at the wrong place at the wrong time and you can get in trouble, and you know my advice."  That's what she's always leaving you with.  "You know you gotta be careful what you're doing, be careful who you hang out with and--," you know.  And man, it seem like I was in there a year, man, and the police would not leave, man, and the guys just kept talking and telling--and the police would say, "Well, you know, when you going load up?" (Laughter) But they finally left but I, but I thought about that after.  I say, I have to be careful; I don't wanna even think about doing nothing wrong 'cause, 'cause you'll get caught even when you're, when you're not the--not the one, you know.  But I never will forget that.
Story_ID: 609269
Speaker 1: So, you said that two more incidences--Texas and Florida, right?
Speaker 2: Tex- well, Florida, we were coming out of Tallahassee [Florida], I guess, and I was in the car.  I used to have to--I learned how to drive when I was about twelve, thirteen years old because most of the guys I was with, like Jimmy Reed and Little Walter, and those guys, they drank all night.  Little Richard--not Little Richard, Richard Lewis had written (singing) "Hey, hey, little girl" ['Hey, Little Girl'] and Marvin and Johnny with 'Cherry Pie.'  They drank all night, so when we got through with a gig, we'd have a four hundred mile hop to the next gig, so I would drive until daybreak until the police could see it was a kid, then I'd, then I'd get out from under the wheel, and then somebody'd be sober enough to drive by then, you know.  So, we had just pulled up to a gas station and it must've been 9:30 at night, you know, the old gas station with the glass thing, you know?  And I was under the wheel, so I pulled up to the gas station; I just pulled up to the gas station--we needed gas.  And I could see the guys sitting in, sitting in the gas station, sitting up there like rocking like this (demonstrates), one of 'em looking out the window, you know.  So I sit there, I'm looking for 'em to come out, you know, 'cause I--
Speaker 1: 'Cause they had to pump your gas then, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So I'm sitting there, I'm blowing the horn.  I thought he didn't see me at first, then I see he's just looking at me, you know, then I see him reach over and do the thing on the phone, you know, and he sit back and kept rocking,  I'm blowing the horn.  All of a sudden, here come a police car.  Man, they three big dudes look like--man, my knees jumped out.  "Get out of the car, boy!  You boys get out the car!"  And the first one, "You boys come out here."  We had New York plates on there--, "You boys come out of New York thinking you gone change things; we gonna show you that we don't--," and, and, and they told the other guys, "Now, you all get in the car and get on out of here.  You just sit--you sit there, boy."  I was under the wheel.  "What you doing driving anyway?"  "Uhh" (imitates crying).  So they put me in the back of the police car.  Now, the other guys are gone; they told 'em to "Get out of here and don't stop."  Now, I'm sitting in the back with a police, and he's got a club look like--'bout this long.  He said, "Yeah, you boys come out here; we gone teach you a lesson 'bout coming out here trying to change--," and I'm crying (imitates crying)--, "I didn't do nothing, I--." Man, I'm--I am, I am a basket case.  So, then the cop tells me, he says, "You gone have to pay a fine, or we gone teach you a lesson."  So I say, "A fine?"  I have no money, but I have about two hundred dollars in cashier's checks.  Remember the old cashier's checks?  So I said, "I ain't got nothing but a check."  "We don't take no checks."  I said, "But this is money."  'Cause you know they got on there ten dollars you know, and stuff like that.  So he looked at 'em so he, so he, so he say, "Well, we'll take these then."  And they took me to the Greyhound bus station.  "And the bus'll be here in a little while so you better be on it."  And they left me at the bus station and I guess the bus was coming the next morning--Trailways [Trailways National Bus System; Trailways Transportation System, Inc.]--coming the next morning.  Well, I didn't sign the checks.  When I got back to New York, one of the guys said, "Man, all you got to do is sign those checks; don't--you call and say that they was stolen."  I was scared; I never did call.  I said, "Man if I had reported those checks stolen, they'd go and get that cop, and he'll come here and get me."  Man I was so frightened.
Story_ID: 609270
Speaker 1: And then in Sanderson, Texas--boy, this is a good one.  We were coming--we were coming back from New Orleans [Louisiana].  We just finished one of those long road trips.  We left our woodie down in New Orleans, so Roy--
Speaker 2: Like a woodie wagon with the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Woodie wagon.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Roy Richard, who was a bass singer for The Robins, and I, we went to--the other guys were--already came back to L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  We went to pick up the car, so here again I'm driving; I'm fifteen maybe, ain't got no license, but it's nighttime.  Roy's drunk, so he's laying in the back of the car, you know.  We got seat belts hooked and everything.  I'm driving 'em in Sanderson, Texas, so I pull up to a stop sign like this (demonstrates).  There's a truck on this side, I'm on this side (demonstrates); the light changes, I start to go off, the truck makes a right turn like this (demonstrates), and just tears the side of my car up.  Well, I jump out mad.  "Man, you--what, what?"  And all of a sudden the sheriff rolls up and he looked at the guy and says, "What's the matter, Sam?"  See?  And I say, "Sir?"  He say, "Shut up, boy, you're automatically wrong."  Now, I say, "But sir."  By this time, Roy is out of the car.  "What's going on?"  And the cop say, "I thought I told you to shut up," bam.  And he hit him; I thought he had shot him. Hit him, man, blood went everywhere.  Now, I'm really out man, I'm--, "Oh, my," you know.  Roy's on the ground, I don't know if he's dead.  He says, "You go on home, Sam, I'll take care of this."  So here we are.  The police put us in a--he didn't even handcuff us--put us in the backseat of the car.  He gave Roy a piece of paper to hold the, hold the blood coming out of his head, you know.  Now I'm scared now, 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen to--we just left our car--he left our car, took us and put us in jail.  Now I'm crying, hollering, "I didn't do nothing sir, I was--please, sir, I--." So I guess he felt some--sorry for me.  He said, "Well, I'm gong take you to the judge and see what the judge say."  So we get in the back of the police car.  Now, we're not handcuff at all; we just in the back of the police car, that's how bad he is.  We drive to the judge's house, and it's about 10:15 now, and the judge is not there.  His wife say, "He's down at, he's down at the pool hall."  We go to the pool hall.  I never will forget 'cause there's some steps that went up to the pool hall; it was like a little dive pool hall, and we sit in the car.  We're not handcuffed, we just sitting there.  And then pretty soon, the judge come out and he had his pool cue in his hand and he was, he was, he was--I mean he was like--signaling like say, "Take 'em on to jail; I ain't got time to be bothered."  And I'm, I'm--, "Sir, please, sir, please, please, please."  So, he came down the steps, and I was crying, man; I mean I--snot coming out of my nose, I mean I'm--and I say, "Sir, we didn't--sorry, sir, we didn't do nothing."  He say, "Boy, you know, I'll tell you what I'm going to do; I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you a fine."  And the fine was nineteen dollars.  Now we had no money.  We went in, we tried to get to--Lordsburg, New Mexico was our--where our next Western Union wire was, you know, we--getting home.  So I say--so I cried and pleaded.  He said, "Okay, boy."  And I remember, I remember him saying--he say, "Boy, I'm going to let you go, but if you don't send that money, we gone come to California to get you, you understand me?"  (Imitates crying) "Yes, sir, yes, sir."  We get in the car, go ahead and we start driving and I hear--Roy's driving now; I hear, "Bam!"  Man, what is this?  We get out of the car and we look, and the whole front of the car is got a little dent in it, and I look back and I walk back and see something in the road.  I say, "We done killed somebody, man."  And I get in the road and it's a big ol' hog.  So--and I thought about it, I said, "Now I didn't do anything back there.  I got a nineteen dollar fine and a threaten to be life in jail."  For killing this hog--we put the hog in the car; when we got to California--if my mother [Alma Williams Barnum] was alive, she'll tell you right now.  She could smell a hog--she could smell that--'cause it took us a day and a half to get to L.A., you know; we got to L.A., you know.  When we went through, you know, the thing where they check you for fruit and stuff like that?  I was so glad the man just waved us on through 'cause if he had stopped with a hog in the back of the car (laughter)--we got home, that hog was in the back of the car stinking.  So I've had some fun on the road at times and stuff, and I've been afraid a couple a times, but generally I, I walked through a lot of stuff with- without, you know--but, boy (laughter).
Story_ID: 609271
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about The Dootones.  Tell us about The Dootones.
Speaker 2: Well, The Dootones--we--Dootsie Williams who owned Dootone Records, he had, he had The Penguins, you know, with 'Earth Angel,' he had a group called The Medallions, Vernon Green and The Medallions, and so he wanted a group with his name on it, so he, he named us The Dootones, and we recorded a couple a songs, one of which made a little noise, called 'Teller of Fortune.'  And we did--you know, we were on the road a lot.  Actually, The Dootones--both Ronnie [Ronald Barrett] and I, we also sang with The Medallions.  We also sang as a Penguin sometime, and then Ronnie became a member of the group called The Meadowlarks that had a hit also.  So, it was two or three guys singing as, as different groups now.
Speaker 1: Why?  I mean why did they have so many--
Speaker 2: That's what's happening now.  Look at the, look at the groups out there now.  Some of 'em have no, no original members.  But at that time, you know, we had different coats, so we--'cause most of the time--say like with The Dootones, we were more, more or less pretty straight guys.  Ronnie and I were both athletes, Charles [Charles Gardner] was a good guy--he wasn't an athlete, but he was a good guy, and Marvin [Marvin Wilkins] we found down on, on Main Street.  I used to go down on Skid Row [Los Angeles, California] to work at the missions and stuff, even--you know--then I was trying to do stuff like that, and I met this guy Marvin who had a low voice (imitates), talked like this.  So we needed a bass.  I asked him did he wanna be in the group, and he said, yes, so he became part of our group, and that happens a lot, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But I guess I'm trying to understand the philosophy of having so many.  This is one record company but it's got the same guys to be in different groups.  Is that to, to, to--I guess to try to front that he had like so many different groups?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Sometimes, the groups started out actually with individual members, but maybe there was one guy in the group who was a drunkard or was reliable; maybe there's one guy in the group who actually wanted some of his money--wanted some royalties or something, so you know he got rid of him quick, you know.  So, in other words, if there's--if The Meadowlarks had a gig and they only had three guys able to sing, there would be a fourth guy; if The Penguins needed a fourth guy, it would be one of us, you know, 'cause we could sing basically everybody else's song, you know.
Speaker 1: I remember 'Earth Angel.'  (Singing) "Earth angel, Earth angel, will you be mine, nu, nu, nu," yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  That was one of the first million seller hits, I think, of, you know, one of the groups.
Speaker 1: And so, you were a Penguin sometimes.
Speaker 2: I was a Penguin sometime, I was a Medallion sometime, I was a Meadowlark sometime, I was a Dootone all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now what was The Dootones' biggest hit?
Speaker 2: 'Teller of Fortune.'
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did that go? Can you--
Speaker 2: I didn't sing lead.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Singing), "Teller of fortune, tell my fortune for me. Will all my bright golden dreams come true?  Or my wishes to be?  Ooh, teller," (laughter).  You can probably get it on the Internet someplace.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so
Speaker 2: I, I couldn't sing, but they thought I could.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you'd sing background and that stuff?
Speaker 2: I sang background.  I, I sing lead on some of the things on the album.  If you ask me what, I can't even remember 'cause people come up now with songs, say, "You, you recorded this in 1971 or '68 [1968] now."  I'll have to have 'em play it for me.
Speaker 1: So, Dootones were formed in--what I have here is it was formed in '55 [1955].  Is that true?
Speaker 2: That's probably true.  That's--yeah, we, we just had got out of school, and be--that's right before we formed The Circats [H. B. Barnum and the Circats].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, did you ever--during this period with these groups, did you ever wanna just quit and go to college or something or, or to play sports or you just lost--?
Speaker 2: No.  At that point it was, it was--no, at that point it was--I was, I was making a few bucks [dollars] then, having a ball.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, now did you get married during this period or did you--?
Speaker 2: No, that then, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not until '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959], six--'59 [1959], '59 [1959]; '59 [1959], '60 [1960]--yeah, '59 [1959].  Oh, I'll forget that, she'll [Barnum's wife, Barbara Klys Barnum] beat me up.
Story_ID: 609272
Speaker 1: Now, you performed with quite a few people now: Jackie Wilson, Etta, Etta James, and--
Speaker 2: Well, like I say, on, on those shows--on the road shows, I would be support for most of all those people--for Jackie, for Etta, for Al Hibbler, for Bill Doggett, for--you know.  I can be singing in the group, I could be playing an instrument behind them, or I could even be writing their music and writing their charts, so.
Speaker 1: So, so you were writing songs, too, for people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not songs, I was writing arrangements.
Speaker 1: Arrangements, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The songs I wrote during that time or during--from the--like '59 [1959], or '60 [1960] on, some of them lasted, but mainly I was just an arranger.  Although--it's, it's a real--see, without, without the business knowledge then that I hope to have now, I would have put my name on a lot of those songs that I'd put together, but, you know, the people that knew the business paid you, say, "Well, we'll pay you to do this," and you'd actually create something, but wouldn't get paid for the creation--only get paid for, for doing it.  And today, that would have been a lot of difference, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I was 'bout to have, have a lot of things that didn't stay in--under my control, but a lot of things I just did and--just did, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I have--anything like prior to '68 [1968], you know, was just kind of out there--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you couldn't copyright.  Okay, so you were with The Robins, and The Robins became The Coasters, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: The Coasters became--The Robin--some of The Coasters--some of The Robins became Coasters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember the exact year, but the--Carl Gardner and Bobby Nunn left The Robins and joined Cornell Gunter and Billy Guy to form The Coasters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was a, a hassle in the camp, and Leiber and Stoller [Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller] took the cream and made another group out of it.
Story_ID: 609273
Speaker 1: It says in '58 [1958], you cut your own single?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess I did.  What was that song?
Speaker 1: Ah, let's see here.
Speaker 2: Was that at Imperial Records?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Imperial Records, 'Blue Mood / Tia Juana.'  Is that it?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, that was on my label.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: That was on my label.
Speaker 1: Really?  Well, okay.
Speaker 2: Everybody had a record label.  I mean it doesn't matter; it, it--everybody had labels (laughter), so--I cut a lot of things on my label.
Speaker 1: What was your label called then?
Speaker 2: It was called Little Star Records; it still is today called Little Star.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had three labels--I had Little Star, Ultrasonic, Bar New [ph.].  I mean to have a labels you just had to have a sign on the door that said, you know, record company, you know.
Speaker 1: So that meant that you just had enough--I mean you had the resources to have your own records printed with your label?
Speaker 2: Well, I could see, at that time, that the guys I was playing with, we were making twenty, thirty dollars a night, and that was good money, and guys that had record companies were making more money so, you know, Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] was--had been doing--I had been doing a lot of stuff with Motown [Motown Records]; I had seen what Dootsie [Dootsie Williams] had done, so everybody had a record label.  We never sold anything.  In fact, today I sell more of those old records than I did when I--when, when the label was going, you know.
Speaker 1: So they're collector's items now in some ways?
Speaker 2: Yes, they are, yes, they are.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.

Speaker 1: So this is--we're about--I guess I got you about right--now--oh, now this is big (unclear).  I remember this song.  Your first major hit, 1959, you're twenty-three years old.  You produced a, a top five hit with Dodie Stevens called (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually, it was number one; that's what got me into the music business.  Prior to that, remember I have no inkling to be coming into the music business.  I'm in Louisville, Kentucky on an assignment 'cause you remember I, I took the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] test--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so they got me in Louisville, Kentucky, you know, getting ready to be in--into the bureau.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were--you passed the FBI test.
Speaker 2: I, I passed the written test when I was nineteen; I took the physical test when I was twenty-one and passed that, and then I--they put me on a few things, you know, to--you know.  So, I was in Louisville, and some guy came in whistling that song.  And I said, "Where did you hear that from?"  It wasn't cut originally with Dodie Stevens.  It was cut with a girl name [HistoryMaker] Micki Grant who was the author of that song.
Speaker 1: Micki Grant.
Speaker 2: Micki Grant.  She wrote a play called 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope.'
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, so Micki was one of my artists on my label with--I had a partner by the name of Ed Brown, and the guy came in singing that song, and I--, "Where'd you hear that?"  He says, "Well, it's on the radio."  I said, "No, it's not, it's not on the radio." 'Cause what happened, when I left to go to Louisville, I took all of my stuff and gave it to another guy across the hall name Carl Burns [Carl F. Burns], who also had a record label, Crystalette Records.  He had a little singer name Dodie Stevens.  So, when I gave him all of my tapes--'cause I wouldn't have no further use for 'em, he took Micki's voice off and put Dodie's voice on.  Now, I wasn't listening to the radio, I wasn't--you know, this record had been out maybe a month and a half, it shot to number one.  And this guy was whistling it in the office--one of the agents--and I said, "What you, what are you--where did you hear that song?"  He said, "It's on the radio."  I said, "Come on, it's not on the radio; it's not even out."  "How do you know?"  I said, "That's, that's one of my songs; it's a song I did," you know.  He said, "Well, no, it's on the radio--number one."  I said, "Come on.  Turn the radio on."  We turned on about four or five stations and heard the song, just like that (snaps fingers).
Speaker 1: Okay.  This, this song is like--what--is this the name of it?
Speaker 2: 'Tan Shoes and Pink Shoelaces' [sic. 'Pink Shoelaces'].
Speaker 1: And how did it go?
Speaker 2: (Singing) "He wears tan shoes and pink shoelaces, a panama hat--," let me see--, "a big panama with a purple band," I, I don't know.
Speaker 1: (Singing) "Tan shoes and pink--."
Speaker 2: "I got a guy, his name is Dooley, he's my guy and I love him truly; he's not good looking, heaven knows, but I'm crazy about his fancy clothes.  He wears tan shoes and pink shoelaces."  So I, I, I called my mother [Alma Williams Barnum] and she said, "Well, there's this man's been calling you but I thought he was a bill collector so I didn't give him your--tell him where you were."  So, I called Carl back and Carl says, "Man," he says, "I got some money for you," say, "but, you know--and your mother won't tell me where you are."  I say, "Well, I'll be home."  I resigned all of my guys that day, went home, and Carl gave me about $230,000.  That was from the publishing and the master rights.  'Cause he was an honest guy and he, he had made a lot of money on the label, you know, so.  So I immediately started Little Star Records, and started to record every day 'cause my thing was if I could make one hit, I can make a hundred hits.  Well, needless to say, in about six months I was broke 'cause I didn't know what I was doing, I was just recording, recording, recording, recording.  Some of that stuff today has come back and, and, and, and you know bore fruit for us.
Story_ID: 609275
Speaker 1: So then I didn't know what I was gonna do.  I could gig, you know; I could gig.  One of my great gigs--I got a call one day from a guy named Sandy Stanton, and Sandy Stanton says, "Barnum?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He says, "I hear you play all kind of instruments."  I say, "Yes, sir."  He says, "Can you, can you play a fiddle?"  I say, "Sure."  He said "Can you--you got a, you got a, you got a kerchief and a, and a cowboy hat?"  I say, "Yes, sir."  He says, "Well, we got a gig for you out at a place called the Shed [ph.], over there in Manchester [Inglewood, California], and it's a, it's a country western place." He say, "It's in a--," he say--I say, "Oh, good."  He say, "What else you play?"  I say, "I play trumpet, I play sax."  He said, "Well, just bring 'em all."  Said, "Our band is called The Biggest Little Band in the World.  Everybody in our band plays different instruments.  We play, we play one night at the Shed, we play three nights at Riverside Rancho [Los Angeles, California], which is over near, near Griffith Park which is--which was a country western place, and we have a radio show."  And he says, "I'll, I'll--," say, "I'll pay you $350 a week."  I said, "Oh, my Lord, thank you."  I go to this place--I get there early.  I start taking my instruments, and there's two guys at the bar and they looking at me and the bartenders had stopped--he--everybody's just looking, ain't nobody said nothing.
Speaker 2: And these are white people, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  At this time in, in that club, this was a country western club and no brothers went in that club, so I, I'm--I don't--you know, I don't really know what else to do.  I'm setting up and everything, you know, and I--now remember, he was going down south and everything.  I wasn't--you know, it just didn't--this is Los Angeles [California].  I never think that way, you know.  So, all of a sudden I--this guy came and I hear, "Sandy, Sandy," and he say, "Get out of here quick.  Get out of here, quick."  That's the first thing he said to me.  He said--I said, "What's the matter?"  He said, "Just pack up and get out of here; we'll talk outside.  Just get out of here quick."  So we get out in the parking lot and I say, "What's the matter?"  He says, he says, "Mr. Barnum," he says, "I'm sorry." He say, "You can't play in here."  He say, "Some of these boys come in here and tear you up," say, "They'll beat up the whole band."  I say--he say, "You know you can't--you--this is a country western."  Then it hit me what he's telling me.  We, we remain friends 'til today, you know.  And he got me into recording with Ferlin Husky and Buck Owens--people like that; I mean--but I'm--that was our first meeting (laughter).  He, he was scared to death, you know.  And I wasn't scared 'til I got outside and realized what he was saying to me, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, he didn't know you were black, I guess.
Speaker 1: No, he didn't know--on the phone--the name Hidle Barnum, [HistoryMaker] H. B. Barnum; you know, it could be anybody, you know.  And when we talked to me on the phone, I was--you know, all nice and everything, you know--, "Yes, sir. Yes, I'll be there. Can I fiddle?  Yes, oh, yeah," you know.  "I can do all that stuff."  So, that was--so, I've had all, all the different kind of gigs, and I mean--great people in my life; I--the thing is, if I meet these people, they--we stay friends for a long time.
Story_ID: 609276
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you're, you're now busy arranging music.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You got--you're trying to--got a label [Little Star Records] going.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now what about--let's see, here's--there's some records here they mention, 'El Pizza.'
Speaker 2: 'El Pizza.'
Speaker 1: I never heard of that.
Speaker 2: During, during--there was a (cough) 'scuse me.  There was a time during our, during our--that a lot of parodies came out for--from new records.  Marty Cooper and I, a buddy of mine, we started making parodies on everybody's record. 'El Pizza' was a big takeoff on 'El Paso,' Marty Robbins' 'El Paso.'  Our, our record went, (singing) "Out in the West L.A., town of Azusa, there is a cafe that I like a lot.  I like it because they serve mostly pizza, I like it because of the waitress they got.  Her name is Lena but I call her Spotty 'cause she spills spaghetti all over her dress."  And so, and so, so every time somebody put a record out, we'd make a parody on it, so we made several parodies on, on, on the records.  During that same time, I recorded a song called, 'Alley Oop,' and gave it to the other guys because I was--I had--there was a time in my life that I got involved in gambling, and I would spend all day long playing the horses, and this was the early '60s [1960s], right after I had gotten married [to Barbara Klys Barnum], before my son [H. B. Barnum III] had--my son was born in '61 [1961], so I must've started late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Now, did, did you write 'Alley Oop'?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't write it.  No, I, I made the record.  I played piano on it and made the record--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and actually gave it to the people who--I gave it to Kim Fowley, Buddy Mize and Dallas Frazier, who came to me with the song, and the reason why we did it because remember we had 'Hully Gully' and we had 'Peanut Butter,' and all those things; it was all the same song, just different, and they came to me 'cause I know how to play the piano, I can play the drums, too--I can do everything, you know.  So I got Hal Blaine to come play drums, and I played the piano and bass, and I made the record and I gave it to 'em for thirty-seven dollars because I needed some money to, to get my lights turned back on at, at my house where I was living, and then my house--I moved from a--that, that was 1960; I moved from a house that cost one hundred eighty thousand dollars to a sixty dollars a month apartment in the span of six months.  I lost--I mean I was, I was gambling heavy.  I was losing eight, ten thousand a day on the horses.  And so if you wanted to talk to me, you--, "Man, don't, don't bother me right now."  "Well, come and do this for me."  "Okay, I'll do it, just gimme my money; gimme my thirty-five dollars," or "Gimme my--," you know.  And I gave away quite a few hits over that time period--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but good things happened to me because Kim Fowley, the guy that I gave that back to, a month and a half later came and gave me ten thousand dollars, say, "Look, you--you know, you're not part of the record anymore but I, I feel bad about taking, so here, here's something for you."
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's how, (singing) "Alley oop, oop, oop, oop, oop," yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right, 'Alley Oop.'
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  So you--it says here you were a member of The Dinosaurs.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, that was a, that was a group that recorded 'Alley Oop' [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But I wasn't actually a member of the group, I just did a track and gave it to 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so this is like 1960, I guess.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 609277
Speaker 1: Then '61 [1961], what about 'Lost Love,' 'Nut Rocker'--
Speaker 2: 'Lost Love.'
Speaker 1: --and 'Everybody Loves H. B. Barnum' [sic. 'Everybody Loves H. B.']?
Speaker 2: Floyd Cramer came out with a record called (hums).  Anyway, I, I copied another--I copied something that was similar sounding the way he did, and mine didn't go to number one, it went to number two on, on, on the charts.  And then 'Everybody Loves H. B.'  During that time period, that's when Sam Cooke died, Jesse Belvin had died, Johnny Ace had died--a bunch of them.  So, all the record labels just thought all black people could sing, so they signed me at RCA [RCA Records], I made an album that probably sold ten copies.  But today, I've got a following in, in Europe; I go to Europe three or four times a year and sing in clubs and stuff, and they think I'm a--but like Barbara [Barnum's wife, Barbara Klys Barnum] says, "Who you think you are, Michael Jackson or somebody?"  (Laughter) They think I'm pretty good; I'm terrible, but they like me (laughter).  And then I left RCA--I, I left Capitol [Capitol Records] and went to RCA.
Speaker 1: So, the song is big in Europe--I mean the album is big in Europe? It made it in Europe.
Speaker 2: Some of the songs--I, I--some of my albums sell for fourteen hundred pounds at a, at a record show--fourteen hundred pounds.  And that was back when the pound was like two forty to a dollar.  I saw a kid come up and I--I asked him did he want me to sign it, he say, "Oh, no, no," 'cause if you sign it, that takes the value off of, you see.  He just wanted my signature on another piece of paper because if it's signed to somebody, then if he sells it--you know, so--
Speaker 1: The value goes down there, huh, instead of up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: I mean here it goes up, I think we said.
Speaker 2: Right in the, right in the--it's still in the, in the cellophane just like it was then.  Kid paid fourteen hundred pounds for that album.  At the same time, I'm over there with big stars, you know, like Wilson Pickett and those kind of stars that go to Europe every year, and four, four or five times a year.  So if I go once every three or four years, I'm still new meat; they're wore out, you know.  So I close the shows and they just laugh 'cause (laughter) I went over there one year with Gene Chandler, Wilson Pickett, Eddie Holman the creator of (singing) "Hey there, lonely girl" ['Hey There Lonely Girl'] all that and Gene Chandler, and I closed the show 'cause they're all--they be--they go over there all the time.  I was over there last year--now you should see the tape of me, and it's on YouTube right now; it's funny.  I mean it's funny to me 'cause I'm not a singer, but I enjoy it, and, and, and, and, and--but I have a few fans and I get letters all the time, something like that.  I'm really a behind the scenes person.  That's where I like to stay.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is some--that's really something, though, I mean the way things work, that you can--yeah.  One, one audience might not see you as big, as big as another, you know and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 609278
Speaker 1: In being out on the road and meeting, meeting people from all walks of life, say, mine, mine happened as, as an accident.  I told you before I used to play in clubs--in nightclubs--and they'd put me in the back room.  One of, one of my highlights from my nightclubs was when I was thirteen again, I get a call one night from a lady name Gertrude Gipson [Gertrude Gipson Penland] who used to be a columnist out here.  And they owned a club or they, they, they managed a club called the Oasis [Club Oasis, Los Angeles, California], or was it called the Night Life [Los Angeles, California] then?  It's--I'm not sure whether the name had changed.  But anyway, that club used to feature all the, the high level black talent.  This particular night, they had Redd Foxx, Slappy White, Lon Fontaine, Linda Fontanette, and the featured artist of the evening was Dinah Washington.  I knew every Dinah Washington song that was out.  That's was one--that's my, that's my queen, even though Aretha [Aretha Franklin], I love you, but Dinah was my queen.  So, my mother [Alma Williams Barnum]--(unclear) in, in the--at home--and then somebody says, "Can H. B. [HistoryMaker H. B. Barnum] come to the club and play for Dinah Washington?"  Well, you know, I say, "Mama, mama, please let me go, let me go."  She said, "You got to go to school."  I say, "Mama, please; I'll be back; I won't stay out, I will be back."  So they sent a cab to pick me up now to go to the nightclub, you know; you have to--you supposed to be twenty-one.  So what had happened, Elmo Hope was the piano player and Elmo, they tell me, had been sitting at the piano since seven o'clock like this (demonstrates), hadn't hit a note.  And Dinah was, you know--time for her to go on, so Gertrude knew that I knew every Dinah Washington song that was ever out; I could play any Dinah Washington song.  But what they hadn't told me is that because her voice was a little, you know, down, that everything had been put down a key.  So, imagine now, I'm going to the club, Redd said, "Come on, kid," you know, "get on the piano," you know.  And the band starts to play.  I think it was either Johnnie Lewis [John Lewis] or Red Holloway; I'm not sure which one--band it was that night.  I can't say what Dinah said to me, but when I hit the first chord and the band hit their first chord, it was in different keys.  And she turned around and said, "Look, little M, get your M off the piano."  I started crying and ran back in the dressing room; I mean I was--aw, it just destroyed me; I mean--that, that is my hero, and I mean--that's the first words she ever said to me in life.  Well, Redd came back there and said, "Kid, get on back out there and, and, and Slappy, get on back out there, and Jimmy Fields, get on back out there, and Lon Fontaine, (unclear)."  And Redd turned to Dinah and said, "Sing the song in the other key."  She said, "Okay."  So, she took me on the road with her for six months (laughter).  So, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've heard she could be really tough, too.
Speaker 1: Oh, I mean she--the first thing she said to was, "Look, M."  And I mean it just went through me like a sword; I mean, you know--she--I didn't--said, "Hello," to her.  So, I've had some--I've had some nice experiences like that; I mean she turned out to be--she was a lovely lady.  I mean, you know, just--she--you know, once we--I guess singing in the right key, you know--okay.  She came out there and sang her show, and then she wanted to know who the kid was, and took me and, you know, called my mama, and I went out with her--so I think for six months with her.  So, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.  Six months with her--okay.
Story_ID: 609279
Speaker 1: I've had some, you know--Lou Rawls.  I mean Lou and I met--Lou--I knew Lou but I didn't really know him.  I knew who he was and everything.  He was coming out of Capitol [Capitol Records] one night and--on the elevator, and he, he gets on the elevator, you know, "Hey, man, how you, how you doing?"  You know.  And he was looking a little sad.  I said, "What's the matter?"  He said, "I just got dropped from Capitol."  This is after he was on an album with Onzy Matthews--good album, but he wasn't selling any records.  Lou--I say, "Well, man, you can't drop you like that; come on back upstairs."  This was--my friend, Dave Axelrod [David Axelrod] had just got hired that day at Capitol, A and R [artists and repertoire] man.  So I went up and said, "Hey man, Dave, you--man, they dropped my man; you gotta take of him, man."  I didn't really know Lou.  Dave said, "I can't sign him at--man, they just dropped him.  I'll sign him, I'm just here--they'll fire me the first day."  I said--and Dave and I have been friends for life, and we're, we're like brothers now.  I said, "Man, are you my friend or not?"  Dave said, "Man."  So Dave came up with a great idea.  "We'll cut a demo, just use four musicians."  And that way he can get some money to save his house and stuff like that, you know.  And the money from the demo'll take care of that.  And throughout the thing, we got to talking and thought about inviting people in, some of them--had people sit around and be there; it was a live album--biggest album he ever had.
Speaker 2: Now, that, that Lou Rawls album, 'Live!' where he talks and that sort of thing, about Walgreens [Walgreens Company] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: --and Chicago [Illinois], the hawk, and all that?
Speaker 1: And all that stuff--that talk and stuff didn't--that's not Lou's stuff; that stuff came from Johnny Watson.  Johnny Watson was doing that long before--you know.  But they, they were great friends, it's, it's all right, you know.
Story_ID: 609280
Speaker 1: O.C. Smith, I mean O.C.--I didn't know O.C. from Adam; I mean I knew who he was.  Jerry Fuller called one day, he said, "I want you to record this guy O.C. Smith."  So we cut one song called, 'Hickory Holler's Tramp' ['The Son of Hickory Holler's Tramp'] and it had a little bit of success.  O.C. was a great guy; I mean he's from Natchitoches [Louisiana], and my father [H. B. Barnum, Sr.] used to be his preacher.  I--we didn't know all this 'til after and, and, you know.  But O.C.--we got enough--we went in there and cut another album, and one of the songs on the album was a song called, 'Little Green Apples.'  Well, Columbia [Columbia Records] put it out as an album--didn't do anything. So they were ready to drop O.C.  One of my good friends in Chicago [Illinois] by the name of Ronnie Jones, another guy name [HistoryMaker] Pervis Spann. I was talking to Ronnie one day, Ronnie say, "Hey man," say, "you know, I was playing party (unclear)," say, "we hadn't played nothing else; we was playing that first part."  "What part?"  "It was the part that say, 'I wake up in the morning with my head in the--.'"  We'd play that in the morning then we, then we'd go to our regular show.  I say, "Man, can you get somebody else to play it?"  He say, "Well, let me call Pervis."  So, Pervis bought a--I, I bought, I bought a thousand albums--my money--from Columbia, and sent it around to all the guys at NARA [National Association for Radio Announcers]--it used to be called NARA with the--
Speaker 2: National association of recording artists.
Speaker 1: Radio, radio announcers, all the black deejays.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Sent it to the guys, guys from Cleveland [Ohio], sent it down to Florida, sent it to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and, and they all start playing just that part (snaps fingers), popped.  Right on in.  O.C. was the first guy that I remember a special--first, first black artist that called me after the session.  He said, "Man, I just wanna thank you."  I said, "For what?"  He said, "Man, your music is beautiful.  You did a good job; thank you for what you did for me today."  We hadn't had any success yet, but that was the first one that, I mean.  He and I remained friends for, for--after that.
Speaker 2: That was a tremendous hit, yeah.
Speaker 1: He was also the first--I won't say the first black artist--that--there was a knock on my door one day, and I opened the door, and there's a little puppy there, a little Belgian Shepherd with a note around his neck that said, "My name is Apples."  Now, everybody that has ever gotten a lot of gifts from artists and stuff like that, Rolex watches, everything, but O.C. did that, man.  So he was just a beautiful guy to me, you know.  Lou [Lou Rawls] was beautiful in his own way, you know.
Story_ID: 609281
Speaker 1: The O'Jays were beautiful in their own way.  I mean they came out here from Cleveland [Ohio].  I met Eddie O'Jay at a conference.  He said, "I got this group that I manage."  He said, "Nothing's happened with 'em. Can you do something with 'em?"  I said, "Well, send 'em out to California."  I have another house around the corner where, where I was living at the time, and they came out. The first day they were here, Walt's [Walter Williams] eye, eye messed up on him.  Took him to the hospital--County General [Los Angeles County General Hospital; Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center, Los Angeles, California]--had to have an operation.  I called his father, say, "Your son is in the hospital to have a operation."  His father say, "Told him not to go out there in the first place."  So now I'm sitting with five guys in my house for six months.  They didn't sing anything.  So when you see them, you just say, "H. B. [HistoryMaker H. B. Barnum] said--," oh, you'll get a good response, you know.  So--and they cut--their first songs were, were cut on my label, Star Records [Little Star Records].
Speaker 2: Did you arrange them?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I arranged it; it was in--it was on my label.  We had a little success with it.  He got 'em going big enough where they went to another big label.  So Little Richard, I mean he'll tell you, you know, you--you know, I--see, I, I did a lot of stuff that I don't--I didn't really--I got credit for it but with the artists, they know, you know.  So when you speak to the artists, they'll tell you the record companies make, make their own story.  And me not, me not, me not forcing the issue, a lot of things go by unnoticed.  But I'm very happy, and I'm cool with it.
Story_ID: 609282
Speaker 1: Now, by 1967 you bought this home here in the Hollywood Hills [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: I bought this home (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is an impressive place.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: It, it seems to speak to a level of success a lot of people can't--don't reach in a lifetime.
Speaker 2: Well, that--
Speaker 1: And this was done in '67 [1967].  You were still in your--you were about thirty-two?
Speaker 2: I was still twenty-one.
Speaker 1: You were still twenty-one?  (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  In 1960--when I left home at--actually, say I left home at sixteen--although I went home every night for dinner to my mother's [Alma Williams Barnum] place, but I was on my own.  I had been fortunate.  I've never lived in an apartment; I've always had a house, I've always--when I left home, I rented a house--a big house; stayed there with two of my football buddies.  When I left there, I bought a house, when I left there I bought a house, when I left there I bought a house right around the corner on a--which is about three blocks from here which I still own.  I bought a--my house note was $105 a month.  I can say now, the house rents for over four thousand dollars a month--that same house.  This house was a gift from God also.  I had just finished playing an alumni game, I had got hit in the lip and, and my lip was--I had twenty stitches right here (demonstrates).  I was driving home but I had just had--with the shots and everything; I didn't wanna go to sleep right away, I wanted to try to stay awake and I saw a sign said for, for sale.
Speaker 1: This is a Manual Arts [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California] alumni football game?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: What, what--
Speaker 2: No, this is a, a, a game from, from LACC, LACC [Los Angeles Community College, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay, community college, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, I drove down the driveway, knocked on the door, knock, knock, and the lady looked out the door and she said, "What do you want?"  You know.  I say, "Well, I'd like to see the house."  "My husband's not home.  He's not, he's not home."  And now, at this time, I got a Afro, I got a mouth that looks like this (demonstrates) with stitches all here.  I mean I'm looking mean, boy; I'm a brother all the way.  So, she--so I guess something in her said, "Well, you can look around outside if you want to."  So I walked around the house.  She had curtains here (points), and it was a Hammond B-3 organ sitting over there in the corner.  So I--she--I could see her like everywhere I went; she--I can see her peeking out the window, you know.  So she, she--I, I saw here over this door, and I said, "That's a beautiful instrument you have there; that Hammond B-3 is one of the best they make."  So, she said, "Oh, you, you, you know about music?"  I say, "Yes, ma'am, I'm a musician."  She cracked the door and said, "What do you play?"  I say, "Well, I actually play the piano."  She say, "Can you play the organ?"  I say, "Ma'am," I said, "I can play it, but I'm really not an organ player."  She say, "Well this organ's been sitting here for five years and it hasn't been played; my husband bought it for me.  I can't play, nobody plays it.  Can you play something on it?"  She let me in the house, I went over there and played the organ, you know.  We sit and talked, and she said, "Well, we're selling this house," and her--Barrett Ryder [ph.] was his name; he's the guy that first merchandised and advertised aluminum patio furniture.  He became a multimillionaire like that (snaps fingers).  So, they were selling this--they built this house, and they were selling this house, and they had bought a house out at Newport Beach [California], and she said, you know, "You like this house?"  I said, "Well, I really like it."  I'm BS-ing cause I ain't got no money to buy no house; I just bought a house a year ago right around the corner here.  So, she, she say, "Well, I'll tell my husband when he comes home."  So, that night, I came over and I left her five albums--a [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson, David McCallum, Frank Zappa, and two more that I had--Cannonball [Cannonball Adderley], and something that I, that, that I, that I had written on.  I left 'em against her door.  Two weeks later, I get a call.  "Barnum [HistoryMaker H. B. Barnum]?"  "Yeah."  "This is Mr. Ryder.  I thought you wanted to buy the house."  So I said, "Sir," I said, "I--," you know, "Sir, I, I'm really not financially able to buy a house right now."  So he said, "Well, my wife wants you to have this house.  Why don't you come by and talk to me tomorrow?"  I came over here the next day, we're sitting right here.  He said, "Listen, son," he says, "I have all the money that I want."  He says, "My wife wants you to have this house."  So, I said, "Well, sir," I say, "I, I just bought a house around the corner."  I say, "I don't have any money right now."  He says, "How long will it take you to get three thousand dollars?"  Now, this is in '66 [1966].  I said, "Probably 'bout a year."  He said, "Okay," he says, "when you--so when you get the three thousand, you know, call me, and (unclear) call me, and we'll take care of the rest with financing," you know.  And that was (cough) all the conversation I had.
Story_ID: 609283
Speaker 1: About three days later, he called me, says, "Did you get the--how you like the house?  Did you get your key?"  I said, "Key?"  He say, "I left the key for you under the, under the--on the porch."  I said, "Well, no, I haven't been over there."  He said, "Well, yep, it's under the porch," you know.  He--and he told me it was a few things--where the lights and stuff were.  So I drove over here, and the key was under the porch.  I came in the door and the house was completely empty.  Now, the first thing I'm thinking, the police getting ready to come down here and swoop me for breaking and entering; this man is a scam--I locked the house back up and went back home.  About four or five days later, he called to tell me something about the, the pool heater, or something like that.  At this point, I didn't tell him I hadn't been in the house, so I came over here a couple a days later; I came in and I stayed here all night--laid on the floor, that little floor (laughter).  And I'm still thinking this is some kind of game, man; it's got to be a game.  He ain't said nothing 'bout how much the house cost, he just told me to have him three thousand dollars in a year.  So, over the next three or four weeks I, I never have any--I didn't have any furniture in here for about a year and a half.  I never did stay here any length a time; I'd stay here for maybe four or five nights, and I'd go back to my other house.  And then, then I'd stay maybe a week, then I'd go back to my other house, you know.  But by the end of the year, I had three thousand dollars and I called him.  I say, "Mr. Ryder [Barrett Ryder (ph.)]," I say, "I have your money."  He says, "Okay, meet me at Guardian Finance [ph.] over on Wilshire [Boulevard]," and I remember we had a time to meet.  I walked into Guardian Finance, I gave him the cashier's check--I don't think it was a cashier's check 'cause I think it was some other kind of--anyway, I gave him three thousand dollars.  He told the guy, says, "Give this man a loan."  And he left.  I never saw him again, but I talked to him after that.  So now I'm sitting with two houses [in Los Angeles, California] (laughter), and I'm looking, I say, "I got to," you know.  Now, it was four years later that I discovered that I have two lots on the bottom that are part of this (makes sound) (laughter).  I mean I have been blessed, man.  So, whatever I, I've missed in fame and stuff like that I, I've got--you know--it was just, it was just amazing, you know.  The other house, it was--I wasn't gonna tell you that story, but I was--I just went down--I went there to buy some tapes, and the man that was selling--had the tapes was selling, you know, recording tapes?  He said he had a house for sale but nobody's looking for houses; I am, jiving.  Three days later, I'm in a house and got the key and got the thing in 'em and got a--got the--you--no down payment; the notes are $105 a month (laughter).  So, I am lucky, so.
Story_ID: 609284
Speaker 1: Now, there's another story that, that's really in- an interesting story about, about your personality and what you're able to do.  You started having--when you got this house, you had a Thanksgiving dinner here.  Tell us about that and how this started.
Speaker 2: Well, remember, I came from the projects [Aliso Village, Los Angeles, California] to where my mother [Alma Williams Barnum] moved.  We were twelve years in the projects, and then my mother--with the money we got together--me doing a little work and her working, we bought a house over in, over in--off of Temple Street in the Westlake district [Los Angeles, California], and I would go over and pick up my homies, you know, the ones that were still around from the projects, and bring 'em to dinner.  So when I got this house, the first year for Thanksgiving, I said, "What can I do?"  You know, I'm so happy; I mean I'm just got such a blessing.  I said, "I'm going to pick up my buddies."  So, I call over to the center over there, and said, "You have the people over there, we'll pick 'em up."  So, we sent three or four cars over and we brought back about twelve or thirteen people--had a lovely Thanksgiving dinner, and I say--somebody say, "You gong do it next year?"  I say, "Yeah, I'll do it next year, too."  This is--that was '66 [1966].  Sixty-seven [1967], we went over--we must a brought back forty people.  Well, by six or seven years after that, one--we had--one year we had 105 people up here and it rained, so I had to bring everybody inside, and we had people eating in the bathroom, in the bedroom, and everywhere, and we're all in the house, and we had Thanksgiving dinner, and that continued for three or four years.  And then in '81 [1981], the choir [LIFE Choir] was established, and so the choir took over the chores of doing all the cooking and everything.  Up until that time I did all the cooking, you know; I did all the buying and everything like that.  Now, we're fortunate; we have people--help sponsor the dinner.  They--you know, we have different people cook the turkeys.  We cooked 132 turkeys last year, you know, and we served about 1400 people.
Speaker 1: This all grew out of just being thankful that you had a place--wanted to share it.
Speaker 2: I am thankful; I am thankful, I am thankful, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and the people we serve are--some are homeless, some are seniors.  We, we have two or three buses of seniors that come.  Some are just people in the neighborhood who stop by.  Some are artists, we have everybody from Lou Rawls to Pat Boone to Billy Davis [HistoryMaker Billy Davis, Jr.] and [HistoryMaker] Marilyn McCoo, [HistoryMaker] Marla Gibbs, Frank Sinatra.  We've got--I've, I've given to all those people who have just stopped by on Thanksgiving and sang a song or, or just served food.  We have the Mormons.  The Mormons send us about twenty missionary kids to help serve, we have some of the gangs that send their gang members to come serve; they, they wear their red and they wear their blue, and there is no trouble, and they come and serve, so it's really turned into quite a thing for us, you know.
Speaker 1: Are the Crips and the Bloods--
Speaker 2: All the Crips and the Bloods, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they--we've never had a problem.
Story_ID: 609285
Speaker 1: We have--we lost our, our eldest person, which was my Aunt, Aunt Lil [ph.]; we lost her last year.  She was 106, and she came every year for thirty years, and the youngest, of course, might be a little new baby, or something, you know.  But we have a prize for the oldest and the youngest, you know.  And Aunt Lil used to, "Y'all don't even have to worry, I'm the oldest one here," and she--we lost her last year.
Speaker 2: So that's the story; she started when she was seventy-six, and I guess--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Well, I didn't know she was my auntie.  She was my father's half-sister.  Remember I told you earlier?  And, in seventy--'bout '72 [1972], we got a call from San Francisco [California] telling us that the--she says, "Well, I think I'm your auntie."  And so my sister went up and saw her, and they kind of had a little relationship going.  Seventy-three [1973], she had a fourplex--I know what they call 'em in New York [New York].  In New York they call 'em brownstones with, you know, four level thing that--the lady she worked for for fifty years bought for her in 1941 for seven thousand dollars, okay?  Now this is '73 [1973], '74 [1974].  I--my sister called me; she went up there, she says, "H [HistoryMaker H. B. Barnum], you need to come up here."  Says, "Aunt Lil has got a lot of problems."  Says, "Some people came by and said they gonna condemn her place 'cause the electricity is old, the steps are falling down, blah, blah, blah--the roof and everything."  So I go up there.  The first thing I discovered, the people living in the other three levels haven't paid rent for two or three years.  Aunt Lil loves 'em.  She just, you know; they don't, they don't pay rent, they, they--you know.  So I'm--while I'm trying to deal with that, these two guys come by, and they say they're from one of the city departments, and they're gonna let her--they're gonna fix all this stuff for her; it's gonna cost about seventy thousand dollars, "But don't worry 'cause she's got equity in her building."  Now, here's a lady with no income, no nothing, you know.  So I--Billie [Billie Barnum] had talked to 'em on the phone.  I say, "Well, come by and meet, meet us."  So I came by and I had my overalls on, and I had--I have some, I had some brogans and some--you know.  So I said to the man, I say, "Well," and he says, "Well, yes, we're gonna fix--the wiring has to be fixed, and this has to be fixed, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah," you know.  I say, "Well, how much this gone cost?"  You know.  "I don't know if we can--we don't have this kind of money," you know.  "Oh, don't worry, sir, we--you know, your payments are only gonna be like, you know, two or three thousand dollars a month."  I'm saying, "How do he expect a lady to pay two, three thousand dollars a month?"  If, if, if everybody paid rent, she wouldn't have two or three thousand dollars.  So I let 'em--I kept 'em there for about two hours; I mean I just let 'em go through their whole thing, and they were tired; they kept going over and over again anyway.  And then I looked at my sister, I say, "Well, okay, let me do my act now," and then I say, "I'll, I'll tell you what," say, "we're on the fourth floor."  I say, "You guys got two minutes, or I'm going to throw you out of here on the--off the fourth floor."  He say, "What are you talk--?" I say, "You got two minutes; don't just talk--you got two minutes, now.  Don't ask me questions; you better get out of here.  You got two minutes, I'm going to throw you out of here."  "Well, we (unclear)."  I say, "You, you--time's running," you know.  So, anyway, Aunt Lil--we, we decided what we're gonna do--she didn't need to be by herself, first of all.  I said, "Aunt Lil, let's sell this place and let's--you come down and live with us in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]."  Well, she don't wanna live with us, she wants to live by herself, so--you know, okay so sell (unclear) to me.  So we got 1.6 for that place, you know (laughter).  Aunt Lil don't like savings and loans; she likes banks.  She wanted to put it all in one bank.
Speaker 2: 1.6--
Speaker 1: "Aunt Lil, you can't put that money in one bank."  Oh, we had a thing.  She don't trust stocks and bonds or banks.  So we wound up--man, we must a had one hundred twenty or one hundred thirty bank accounts, you know when, when you keep it under the level where it's protected, you know.  And she, she said, "Well, you know I don't have any--." She didn't have no kids or anything, but the girl that was staying with her was her niece, not a blood niece, but a niece.  So she let Margaret [ph.]--said, "I'm going to give the money to you three."  I said, "Well (unclear), I don't need the money."  I said, "Just leave it in the bank," you know.  Billie, my sister, "I don't need any money, Aunt Lil; leave it in the bank."  Margaret takes hers 'cause she's got two kids and she needs to, you know, buy a house, or something like that.  So, Aunt Lil say, "Well, since Margaret's buying a house, why don't I just stay up here with Margaret for a few more years and then I'll leave."  Well, needless to say, in three or four years, Margaret was on crack, had spent her money, most of our money, and so we said, "Aunt Lil, forget the money; come on out here."  So she came out here and stayed with us for a little over thirty--'bout thirty years, you know.  And, you know, the money--she was happy.  She stayed by herself until, until about eight months before her death.  And the only reason--she was staying by herself in an assisted living place, but she liked it; she didn't wanna come and live with anyone, she wanted to stay by herself.  She liked to cook, she liked to do everything.  She'd come over and clean the house and stuff like that for us, you know.  And then one day we were on our way to a funeral, and we called her--just called her, and she didn't answer.  So we--right after--we told the people to break the door down because we didn't know, 'cause we were already going to the funeral.  They broke the door down and said she had fallen down, she couldn't get up, but she wasn't hurt, so she just took a nap (laughter).  But we were worried to death, so we said, "Aunt Lil, if you're not gonna come live with us, we got to put you in a home."  Oh, she cried, she cried, she cried.  About three days after she was in the home, we went to see her.  "Where's Aunt Lil?"  "Oh, she went to bingo with the people."  "Oh, you mean it ain't Mama Suki [ph.]?"  Oh, she done took over the place," you know (laughter).  So, she just had a--she had a great time.  We had her 105th birthday party last year, and we invited friends and stuff like that, from all over the place, and then last year she--she went out nice, you know; she had a good time.
Speaker 2: Well, that, that's a wonderful story.
Story_ID: 609286
Speaker 1: Tell us about the choir [LIFE Choir] now.  How did you come up with the idea with--for the choir?  Now you've been--I don't wanna skip--leave anything out--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but you've arranged for, for movies, television shows--
Speaker 2: I've arranged for movies, television, a lot of commercials.
Speaker 1: --for Gladys Knight and the Pips, and a lot of--
Speaker 2: I mean I did--you know--I did commercials just--for about eight years straight, just--
Speaker 1: Can you give an example of some of the ones that--so if we see it we'll know it's you?
Speaker 2: (Singing) "C-N-H, C-N-H, dot, dot, dot, dot, dah, dah, dah--drinking sugar from Hawaii;" that was mine.  (Singing) "Milk does a body good," you know that?  Milk does a body good?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: All the Plymouth.  I did, I did on camera stuff for Plymouth and Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC], with Petula Clark and myself; we were both on camera and we did--I did a few years--I did Chevy for years, Ford [ph.] white sale for years, Bactine, Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company]--just--I, I better myself out of the commercials.  See, you guys remember, all this time still, I--music wasn't what I wanted to do but it was, it was a--that was--afforded me a good living, and so I did it, and I think I'm very good at it, but I had--I don't have that burning--I mean I can, I can work for four or five weeks, and then if I wanna stop, I just stop, and I don't miss it, you know.  I know, I know it's important, not just to me, but important to the world--music, but I don't--I think--Quincy [HistoryMaker Quincy Jones] said to me, "Man, if you had more drive, man, you could be doing what I'm doing."  I said, "No, but I don't know if I wanna do what you're doing."  I mean I can only eat one steak a day, and only, you know, only sleep in one room, and not that I don't--sometime I look at some of my associates or my, you know, counterparts to see what they have, but I have just as much, you know; just as my, you know.
Story_ID: 609287
Speaker 1: The choir [LIFE Choir], I was--I, I was writing a lot of songs, and I never could hear 'em, you know, 'cause you have to pay to go and have people sing, so I invited about fifteen people to come one night to sing, to sing some of my music--just go over it.
Speaker 2: So you started writing gospel music, or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I had been writing it all the time.  I worked, you know, with Alex, Alex, Alex Bradford and James Cleveland.  I, you know, all during--all this--during this other time, I worked with all these different people.  So I've always been doing gospel stuff, but I was writing this gospel--wanted to hear it.  Invited fifteen people, somebody said, "Let's do it again next week."  So for the next week we had twenty-five, and the next week--so now, we've had about eight hundred people over the last--we're in our twenty-sixth year now.  In fact, when I leave here right now, I'm going to record; that's why I was asking what time it was.  And--
Speaker 2: Eight hundred people sang?
Speaker 1: Have, have gone through the choir.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We, we have a, a standing force of about ninety that come to rehearsal.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 609288
Speaker 1: So I, I called a few people together on a, on a, on a Tuesday night to go over some songs, and then somebody says, "Yeah, should we do it the next week?"  And then the next week and the next week, so now we have a large choir.  It's been together; we're going into our twenty-sixth year.  We've had a--
Speaker 2: What's the choir called, the--
Speaker 1: Called LIFE, LIFE (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) LIFE.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And we got--our website is lifechoir.com.
Speaker 2: LIFE Choir.
Speaker 1: And we do--somebody said to me the other day, "You know your choir never had a real hit record."  Yeah, but we've watched our kids grow up, we've seen our kids do good things, we've, we've sang with almost everybody in the business from [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte to Aretha [Aretha Franklin] to, to Foreigner, to--I mean we just sang--we sang with everybody.  We, we do--
Speaker 2: So you're in the choir on a Foreigner record?  The hit?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  (Singing) "Say it loud, say it clear."  (Unclear), yeah.  Wow, we've--we've sang with--we've, we've done the Grammys [Grammy Awards], the Academy Awards [Oscars], the music awards, Shirley Caesar, all the--you know, all the gospel shows.  We--we've done everything, and we're still, we're still very happy.  We still got some--we've got at least thirty-five members who were there in the beginning, and like I said, we've had about eight hundred people go through the choir 'cause some people come for one week and they see they're not gonna be the star, so they leave, and some people come and stay, you know.  Some people move away and they come back.  We had one girl that--she comes--she's in England.  Her two week vacation every year, she comes to the same place--back so she can come to two choir rehearsals.  So it's, it's, it's a good thing, you know.  The choir is involved in a lot of work with the seniors and, and students.  We have a mentor program with the students where we try to mentor a child with a, with a grand- grandparent type person because there's a lineage that's lost in between there that we've, we've allowed to disappear.  I was very disheartened and surprised.  I met this young lady, lovely young lady; she can't cook.  Well, all sisters can cook.  I mean, you know, that's passed down from grandma to--you know, you--so there's, there's things--there's information.
Story_ID: 609289
Speaker 1: One of the things about my Aunt Lil [ph.], who I talked about earlier, the last eight or nine years, we sat and talked to her and videotaped it, and just to, you know, to talk about things.  When she was born, they didn't have airplanes flying around.  When she was born, they didn't have, you know, the telephone as we know.  When she was born--so she's seen all these things happen, and it was interesting to get her view on things, you know.  Aunt Lil didn't smoke, but she did drink a little wine, and she worked hard every day, so there must be something to that long life and the, you know, the longevity from things that--the way you treat your body and treat yourself and treat your mind.  She was always happy, even though she was poor most of her life and, you know, the lady retired there around 1942, but she worked.  Even after that, she worked; she found stuff to do with other people, you know--taking care of people all the time and stuff like that, so--there must be something to that.  Something, something we've lost--not just as a race, but just, just as people in general, you know.  I, I wouldn't--just the discipline and respect, for one thing.  About eight years ago at the Thanksgiving dinner, I said something outta the side of my mouth, and she hit me upside my head, and she was sitting five tables away.  I don't know how she reached me.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But there was something to the respect and the discipline that, you know--I mean the--I won't do anything wrong now, because I'd just be shame that Aunt Lil, or my mama [Alma Williams Barnum], or somebody would, you know--, "Oh, I didn't know H. B. [HistoryMaker H. B. Barnum] would do anything like that," you know.  I, I don't wanna hear that.  So that, that--ain't the fright or the fear of the police or the jail time, it's just the--there's things that, that, that are bred in you that are, that are, that are just--that are in you that I think that we're missing a lot with our kids today.  But I'm lucky; I have fifty-eight godchildren, and they're all good, no problems.  They think I'm crazy 'cause, you know, I may go off at any minute, but they are good, good kids, you know.  They're productive in society, they all have good jobs.  Most of 'em are working.  Some of 'em got to travel with the president as presidential bodyguards, a couple are mayors, a lot of 'em are in law enforcement like police captains and stuff like that, and a couple of--one is a law professor at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], you know, so, you know.  And I keep in contact with 'em on, on a daily basis.  And they never know where I'm going to show up.  I mean I went to one of the colleges last year; he walked out of his dorm, I was standing there, he say, "What are you doing here?"  "Just come to check on you, make sure you ain't messing up."  "Well, you could've called."  I say, "No, I just wanna make sure for myself, you know--see what you doing."  "Aw, you--uncle, you crazy," you know.  "Yeah," I say, "I know; and don't you forget I'm crazy, too (laughter); no telling when I might go off."  So--we, we, we've had fun.
Story_ID: 609290
Speaker 1: Along with the choir [LIFE Choir], you know, I coached sports and stuff, and--
Speaker 2: So you're still involved in sports on some level (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah; it's, it's, it's hard, 'specially when you're on the road and stuff like that.  There was a time that I spent almost twenty years where I wouldn't even go outta town on the weekends 'cause we had our football games and basketball games on Saturdays and Sundays, so I found other ways to sustain my income by staying in town.  Now, I have to travel a little bit more 'cause my, my clients take me far away, and I have clients all over the place.  Up until last year, Don Ho has been--was a client of mine for fifty years and--
Speaker 2: Don--
Speaker 1: Don Ho.
Speaker 2: Oh, the Hawaiian guy, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Tiny Bubbles,' you know; that was--I did that; that was one of my records.  I was, I was with The Osmonds on the road for ten years, and when they got ready to do their tour, they called me and asked me if I wanted to go out, and I say, "Well, I can't now, but maybe if you stay out another year, I may join you next year," 'cause I was The Osmonds' musical conductor for, for ten years.  I worked at Motown [Motown Records] for fourteen years, which means I worked with The Supremes, The Tops [The Four Tops], The Temps [The Temptations], Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson], Stevie [Stevie Wonder], you know.  And I was one of the people responsible for making Motown put the artists and the arrangers and things on their records, even though with the early Motown records they didn't, they didn't put arrangers and things on their records, you know.  But we, we went to B.G. [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] and he finally let us do that.  I was with Capitol [Capitol Records] for--at the same time I was with Motown, I was at--also at Capitol, so I did [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson, Cannonball [Cannonball Adderley], Frank Zappa, The Lettermen, David McCallum, Kay Starr, Frankie Laine, you know.  So, by--I guess by not having any real training in the music, I'm not tied to any, any kind of thing.

Speaker 1: And the thing I forgot to tell you earlier, when I, when I decided that I was gonna play music and, and I--you know, well, like I said, walked through that--walked out of Louisville [Kentucky] and came back to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], after I got broke, lost my money, I didn't have a real skill; all my music has been picked up--kind of self-taught, but I did want to--I could hear it, but I didn't know how to really put it down properly, or not--I can't even say properly 'cause even I don't do it properly now.  It works, but--so I got it--I was looking through Billboard magazine, and I called up three people.  One is still alive so I'm not gonna tell you about him, but the other two I can talk about.  Neal Hefti was one, and Ernie Freeman was the other.  They were the--
Speaker 2: Neal Hefti, I remember him.
Speaker 1: --and the third person is a, is a very well known person.  He says, "Don't tell anybody yet 'til I tell you when to tell 'em."  But I just called him on the phone and said, "Hi, my name is H. B. [HistoryMaker H. B. Barnum], and I'd like to learn how to write music, so can you help me?"  And the three didn't know I was talking to the other guys, so I would spend one day, say, maybe go to Ernie Freeman's house, or follow him to the studio, and just listen and watch and see how he handled the musicians, see how he, you know--what he did.  And then Neal Hefti was the only guy that charged me, and what he did, he said, "Well, why should I help you?"  I said, "Well, 'cause I need to learn something and you're the best at what you do," you know.  He said, "Well, how much you gonna pay me?"  I say, "I ain't got no money."  He said, "Well, what you gong give me for helping you?"  I said, "What do you want?"  He said, "Do you know where to get sweet potato pies?"  I said, "Yeah."  So, I used to go to Neal; when I go to session, I'd have ten sweet potato pies with me, and he'd let me sit there and listen.  And I learned how to, you know, note, note the music down properly, you know, good enough for the guys to read.  I don't, I don't write all the right signs and everything--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but I write enough where they can understand it.
Story_ID: 609292
Speaker 1: And I, I said--I said earlier I didn't--I--that music is important.  I--to this day, I don't know if I'm a really--gonna be gonna be in music all my life, but I know it's important because I--right after the Detroit [Michigan] riots, I was going to Detroit to conduct the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, DSO, and there was a guy running around in the streets with a violin.
Speaker 2: This is '68 [1968]?
Speaker 1: This is right after the Detroit riots.
Speaker 2: Okay, '68 [1968]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '68 [1968], something like that, yeah.
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967], '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: And the guy was with a violin, so me walking down the streets, you know--and remember, at that time I was sporting a Afro and everything, you know.  I say, "Hey, man, what's happening?"  The poor guy almost had a heart attack.  I mean he backed up like he--like I was killing him.  Well, I didn't think anything of it until he went on.  I said, "That guy was scared of me."  So, later on that afternoon, I went to the Det- to, to conduct.  I walk up on the podium, and this guy is the concert master.  He looked up and he just looked really, you know, like shame, you know, and I--so I went to the band, I say, "Man, don't worry," like--you know.  And it just made me think, you know.  In music, I take my piece of paper.  Now, this year alone, I'm gonna go to China; I've been to Prague [Czech Republic], I'm going to Poland, I'm going to England in three weeks.  I'll take a piece a paper and I'll put it down in front of people who don't speak my language, who don't know anything about me, I don't know anything about them.  And for that time and space that we're there, they'll do whatever I ask 'em to do with the best of their ability, and whatever I ask them, they'll do it.  Now, I thought about that.  Preachers can't do that, politicians can't do that.  Businessmen can't do that--there's always, there's always a confrontation.  But with this little piece of paper and these notes on it, all these guys are subject to my will for that time period.
Story_ID: 609293
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you.  What was the first time--tell me about the first time you were asked to conduct a symphony.  Now, this is--you've talked about popular music all this time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A symphony?
Speaker 1: --but, but who asked you to conduct the first symphony, and how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, I did write a piece for my high school orchestra [at Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California], you know, which was a symphony, and I did play--oh, you said conduct. I think the first time I really conduct a symphony--
Speaker 1: You know, like the Detroit Symphony [Detroit Symphony Orchestra] or something.  How did you--
Speaker 2: --was probably with Lou Rawls 'cause Lou used to do a lot of symphony dates, you know.  And I think that was probably my first symphony.
Speaker 1: This would be like '65 [1965], '66 [1966], something like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when he, when he--right after, right after, right after 'Dead End Street' came out, he started getting jobs.  You know, the symphonies are all suffering with lack of sponsorship, so they bring in pop artists in to help, you know, earn money.  I had some interesting things in the symphony.  I will mention Cincinnati [Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra], 'cause Cincinnati had just come back from one of those world contests where they had won third place, and their noses were up to here (gesture); I mean they were--we came up--and with Lou.  Now Lou's one of the artists who really respects music, 'cause Lou never had monitors on the stage.  He didn't have the noise.  Lou liked to hear the natural sound of everything, so I know it wasn't too loud or anything.  But I think because they were symphony players and--you know, and one of the cello players was even sitting like this (demonstrates) with the cello.  One of 'em had an earplug in his ear, you know, one of the--and they were giving me the blues.  I mean starting rehearsal, they were giving me the blues.  So, there's a lot of ways to handle these kind of things, so what I did--'cause they, they don't--what they don't understand is that as a, as a musician, especially musicians that I hire--I mean they come from Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York] and all the top schools, they--they've been musicians much--they have much better musicians than I am in the sense of playing and stuff like that.  They may not have my creativity or whatever I have, they don't have, but they are, they are excellent musicians.  So the way I handled this particular situation 'cause they were, they were just being absolutely snobbish, snobbish; not only disrespectful, but just like, you know.  So we took--I called a break early, and when I called the break, I asked the--I told my piano player, I said, "Jeff," Jeff (Unclear), one of the Juilliard graduates. Jeff," I say, "why don't you go over to the piano and just practice scales; don't play any particular song, just your rudiments, you know."  And I told David T. Walker, I said, "David," said, "get your, get your acoustic out and go in the corner and play (unclear).  Don't play blues stuff--just, just like you tuning up, you know."  And then I went to the French horn player and I said, "Ooh, what kind of horn is that?"  And he said--he told me, you know (makes a face).  I said, "God," I said, "could I see it?"  You know.  So, he reluctantly handed it to me, very carefully took another mouthpiece out of the case which, which is cool, you know, and put another mouthpiece and handed it to me, you know.  And I just played one little passage from '(Unclear),' which is a very hard piece to play, especially when you haven't warmed (unclear), and I played that.  And--but I noticed as, as Jeff was playing, the other musicians and the artists were looking at him like, well, god.  They just got through playing 'Dead End Street' and everything, and these guys (makes sound), and David's over there, you know, like (makes sound), and now I picked up the French horn.  So, I could see that they were saying, "Uh-oh," you know, "these guys really can play."  Well, we went--then I went to the orchestra manager and I said, "Listen," I said, "your, your, your orchestra really doesn't seem to be into this today."  I said, "No disrespect," I said, "but you know, why don't we just play the show with the trio?"  You know.  I say, "I mean, after all, the reason we're here anyway is just to help you guys earn some money, so we'll do that by--we'll just play."  "Oh, no, no, oh, oh--oh, no, we'll play.  We, we love to play with you."  When they came back, they were like little kittens.  Man, they played their butts off, man (laughter).  I mean--you know--and I could've bawled about 'em and called 'em a whole sack of 'em, but I said, "Let me handle this a different way."  And so I, I run into--every once in a while I run into--'cause the classical players, they don't understand.  When we started learning to play music, we learned the classics first; that's the way, way it is (background noise).  We have to learn Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart] and Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] and all that other stuff.
Story_ID: 609294
Speaker 1: So I, so I, I run into a few problems now and then, but a lot of times it's rewarding, too.  I remember we were doing a thing with--you mentioned Detroit [Detroit Symphony Orchestra].  We were doing the thing--the opening of the new stadium, and they had Pavarotti [Luciano Pavarotti] and, and (Unclear)--The Three Tenors, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So as, as it's customary, Aretha [Aretha Franklin] was gonna sing 'The Star Spangled Banner' before Pavarotti and The Three Tenor thing.  So I get to the thing, and naturally I want to, you know, pay my respects to the guys, so I went to Pavarotti, you know.  I mean I know--and Placido [Placido Domingo], "Hello, how you doing?"  You know.  So, then I wanna see their conductor and say, "Hello, I'm Aretha Franklin's conductor."  So, I go to the dressing room, there's a guy at the door, and I said, "I'd like to--," you know.  "The maestro is resting."  I understand that, you know; that's cool, you know; but, you know, what my guy would do is say, "You know, H. B. [HistoryMaker H. B. Barnum] duh-duh-duh." You know, Placido's conductor's, you know, "The maestro is resting."  Well, I was really cool.  I backed off and waited, and when he came out, I started to approach him to--just to shake his hand and everything, and he kind of didn't--just turned away, and his man said, "Oh, not now, not now."  It's cool.  Well, we went out and we did 'The Star Spangled Banner,' and I--that arrangement I wrote for Aretha.  When we finished, the orchestra stood up and applauded.  Now, after the thing, he was trying to find me to get my autograph (laughter), and I was really cool, I, you know, but I did it and I say, "Man, I came to see you earlier, but you were resting."  You know, he was very proper and everything.  Say, "I came to see you but you were resting."  He say, "But, you know, it's cool; let's go out and have a cup of coffee one day," you know.  But I--but, you know, you get--it's all music, we all play the same notes; it's just how you arrange 'em and, and the structure, you know, how you arrange 'em.  It's--
Story_ID: 609295
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think we were talking off camera about [HistoryMaker] Harold Battiste, [HistoryMaker] Johnny Pate and some of the other people that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, man, there's so--
Speaker 1: --are arrangers that don't really get the--people don't know who they are a lot of times from behind the scenes.
Speaker 2: Look at the guys that arrange--the guys that arranged for Motown [Motown Records], Dave Van DePitte [David Van DePitte] and, and Paul Riser; these are great guys.  They, they made more hit records than--you know.  But they don't, they don't get the thing.  [HistoryMaker] Ray Chew--a lot of people don't know Ray Chew, the guy that just did the Democratic Convention [2008 Democratic National Convention, Denver, Colorado]; he's a brother and, you know, he's a brilliant, great guy.  We have, we have people outside the playing field like Ernie Fields, Jr., who's a contractor who we steady have to fight the establishment, you know, because just say a lot of the theaters and everything, they have one contract.  I'll tell you, when I first went to New York [New York] to do 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope' [Micki Grant]--and I understand the politics, you know, and I--you know, I--there's more than one way to skin the cat.  I went to New York to do 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,' and, you know, I'm the, I'm the--one of the writers of the show and the music, and I'm gonna conduct the show, and I'm big cheese, you know.  I'm coming out of California, I've got hit records going and everything, you know.  And, so I start to call musicians and I get a call that says, "Barnum [HistoryMaker H. B. Barnum]," says, "you're calling musicians for the show?"  I say, "Yeah, I'm calling, getting the band together."  "Oh, no.  You, you, you don't do that."  I say, "Unh-uh, huh?  What do you mean I don't do that?"  "Well, we have a contractor."  I say, "Well, I didn't hire him," you know, "who is he?"  "Well, his name is--," and they told me the guy's name.  And I said, "Well, I don't even know who that guy is."  Say, "But he contracts the shows."  So, I say, "Well, no he ain't contracted my show; I got my own contract.  I'm bringing Jimmy Bond in from California to do the contract for the show."  So the guy said, "Well, we'd like to meet with you at the union."  This is the musicians' union [American Federation of Musicians].  I sit down, and it was put to me very nicely, and this--and I, and I thought about it and he said, "Listen, if your show closes tomorrow, what, what are you gonna do on Broadway after that?"  He say, "Now wouldn't it be better to let him contract the show, then anybody you want to work, just tell 'em who you want working."  And I thought about it 'cause the same situation happened here at Capitol [Capitol Records] with, with the guy who contract--so I, so I really--I really didn't--I say, "Okay, I'll tell you what to do.  Let's--I'd like to--," and I named off people who I knew in New York, who were very good people, and I say, "If they, if they can get a gig--," and it worked out fine because not only that, but I brought in Joyce, Joyce, Joyce Brown, I bought in--what's the girl's name that she's conducting 'Color Purple' ['The Color People'] now?  I bought all these people in, you know, you know.  So, you have to sometimes back up a step to move two steps forward.  But now, in this day we--like we go to a theater like the amphitheater.  They say, "We have a house contractor."  Well, the union says you can't have a house--it has to be open door. Well, they have a house guy.  So, sometimes we have to back up and say, "Okay, tell your house guy I've got my guy; they have to make the same amount a money, so you wanna pay both, it's all right."  And they do that, rather than give it up.  They paid both and let my guy bring in some of my guys and some of your guys, and we work it out.  And I'm not saying black or white guys 'cause, you know, most of the musicians I use are white guys anyway.  But, but, but they're my guys and, and, and, you know--but the, the houses--and you go around the country--and I just got off the phone with the people in Anderson, Indiana.  The lady says, "Well, I've got a band that'll play for two hundred dollars a man."  I say, "Well, will they play what I want played?  I don't care how much you pay 'em."  She said, "Well, I know these guys."  I say, "Well, look, they're not the guys I wanna use.  So now, let me send it back upstairs to the agency and Aretha [Aretha Franklin], and you tell them that you got the people, when it says in the contract you're supposed to call me, and that I, I book the people and I invoice you, you know.  Now, I don't mind working with your guys, but what you're doing is telling me that you've already got 'em, you haven't talked to me at all.  How do you know what I want?"  You know.  So, we, we still have a few little problems, you know.  But by working with variety of artists I work with, I get a chance to meet all types and all things, you know.  I mean, we've gone from The Osmonds to, to Phil.  I've done stuff for Sinatra [Frank Sinatra], I've done stuff for Dean Martin.
Speaker 1: Is that Phil Collins you're talking about?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: I even had Kay Starr, Frankie Laine.  Then I wrote a Puff Daddy [Sean Combs]; I didn't even know who Puff Daddy was, and I told my son [H. B Barnum III], I say, "I'm doing this thing with this guy name Puff."  "You working for Puff Daddy?"  I said, "Yeah."  "Oh, Dad, Oh, oh, oh (makes sound)."  I say I was getting ready to punch one in his eye 'cause we were in the office, and he said, "Man, you, you, you, you living large," and I thought he was talking about my weight (laughter), you know.  But, you know, I've got a spectrum of people I work with, and--you know the--Pink Floyd's going out to do another tour; I'll probably go and work with them again.
Story_ID: 609296
Speaker 1: I brought my sister [Billie Barnum] into the business.  She's got a--quite a, you know--quite a history, too.  And so it's, it's--
Speaker 2: But what does your sister do?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: She's a background singer but she's been with Pink Floyd.  She, she started with Nat King Cole was her first gig--one of The Merry Young Souls; she was with Nat Cole for twelve years, met her husband there, they been married forty-six years (laughter), but she sing with Pink Floyd, Humble Pie, Queen; she's now--still with David Henley [sic. Don Henley] now.  Pat--she sang on the Smothers Brothers shows, Sonny and Cher shows, Carol Burnett shows, you know.  So, where--it's gonna--and she's not a great singer, but she's very well prepared, and in a situation where they only use, like say, John Williams; she's--every movie he's done, she's been in the scores where they might--there may be only three blacks singing the chorus.  Basically, it started out--because a lot of 'em weren't prepared to go in and sit there, look at the music and sing it right now, you know.  Once they learn it they could sing it probably good as anybody, but it's a business where time is money, where you have to go in and, and, and do it.  They can't play it three times 'fore you can get it in your head; that's not what this business is about.  This business--and it's really become more so since corporate structure has taken over the business.  It's not a creative business anymore; it's a corporate business now.
Story_ID: 609297
Speaker 1: First time I went to Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada], I went to, I went to, to Harrah's [Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel and Casino] with, with Sammy Davis [Sammy Davis, Jr.], and Bill Harrah [William F. Harrah] would come in and he'd come into my dressing room--the lowly conductor--says, "My name is Bill Harrah, I own this place.  If there's anything you want, you let me know."  Now, I didn't think that he meant that, so the first time I picked the phone up to see.  "I'd like to make a collect call to call my mama [Alma Williams Barnum] to tell her I got here safe."  He say, "Mr. Barnum [HistoryMaker H. B. Barnum], you can just dial."  Now, I'm thinking, I don't wanna dial; if I dial this thing gone that's gonna be on my bill when I get ready to leave. He say, "You're our guest."  Bill Harrah told me, he said, "I hear you like to hunt and fish."  Say, "We have a cabin down the road."  Say, "If you don't wanna stay at the hotel, you can stay at the cabin.  There's a boat there and the guy--guys who wanna hunt, and there's a guy that'll take you out hunting."  I mean now, you go and they're worried about a--you know, they, they pour a shot a liquor and they, they measure it, you know, so--I've seen the change.  Oh.  And I forgot to tell you.  I was the first singer at Disneyland [Anaheim, California].  Yeah.  I was the band singer at Disneyland when it opened in 1955 here, and I was the band singer that--we had a, we had a band called The Mustangs, we did eight shows a day, and I sang two songs, 'Wait 'til the Midnight Hour' [sic. 'In the Midnight Hour'] and something else; I forgot what my other song was.  And Mr. Disney [Walt Disney] used to come down as we're sitting here, and he'd sit and talk to us between shows, and we'd walk around and go on rides together and stuff like that.  So--and I was there for three years, eight shows a day, seven days a week for three years.
Speaker 2: This is in the, the club at--
Speaker 1: Well, we played all over the park; we played different--stayed there a while, yeah.
Speaker 2: All over the park?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We did eight, eight shows a day, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Eight twenty minute shows a day.  The guy, Sonny Anderson who, who was the piano player, became the director of Disneyland entertainment.  Tina Mason who had some--did a stint with The Mouseketeers, and then the other guys; a couple of the musicians are still active playing.  But I--yeah, I was, I was a Disneyland singer; they thought I could sing.  I used to come out and do my Wilson Pickett and everything, you know.  And so--
Speaker 2: Isn't that--
Speaker 1: So I've had some fun, you know.  I used to get tickets to any Disney park in the world free, and about nine years ago, Sonny retired, and I took--I took about twenty people to Disneyland.  And I couldn't reach anybody.  You know, there, there, there was a turnover, and I couldn't reach anybody so I, I'll just pay for it.  Man, I almost had a heart attack.  It was--at that time it was like thirty-five, forty dollars per ticket.  I think it's up to like sixty or seventy now.  I couldn't believe it, you know, 'cause I could just, I could just call up and say, "Listen, I'm gonna be in Florida; leave me sixty tickets at the, at the gate," you know.  "Yes, sir, Mr. Barnum [HistoryMaker H. B. Barnum]," you know--boom!  But then it changes, you know.  That--that's why they call us old school now (laughter), 'cause we--everything has changed.  If I go to get a gig now, they say, "Well can you send us a resume?"  Where, before, I'd say, "This is H. B."  "Oh, yeah, Mr. Barnum," you know.  But it's different now (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But it's cool.
Story_ID: 609298
Speaker 1: Well, tell--you have a story about Aretha Franklin in Paris [France] you want to tell us.
Speaker 2: I'm going to have to set this up.  My queen--and I love her to death; she's, she's sent my younger sons [H. B. Barnum III and Daniel Barnum] all the way through school and into college right now.  Miss, Miss Franklin had a time period where she cancelled a lot of jobs, so--even to the point that one day I was on--I was at the airport getting ready to board a plane for Brazil, and got a frantic call from--one of her employees said, "Don't get on the plane.  Don't get on the plane.  She, she, she ain't going."  I said, "What do you mean she ain't going?  My luggage is already checked."  My luggage went to Brazil.  So we, we didn't get on the plane, we stayed here.  Well, we were in England--Paris.  We were supposed to do a tour--England, Paris, up in, oh, Norway, or somewhere, but Miss Franklin decided not to do it.  This is during the time she was married to Glynn Turman.  Glynn is a friend and I--so don't get mad at me Glynn, but this was funny.  We were playing in a place where they have the rates sitting on your seats, you know, go up like that (demonstrates), and they love Aretha anywhere in the world.  I been almost every place; I've been in caves and Marrakech [Morocco], I've been in the deserts in Sahara, and if you say three names, they know who they are--Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Muhammad Ali.  I don't care--you name anybody else, somebody's gonna go, "I never heard of 'em."  They those names around the world.  So we're, we're doing this concert, and we were doing the concert in Paris because she cancelled the whole rest of the tour, and Paris was a TV--live TV show that was gonna make all the promoters have a--they're all gonna share this revenue from this live TV show.  So, as she can, she came out and she killed 'em; that first half, she killed 'em.  I mean she, she--I mean they love her anyway, but when she's on, she's, she's the greatest singer in the world today.  So, halfway during the show, we have a kind of a little rest period where she goes out for about two or three minutes.  Well, prior to the show, she told somebody to put this black scarf on the piano and put this stool under the piano and I, I saw it there; I didn't know why it was there.  I didn't pay attention.  So, we get--we, we get through--we get to this point where she goes off, and I'm playing the little vamp thing and I'm doing my thing, you know.  Now, the audience is as close to me, maybe fifteen feet behind me, that's where the audience starts; they're really close.  So, I'm playing and playing, and playing, she doesn't come back and I'm looking back--where is Aretha?  I'm trying to see Norman or somebody.  "Where Ree?"  They pointing back there (points).  "Where Ree?"  They pointing back there, you know.  We're live TV.  It's like a two and a half minute break, now it's ten minutes, now it's fifteen minutes.  The promoter, the people there were--, "Where is she?  Where is she?"  You know.  "Do something!  Do something!"  But we're live.  So what do I do?  I just keep playing.  The singers are singing (singing), "R- respect--ree, ree, ree--sock it to me."  And they asked me, "We gotta rest for a minute."  I mean we're--now, it's twenty-seven minutes.  We're on live TV.  We've played this vamp so many times; I tell the trumpet to lay out for a minute and then--now you play, now the trombones layout and you rest your chops.  The rhythm guys, they're about to--falling out.  The drummer in this particular instance has got diabetes; we don't know this.  He look like he's about to die back there.  Right before the show, he was looking so--his eyes were so glary I gave him a couple a candy bars to eat--maybe give him some energy, but he's back there and I just--his eyes just--he's just playing.
Story_ID: 609299
Speaker 1: All of a sudden, here comes Aretha [Aretha Franklin]; she's changed clothes.  The people, "Yay!  The queen!  The queen!"  You know.  They don't speak English, but "The queen, the queen."  She comes out and--, "Hold it, H. [HistoryMaker H. B. Barnum]. Hello!"  Response, "Hello!"  "How's everybody?"  Not much response 'cause they--now we're--area they don't understand.  "How many of y'all--I've got a surprise for you.  How many of y'all have heard of 'Cooley High'?" (Makes a face) "'Five on the Black Hand Side'?"  She mentioned one more--no response, except, "Sing!"  "We wanna hear you sing!"  You know, it was very broken English.  "Well, I have a surprise here.  One of the biggest stars in the United States of America, Mr. Glynn Turman!"  And Glynn walks out, very dapper; he's a good looking guy, tux and everything, you know.  I'm, I'm, I'm looking at the singer, I say, "Brenda [Brenda Corbett], what's going on?"  Brenda says, "I don't know," 'cause Brenda's her cousin; she usually knows everything.  "What's happening?"  My back's to the audience.  So, she said, "We're gonna do something for you now.  Have you heard of 'Cyrano de Bergerac'?"  There's no response; they don't understand what she's saying.  "Well, we're gonna do something from 'Cyrano' for you."  And with this point, Glynn turns around and pulls the stool out, helps her, and she sits on the piano in a scarf.  He reaches in his pocket and pulls out the--you know the little playbooks--the little small playbooks?  Opens it up, says, "We're gonna do something from 'Cyrano,'" (laughter).  He reads a line, hands her the book, she reads a line, hand the book back.  Now, the people said, "We wanna hear you sing!"  They kept saying that.  "Sing!"  (Makes sound) "Sing!"  "Sing, you--," and she--they keep on.  I mean we're like thirty-five minutes at this point.  Then, then they start booing.  Then Brenda said, "Look out!"  I did like that (gesture), and something flew past me (laughter).  They start screaming, and they finished the whole like three pages before they stopped.  By this time, the people are booing, they--there's obscenities, and they--she don't--the queen does what she wants to do when she wants to do it.  Glynn takes a bow and goes off, so we got the show back, but it didn't--never really got back to the pitch that it was, you know.  By now the promoters are livid.  They've got our passports and our tickets.  We get back to the hotel and they tell us we've checked out, so I go up to the manager and I said, "Sir," I say, "we haven't checked out."  Then he said, "Well, they told us you had checked out, so if you wanna stay the rest of the night, you gotta pay."  Now, I was gonna go to England from there and by the--by a car, though so, so I had about twelve thousand dollars, American dollars on me.  I said, "Well, look, I'll pay for the rooms tonight, you know."  So I paid for the rooms.  Now, the next morning--I mean we're up all night trying--, "What are we gonna do?"  I mean the lady got our passports, said she's not gong give us our tickets back, she's not gone pay our way home, you know.  I mean we're, we're in panic.  I get up the next morning and I call Ruth Bowen.  They go, "Miss Bowen and, and Miss Franklin checked out; they're gone."  I say, "Oh, my Lord."  I go to the, the promoter, I say, "Listen," said, "whatever happened is not our fault.  Why would you take it out on the poor musicians?"  And she says, "Mr. Barnum, you have been a gentleman," and said, "I'm gonna give you your tickets and your passports, but I'm not paying for anything."  I say, "Well, thank you so much," you know.  Now, we gotta figure out how to get to the airport 'cause we have no money except the money I had on me, and most of that's gone.  We had met some hippies that had a old Volkswagen bus, you know--big Volkswagen bus?  So they said they would take us to the airport, so the--we went to George (unclear), which is a nice hotel.  The rest of the band was at a--down the street; a nice little French hotel.  So I said to him, "Go pick the guys up and bring them here, then I'll get Cecil [Cecil Franklin]," Aretha's brother, who was her manager, "and we'll come down and we'll meet you guys down here."  Now, I only got enough money to pay Cecil's room.  I got the guys paid down there, so they bring the bus up and, and I'm waiting for Cecil to come down.  While I'm waiting for Cecil to come down, I go upstairs and go out the fire escape, go down, come around to get in the bus, I get in the bus, "Everybody here?"  Said, "No, the drummer--," the guy that had been sick?  Say he went in the--waiting in the hotel.  I say, "I gotta go in there and get him."  Now, I just come out the fire escape; I gotta go get him, they gone see me and wanna know what--'cause I, I told 'em we were checking out, they wanna know where their money is.  I go in the lobby, and this brother, man, he looked--you know the guy that played in, in 'Walk the Green Mile'?  'The Green--Last Green Mile' [sic. 'The Green Mile']?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: He's about that big--big brother, man.  He laid on the couch in the middle of the lobby, man, just sweating, I mean he's sick; I mean he's sweating.  I say, "Oh, my god; I gotta get him out of here," (laughter).  So I'm--I get him out.  Make a long story short, they went to the wrong--they went to--they went--they didn't go to de Gaulle [Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris, France], they went to the other airport--the Orly [Paris Orly Airport, Orly, France] (unclear).  Wrong airport.  I'm at de Gaulle.  I had no money for porters--nothing like that, but I got a bunch Aretha albums and pictures.  Man, I'm giving pictures away and I was trying to get on that plane.  We made it out of there boy, but we--we got home, boy, I'll tell you I, I thought, I thought, I know I'm going to be in jail, you know, for something--for not paying these bills.  And, you know, she don't--it doesn't bother her; she don't care, she--boy, when I, when I had to go back to get that guy off that couch--but people walking around there like, you know (gesture).  So, I've got a--we, we, we, we've had so many cancellations and things that happened.

Speaker 1: One night she played for some--up in Flint, Michigan; it was some guy who was a gangster, we didn't know it.  She didn't know it, so she decided she wasn't gonna go on, because this guy's a known drug dealer, but we didn't know that when she took the gig.  So, I said, "Miss Franklin [Aretha Franklin], look; you know, this guy, this guy--if you don't go on, no telling what he might do to all of us, you know.  Let's just do the show, and do a short show and get outta here, you know."  Well, we convinced her of that.  Kansas City [Missouri] she didn't show up, so the promoter was a little gangster guy who's gonna take it out on the band.  Well, in Kansas City, remember I mentioned Sam Ancona [Samuel Ancona] and the--my nephew is married to his daughter?  I called Sam, he came down there in his bathrobe.  These guys were loud talking, "Man, we're gonna--the band ain't gonna get outta here alive and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."  Sam walked in in his bathrobe and says, "Anything wrong, kid?"  And I looked around and the guys was backing up and I said, "I guess not, uncle."  (Laughter) We, we go straight to the airport and got on a plane and got outta there.  So, she's been interesting well, twenty-eight years with, with Aretha now, and we've had a lot of fun, you know.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: There a couple a things.  I don't know if--let's not say--I don't, I don't regret doing them, but I think I might've handled it different.  I was a little, a little quick in my mouth.  I got blackballed from doing movies.  I had just done about my seventh film with the Corbin brothers [ph.], which were B pictures, but I did a very good job, and I was getting calls to do major films.  And one of the big guys in the business showed 'Super Fly' to me, and my remark to him was, "If this had been about a Jewish kid, I don't think you would've made this film; it's a horrible film."  I said, "I think this'll make black kids act crazy."  And he, he told me I would never do a major film in Hollywood, and to this date, I haven't.  But I, I think it's changing because he's no longer alive, and my--I'm getting a resurgence.  The other thing I would've did different, I had told another--I was doing a show called 'Amen,' you know, when it first started.  I did the first four episodes, and it was on Tuesday--
Speaker 1: That's the show with Sherman Hemsley--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, yeah.  I did the first four episodes.
Speaker 1: --and Clifton Davis, right.
Speaker 2: It was on TV--it was on, it was on Tuesday nights, which is my choir night like tonight?  And we were taping 'til 11:00, 12:00 at night.  Well, when I took the show, I told the producers, I said, "Listen, what time we get through taping?"  He said, "Oh, about 6, 6:30."  I say, "Oh, great, that's fine."  The first episode went so long that I went to him, and I thought I was doing the right thing.  I said, "Listen, I don't think I'll be able to do this show because I have a commitment on Tuesday nights and I--," you know--and I, I was probably naive in doing this.  He said to me, "What's your commitment?"  I said, "Well, I have a choir [LIFE Choir] that meets on Tuesday night."  And in very bad words, he said, "(Makes sound) choir."  Say, "I'm paying you ten thousand dollars a week and you telling me about some (makes sound) choir."  And he said, "(Makes sound) the choir."  I said, "(Makes sound) you, too" (laughter).  And so, if people who know my career, know I was doing the, the Essence awards [Essence Music Festival], I was doing the, the--what's the gospel show?  The--I was doing the, the Academy Awards [Oscars], I was doing the music awards, I was doing the Image Awards [NAACP Image Awards], I was doing all these shows, and then--so you'll know--everybody will know this producer guy is.  From that, that day, I--all those shows were taken away from me.  Now, I could cry about it and--you know--but, you know, the truth is I haven't missed a meal, I haven't missed a house payment, you know.  I got more material things than anybody can do anything with.  I, I have to clean my closet out three times a year just to give stuff away, so I haven't missed it.  I, I would like to do a, a major movie, and I think I will before it's all over, you know.  I think I'll--you know, I would like to do more television, and I think it's coming back around now, you know, 'cause the business has changed, and there a lot of young blood in the business, and some of them will, you know, not even care about what--you know.  But this is a very--this, this entertainment business is a very close business, you know, and very vindictive to those who don't play the game properly.

Speaker 1: Now, well, tell us this.  When you look back on your career again, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's not here yet; I'm, I'm still working on it (laughter).  You know, I, I've never been concerned with that, I just--my mother [Alma Williams Barnum] told me as long as I had a place to sleep and something to eat, that I had everything that I, that I was entitled to.  Anything that--anything past that is a plus, so I got a lot of pluses.  I got two kids--I got two great kids, I got fifty-eight great grandkids, I have more food than I can eat, more houses than I can live in, more clothes than I can wear, so, you know--I don't, I don't--and, and I, I have a lot of good friends, a lot of good people around me.  So--and legacy, I don't know.  Everybody will say what they wanna say.  People that like me will say something good, people don't like me will say something bad, so I don't worry about that.
Story_ID: 609303
Speaker 1: Well, tell us a little bit about your family now.  You mentioned your kids.  Could you tell us about your kids and?
Speaker 2: I have two boys and--now that's said, either one of 'em are in music, they both play well.  My oldest son, H. B. III [H. B. Barnum III], is a excellent guitar player, keyboard player and everything, but he has no love for the music, no passion for it.  He's a computer analyst, and we did shows together where--when the computers first came out, he just quickly picked it up and we were doing a lot of shows, but then I found he wasn't happy, so I told him to do what he wanted to do, and he, he just likes to tinker with the computers.  He left En- not Enron [Enron Corporation]--is it--is that the computer based on the war things?
Speaker 1: I'm not--
Speaker 2: You know, you know, he left, he left them the--he's in a small company now where they build systems for companies, you know--worldwide systems.  He's really happy.  My younger son is a junior at University of Arizona [Tucson, Arizona]; he wants to play on the professional tour.  Daniel [Daniel Barnum], you better make the golf team this year 'cause I could--need some scholarship money.  And I have fifty-eight godchildren, and like I said, they're all, they're all over the country--all over the world in fact.  I got one in Poland, a couple in England, one in the Philippines.  I, I talk to them almost every day; with Skype we could talk all over the world and don't have to pay, so I talk to them, you know, on a daily basis.  I--legacies and things like that--whatever they say, they say, you know, so.
Story_ID: 609304
Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't talked about?  I know it's probably a lot of things we haven't talked about we could've talked about, but is there any major thing we need to mention before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I'm just--when, when you called to say you wanted to do this, I thought you wanted me to talk about some of the other artists or something, I had no idea you wanted to talk about me (laughter).  So I'm really honored, and thank you very much, and maybe it'll be helpful to somebody.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you.  Our last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't wanna get spiritual here, or something like that.  I'm not concerned about how I'm gong be remembered; I'm concerned about where I'm going from here.  So, what I try to do is to treat people in a way that, that if it were reversed, I--you know, it wouldn't be a problem.  That's not easy to do because no matter what you do, there's always somebody that's there that's gonna have a negative take to it.  I mean, you know, they're not gonna--they're not gonna receive it the way you send it out.  So, if, if you--if you remember me that I, that I try to, try to be straight up, I try to watch other people's feelings.  And sometimes, sometimes you don't have to be right all the time, you know, you--if you know you're right, then you don't have to punch somebody in the nose to prove it, you know.  And, and that's not to say--now, I just said I wanna be straight up, but then sometimes you have to back off a little bit and let somebody else have a little space, and I'll do that.  So I, I hope people remember me as a nice person, I hope that they remember me as a person with talent, and I hope they know that I'm a very lucky person, and I'm grateful for every minute of it.  That's, that's--you know.  Other than that, I--it doesn't matter.  If I go to the right place, I'm cool (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.  We've been lucky to talk to you, so thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you; thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
