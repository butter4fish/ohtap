Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns; observing are Latoya Crowe [Latoya J. Crowe], Andreya Davis [Andreya J. Davis], and Crystal Brown.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Sure, Wayne Alix Ian Frederick [HistoryMaker Dr. Wayne A. I. Frederick], W-A-Y-N-E, A-L-I-X, I-A-N, last name is F-R-E-D-E-R-I-C-K.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of (laughter).  My, my dad [Alix Frederick] had a horse, a white horse named Wayne, is the only connection I can make, but I, I'm gonna deny that for as long as I can.
Speaker 1: I, I understand, understand.  And, and the spelling of Alix is a little different, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's an English--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --version of the spelling.  Wayne actually is a Scottish name, and Alix is, is spelled in a Scottish fashion as well, as in A-L-I-X.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And sir, what is, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: June 17, 1971, Port of Spain, Trinidad [Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago].
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a surgeon as well as a university president.
Speaker 1: And you're the president of Howard University [Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the seventeenth president of Howard University.
Speaker 1: There we go, okay.  All right, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is January 30th, 2017.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at Howard University, in my office suite.
Story_ID: 650799
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five questions we always ask as a kind of a warm up, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  It's called doubles, which is a Trinidadian delicacy.  It's an Indian dish.  You could say it's a small version of a roti without any type of meat in it, chickpeas and curry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I do, blue.
Speaker 1: All right, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I do as well, summer.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Montego Bay, Jamaica.
Speaker 1: And the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, man's greatest imperfection is his passive acceptance of his imperfection.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 650800
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Alix Frederick] side; but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Frances Mabel Tyson-Hill [Frances Tyson-Hill].  That's F-R-A-N-C-E-S; Mabel is M-A-B-E-L; and her last name is hyphenated; it's T-Y-S-O-N, hyphen, H-I-L-L.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is October 23rd, 1945.  And she was born in Trinidad and Tobago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Port of Spain as well or--
Speaker 2: You know, I, I hesitated because I believe she was born in Chaguanas [Trinidad and Tobago].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How, how far back can you trace them and--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --are there any stories about some of your relatives?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so my--as far back as I can go is my great-grandfather was an indentured laborer who was brought from India to work on plantations in Trinidad.  He was a, a very shrewd businessperson as well, and so he acquired a lot of land at that time and became a pretty significant landowner.  He married my great-grandmother, and they had two daughters, one of whom was my grandmother.  Her name is Christine Roach [ph.].  They, as a result, grew up in that part of the country where agriculture was prolific in Chaguanas, Trinidad.  And--
Speaker 1: How do you spell Chaguanas?
Speaker 2: It's C-H-A-U-G-A-U-N-A-S [sic.].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: All right, so Chaguanas is a agricultural area where a lot of farm --
Speaker 1: Yeah, at, at that time, correct.  It's now much more of a metropolitan type of place.  My grandmother, Christine, worked and met my grandfather, Charles Arthur Tyson [Charles Tyson].  They got married and had five kids, of who my mother was the oldest.  Subsequent to that, my grandmother and my grandfather divorced.  She remarried.  She remarried a gentleman by the name of Victor Roach [ph.], and they then had five kids as well.  So my mom was the oldest of my grandmother's ten children.  They all grew up in the environment of Chaguanas in an area called San Juan in Trinidad.  My grandfather was a principal.  My--as in my mother's father was a principal at a high school and elementary school for quite some time before he went to England and became a lawyer later in life, in his forties.  And then--
Speaker 2: So he was a principal of a high school in Trinidad and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So he had gone to college ahead of time (unclear)--before--
Speaker 1: Right, and then he went back to get--at that time they, they had a teachers college that he attended.  And then he went to England to become a lawyer and came back to Trinidad and had a pretty prolific law practice (clears throat)--as well as did dabble a bit in politics as well, was a supporter of a couple of political parties as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So was he involved in the independence movement in Trinidad?
Speaker 1: He was not directly involved in the independence movement but certainly knew and interacted with all of the principals that, that were involved.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I know, Eric Williams is one of the, the heroes of your mother--
Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 2: --and a Howard graduate and someone who taught here, all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so he, he wasn't a Howard grad, but he--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --he did teach here.  And he was, he, he probably was the first person that I ever realized my mother admired so much that was a public figure.  He went to Oxford [University of Oxford, Oxford, England] and then came to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] because he used to describe it as the black Oxford.  And before going back to Trinidad to fight colonialism and to gain independence for Trinidad, he felt that Howard was a necessary stop in his journey because of what was taking place at Howard University in those years.  So he came here and joined the faculty of the political science department and was a prolific writer while he was here before going back to Trinidad.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think his classic book is 'Racism and Capitalism' [sic. 'Capitalism and Slavery,' Eric Williams].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, classic book, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 650801
Speaker 1: So your mother [Frances Tyson-Hill] did, did, did she have a chance to go to college too?
Speaker 2: No.  She went to nursing school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which at the time was not--well, the way it was set up in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago] was not necessarily considered a college or university.  She actually wanted to become a physician.  My grandfather [Charles Tyson] felt that women should become nurses at that time and encouraged her to attend a nurses, nursing school in Trinidad at that time, and so she did that and practiced nursing for some fifty, fifty-one years.
Speaker 1: Now that's the prevalent thinking in those days, even though there were women who were physicians in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, but they were--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --far and wide in between, especially in Trinidad at the time.  He was a good man.  It wasn't the best of decisions, but given the time and the circumstances he was in, you know, he felt that that was the right decision.
Story_ID: 650802
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Frances Tyson-Hill] talk about what's li- what it was like growing up in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, absolutely.  She, she loved it.  They grew up in a, you'd say probably between lower class and middle class.  And as life progressed, they advanced into the middle class, and I would say even into the upper middle class.  She describes her childhood, you know, as, as one that was fun, you know, lots of stuff to do, always chores.  Being the eldest, she had the responsibility a lot of times for kind of overseeing, you know, her younger siblings, who as she describes she had three younger brothers and a younger sister at that time.  And they were, you know, ex- extremely gregarious folks.  When they get together they tell lots of stories of, you know, sneaking out to parties and things like that, normal teenagers would do.  She--her relationship with my grandfather [Charles Tyson] was a special relationship as well, she being his first child.  They were very, very close, and I saw that in my childhood.  He would come over to our house every weekend with a group of friends and have a meal with us and have some drinks with his friends.  And you know, I got the opportunity to kind of, just observe both of them interacting as well as, you know, listening in on some of the conversation as well.
Story_ID: 650803
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you about your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: So my father's name was Alix George Frederick [Alix Frederick].  And that's A-L-I-X, George, G-E-O-R-G-E, and Frederick, F-R-E-D-E-R-I-C-K.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His, his full date of birth I have to get from the sheet, and I'll tell you why.  I, I don't, I didn't know my dad.  He died a month shy of my third birthday.  He and my mom [Frances Tyson-Hill] were, you know, a young couple in love with two really young kids.  My younger brother [Stephan Frederick] at the time was probably nine months old.  I, I, yeah, I think he was about may- actually maybe even young, maybe seven months old at the time of my father's death.  And part of my mom's coping mechanism was to not have us engage with anybody in his family.  It's--he died on May 9th, 1974.  And to this day, if I call my mom and ask my mom about him, she'll, you know, choke up and you know, the conversation will end very shortly after it started.  So she, she still has never had a full conversation with me about all of the circumstances surrounding his death.  He was a mounted branch police officer who fell off his horse and had a head injury that resulted in an operation.  At that time he was diagnosed with a leaking brain aneurism, you know, right after that happened.  And then shortly after that, died.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so he was--I, I, I take he was born close to the same time as your mother.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He, I, I want to say he might have been a year or two older than my mom.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I believe my mom--the form that you sent us--
Speaker 1: Has the information?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So '41 [1941] or '42 [1942], just, just for the sake of--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: --this conversation--
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-one [1941].
Speaker 1: --and a couple (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, I, I know you didn't grow up with him, but what do you know about his family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, they lived in the southern parts of Trinidad from an area called Point Fortin [Trinidad and Tobago].  Fortin is spelled F-O-R-T-I-N.  At that time, you know, he--I, I get the impression that he was: one, he was an only child, is how my mom describes him to me, was a bit of a disciplinarian, wanted to--he joined the police service [Trinidad and Tobago Police Service].  And everyone that I've ever met who knew him, other officers who have since become commissioner of police and so on, always described him, although he was a, a pretty young police officer, as someone that everybody always thought would become the commissioner of police at some point.  He was very serious about what he was doing, very focused.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there--did he get a chance to go to college or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, didn't go to college, went straight into the police service is, is what I understand, out of high school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's common in even now.  A lot of places--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --where you can go from high school and join the police force.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 650804
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Frances Tyson-Hill] and father [Alix Frederick] met?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's quite a story actually, so.  My, my mom and dad met in a very similar way to how I met my wife [Simone Frederick] actually.  So my--kind of around carnival time in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago] my mom was at an event at an area called Queen's Park Oval [Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago], which is a major place for cricket, but people did also a whole other functions there.  She was leaving that event to walk back to the nursing hospital, which is within a mile or two of that area.  My father was on duty on his horse and saw my mom and offered to escort her back to the hospital.  And so he walked alongside her on the horse all the way back and told her that he'd be back the next day to meet her.  Came back the next day to the hostel to meet her, and she wasn't there.  So he proceeded to sit and write a letter to her.  Her version of the letter is that he basically told her that he was extremely serious, and he'd be back the next day at five [o'clock] and expected her to be there.  And so she said that she thought he was crazy and scary enough that she did wait for him the next day (laughter).  And the rest, as they say, is history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My wife and I met in almost the same area, 'cause she actually grew up in a house maybe two blocks away from where my parents actually physically met each other.  It was carnival time.  I met her at the end of the festivities, and I actually walked her home.  So we walked in the opposite direction, and then I, I left her with my chain and the engagement ring that my dad gave my mom as a reason to come back and see her the next day.  When I--well, later that evening, when I went back later that evening, her mom gave me back my chain and engagement ring and told me that she went out.  I was pretty disappointed.  And the next day I was leaving for the airport to go back to Houston [Texas], and so I stopped by and met her, had a conversation with her.  That was February 13th.  I met her on February 12th, and the next day was Valentine's Day.  We probably spent seven hours on the phone overnight.  And in a similar fashion, as they say, the rest of it is history.  Four months later she was--we were living together.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  That's, that is something.  So, so your parents, so they met and they were like--so there's a real strong emotional bond in there someplace that, that--
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Absolutely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) went awry some sort of way I guess.
Story_ID: 650805
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents and their personalities, their sense of humor, their political views, how they walk, how they talk, what they look like, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think physically I look like my mom [Frances Tyson-Hill].  My dad [Alix Frederick] was a tall, light-skinned gentleman.  I don't think I look much like him when I look at pictures.  I think I look more like my mom.  But I think definitely personality wise, from everything that people describe to me, I probably took after my dad.  You know, I, I, I won't say I'm as serious, you know, as, as people describe him to be, but I think I'm very focused in terms of what I do, the things that I do.  I think the relationships that he has, or he had, with family members and you know, friends is one of deep loyalty, I think is the same thing that I cherish, you know, that deep loyalty.  My mom, I would describe her as fun loving.  At, at my age, I think I have some streaks of that but probably not to the extent that she had it.  And you know, I, you know, I think from an interaction just in terms of engaging with the kids and so on, I think, again, my mom describes my interaction with my two kids [Wayne A. I. Frederick II and Kirie Frederick] the same way my dad interacted with us as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So do you have any idea why they broke up or--
Speaker 2: No, my parents didn't break up.  They, they--my dad died.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right, he--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: That's right, he--
Speaker 2: --a, a month shy of my third birthday.
Speaker 1: Hm. That was your [maternal] grandparents [Christine Roach (ph.) and Charles Tyson] that had--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, hm. Fell off his horse, (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Story_ID: 650806
Speaker 1: Do you have siblings?
Speaker 2: I have two siblings--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --one younger brother [Stephan Frederick].  My mom [Frances Tyson-Hill] remarried [Peter Hill] a few years after my dad's [Alix Frederick] death, and I have a younger brother [Hilary Hill] who is probably some seven years--six years younger than I am.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Can you tell us something about them?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Three of us are very different.  They both went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  My second brother never finished.  My youngest brother did.  He's a physical therapist.  My second brother works retail.  And you know, I think the most probably stunning thing about the three of us is when people meet us independently, they never realize that we're related.  So we're--you couldn't have three more different guys who grew up in the same house.  My youngest brother, it's understandable because he was, you know, a few years younger than we were.  When he started high school I was in college, and so it was a different time.  He had a different relationship with my, our parents at that time as well.  But my second brother and I are very, very different.  He's a, he's definitely a fun loving, carefree, live in the moment kind of guy.  And you know, again, I think we have a very close relationship, all three of us; but we're very, very different.
Story_ID: 650807
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Me, yeah, I do.  You know, at the age of three I remember lis-overhearing my [maternal] grandmother [Christine Roach (ph.)] talking to some neighbors about my having sickle cell [sickle cell anemia].  And I, I didn't quite understand what it was, et cetera.  I was riding on a tricycle.  At the time I remember stopping her to ask her to explain to me what it was, and she attempted to do so.  I rode off and came back and said to her I was gonna become a doctor to find a cure for sickle cell.  She, she repeats that story a lot, and that's, but, and that's probably my earliest childhood memory.
Speaker 1: That seems like an indication of focus (laughter), purpose.
Speaker 2: Yeah, from a pretty early age.  She, you know, my grandmother and I were very close.  She was a huge motivating factor in terms of she never made me feel that I would not be able to accomplish the things that I set, set out to do.  And so, you know, and that, anytime I would repeat that, you know, she would just encourage me and act as if of course that's gonna happen.  And so it was a, a strong motivator growing up.
Story_ID: 650808
Speaker 1: Now, sickle cell anemia is, is a disease that--the first time I remember it getting a lot of public attention was in the early '70s [1970s].  Tony Brown had a public television show ['Tony Brown's Journal'] and discussed it.  And then there was all sort of magazine articles about it.  People were talking about it.  And it was a disease that is primarily in the African and African American population.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And there are some Mediterranean people that have it as well.  But explain, what is it?
Speaker 2: Sure.  So sickle cell anemia is a hemoglobin disorder that affects the hemoglobin protein, which is the oxygen carrying protein in the red blood cell.  It came about and people suspect it may have come about as a mutation in Africa because people with malaria, in particular, and, and, and carriers of malaria, people devolved--they suspect people devolved a mutation as a way to avoid being infected by malaria.  What happens, those red blood cells don't live long enough for the malaria parasite to proliferate within the blood.  So people with sickle cell and sickle cell trait are less likely to develop, you know, bad cases of malaria or malaria at all.  The problem is that once you inherit both of the recessive genes, the disease is very debilitating and is associated to a very short lifespan, strokes in childhood, kidney failure, kidney disease, things of that nature.  And so, you know, it obviously doesn't benefit in terms of, you know, not being able to get malaria at that time, but as time would go on obviously those born with the disease would be affected in neg- negatively.  As you mentioned, they are Mediterranean folks who aren't black skinned who also have sickle cell as a result of that as well.
Story_ID: 650809
Speaker 1: I know there was a lot of talk about trying to find a cure for it in the early '70s [1970s].  Yeah,  (unclear) there's discussions about it before then, I don't ever remember hearing it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the scientific community there was because it's one of the most studied genetic disorders.  And you know, adding from a clinical point of view, it's one of those disease processes that you can track the family members with the trait.  You can predict, to a certain extent, what people's risks are for having it and so on.  The other reason that it was discussed in the scientific community is because [U.S.] Army, black Army recruits back in the '50s [1950s] into the '60s [1960s] were having lots of difficulty going through basic training, so they would end up with joint pain, unexplainable.  And in investigating that, you know, the, the actual sickle cell disorder [sickle cell disease] and genetic makeup of what caused it was really identified.  But a lot of people claimed that the investigation of the black Army recruits and why they would not be able to tolerate the physical activity without getting this debilitating pain is part of what brought it to people's attention as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know in the '70s [1970s], there's, there was three streams of discussion about it.  One stream was there were some activists that were questioning whether it even existed, and which is not true; it does it exist.  And, and there was, there was, there were also people who, who had--there, there was, you know, a lot of different cures supposedly that, you know, people came out with. One Nigerian was telling me that someone in Nigeria had discovered a chew stick they could--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --take care of it, you know.  I mean, like people were--these were coming out every month (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --different way.  So it was used as, as a political, you know, as a discussion, discussion of what, what, what to do to cure it.  And it dominated a lot of news in the, in the '70s [1970s].  Now it seems like it's not discussed as much anymore.  But this is a serious and very painful disease, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is. I mean, I was born in 1971.  Mandatory testing for the disease was initiated in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago] in 1970.  So at birth you know, my, my parents [Frances Tyson-Hill and Alix Frederick] were told about it.
Story_ID: 650810
Speaker 1: As a result, I spent the first six months of my life in an apartment close to the hospital, within walking distance, before we moved into the home that my parents [Frances Tyson-Hill and Frederick's stepfather, Peter Hill] still live in today.  And it, it is.  I was hospitalized probably on three to six times a year as a result of having sickle cell crises growing up, you know, as a kid.  And the life expectancy at that time was about eight years old, is what my parents were told in 1971.  So making long term plans was not a big part of, you know, our family discussions around what I would do long term, et cetera.
Speaker 2: Did you know that then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, I, I think between eight and twelve I discovered that.  Interesting enough, my, my mom made a big deal about my birthdays; still does to this day.  And as I look back on it, I think a lot of that had to do with, you know, how she coped with the fact that she felt, you know, I probably would not live a long life.  And so as a kid, in my neighborhood it was well known as well that, you know, that was the case.  I remember really young kids stopping me once and asking me if I was gonna die when I was sixteen.  You know, kids can be insensitive, not by being cruel but being curious sometimes.  And I remember asking my mom about that, and you know, she, she answered honestly about it.  So you know, growing up, I think that was always the feeling.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now you also spent a lot of time in hospitals and in doctors' offices as well as that, right?
Speaker 1: That's correct.
Speaker 2: Kids normally, children normally, especially young boys, spend a lot of times in doctors' (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --anyway from doing different things.  But, but you spent more because you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, absolutely.  You know, being hospitalized as frequently as I was, was, was a big part of my childhood and a big part of what framed my point of view and opinion about a lot of things.  I spent a lot of time laying in the bed.  I remember, you know, all, the anxiety I always had about when the doctor would get there, you know, and being so anxious to see the doctor to find out when I would be better, and more importantly, when I would get to go home.  And then I also remembered how, you know, being disappointed when that person would, you know, say I had to spend another day or you know, they won't show or what would happen next and so on.  So a lot of what I do in terms of practicing medicine today, really evolves all to that.  Spending time with the patients and you know, that communication aspect of it is important.  Several times those doctors would stand at the foot of the bed, never lay a hand on me or address me directly.  You know, I guess part of it being a kid; part of it was how we viewed physicians and interested with physicians back then.  And so, you know, I know today when I see my patients I always keep that in mind, even if I don't have good news or I don't have definitive news.  I try my best to, you know, always sit in front of the patient when I go in the room.  You know, all, all those types of things that's to slow me down enough so that they can get my attention, and you know, when I leave the room they can feel comfortable even if they don't hear what, you know, they were hoping to hear.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're referring to something that happened.  So you can even see that in old movies about white people, where the doctor, a doctor in a Jewish community or poor Italian community or whatever is considered, is, is, is considered--is feared on one hand and, and, and, and aw- people are in awe of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, very--
Speaker 2: --them.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Being a doctor is considered the highest aspiration of, of a youth. I mean--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  No, absolutely, and, and that's, that's how I saw physicians growing up.  They, they represented the pinnacle of societal achievement, as it were.  And so, you know, I, I always held doctors that came to see me in, you know, in, in awe, as you, as you mentioned.
Story_ID: 650811
Speaker 1: Now, how would they treat you?  I mean, how would they treat si- your sickle cell [sickle cell anemia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know what, it was not clear what the best treatment was.  While in America, narcotics were used for pain control and so on, that was never the case in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago].  As a matter of fact, I don't ever remember getting any kind of pain medication until I came to this country.  So you know, they tried hydration.  There was a theory that your blood was acidic, which is not totally incorrect.  Part of the problem is that if you get deoxygenated and the hemoglobin then takes on a sickle shape, which is why the disease is named sickle cell. Those blood cells get sticky and they get stuck in the smaller vessels in your joints, especially in (unclear)--like your joints, and that exacerbates and really causes the pain.  So with that in mind, the, in terms of the treatment, you know, they would give you things to try to alkalize your bloodstream, so bicarbonate soda or something that I would have to drink.  And just the taste or the smell of it now makes me sick to the stomach.  But you know, the annals of preventing infection, so sometimes they would give you drugs like penicillin, antibiotics.  Whereas today we recognize that hydration is a major part of that, of the treatment.  Staying oxygenated, well oxygenated, is a major part of treatment and good pain control.  So when I came to this country, a, a big part of my mom's [Frances Tyson-Hill] reasoning was because Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] had a sickle cell center [Center for Sickle Cell Disease].  And so a lot of those things in terms of my treatment changed dramatically.  I also learned a lot about my disease, and so my ability to manage it was also enhanced significantly.

Speaker 1: Tell us about growing up in Tri- Trinidad (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: What, what, what is Trinidad like, 'cause I, I imagine mostly African Americans who live in the United States are gonna be watching this at some point who have never grown, grown up in Trinidad, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what was it like?
Speaker 2: You know, Trin- Trinidad was a great place to grow up.  You have a tropical climate.  Sports were a big part of the activities growing up, the, the cricket and foot- football, which is known as soccer here in the U.S. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Though for record, it's just about Venezuela, right?
Speaker 2: It's just about Venezuela.
Speaker 1: It's an island--
Speaker 2: Yep, just above--
Speaker 1: --just north of--
Speaker 2: Just north of Venezuela.  That's about eleven degrees latitude from the equator, so it's very close to equator as well.  On the southern coast of Trinidad on a clear day you can see the northern coast of Venezuela, on a, on a clear day, so that's how close the countries are.  It's a twin island state, Trinidad and Tobago.  I spent obviously my childhood on the, the island of Trinidad.
Speaker 1: That's the larger one.
Speaker 2: That's the larger of the two islands.  And it was a, a lot of fun.  You knew all your neighbors.  Summer when school was out, most of the activities you participated in involved everyone in the neighborhood.  So you know, you really grew up in a, in a community where you knew everyone.  My [maternal] grandmother [Christine Roach (ph.)] and the rest of my--and my aunts and uncles grew up within a mile of our home in the same community as well.  So you know, when it was the, you know, league soccer games or you know, cricket or any other types of activities that took place in the neighborhood, the family was always, you know, well integrated into it as, as, as part of all of those activities, so it was really a lot of fun.  I had a great childhood in terms of what I was exposed to.
Story_ID: 650813
Speaker 1: My education as well was phenomenal, as I look back on it.  My elementary and--
Speaker 2: Where did you start school?  What was the name of your first school?
Speaker 1: First school I went to, I, I, I went to a, a type of Montessori, set up with just a few students, didn't--I know--I'm not even sure that it was a formal name as much as, as a lady in the neighborhood who would take in really young kids.  So I was taught my alphabet and how to count and stuff before going to formal school.  That was a major part, very early start.  And then once I did attend school, I went to the school in the neighborhood known as Diego Martin, as in D-I-E-G-O, M-A-R-T-I-N Government Primary School [Diego Martin Government Primary School, Diego Martin, Trinidad and Tobago], which is the equivalent of an elementary school here.
Speaker 2: Now, Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago] is on the British system, right?
Speaker 1: It's on the British system, and so it was a very robust education.  As, as I look back on it and I look at the education my kids [Wayne A. I. Frederick II and Kirie Frederick] have had in elementary school here, primarily private schools, it, it rivaled it.  I mean, it was a very, very strong education.  And then I went to high school.  The system is set up differently, such that you go to high school really around the time you would go to middle school here.  And I went to--the formal name of the school I went to is called the College of the Immaculate Conception, CIC, St. Mary's College [Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago].  And that was a, a quite an experience as well.  Then you had to really pick what kind of direction or field you wanted to go into, whether you wanted to do business or focus more on the languages or science.  And I elected to do more science subjects; so everything from math, physics, chemistry, biology I immersed myself in.
Story_ID: 650814
Speaker 1: Now, just go back to grade school days, did, did you have any favorite teachers at Diego Martin [Diego Martin Government Primary School, Diego Martin, Trinidad and Tobago]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I did.  There were two teachers in particular that stood out.  You know, my, my first teacher at that school was a woman by the name of Margaret Taylor [ph.].  Funny enough, I dated her daughter many, many years later (laughter), and her mom would always--I was always wondering if her mom had stories about me when I was back then.  And I always remembered her.  She was, and she, she was very good at motivating us, very organized, and you know, someone that I felt I always emulated in terms of how, how, how professional she was about what she was doing.  You know, and back then teachers, you know, were really high standing members in our society and our community as well.  The other teacher that stands out to my mind was my last teacher in elementary school, a woman by the name of Mrs. Chandler [ph.].  And that last class and oh, that, that, that last class in elementary school you get ready to take an exam that decides where you go to high school.  And the best performers go to the better high schools.  And she prepared us in a really strict and stringent way, was robust preparation.  And I think it was a big part of what really launched my academic career in terms of, you know, I felt that I did have a good ability to recall and you know, to pay attention.  But I got really serious about school I think in that, that--in her class in particular.
Story_ID: 650815
Speaker 1: Now I, I think I read, if I remember it right, that, that some of the time off you spent hospitalized or at home, you know, in a sickle cell cri- crises was time that you used to, to study.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I read a lot.  I was a vociferous reader back in those days.  My mom [Frances Tyson-Hill] was always very--education was a big part of what she felt was necessary but more so about books.  She really felt that reading was important.  So one of the things that I would do was constantly ask her to buy me books, and so she would do that.  I remember our summer vacations when I would be, you know, I would be off and everyone would be vacationing, she would bring me a book a week.  And I would, you know, just be going through that, to the point that I think around the age of twelve I pleaded with her to buy us an encyclopedia.  Back in those days that was like getting a, an Apple laptop.  And I remember thumbing through almost every single volume of, you know, what then took up so much space in our house, and experimented on everything that I found in there.  You know, want to plant potatoes in the backyard, I would go through that encyclopedia and look up potatoes.  And I mean, that's everything, everything that I was ever curious about, you know.  I was so happy when we got, when we got that encyclopedia as an example.  It was such an important part of, you know, what, what I would do during the summer times as well.
Story_ID: 650816
Speaker 1: Now you, you had like, you broke a arm and broke a leg at one point--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right, grow- growing up.  Was that related to sickle cell [sickle cell anemia], or was it--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, it related more to playing soccer--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which my mom [Frances Tyson-Hill] totally abhorred.  She never wanted me to play soccer.  I would say when I was ten, eleven I was decent at, at playing it, but my sickle cell obviously prevented me from being able to excel.  I, I couldn't develop the stamina, plus I was a really small kid.  And around ten, eleven the other kids started growing, and I didn't as a result of my sickle cell.  That's one of the things with sickle cell. Lots of people with sickle cell tend to be very small in stature and so on.  Your adolescent characteristics come in really late, later on in life, more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You look young now--
Speaker 2: --when you're in twenties.
Speaker 1: --to tell the truth--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but you're, but you're tall--you're, you're what, about 5'10" at least?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm almost (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --5'11".
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I was--I came to college, I was 5'6", you know, and stayed like that for a couple of years.  So you know, it wasn't something that I could do that my mom wanted me to do regularly.  My stepfather [Peter Hill], you know, was really kind, and I always appreciate that he did this.  He was--a lot of times my coming to school and away from--and, and back home took place with him.  He was prisons officer.  And the main jail in, in Trinidad was actually a block above my school [Diego Martin Government Primary School, Diego Martin, Trinidad and Tobago], so he would, you know, drop me off to school and pick me up.  Oftentimes I would go to the soccer field and play, and he would come and park his car, not let me know he was there, and watch me play.  I would get in the car, and we'd never talk about it.  I would change my clothes and go back home.  Sometimes I would have to go to sleep muddy just so that my mom wouldn't know that I was out playing soccer, and he never would, would spill the beans.  But one of those times I was playing in the courtyard at school and I broke my leg.  And another time on Howard's campus [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], playing on the main yard, I, I fell and broke my arm, actually both, you know, really treacherous events as I look back on it now because of all of the risks with having sickle cell.  But both (unclear)--and I survived.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So what position did you play in soccer?
Speaker 2: I used to play forward--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I, when I played a lot.  Now when I play, I like to play more midfield.  Like I said, a, a big part of this is stamina or lack of it, so I like playing up front so you went--the ball wasn't there as often so I could catch my breath (laughter), et cetera.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 650817
Speaker 1: Well you do a lot of studying.  This is true, and you've got, like, to deal with this, with sickle cell anemia, which is a big part of anybody's life that has it.  But what, what did you do for fun?  Did you have favorite music or, or--
Speaker 2: You know, I wa- I wasn't--
Speaker 1: --distractions?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I wasn't into music as much as I was into soccer and you know, that type of activity.  Having said that, I, I did fall in love with Bob Marley's music because of an uncle who played it constantly.  You know, and my mom [Frances Tyson-Hill] had a, a few favorite songs that she would play.  The first record I ever bought, and I have to say record because that's what was available in those days, was a 45 [45 rpm record] by The J. Geils Band band called 'Centerfold.'  And every time I hear that song now I--it, it was one of those records with two sides.  The J. Geils Band had two songs, 'Centerfold' and 'Freeze-Frame,' which, you know, a few months ago I, I heard on the radio and definitely brought a little smile to my face.  But that's probably the only record I ever bought.
Story_ID: 650818
Speaker 1: So you're born in '71 [1971].  Eric Williams was the, was the prime minister then, right--
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Correct.
Speaker 1: --of, of Trinidad?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so what, what--did--was your mother [Frances Tyson-Hill] discussing him then with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Tri- you know, Trinidad gained its independence in '62 [1962].  Eric Williams was, you know, even then in his life as the prime minister in certain communities, you know, was a national hero, a legend in many ways.  And the things that my mom spoke too about him were the things that he afforded, the opportunities that he afforded, especially African descendants like herself.  So when--she used to talk about the free education and the quality of it, and he felt that that was so important to maintain free healthcare and the opportunities like herself to become a nurse.  And so when he died, was the first time I had ever seen my mom, you know, cry and really mourn someone.  It was like her own dad [Charles Tyson] had died.  And you know, the, the nation in general was definitely, you know, in a state of mourning.  But my mom in particular, it affected her deeply, you know, and I could tell.  And that was one of probably the most important times in my life, the way she admired this man that was so selfless in his service.  He was a true civil leader.  He was smart, well educated, conducted himself with a lot of integrity.  She really admired that.  And I remember thinking to myself, you know, I, I--that's--I wanted her to, to feel that way about me someday.  When she re- you know, she had three sons [HistoryMaker Dr. Wayne A.I. Frederick, Stephan Frederick and Hilary Hill], and she wanted all three of us--she was very clear what she wanted all three of us to do.  She wanted one of us to be a pilot because she loved traveling, and she thought that would be an easy way to get free trips.  She wanted one to be a physician, to fulfill her own dream.  And she wanted one to be the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago.  And you know, that always resonated with me, that those were the types of aspirations that she had for her kids.
Speaker 1: You think you'll ever move back and run for office (laughter)?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, that's always a source of (laughter) a lot of conversation.  But, no, I'm not sure that I, I have a political bent.  I do have a, a deep, deep love for the place.  I would love to do anything that I can do to, you know, make it better.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you ever meet Eric Williams?
Speaker 2: I never met him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never met him, but I've read all his books.  I've looked at anything I could get my hands on about him.  And actually there's a school now, one of the universities actually has Eric Williams lecture as well.  So I, I follow some of those things.
Story_ID: 650819
Speaker 1: Now, high school, now did you have to pay tuition for high school [St. Mary's College, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago]?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have to pay tuition.  Public system in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago] was very robust.  The best high schools were in the public system.  And the school that I went to, in my opinion, was the best high school at the time in the entire country.
Speaker 1: So it wasn't a Catholic school, per se (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a Catholic school--
Speaker 1: --but it was a--
Speaker 2: --run by, run by the Holy Ghost fathers [Congregation of the Holy Spirit], which was an order of priest from Ireland.  And they were, you know, very strict.  But at the time that I went to school, they had started really bringing in teachers who were not Catholic.  So the quality of the education was robust, was, was extremely intense, and a high quality education.  My high school had, is, was founded before Howard University [Washington, D.C.] was, and that's how rich the history is of my high school.  So one of the greatest honors of my life thus far was being inducted into the hall of fame of my high school a couple of years ago, very humbling honor.  And I believe I'm, I'm the first graduate to have graduated somewhere in the 1980s--I graduated in 1988--to be inducted into the hall of fame.  The next closest person I think probably graduated in '71 [1971] or '74 [1974].  So it was, it was quite an honor.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, yeah, Howard was founded what, 1867? Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And my high school was founded a few years before that.
Story_ID: 650820
Speaker 1: Now it's often said that someone with a high school education from the islands, from Jamaica or Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago] or any, especially the English ones, when they come here, it's like they've already graduated from college.  I mean, the, the, the education they receive there--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in, in that system is superior to what people get here.  Is it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I won't say it's superior in the sense of grade for grade I think, you know, it, it is probably equivalent.  I think the difference is that you graduate high school there in what we call form five.  At the time, I just skipped one of my grades in high school [St. Mary's College, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago].  So I, I went to high school a year earlier because I have a June birthday  And then I skipped what would be the equivalent of seventh grade.  I went from six to eight, or, or seven--eighth grade.  I went from seventh to ninth.  The impact of, of the way the system is set up there, once you get to tenth grade you really have completed what is considered high school here, and you can actually take the SAT, et cetera.  I elected to do two more years, which you can do.  They call it advance level versus ordinary level in the British system.  And when you do those classes you really are doing college university quality work.  And so it's like doing advanced placement here, if you take advanced placement courses, et cetera.  And I think that's what gives students coming from the Caribbean an advantage, when they do those two extra years.  So I did that.  I had advanced placement.  But because I was admitted into Howard's B.S/M.D. program, which is a combined bachelor of science and M.D. degree program [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I only had to do two years undergrad.  So they wouldn't let me take any of the advanced credit in order to--because I would have to--I would spend even less time at the undergrad level.  But it really gave you a different level of preparation because of, of the advanced level of the work that you had to complete.
Speaker 1: Now did you run for student--did, do, do they have like student--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --president and that sort--
Speaker 2: They, they do.  So I actually was a pre- is call it prefects.  I was a prefect at, at my high school.  They do it by popular vote.  So you get on a ballot, and there are multiple prefects though.  I don't, I don't remember how many, but there are multiple, and then there's a head boy, or head prefect.  And that person is elected through a process of, at that time, the number of votes you get and a discussion with the principal.  The year that I did it, I remember having a conversation with the principal.  Although I had a lot of votes, I was one of the smallest kids in the school, not just in my, in my grade, so that was not something that anybody felt would be wise at the time.
Speaker 1: What, they had you be the head (unclear)--be- because you were small (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter), absolutely.  You know how teenage boys can be, so and I, I had no interest at that time.  And, and I--you know, it's funny because I often have to be remembered about that because in college I participated in no student government activities whatsoever.  And it wasn't until I did my residency program [at Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] and was named chief resident of the year that I started thinking about, you know, the leadership qualities that I may possess and the leadership opportunities that may present themselves later on in life.  And so, when I did my fellowship at MD Anderson [University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas] as well, I, I was named the chief administrative fellow in my last year as well.  And those things really, you know, made me examine and explore my leadership capabilities as well.
Story_ID: 650821
Speaker 1: So you graduate from high school [St. Mary's College, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago] in '86 [1986], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You were fourteen?
Speaker 2: I was fourteen at the time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Fourteen.
Speaker 2: And then I did two more years of advanced work and applied to college and enrolled when I was sixteen at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Now did you apply to any other colleges other than Howard?
Speaker 2: Only applied to Howard.  My best friend at the time, Shaka Hislop, was a freshman here, a registered freshman on the soccer team.  He had a scholarship to West Iona College [sic. Iona College, New Rochelle, New York], and at the last minute Howard made him an offer.  He was actually in New York already getting ready to settle in, and then Howard came in and made him an offer to, you know, be a goalkeeper on scholarship here.  But because of when he signed, he had to register as first year.  So he came down here, had a fantastic time, told me about it, made me fill out an application, which I did and gave him over the Christmas break; and he paid the twenty-five dollar fee for me.
Story_ID: 650822
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about leaving Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago].  Had you ever been out of the country before?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We--you know, this is one of the things I think my mom [Frances Tyson-Hill] was very good at, in that she felt that we needed a worldview.  We traveled every summer break.  She'd pick different places.  I had been to Barbados.  We really focused on North America a lot, so we'd go to New York [New York], Disney World [Walt Disney World Resort, Orlando, Florida], Miami [Florida], and, and Orlando [Florida], things of that nature.  And so I, I had been before.  Coming to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] was very different because I hadn't been to D.C. before.  I'd never seen the, the campus or anything like that before and definitely had never lived in America before.  So I think it was traumatic for my mom, in particular, leaving this, you know, undersized kid with a chronic illness [sickle cell anemia] to kind of live on his own, you know, in a strange city.  And none of my--none of her relatives, none of her siblings lived in D.C.  They all lived in New York.  So, and that was really taxing for her I think to do that.
Speaker 1: Now if I remember correctly, in 1988, well, late '80s [1980s], was a time when Washington, D.C., was characterized as the murder capital of the United States.
Speaker 2: Yeah, correct.
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry told the National Press Club, he says, "These are not murders.  These are just some killings."  And which I thought was incredible.  I couldn't understand, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But it was the crack epidemic [crack cocaine] was running rampant here (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.  Yeah, and so when I got here, it was so bad that my first semester the city was under a curfew that was instituted sometime maybe that summer into the fall, and so I had to return home by eleven o'clock every night.  If you were eighteen and younger you had to be inside by elven o'clock every night.  And so studying late wasn't always a good option for me.  And again, it was, you know, it was difficult.  I, I don't think I appreciated the magnitude of the problem because being on Howard's campus and you know, this part of the city and living in Brookland and in Northeast D.C., you know, those neighborhoods I can't say necessarily had open air drug markets, et cetera.  But you would see it every night on the news and every day in the paper.  There was a lot going on.  And I would end up being on, on the other side of that dilemma when I started my surgical training.  People would be shot and brought to the hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] and dropped off on a regular basis, you know; and, and those were difficult things to see.
Story_ID: 650823
Speaker 1: Who was the president of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] when you came?
Speaker 2: When I started, Cheek, [HistoryMaker] James Cheek was the president of Howard.  I don't have any recollection of ever laying eyes on him.  What is interesting is that I have three degrees from Howard, and I also have a certificate for, from general surgery from Howard.  My three predecessors all signed those.  So I have one signed by President Swygert [HistoryMaker H. Patrick Swygert], one signed by President Ribeau [Sidney A. Ribeau], and the other two signed by President Jenifer [Franklyn Jenifer], very unusual.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, okay.  So, well, you arrived.  Did you like the campus when you got here?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved it.  The first day I went on cam- I came on campus I just absolutely fell in love with it, everything about it.  It was a warm summer day, August.  Everybody was so friendly.  The Campus Pals at the time were, you know, just so welcoming.  And then, once I started school, faculty was, was just so warm and inviting.  I got a lot of questions about whether or not I belonged in the class because (laughter) how young I looked even then.  Many of the professors, when they would call the roll and I would put my hand up, would come and have a conversation with me after class as to how old I was and so on.  There were lots of rumors on campus that I was about twelve.  I looked twelve.  And so for a long while people always felt that there was this twelve year old kid attending Howard.
Speaker 1: So you, you were still growing.  You were like 5'6".
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --5'6", eighty-eight pounds with all my clothes and sneakers on, so I was a really small kid at the time.
Speaker 1: All right, so did you live in the dorms or--
Speaker 2: No.  I lived in, on Jackson [Street] and 14th Street Northeast, 3201 14th Street to be specific, Northeast.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I shared a house with a landlady, her husband, and four other Howard students.  And those--one, one of those guys kind of grew up in the neighborhood where I grew up [in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago], and so, you know, we had a really good relationship back then.  And when I came up I moved into the basement of that house.
Story_ID: 650824
Speaker 1: So you were in a program as a baccalaureate pro- program and M--as--what was it called (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it's--
Speaker 1: --a medical--
Speaker 2: --it's called--yeah surgical, it's, it's an accelerated M.D. program.  You do two years undergrad and then four years of med school.  After the second year of medical school, you're awarded your bachelor's degree.  And then after the fourth year of med school you get your M.D. degree.  So, when people look at my CV [curriculum vitae] they all seemed confused because my CV says that I got my bachelor's degree [from Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in '92 [1992] and M.D. [from Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] in '94 [1994].  And so it seems like I only did two years of medical school, but I, I did four years of medical school and two years of undergrad.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, who were some of the professors here that were pivotal in your development?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I, I would say there're several professors that really influenced me.  At, at the undergrad level, the volume of work and stuff I did was, was very large.  And I have to admit between that and being the manager of the soccer team, I, I didn't--I, I, I, I can't say that I got really close to any professors in particular.  The first person I would mention is a woman named Dr. Bococol [ph.], who oversaw the pre-professional program.  She was a woman who got me into the B.S./M.D. program.  And she was very instrumental in, you know, I would say giving me confidence and recognizing my academic talents early on and really encouraging me.  The reason I mention her as well is because, you know, she's one of the people in my life who my life's journey intersected with in a very, very unusual circumstance.  When I came back to Howard [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] in 2006 to take over Dr. Leffall's [HistoryMaker Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr.] surgical practice, I came off the elevator one day, and she was standing on the fourth floor in the hospital.  And I immediately recognized her.  She recognized me as well, and she said, "I just got an appointment to come and see you."  And I thought this was the strangest thing.  Here's this woman I haven't seen probably since I graduated from undergrad.  I hadn't seen her or interacted with her significantly.  And I was back, you know, some, that would have been now over a decade later plus.  And you know, she, she needed to come and see me.  Long story short, she had developed a breast cancer with metastatic disease to her arm.  So an orthopedic surgeon had a broken arm, but more important, you had to come and see me, and I remember taking care of her until she died.  And again, it was a humbling life's lesson.  You know, here was a woman that was bigger than life to me because of the opportunity she had granted me.  And the very opportunity she had granted me to get into the profession that I would get into, I now had the opportunity to turn around and take care of her.  And I can't tell you how many times and how many people on this campus with whom that has happened.  And it's a very humbling experience, but it also is one in, in which the gratitude for what they did for me back then is profound.

Speaker 1: Your medical studies start in your--after your second year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: After, after you completed two, two years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct, yeah, so in 1990 I started medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  At that time I was nineteen when I started medical school.  And so that was a very unusual time in my, in my life.  I was very young.  The things I was being exposed to, especially because in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] there was still a significant number of murders taking place, and a lot of those young men were in my age group.  And so as I got into my clinical years [at Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.], a lot of the patients that I was taking care of in those traumatic situations looked like me and were my age.  And again, that was another thing that really, you know, formed my opinion about social justice and about what I had to do as a physician in terms of the altruistic nature--not just of the profession, but how it related to the society at large.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 650826
Speaker 1: So this is, yeah, the late '80s [1980s] I think people's, the community's perception of what goes on in black colleges [historically black colleges and universities] was influenced by the movie 'School Daze' by Spike Lee (laughter).  I think '86 [1986], '87 [1987] it came out [sic. 1988]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --whatever, you know, but they showed party life and frat life and all that.  But they also, you know, raised the question of South African movement and the school's political, you know, disposition towards these movements.  Did, did you get involved in any student--
Speaker 2: No, I, I--
Speaker 1: --activities (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I didn't.  In the spring of '89 [1989], the student body took over the administration building.  And at that time, the president was [HistoryMaker] James Cheek.  And, and it was over a controversial--one of the issues was a controversial appointment to the board of trustees.  He had just named Lee Atwater [Harvey LeRoy Atwater] to the board of trustees, and between that and other things, the students wanted to see change.  They took over the administration building.  I was far removed from it, didn't quite understand why, focused on my studies, doing my schoolwork, and you know, was, was pretty far, far removed from it.  Having said that, you know, it did give me a window into what black America was like.  And I think trying to understand that and assimilate was a part of my education as well.  And between that, subsequent to that, watching Doug Williams play in the Super Bowl [Super Bowl XXII] and win.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's 1988.  That's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right after you arrived.
Speaker 2: That spring, yeah.  That's, that's--
Speaker 1: He was the first black quarterback to win the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's exactly right.  Yeah, I remember how I didn't understand the sport, but yet still I could feel the significance of it.  You have the Olympics [1988 Summer Olympics, Seoul, South Korea], and again, seeing black athletes excel, and again, seeing the importance of that in the greater society at large.  You come into the '90s [1990s], and Nelson Mandela visits this campus [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] the year I graduate, '94 [1994], from medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  My graduation speaker for one of my graduations was General Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell].  I remember attending that and looking at all the snipers on the roofs and so on and thinking, you know, here's this black man who was, you know, so important to the American military.  And so you know, that, that period of time for me and that assimilation into what it meant to be black in America was extremely important and, and allowed me to develop a deep connection to that experience.  My friends explaining, and my learning the history of the South, learning the history of Jim Crow, you know, all of those things, it, it, it really brought me a deep understanding and a deep affection and assimilation for black America, which I think, you know, was extremely--is and has been extremely important to my development.
Story_ID: 650827
Speaker 1: Did you see a difference?  People have debated it, argued it in conferences and on the street corner, and in the barbershop about the attitude of people who come here from the West Indies or West Africa to the United States for the first time and their--and their attitude about the country as opposed to those who are raised here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, definitely.  I, I mean, even you come from the Caribbean at that time, or even, you know, Africa, I think the tendency is to see abundance, to see abundance of opportunity, abundance of, of, of material things.  And to think that those things are available to everyone equally, and you know, if black Americans would apply themselves, they would get it.  And I think that's an, it's an unfortunate short circuited notion about the real construct of this society.  And so yes, I think, you know, folks coming from the Caribbean and Africa at that time, folks I would interact with, I, I--we had a very myopic point of view.  You know, we were very focused, and we, and we felt that if we applied ourselves academically and did well, all of America's opportunities were available to us.  It's naive, because you come from a society where everybody look like you.  The people in power look like you.  And so the only barriers to your success are opportunity.  Are there enough opportunities to hire a physician, even if you could become a physician?  So we came from a country [Trinidad and Tobago] where the literacy rate was 98, 99 percent.  And you know, so everybody was smart, went to high school, but then how many real opportunities were there for you to work.  And then you come here.  You feel that you're just as smart and then in this vast abundance.  But you know, as I matured and went through my surgical train- my medical school surgical training [at Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.], it, it became evident to me that that is not exactly true about how this society is set up, and there are barriers to one's success.  And when I got to MD Anderson Cancer Center [University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas], I think that was the first time that that came home to me.  I was I think the fifth black probably to train in surgical oncology there, in 1999 to 2003.  And that came home to me quickly.  It was a great place.  I was warmly received.  But the reality was that that was not an opportunity that was available to everyone.  And I recognized that very quickly, and I was so appreciative of what I had here at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] at that point.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Houston MD Anderson I imagine would be a big difference from here--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --although there are--
Speaker 2: --big difference, huge--
Speaker 1: --doctors there--we've interviewed some black doctors at MD Anderson who are, you know, successful and that sort of thing.  But it wasn't without, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --some struggle, you know, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, no, absolutely.
Story_ID: 650828
Speaker 1: We haven't talked about Dr. Leffall [HistoryMaker Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr.] yet.  I know he's one--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of your mentors in the medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And there are probably others too, so.
Speaker 2: So Dr. Leffall was a, you know, a larger than life figure when I got to medical school.  You know, he's one of those people, you see him in the hallway, and you, your day is made because you just laid eyes on him, that type of mystique.  I never thought I would end up having such a close relationship with him.  That's been one of the blessings of my life.  I think when we all get to medical school, we all cherish, you know, the few moments you would spend in his presence.  And I have now had an opportunity to spend just a few moments, you know, to spend a lot of time with him in a what's more of a father-son relationship.  He's a wonderful man.  I felt when I--after I met him, I knew I wanted to be a surgeon as well, but I didn't feel I had the personality.  Most of the people who were doing surgery at that time were aggressive and loud and I would even say obnoxious, and he wasn't.  He was a gentleman.  He was gentle.
Speaker 1: You just described how people described Jack White [Jack E. White]--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --but you know, that's--I had to laugh.  I never knew Jack White, but Dr. Jack White, they, that's, that's how they describe him.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I, I never met him, but that was my impression of the guys in my class who wanted to do surgery.  But Dr. Leffall was a man of grace and a man of, of, of patience and measure.  And so I remember after meeting him I thought, okay, I think I could be a surgeon if there are these kinds of surgeons as well, even if they're the exception to the rule.  And so you know, over time I developed a really close relationship with him.  The thing about my relationship with him that I would say really impacted my life was what--he was the person who convinced me that mentorship was a two way street, that as mentors, you get a much from your mentees as you see them progress and grow and succeed.  And, and that is the thing that he taught me more than anything else.  I really, when I came back from MD Anderson [University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas], when I was there and he would call me to see how I was doing and you know, when I came back here with my wife [Simone Frederick] and my son [Wayne A. I. Frederick II] and he was trying to convince me to come back and take over his surgical practice [at Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.], I, I, you know, I thought to myself: here's a man that, you know, I, I admire so much.  And in a lot of ways he now was admir- was admiring what I had achieved and, and was so vested in my success, and that was very, very touching.  He had a saying that he would give all of us, which is, "Excellence of performance shall transcend all artificial barriers created by man."  It was a saying that Charles Drew [Charles R. Drew], you know, first spoke (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yeah, he's the beacon of the rest of them, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's absolutely right.  And so you know, that, that has been a humbling experience.
Story_ID: 650829
Speaker 1: The other person who has been a huge influence on not just my career but my life as well, is [HistoryMaker] Clive Callender.  And I think, I, I think I have been attracted to both of these men because of what happened with my father [Alix Frederick] so early in life.  I think I've always been attracted to strong men who lead with a certain level of integrity and have embraced not just the surgeon in me or the career aspects of what I do, but they've been concerned about my personal life.  And Dr. Callender is an example of that.  He, he became the chair of surgery [at Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] after Dr. Leffall [HistoryMaker Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr.] became the president of the American College of Surgeons.  When I was graduating from the surgical program, he gave me the Chairman's Award [Chairman's Award of Excellence] as the chief of--as the best chief that graduated that year.  It was a very humbling honor at that time, 'cause I remember sitting in those seats as a junior resident watching, you know, who the chief resident of the year was every year and thinking to myself, wow, you know, I, I--it's not something I could even think I could aspire to be.  What was critical about his involvement is that when I went to MD Anderson [University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas], he tried to get me to come back here.  I had just met my wife [Simone Frederick], and I couldn't take any chance.  They took forever to make me an offer.  And I was so apprehensive about the whole thing that I took a job at the University of Connecticut [University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut] because they were taking so long.  And I remember him calling me in April to then make me an offer.  I had to move in July.  I had already accepted MD Anderson's offer--I mean UConn's offer.  And I remember telling him that I wasn't gonna come, that I would go to UConn, and he was so devastated he stopped talking to me (laughter).  It was--
Speaker 2: Who, Dr. Callender, right, the--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --Dr. Callender?
Speaker 1: --that, this is Dr. Callender.  And you know, obviously I went to University of Connecticut, and two years later I found myself back at Howard [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.].  He got to recruit me again and sealed the deal.  And I remember when I came back here, one day I walked into his office and I said you know, "A lot of things are going well, and I'm pretty happy.  But I do have this aspect of my life around my spirituality that concerns me."  And I, and I remember telling him it's not a church thing.  I, I was an altar boy growing up in, when I was in high school [St. Mary's College, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago].  So from the ages of ten to sixteen I was an altar boy.  I went to all Catholic high school.  I was an Anglican.  And so it wasn't so much that aspect, but I felt like it was a deeper personal journey that I needed.  And so you know--
Speaker 2: You were a practicing, practicing Anglican?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was practicing.  I, I, I wouldn't say--
Speaker 2: So did you, you go to--
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say--
Speaker 2: --church as a--
Speaker 1: --very active.  I did, but not, not very often.  I wouldn't say very often at all.  And he came to me one day, and his solution was every morning, I will send you a text with a piece of scripture in it, and you know, it'll just be random.  And you can take a look at it.  And, and so we have done that for as long as I can remember.  Every single morning he does it, up to this morning.  And I send back a note that, that simply says, "Thank you."  And that has been very helpful because that has spurred other conversations with us, you know, about questions that I might have about decisions I need to make, personal and career wise in particular.  And so I'm very appreciative for that.  And I, I've kept all of the, the texts interestingly enough.  But that's the type of mentor that he has been to me as well.
Story_ID: 650830
Speaker 1: Let me walk back a little bit.  Oh, I wanted to point out--neither one of us mentioned it, but Dr. LaSalle Leffall [HistoryMaker Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr.] bec- was, became the president of the American College of Surgeons, which is, I mean, the recognition--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that he's the top surgeon.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he is the first, yeah, he's the first African American to hold that position--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --as the president of the American College of Surgeons.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause e- even with the reputation of Jack White [Jack E. White] and some of the others, they didn't, they never achieved that.  We know, you know, how America can be.  That's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --there was a National Medical Association and there was American Medi--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's correct.
Speaker 1: --Medical Association [American Medical Association].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's correct.  So for him to, you know, be elected to such a mainstream position at that time was a high honor that occurred in 1995.  I was an intern in the hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.].  I remember when we got that news, the feeling of, it was overwhelming, you know, that a black man would be the president of the American College of Surgeons.  It was unthinkable.  But he certainly broke that, the glass ceiling.
Story_ID: 650831
Speaker 1: I just want to walk back to your--now, when you, when you I guess matriculated through medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], there--what aspect of medicine did you end up focusing on (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my intention initially was to be a hematologist, oncologist because I had sickle cell [sickle cell anemia], and I wanted to find a cure.  No one really discussed a research career with me, which is part of what it probably would have taken.  So I ended up, you know, focusing on surgery.  I fell in love with it.  A guy by the name of Wayne Tuckson [Wayne B. Tuckson], was a colorectal surgeon, he actually is the brother of one of my--of Howard University's board members, Reed Tuckson [Reed V. Tuckson].  He was a colorectal surgeon.  And in my sophomore year in medical school he invited me into the operating room.  And so I went in there, and I loved everything about it.  I loved the smell in the room.  I loved all of the blue gowns and drapes, and everything about it just touched me in the right way.  And I remember leaving the room and thinking I've got to be a surgeon.  But I was concerned that my personality just wasn't, you know, what most surgeons were.  I was a quieter guy, and I didn't feel, you know, like that until I met Dr. Leffall [HistoryMaker Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr.] and saw that, you know, that was not the only thing that I needed to, to be worried about.  The other thing that, that he did as well is, I had a very large spleen, was a result of my sickle cell, and I played soccer.  And I went back and forth about it.  I, I, I, I theorized that one of the reasons I was so small was that I could not eat large meals.  I ate very little, and I would be full, and I think my spleen was compressing my stomach.
Speaker 1: What does the spleen do?  Try to--can you explain--
Speaker 2: Spleen, you know, we refer to the spleen as like the filter of the blood.  It takes the old blood cells out and the old white, white blood cells out, old red blood cells out, et cetera.  And sometimes because the sickle cell and the, the cells being deformed and so on, those cells can get stuck in the spleen.  You get what we call splenic sequestration.  You could get really large spleens.  Usually, over time, the spleen gets really small and actually you get a really small spleen sometimes in adults with sickle cell.  Mine was different I think because I had a high fetal hemoglobin as well, well into my adulthood.  So my intern year of my residency [at Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] I remember discussing that with Dr. Tuckson, and he sent me to see Dr. Leffall.  And so the other unusual thing about my life is that Dr. Leffall also operated on me as an intern.  He removed my spleen.
Speaker 1: He removed the whole thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he removed--
Speaker 1: So you, you--
Speaker 2: --the whole thing.
Speaker 1: --you can live without a spleen?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you can, you can.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And so he removed my spleen my intern year.  As a matter of fact, it was February of my internship year he removed my spleen, so another unusual connection that we have.
Story_ID: 650832
Speaker 1: At what point during--well, I, I didn't ask you this, but what point during the training do you start to specialize?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, you know, one, once I was doing general surgeon residency, in your third year, so you start thinking about what, you know, what do you want to do in terms of if you want to do a specialization, you could be a general surgeon and do a wide variety of--
Speaker 1: Was this here at Howard or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was here at Howard--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --Howard Hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.].  And you know, I, I admired Dr. Leffall [HistoryMaker Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr.].  He's a surgical oncologist, so I thought about, I thought about that kinds of surgery.  And I really loved it because you operated on all parts of the body when you do surgical oncology.  But it was very difficult to get in at the time.  There's a matching program, and it was very difficult, so.  And I wanted to go to one of the top places.  Dr. Leffall always used to emphasize that, that, you know, "You should go to one of the top places."  He had been to Memorial Sloan Kettering [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York], and so it's a big deal.  I petitioned our general surgery residence program to let me spend a month in Texas at MD Anderson instead of taking vacation for the entire year.  So they put all my vacation together in one month, and they took me to--and, and they let me go down to MD Anderson, where I went and operated with a guy by the name of Doug Evans [Douglas B. Evans].  The chair of surgery at the time was a guy named Raphael Pollock.  And that was probably one of the best decisions I've ever made.  That month I spent, they saw something in me that I could not predict they would.  And Raphael Pollock wrote a very nice letter to Dr. Callender [HistoryMaker Clive Callender], imploring him and trying to convince him to let me come back at some point and, and do my residency program--to, to do the fellowship program, sorry.  So that, it, it was, you know, it was great to be able to do that, and I ultimately got into the MD Anderson Cancer Center [University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas] to do my fellowship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where does M- MD Anderson rank in terms of the cancer (unclear)--
Speaker 2: You know, it's, it's ranked either one or two in cancer care in the country every year.  I think it's the best cancer center in the country, personally.  It's a fantastic place that combines research and clinical medicine.  And it's, it's also a huge place as well.  You see so many things there, such a wide variety.  It was an unbelievable experience.  And I get to go back there on March 6th and give a keynote address, which will be pretty emotional for me there.  A place that I dreamed of going just to do my fellowship, to have them invite me to give a, a talk there is going to be quite humbling.
Story_ID: 650833
Speaker 1: So you were there for two years or--?
Speaker 2: I was there four years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Four years, okay, all right--
Speaker 2: I did two years of research as a postdoctoral research fellow and then two years as a clinical fellow.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It was in Houston [Texas] you met your wife [Simone Frederick], right, when you were in (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, I was in Houston, but I met her in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago].
Speaker 1: Trinidad, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  Well, tell us about this experience.  I mean, what, what did you learn in those four years of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so you know, I, I tell people I learned to take care of patients at Howard [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.].  That's my general surgery residency.  I left here really competent around the issue of taking care of patients.  I really learned to do complex operations at MD Anderson Cancer Center [University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas], which I still perform today.  And for that I'm very grateful, very, very complex operations involving the pancreas, the liver.  I really learned how to do those operations there.
Speaker 1: Now does having sickle cell [sickle cell anemia] in any impair--I, I, I know the answer is probably no, but it probably makes it difficult.
Speaker 2: It can actually.  You know, if--one of the things: sometimes you can be in operation for a long period of time.  That physical activity in and of itself could lead to a crisis.  I once did a transplant with Dr. Callender [HistoryMaker Clive Callender].  It took some eighteen hours.  And I remember being in there for, you know, much of it.  I remember doing very long cases at MD Anderson as well where, you know, physically it was taxing.  Can't necessarily take breaks when you want to.  And so even when I was signed up to do surgery, there was a lot of skepticism as to whether or not I'd be able to do it, given my sickle cell, and that was a, a major question.
Speaker 1: Has anyone else ever done it with sickle cell?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I've never met another surgeon with sickle cell.  I, I don't know if there's another one in the U.S.  I've never--I don't know another surgeon who does, you know, cancer operations, like I do Whipples [pancreaticoduodenectomy] and so on, who is a u- a university president and still practices.  And I don't know another sickle cell--a president who has sickle cell.
Story_ID: 650834
Speaker 1: Now did you know these things before you became their president (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, I, I had no clue.  But every time--
Speaker 1: Now you hear somebody (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) someone--
Speaker 1: --people say if they thought, if they had known--
Speaker 2: --ask me it, yeah.
Speaker 1: --how hard it was gonna be they wouldn't have done, but they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, you know, I, I'll tell you, surgery, I, I knew of some of the difficulties that could occur.  Because I was a student [at Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] I could see it.  And so that was always a concern.  I had no aspirations to become a university president.  And so when I was presented with the opportunity and I was informed that I would be negotiating my contract, I recognized that I didn't want to give up operating, at least not just yet.  You know, I'm a young, fairly young man at forty-two, taking over the presidency of the university [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And I was, I was very concerned if this didn't work out, well (cough) would I--what would I go back to doing.  And so, you know, it's hard to do these operations if you don't do them frequently and to so maintain your skills and so on.  So it was a very, very tough decision.  And I'm appreciative that the board was supportive of my desire to continue operating (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 650835
Speaker 1: What was the toughest part of becoming a surgeon?
Speaker 2: Becoming a surgeon?  I would say, you know, the, the thing with surgery is that there's a lot of instant gratification, right.  You can see somebody with a surgical problem.  You take them to the operating room, and you fix it.  And it, there's a lot of instant gratification.  The down side of that is on occasion you lose patients, and you can associate their death directly with your intervention and or lack of it.  And that can be emotionally trying at times.  And I've had a couple of those experiences.  The, the, the things about those experiences is that they make you grow in ways that you can't imagine.  So people often ask me, "Why are you a cancer surgeon?  That must be depressing, you know, telling people they have cancer."  We don't have a cure.  And actually, patients, the way they react is always encouraging.  So I took care of a family who had a, an illness that affects their colon, which they get a lot of polyps.  As a, as a young man in medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] I first met them and then in residency [at Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.].  Dr. Leffall [HistoryMaker Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr.] had taken care of multiple of them, and so they were well known to us.  When I came back here after my fellowship [at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas] and after my stint at University of Connecticut [University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut], I saw one of them in the office, and she had a tumor basically affecting the, the first part of the small intestine.  And so she needed a complex operation called a Whipple [pancreaticoduodenectomy].  And I took her to the operating room, and first two days everything went well, looked great.  And then all of a sudden, without explanation, like on day four, she deteriorated and died.  Multiple family members there.  It was, it was very difficult.  I remember getting back home, and my son [Wayne A. I. Frederick II] came and sat next to me and insisted on talking to me.  And I remember him saying eventually, you know, "I'm sure you did your best and you know, it'll be fine," and he, he wouldn't leave the room.  And I had tears streaming down my face.  It was very difficult.  Well, that same--
Speaker 1: How old was your son?
Speaker 2: He was probably four at the time, just a little kid, and you know, he could just tell that something wasn't right.  I would take him to basketball games to see the Wizards [Washington Wizards].  I remember the next time I took him to a basketball game, we get in to the arena, go to buy popcorn and stuff.  And we get to this, to the counter, and the woman behind the counter was this woman's sister.  And I thought to myself, oh, my goodness, this is gonna be difficult.  And she came around the counter to come and hug me.  I remember going back to my seat and thinking (makes sound).  So the next day I went back.  I was, I have to go to a different counter.  Next time I go to a Wizards game I went to a different counter and sure enough, the woman was there again.  And I thought to myself, this is so difficult.  So two months pass, and I get a call that the woman wants to see me, she and her son.  And so I, I say--I agree to see them in the clinic.  I go into the office, and her son is there.  He's thirty-nine years old.  He has developed a cancer in his colon from the disease process, but he also has developed another cancer in the area his aunt developed on and requires a Whipple as well.  And so I see him.  I agree with them that that's the operation he needs, and I then tell them, "Listen, I think you should go get a second opinion.  I operated on your aunt, and she passed, and I don't have a good explanation why."  And so he says, "You know, that's all well and good, but we want you to do the operation."  His mom insists.  And I operate on him, and he did well, you know.  And that's I think the most difficult thing about surgery, the humbling experience that you're only as good as the next case.  And that next case could be a case of a bad outcome.  But at the same time, it's also uplifting because the patients always have a courage that they infuse in you that you can't explain.  And there's nothing else in life that I've ever done that I've seen that or gotten that from an experience.
Story_ID: 650836
Speaker 1: So as you stated earlier, you went to, from MD Anderson [University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas], to University of Connecticut [University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut].  You're trying, there's a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --recruitment process, they're trying to get you to come here.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And Dr. Callender [HistoryMaker Clive Callender] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that didn't work.
Speaker 1: --is calling you and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it just didn't work out.  You ended up going to the University of Connecticut.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: What were some of your experiences there?
Speaker 2: You know, it, in retrospect, it was the best thing that happened.  I wanted to go to a smaller place where I could do and really explore the breadth of my surgical talents, and that's what happened.  The complex operations that I had learned to do at MD Anderson and everything from esophagectomies, removing the esophagus, to removing, you know, the head or the tail of the pancreas, liver resections, you name it, every single, I would say every single index, complicated case you could do I did at University of Connecticut and did them well by the grace of God.  So, I quickly developed a reputation around my surgical skills, and I was, I was very blessed, and it was humbling.  The first person I ever operated on with a pancreatic tumor, I did on October 5th, 2005.  That gentleman is still alive today.  You know--
Speaker 1: Pancreatic cancer is supposed to be--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the closest thing to a death sentence.
Speaker 2: That's absolutely right.  And he lived--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --forever, for, I mean, he's still alive; he's still doing very well.  The second person I operated on for a pancreatic cancer was a woman who also had involvement of the main vein, the portal vein that carries the blood to your liver.  I had learned a very complex operation at MD Anderson where you could take the vein out of someone's neck and replace it, replace that vein.  And so I did that operation on her, yeah, on, on January 6th, 2006.  And she lived until, I believe 2013, for seven years did very well.  So my, my first, I would say, you know, the first major cases I did at that place really gave me a lot of confidence in my ability.  And almost every other surgical service at the University of Connecticut consulted with me to either come in and assist with a case or to do something.  And so the breadth of the experience that I got there in the three years I had been at--just under three years that I was there was absolutely incredible.  I learned so much about so many things.  And it, it just really set my, you know, my, my confidence in a different place and really let me know that the training that I received both at Howard [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] in general surgery and at MD Anderson in my surgical oncology fellowship had prepared me well.
Story_ID: 650837
Speaker 1: Were there any special mentors or special peers there that you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, I, I, I would say no.  I, I--it was, you know, it, it--and, and that in and of itself actually was, well, I would say it was telling, because that made me yearn for what I had in Dr. Callender [HistoryMaker Clive Callender] and Dr. Leffall [HistoryMaker Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr.] here.  Dr. Leffall came up to University of Connecticut [University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut] by my invitation to give a talk once.  And I remember just watching the students again be in awe of him and everybody listening to him and being in awe, and I--and I that just took me back to a place of comfort.  And that occurred, you know, maybe within nine months of him approaching me about coming back to Howard [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.], you know, and it really helped seal the deal.  Having him be in my University of Connecticut environment and seeing him still work his magic in terms of inspiring others, et cetera, made, you know, really made me know that, I, I had to go back and had to come back to Howard and take over his surgical practice once he asked.  He was a man that I could not say no to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so you came back to Howard in, what year was it?
Speaker 2: I came back in May of 2006.
Speaker 1: Two thousand six [2006].
Speaker 2: And so later that month, Dr. Leffall turned seventy-five on May 22nd, 2006.  Actually, he turned, he--sorry--he turned seventy-six in May of 2006.  And I remember he got me to agree to operate with him on his last day that he operated, which, again, was a very special day.  He booked several cases.  And I went into the room with him, and you know, we, we did all the cases.  We did probably some seven cases.  We left the operating room, and as we--as they opened the door for the operating room and we walked out, the entire staff in the hospital had lined the hallway, you know, as we walked out.  It was a very, very emotional moment.  And again, I, I remember getting back to my office and thinking, this man is a legend, you know, and I just did his last operations with him.  And now I'll do the operations that he, you know, used to do.  And so again, the passing of that mantle was very special.
Story_ID: 650838
Speaker 1: You were made deputy director of the Howard University Cancer Center [Washington, D.C.] in 2007--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --served for a year.  Now, what--we've, we've, we've interviewed other physicians who talk about the major diseases that, that seem to plague black Americans, hypertension, heart disease.  What's the other thing?
Speaker 2: Prostate cancer.
Speaker 1: Prostate cancer, yeah.  What--in, in fact, I, I was gonna ask you, like, what--how do we stand in terms of the cancer?  What cancers do we get the most?  I, I think prostate is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --number one, right?  Is that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, you know, we, we, we--there are significant cancer dispar- dis- significant disparities in terms of the cancer care in this country, in terms of what affects African Americans versus their Caucasian counterparts.  We, we don't--as a, as a diaspora, we aren't afflicted with cancers in the same--at the same rate.  In some, some cases we are, like with lung cancer, still the high incidence.  But prostate cancer in African American men is still very significant compared to their Caucasian counterparts.
Speaker 1: And what is the cause, you know, re--
Speaker 2: You know, it's, it's--we're, we're still unclear as to why African American men are, are so affected by prostate cancer.  There used--I mean people used to be concerned that we weren't screened as well, and therefore we were developing advanced disease.  The latest U.S. Preventive Task Force [U.S. Preventive Services Task Force] has suggested that that screening probably should be decreased.  So you know, we're not sure that that's the reason.  Are there some underlying genetic issues?  There probably are.  But these things are, are very poorly studied as well in terms of what, what are the causes of the disparities.
Speaker 1: I just wondered if, if, if, if it relates at all to the, those three disease  we mentioned, high blood pressure and diabetes--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know it--
Speaker 1: --and, and--you know.
Speaker 2: I, I don't think so becau- at least we haven't found a direct link in terms of the mechanism and the changes that may occur, you know, upstream, as we say, that then cause a downstream effect.  We haven't found a direct correlation just yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about breast cancer in black women?  Is that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, breast cancer in black women has a lower incidence than in white women.  However, when black women do get breast cancer, they tend to die from it far more so than their Caucasian counterparts.  And when they get it, they tend to get virulent types of breast cancer, such as what we call the triple negative breast cancer, in which there are no estrogen or progesterone receptors expressed in the cells that developed the cancer.  And the, the cancers produce a protein called HER2/neu, or, or don't protein called HER2/neu.  Those, those, those cancers that black women get are far more virulent and lead to death, far more likely than the breast cancers that the average Caucasian will get.  Black women are also more likely to get those breast cancers at a younger age as well, which is the other very concerning thing as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is environment a, a factor in all this?
Speaker 2: You know, it, it potentially is, but again, we don't have a good explanation.  I mean, here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] you have one of the highest cancer death rates among black women for breast cancer.  And it's not clear that that's, you know, an environmental thing.  At least the environmental things we would be concerned about aren't evident, aren't, you know, obviously evident, so it's, it's unclear as to why it is.  There, there clearly may be some genetic issues that, again, because it's poorly studied, we just haven't unearthed quite yet.
Story_ID: 650839
Speaker 1: You know, I wanna I guess try, try to finish medicine before we go on into administration.  But, but what's the future of cancer treatment?  Now is surgery--I mean, you're a surgeon--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --of course.  And surgery is revered on one level, but people say, you know, you know, pre- prevention should be the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean--
Speaker 1: --focus of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) it has its limitations.  There's no doubt about it.  We have to get better at figuring out what causes these cancers.  And as you rightly alluding to, try to prevent them.  That's one aspect of it.  The other aspect of it is that our treatments have to become more personalized.  And I think the push in personal--for person- personalized medicine is a good one and I think one that would prove to be fruitful as well, because what you need is the ability to try to control someone's disease process based on not just the cancer that's growing in them but them as a host of that cancer.  What are the things about their background in terms of diet, environmental exposures, genetic makeup that may make them interact with that cancer differently as well as interact with the medications that you may give them differently or even the operation that you may, you know, lay out for them.  And I think that's where we're heading.  A lot of cancers now are becoming more chronic diseases.  So we have people with metastatic cancer that are living much longer because we're able to control, even when it does spread, the impact that it has on the parts of the body that it spread to.  And so you know, I think more personalized treatment is the wave of the future as well as understanding the mechanisms that lead to the cancers so that we can spend a lot more time and money on prevention.
Speaker 1: You think genetic research will really put a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think genetic (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) slow down a lot of--
Speaker 2: --research is critical, absolutely.  But again, African Americans are very underrepresented in a lot of these studies and a lot of the, and a lot of this research because of some of the holdover from the Tuskegee experiment [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male].  And so people are hesitant (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) From their suspicions, yeah.
Speaker 2: --to--right, hesitate to sign up, but we have to have more of them participate.
Story_ID: 650840
Speaker 1: Oh, attitude.  It's commonly thought that your attitude makes a difference in you getting well or staying sick.  And that--is, is there any, like, scientific basis for that kind of thinking? Or have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I'm--
Speaker 1: --have you noticed--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I could--
Speaker 1: --that?
Speaker 2: --say anecdotally--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I, I have noticed.  But you know, I, and, and I say it's anecdotal because, like everything else in life, people who are placed in a difficult circumstance have significant hurdles to overcome.  If they approach it from a position of defeatism versus from, you know, a, a courageous point of view, I, I think even regardless of the outcome, everybody around them also feels uplifted because they gave it their all, and they did so in a, you know, positive manner.  And I think that's really, you know, ultimately what people see, right.  There's not probably not a good definition of people dying happy, but the people who do approach the end of life or approach those challenges, you know, with a positive perspective, I think tends to make everybody feel that they've done better, you know, because of how they approached it.
Story_ID: 650841
Speaker 1: Now what does it mean in 2007 you were, when you were made deputy director of the Howard University Can- Cancer Center [Howard University Cancer Center, Washington, D.C.]?  Did, did that, like, add administrative duties to it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it did.  You know, prior to that I, I had been the chief of general surgery [at Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.].  The administrative duties there were very light.  And so the deputy directorship of the cancer center I would say would, would have been one of the first administrative duties that really carried some heft and had me engaging around finances, human resource issues, recruitment, that type of thing.  It really got me to start thinking about, you know, how complex organizations work, how you fit into them, how you strategize to make things work, how you impact culture, you know, those, those types of things.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, you were made--you were named division chief of general surgery in the department of surgery in 2007 and served in that capacity to 2011.  So these are additional medical responsibilities as well.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I mean, me- you know, both more clinical responsibilities, but what, what was clearly happening was that people were identifying my ability to, you know, engage around leadership issues and were giving me an opportunity to, you know, test that capacity.  And, and those were important, im- important changes.  The role that I think really probably propelled me to a different mindset are my--internally, was the associate dean of clinical affairs in the medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  That was a role that I had already started pursuing my M.B.A. [at Howard University School of Business, Washington, D.C.] in 2009, and that role came about I believe around 2010.  And it really made me look at the business of medicine differently.  It made me look at what really mattered, in terms of profit or loss, and what provided people fulfillment and happiness if they completed a job while not necessarily thrusting finances in front of them all the time, and trying to strategize as to how you could bring about that joy and happiness without it always being about the bottom line.  And so that, that was a very, very critical--getting my M.B.A., during that period of time as well, was also far more important than I, than I realized at the time as well.
Speaker 1: But which came first, you pursuing your M.B.A. or being named interim director--
Speaker 2: I, I believe my--
Speaker 1: --of the can- cancer center (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) pursing--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh no, the--being the interim director of the cancer center I think happened before--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I embarked on my M.B.A.
Speaker 1: So, so that--
Speaker 2: That was one of the things that--
Speaker 1: --that inspired, one of the things that inspired--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because you know, you'll sit in meetings.  People would show you finances and then take it away just as quickly and you know, act like it was too complicated for you to understand.  And, and I, you know, I just never felt that these things could be that complicated.  But I knew that without, you know, an M.B.A., people would continue to do that, and it would be an uphill battle.  And so I thought, you know what, I'll--I, I am interested in finances.  I always have been, probably would have done it a lot earlier in my career if I hadn't done the B.S./M.D. program and had to be so focused, so I didn't have an opportunity previously.  And so I decided I would go back and pursue it.
Story_ID: 650842
Speaker 1: And you pursued that here at Howard [Howard University School of Business, Washington, D.C.], your M.B.A. (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.  Yeah, I was a--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --full time faculty member at the time.  And I would come up here in the evenings, operate during the day, see patients, teach, and then I'd come up here in the evenings and go to school.  And it was--
Speaker 1: That's, that's a lot of time.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but, one, one of the interesting things about what I read is that a lot of the students didn't realize that you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had--
Speaker 1: --you worked--
Speaker 2: --no clue who I was, that I had an administrative position such as the associate dean in another school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  I rarely ever came up here in surgical garb, and I would just sit in the class.  And unbeknownst to me, it was also an education for something else that I was being prepared for.  So I would sit in those classes and listen to students complain about registration or complain about some administrative service in the A building [administration building], and I would think, wow, this is interesting, you know.  I, I wonder what I would do if I could fix this.  And at the time I had no de--no aspiration or desire to do anything else other than, you know, be a leader in surgery.  That was my focus.
Speaker 1: Was Patrick Swygert [HistoryMaker H. Patrick Swygert] the president then when you were--
Speaker 2: No.  At that time, in 2011, around 2010, from 2009 to twent- 2011, Sidney Ribeau [Sidney A. Ribeau]--
Speaker 1: Oh, Sidney Ribeau (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) was, was the president, correct, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --my M.B.A. degree was signed by President Ribeau.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 650843
Speaker 1: Anybody familiar with college administration knows that college, especially as old as Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], has a culture that's going.  It's like a--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --a aircraft carrier hidden somewhere. To turn it around and change it is, is, takes a lot of work--well, any institution like this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did you, well, were you really think, thinking about what you would do things differently if you could, if you had the chance?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I, I didn't start thinking about that until I became the provost.  You know, when, when I became the provost and I had the responsibility of the academic enterprise and trying to direct that in the right way, that's when I really started thinking about culture and the impact.  But I also thought about it very differently than I think most people would.  I saw myself as a product of the culture.  And I think oftentimes when people talk about changing the culture, they talk about, you know, throwing everything else and just totally changing it.  And I would argue that the biggest thing about changing the culture is knowing what aspects of it to keep and to make sure that whatever else you change, you don't de- deplete the things that make it great.  And there are things here that make it great.  There are people here who, like Mrs. Bococol [ph.], who worked here for some forty something years.  I met her as a student, an undergrad working in financial aid, and then she becomes my chief of staff.  But her dedication to the place over forty years is evident.  And I think those things that are embedded in the culture, those people who are a product of the culture, you want to make sure that you preserve the aspects of the culture that allow them or others like them to thrive.  And then you really work on the things that you think are destructive.  And oftentimes, those aren't necessarily a lot of things, but they're very specific things, you know.  And so, for lack, for lack of a better expression, you need a more surgical approach to making sure that you cut those things out, and you keep the things that really are desirable.
Story_ID: 650844
Speaker 1: Just from the outside looking in at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I mean, my, my daughter went to Howard because I urged her to go, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: And, and, and I, I know that's true.  She graduated.  You know, she was a good student, and now she's successful with, with art and other things she's doing.  But as I told her, I, I would have attended Howard, had I--if I could have done it over again, you know, if I could do it over again.  But the reputation outside of Howard is a place where our top black minds are.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it's a place where there's creative freedom, and there's--you know, that's the positive.  This is, is Eric Williams, as he thought it was a black Oxford [University of Oxford, Oxford, England].  I saw it as the black Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or something--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so.  But, but the down side is that there's always--that aspect that there is, when it's a lot of money involved in an institution, or even a little bit of money, there're gonna be people around and trying to, you know, chip off it, this and that.  And that's true for most black colleges, there's that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --thinking that everything's not nailed--if everything's not nailed down, somebody's gonna, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --abscond with something, you know.  So, I mean, is that, you know--
Speaker 2: So you know, I, I, I, I, I have to say that I, I don't necessarily see that, right.  I, I, I mean, I see this, I see it more as Harvard being the, you know, Harvard being the white Howard, you know.  And so (laughter), a lot of things that plague--plague us all equally.  They get different platforms, and they get different play depending on who's speaking about them, right.  So for instance, you know, Harvard has a $34 billion endowment.  They've had four managers of the endowment in the past decade.  You know, that, that's kind of similar to the, to an--(unclear)--leadership as some of our HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities].  They just announced that they're gonna fire half of the people managing the endowment, to go in a different direction and to outsource it.  I mean, you know, complex institutions often have complex problems and then have to resolve, and, and I think that's the thing that's underappreciated here at Howard.  There are seventeen businesses here.  You have thirteen in--schools and colleges that are all different.  I can't take a dentistry professor and send him or her over to the law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] to teach a class, right.  So you have to build those almost independent of one another, but you have to build them in a way that they are sustainable and that they can thrive.  So that makes it complicated.  You layer on top of that, that you have a radio station [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.], a TV station [WHUT-TV, Washington, D.C.], a hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.], and then in my opinion, college athletics today is another business in and of itself.  And you get a very complicated organization that requires complicated solutions.  In this environment, what makes it even more difficult is that you're not doing that for the elite, and that's probably the biggest thing that separates us, right.  So at Harvard, those schools are doing it for as many kids whose parents make five hundred thousand dollars plus.  There are thirty-eight higher ed [higher education] institutions in this country whose student body is made up of more students from the top 1 percent than from the bottom 60 percent in income.  Howard obviously isn't one of those institutions, and that's what makes it difficult.  That's what brings about the financial pressure.  We have 60 percent Pell Grant eligible students in our undergrad.  At a private institution that's unheard of.  (Unclear) institutions with greater Pell Grant populations than ours are state institutions, like a Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], where the tuition, in state tuition, where 90 percent of the kids quality for in state tuition is five thousand and some dollars, right.  There's no in state tuition here, so private institution and the tuition is twenty-three thousand dollars.  And you have kids who come here and the expected family contribution to their education is zero.  So that financial conundrum is what I think has continued to plague us; and we have find innovative solutions for that.
Story_ID: 650845
Speaker 1: As provost, you started really thinking about becoming a president, is that, is that true (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--no.  I, I, I, I started thinking about the solutions.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I have to admit not the presidency.  And you know, I, I, I don't like to say this often, but I'm not crazy about the job.  I love the work.  I, I love the work, and I love the impact it has.  But the fish bowl of the job and the political nature of the job is not something that I'm crazy about.  So I never thought about it from that aspect or aspired to it.  When the search started for the next president when I was named interim president, was the first time I really thought about it.  And I was named interim president suddenly, right.  I, I got a call from the board that the president [Sidney A. Ribeau] was gonna step down, and they wanted me to be the interim president.  So you know, I was shocked.  But as I assume--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you consider yourself to be low key.  I was reading that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in articles that you, you're shy--
Speaker 2: I, yeah, I'm, I'm shy by nature and you know, would much rather be off in a corner of a room speaking to one person only and you know, not necessarily be in the spotlight.  I, I don't have a problem with public speaking.  I, I welcome the opportunity to public speak, but you know, I'm, I'm not a spotlight type of person.  And I think these jobs overexpose you, to be quite honest, you know.  People have a lot of access to you all the time.  They want access.  They want to maximize that access and influence.  Everybody, you know, has an opinion about how you should do the job and what you should be doing, and they also want to tell you every single time they see you or get an opportunity to.  And in this day of, you know, electronic means of contacting people, especially by email, people want to do that.  They want to, you know, they'll send you emails.  They hide behind their devices.  And they can say some of the most offensive things without any consequences, and that makes it difficult.  And with two young kids [Wayne A. I. Frederick II and Kirie Frederick], that overexposure, you know, that's a lot to deal with.
Speaker 1: Now, people aren't sending you things with the intention of offending you, are they?  Are they, are they, are they, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I--
Speaker 1: --sure you might get that kind of thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I, I can't--
Speaker 1: --I'm sure--
Speaker 2: --read intent.
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: But I think that's the society we live in though, right.  We have a president [President Donald John Trump] who tweets.  And as much as we complain about it, the very people who complain tweet just as much, how we're obsessed with voicing our opinion about everything, and it's instantaneous.  We bring students to college and universities like Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] to learn critical thinking, to rationalize, to learn how to build an argument, to learn how to discuss something without getting overly emotionally, you know, en- en- enraged, as it were.  But yet, still, the order of the day is a 140 character response to almost everything, and that's difficult, right.  It's difficult to convince a student that there's no way you could have critically thought about something if you reacted to it within six seconds of reading it or seeing it.  And if you did so in just a hundred forty characters, it's difficult to convince people of that.  But that's what, that to me is the essence of what our universities are about.  So there's a big contradiction taking place in higher ed [higher education] that we have to combat and figure out ways to, you know, impress upon people.  So yeah, people do say things--you know, again, like I said, I, I can't read intent, but I think that's just a societal norm now though.
Story_ID: 650846
Speaker 1: You finished your M.B.A. [at Howard University School of Business, Washington, D.C.] in 2011, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you were, you were dean then, right?
Speaker 2: I was the associate dean (unclear) yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Associate dean, all right--
Speaker 2: And then late that fall I became the deputy senior vice president for health sciences.  And then Dr. Leffall [HistoryMaker Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr.] was named provost in January, and I became the deputy provost for health sciences.  And then once a search was conducted for that job, I participated in that search, and I became the provost in June of the, the following year, June of--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --June of 2012.
Speaker 1: All right, so that's--were you basically doing that full time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm, I'm, while I'm doing that I'm operating.  What, what I should note is when I was associate dean I interviewed to be the dean of the medical school.  I actually--ironically, I would have been the seventeenth dean of the medical school.  And as they say, you know, sometimes when one door closes another opens, and that's a classic example.  I didn't become the seventeenth dean of the College of Medicine [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] but became the seventeenth president of the university [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And so you know, when I didn't get that job I was, you know, I was pretty disappointed, was thinking of moving, moving on and you know, looking elsewhere.  And then suddenly Dr. Leffall became the senior VP for health sciences because of a resignation of the then senior VP for health sciences who had been here only, you know, some eighteen or twenty months.  And he asked me at that time to be his deputy.  And that really was kind of what started, you know, the cascade of events that led to me being the interim president in October of 2013.
Story_ID: 650847
Speaker 1: But in 2013 I guess it was, President Ribeau [Sidney A. Ribeau] left, you know, almost in a--it was, it, it--nobody expected him to, right?  That--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I mean, there was a lot going on.  It was a difficult summer.  I have to say he, he is one of the nicest men I've ever met.  And I--you know, what--seeing what he had to go through close up was difficult.  We had a board member in April or May of that year, vice chair of the board, wrote a letter that was meant to be for internal consumption, and it was leaked.  And you know, that was in the newspaper and just created a cascade of events, you know, with a lot of press, and it was just very difficult, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now it was suggested that, what I read, that Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] was in a crisis at that moment.  Was it in fact in a--
Speaker 2: You know, well--
Speaker 1: --a--
Speaker 2: --the financial circumstance at the university wasn't the best.  We were doing one time things that were fixing the finances.  But structurally, we, we weren't making substantial changes that were bringing about long term structural change.  And the student body, as a result of the recession, African American unemployment was twice that of the national number.  And so the students who were coming here were coming with less and less means.  And you know, we didn't have a, a fundraising effort that could fill that gap.  We weren't monetizing assets in such a way that we were bringing in, you know, diver- a diversified revenue stream.  You put all those things together, it's a perfect storm.  And so you know, it wasn't a crisis that he had created.  It was a crisis, quite frankly, that he had met that had been on its way there over a period of time, you know.  And some of would argue, you know, how quickly do you solve or you know, does that make people comfortable or anxious?  And you know, so all of those things put together, you know, that was a conclusion of a difficult summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, President Ribeau steps down, and you were appointed interim president.  And then a search was launched to find a new president--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --with that.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --search committee was chaired by Vernon E. Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.], right?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: You had a high powered search committee.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was a robust process, I got to tell you.  I, I was hesitant after my experience with the (unclear) search about participating in a search.  And, but they ran a, they ran a very vigorous, very, very vigorous process.  And I was happy to participate, even if I did not get the job.  I, I would have felt very comfortable about the integrity of the process and as well the type of rigor that was put into it.  You know, it was quite a test.
Story_ID: 650848
Speaker 1: Now tell us from your point of view how you emerged as the president [of Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: You know, so, again, I, I, I don't know what the factors were that influenced the search committee.  But from my perspective in terms of when I became the interim president, I started to think about, you know, what the institution meant historically and the fact that we needed to use its history and legacy, not as an anchoring point but as a driving point to the future, how we needed to be more innovative about the solutions, how we had to diversify the revenue stream, how we had to think of ways I would make that better.  We have to provide the education we provide in a more operationally efficient manner as well.  And so I think, you know, that type of thought process probably was seen as, you know, an opportunity to meet the challenges of the day, low, you know, revenue streams.  I wouldn't say we were in a high cost environment but costs because of--incurring some costs because of inefficiencies.  And so we, we had to try to solve those conundrums, you know, and I tried to present some solutions for those.
Speaker 1: Okay.  One solution was the Center for Academic Excellence, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And now I'd, I'd read somewhere that black colleges [HBCUs] actually retain more black students than any other institutions 'cause actually historically, I mean, it's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, but what was the, the, the problem you were trying to deal with?
Speaker 2: So, you know, that, that, that wasn't my idea.  But, but that was something that as provost I started to get an opportunity to implement it.  I had a slightly different bent on it though that I tried to apply.  And that was I wanted to focus on, on I would say highly competitive scholarships and fellowships.  I do Rhodes scholar [Rhodes Scholarship], because I felt that we had students who were bright enough to get there, but we needed to really expose them to the possibility that this wa- you know, this was an option and then to really give them all the tools that would arm them so they would be able to, to really win those.  And that, that was difficult.  It was a difficult equation, as it were, to put together, because here you're getting Pell Grant eligible students, and you're talking about sending them to be Rhodes scholars.  But we had a strong plan to put together.  So when we put our offers together, my projection was that in five years we would win a Rhodes scholar.  We won one in our second year.  The number of students who we've gotten interested in it and the number of students who've applied to all of the scholarships has really risen significantly.  We started with about thirty students the first year who applied to all the different types of fellowships.  We won a Marshall Scholar- [Marshall Scholarship], and then we, we had a Truman scholar winner [Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation].  And you know, that number has gone up now into the fifties, almost sixty.  And then this year, from what I'm hearing, we probably are gonna have even more students apply to it.  So, one, one part of it was to provide support for students holistically in terms of tutoring, academic advising, et cetera.  But then there was this little caveat where I really wanted us to prepare students to really be competitive on a national and international stage; and I think so far has been bearing fruit.
Story_ID: 650849
Speaker 1: Tell us about GRACE [Graduation and Retention Access to Continued Excellence].
Speaker 2: So GRACE is a grant pro- grant program that I started to look at how could we apply some of our funds to students who were in need and help the retention rate by doing that, because the number one reason students leave Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] is because of finances, not because of academic aptitude.  And they, the sophomore is, is--funny enough, I read an article recently about the fact that more colleges and universities are paying attention to sophomore students.  A lot of times we pay attention to freshmen coming in, to get them in with resources.  And we pay attention to, you know, juniors and seniors to get them over the line.  And (unclear) the sophomore I guess get neglected.  The, the whole thing about this program that we started a couple of years ago is to really push, you know, that support for those students.  And so they have to obtain and maintain a certain GPA [grade point average].  And we give them funds really guided at retention.  The GPAs aren't, you know, that, that we want and you know, in the high honor range because we rec- we're recognizing that some of these students as well are, you know, out working and dealing with a multitude of other, you know, stressful factors and trying to maintain good grades.  And so we have to give them the best opportunity possible.
Story_ID: 650850
Speaker 1: [U.S.] Congress recognized you in 2014.  I have a note here.  What was, what was that honor about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they, they recognized me for my work in health disparities and trying to close the gap.  When I first came back to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] I did a lot of research on, you know, what were some of the reasons, tried to tie it back to some molecular reasons as well as to why there was such a big gap, wrote some paper about triple negative breast cancers in African American women and also very advanced cancers that I hadn't even seen at MD Anderson in African American women, breast cancers, breast cancers in which the tumors were so large you couldn't tell it was a breast if I showed you a picture of the tumor, had eroded away the nipple and so on.  And in the nation's capital [Washington, D.C.] it really bothered me that I had seen two dozen of those patients in a two year period.  I hadn't seen one single patient like that at MD Anderson Cancer Center [University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas].  And so I recognized that there was something else wrong.  You know, there may be genetic or molecular issues, but that access to care and people's belief system about the healthcare system and how they engage was, was real.  And so Congress, you know, read me into the record [Congressional Record] that, that June, which was, again, very humbling.
Story_ID: 650851
Speaker 1: Well, as we sit here in twen- 2016, where is Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?  What's, what's the status of Howard; and where do you want to take it?
Speaker 2: So you know, Howard is embarking on the celebration of its 150th anniversary on March 2nd, 2017.  This is one of the few universities in America that started as a university back in that time.  A lot of our universities, colleges [HBCUs] started as seminaries and then became universities over time.  It started as a university.  And the essence of that bold dream to educate freed slaves coming from the South has now blossomed into the reality of the education of the African diaspora in a way that has led to leaders in many fields.  And so Howard right now is in a great place in terms of being able to provide that academic excellence.  We do have to solve the complex financial circumstances that faces the student body that we are bringing here.  While they are financially challenged, academically they have never been brighter or more capable.  And so what we are doing as we look forward is to make sure we thrive.  We have to continue to create an environment that accommodates that academic excellence that our students are demanding and, and, and displaying.  And we have to do so in a circumstance that leaves us not just fiscally solvent but fiscally thriving so that we can be bold and innovative in terms of taking on the real big problems of today and coming up with solutions.  But that does require that you take some risks, and you have to have the financial capacity in today's world to take risks in higher ed [higher education].
Story_ID: 650852
Speaker 1: What's your alumni support like?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Alumni support has been growing and has been better.  When I took over the university [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], our alumni giving rate was 4.78 percent.  It's now up to, last year it was 10 point something percent.  And we are on our way this year we think to between 12 and 15 percent.  So it's been growing significantly.  More importantly, I would say our alumni engagement, right--that's the alumni participation rate as far as giving.  But our alumni engagement probably hasn't been better.  We have done a lot of stuff around our communications to ensure that.  I've put out a monthly newsletter called the Bison Beat, for the purpose of engaging, you know, our alum.  I do an alumni call once a month.  As a matter of fact, the last one had 501 alumni registered for the call.  I do a state and university address at homecoming, where we discuss all the finances, et cetera, and we do it as a webinar.  I've had some interview series with--I had Wolf Blitzer moderate the first one.  I had Ed Gordon [HistoryMaker Ed Gordon, III] do the second one, a, a student do the third one, and my student ombudsman to do the fourth one.  So there, there are lots of opportunities to know what's going on at the university, to engage to give you a feedback and input, and we welcome all of that.
Speaker 2: And what about the surrounding area here?  It seems to be changing, and it seems to gentrifying.  How, how, how, how, how does this--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --affect the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's aggressively gentrified, so we have a responsibility to make sure that the people who are moving in assimilate to what this university is about and to educate them.  So we also have an engagement series with the community where we invite members from the community and the (unclear) to come in and meet with me and, and talk about what's going on at the university, et cetera.  I think that's been very helpful in getting people to understand what the university is about and what our overall plans are that may impact the community.
Story_ID: 650853
Speaker 1: In terms of raising money, is, is, is, is Howard still very dependent on, on the federal government for (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, significant part of our budget from a revenue point of view.  It is about 28 percent of our budget.  What I will say is the return on investment that the country has--that the nation has received from it is significant and I, I, I think can't be overstated.  As a matter of fact, I think we have to constantly make sure that people are aware of just how prolific the university has been.  I mean, we produce--if you look at all the black physicians in this country, Howard University [Washington, D.C.] is responsible for producing the largest number of them of all time.  We send more African Americans to medical school than anybody else in the country.  We--over the past decade we've sent more African American students to (unclear) than Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] combined.  So what Howard has been doing, you know, whether it's in dentistry or social work or business, is remarkable.  And so that federal appropriation I think is, is well spent.  Having said that, looking at the political climates of the country and the uncertainty and unpredictability of what is, is going to occur, we also recognize that we have to become more self-dependent and self-sufficient.  And so that's a major part of our long term financial plans and goals.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 650854
Speaker 1: Could you speak a bit to the need for the black university?  I think years ago when Negro colleges were formed, it was actually stated some of the stated goals were that they just wanted black folks to get an education so they could get out in the marketplace and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --get a job.  But, but it wasn't, wasn't so much about it being a black school or, or, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a commitment to African American people, per se.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what, what, what--where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--you know, this is something that's so often confused.  Historically, black colleges and universities is a designation that was a--is a federal designation that came about in 1964.  It's poorly understood there are 107 such designated institutions.  There are at least three of them who have African American student populations that are in the minority.  So it's not just about being a black school or a black college or a black university.  People sometimes (unclear), well, is there a lack of diversity?  I'd, I'd also argue that as well.  Diversity isn't just skin deep.  We have students from forty-four states and seventy-one countries on this campus.  I'm not sure how much more diverse you can get in terms of difference of thought and, and ideology, et cetera.  So, what I see is, is there a need for a Howard University [Washington, D.C.]?  And in a complex organization like this, where you have a dental school [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.], a medical [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], a law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], a school of social work [Howard University School of Social Work, Washington, D.C.], school of divinity [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.], and then all the other grad offerings, my--the answer is absolutely yes.  We do it better than anyone else, and therefore, they, they are still necessary.  The HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] as a group represent 3 percent of higher ed [higher education] institutions, but we're responsible for maybe 25 percent of all of the bachelor's degrees offered to African Americans in this country and as high as 40 percent of all of the bachelor's degree and STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] disciplines offered to have African Americans in this country.  So the impact we have in terms of diversifying many fields is, is clear.  And so it's not an issue of whether or not we are necessary.  We are essential.  What is important is how excellent can we be and do we have the resources, both financial and personnel wise to be as excellent as we can be.  And that's what I think all our university presidents should be focused on.
Story_ID: 650855
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back over your career, over all you've done to this point, is there anything major you would do differently if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: I, I mean, I, I'm not a, much of a second guesser.  I, I tell people, in life I have no regrets, because even when I've made I was--they've proven to be important teaching points.  So you know, I can't say to you sitting here that there's anything specific I would do different.  That leads to a question of, you know, kind of what is your legacy or what you want your legacy to be.  And I think there's only one legacy that's important on this campus, and that's Howard University's [Washington, D.C.] legacy, not mine.  Sixteen men have done this job before me.  And if I can pass the mantle of leadership on to a woman, that would be probably the single most important thing that I could do.
Story_ID: 650856
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community today, I guess in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago] as well as here?
Speaker 2: You know, in--my hope and concern is that we love and embrace each other for the richness of our diversity of thought and the richness of the diversity of, of our talent spectrum.  I think too often we discount each other too easily.  We talk about how we integrate and assimilate into the greater society a lot.  But even within our own communities I don't think we really embrace each other enough.  You know, I think unfortunately there's more self hate than there's self love.  And I think if we practiced more of that, some of the advances that we have already achieved, I think would be exponential.  We have to have much more belief in what it is we're capable of and also to recognize that the data suggests that.  Last year, a greater percentage of African Americans who graduated from high school in this country entered college than their Caucasian counterparts did.  And you know, we--I, I, I don't think we embrace that data and embrace the fact that a greater percentage of African Americans see college and universities as the economic escalator that it is.  And, and I think that in and of itself speaks to the altruism of our youth and, and the focus that they have.  And although there's a lot of cynicism about our youth, I don't share it, because I see the kids who come here who have no means, no financial fortitude, and yet still for alternative spring break they're gonna go sleep on a church floor or sleep in a damp place in Haiti and provide free dental care or clean up the streets of Baltimore [Maryland].  I mean, those kids are, are bent on doing the right thing.  And we just have to continue to provide the best environment for them in all our communities, whether it's in Trinidad or Lagos, Nigeria, or right here in, you know, one of our cities in America.
Speaker 1: Do you get a chance to interact with students much as a, as individuals or as organizations?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot, a lot.  I have a lot of student engagement.  I also walk around campus [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] a lot and just go sit in classes.  I'm fascinated by the academic environment.  I'm curious by nature.  If I had the time or the capacity to get a degree from every one of the schools and colleges on this campus I probably would.  But I can live vicariously through my student body.  And I'm always curious about what they're doing and why and what they hope to achieve and what they hope to change.  And every time I hear one of those stories it's, it's inspiring.
Story_ID: 650857
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about--there's so much discussion today about STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] education.  And we were at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], oh, I don't know.  It had to be like ten times with the national--a, a science foundation [National Science Foundation] grant to interview scientists here.  And--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: So I, I just wanted to ask you a little about the, the--STEM education requires as a major commitment in terms of equipment--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, a lot of times, you know, and research grant money and that sort of thing?  What, what, what, what are your--what, what's this (unclear)--
Speaker 2: You know, I--
Speaker 1: --about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think we have to find a balance.  And we talk about it a lot.  I'm not sure we are guiding students correctly about it.  So, it is important.  There's no doubt that it has a role to play in the changing economy that we're in.  The economy we're in is changing, and it's complicated.  And whether it's, you know, technology, you look at artificial intelligence, I mean, all of those things clearly are a wave of the future.  However, I, I'm not sure that we are as realistic about what that means, right, and I'll give you two examples.  We, we are talking now about a driverless car and what that would do to the economy.  And you think about all of the cab drivers as, as an example.  What do they do?  Who do they become?  And for that matter, how many people do you need to--in that industry to really deliver a driverless car?  You only need but so many.  We talk about Silicon Valley a lot, but how many people are really employed in Silicon Valley [California].  The last data I saw I don't think there are more than twenty thousand people employed in Silicon Valley.  You think of General Electric, one of the mainstay companies of our time, and you think of its growth over time and how many years it was around, now stable, and but how long it took for it to become the General Electric we know today.  And then you compare that to Snapchat [Snap Inc.], that at one point just had ten employees and you know, was well on its way to being a billion dollar company.  The number of employees that these--a, a number of jobs that these industries are gonna create are, are finite, and there are not that, that many.  And I think it's a little misguided if we throw all our energy at STEM to say that, you know, we have to get all our kids into those fields that diversify, et cetera.  There have to be other things that will make sure the economy, you know, continues to grow and has all these different aspects.  And I think that's one of the real dangers, trying to see into that crystal ball as to what is going to matter outside of those disciplines, right, what--when--if you have a driverless car, what else is going to be important in that particular industry?  How about it--it still means that you have to make cars.  There's something there and an opportunity there.  It, it still means that there are other things.  You, you need better highways probably.  You need better roadways.  You know, all of those things are, are probably gonna be just as important.  But there is not as much focus on all of these other things as much as we've gotten so focused on just the technology aspect, and we talk about STEM in that way.  And that worries me.  Will people stop going to the theater and listen to great opera singers?  I'm not sure that they would.  So if there are kids who have that talent, we should be nurturing them and not make them feel that they're second class if they go into those things.  I think that's a, a misguided issue right now.
Story_ID: 650858
Speaker 1: As you--we mentioned earlier, Eric Williams came here to study political science and goes back and becomes a prime minister of a country [Trinidad and Tobago].  Is, is Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] still through history, political science, Africana studies, art, film, still a leader?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  The second African American female senator, Kamala Harris, Howard grad, actually just took, took up office 2017.  You know, I, I think we are still at that leading edge in all of those areas.  The current mayor [Kasim Reed] of Atlanta [Georgia] is a Howard grad.  The current mayor [HistoryMaker Ras Baraka] of Newark, New Jersey, is a Howard grad.  I, I think it's still absolutely critical that we're there.  How people are writing about the past and how that helps us define the future is gonna be critical as well because so much stuff is happening so rapidly.  So much stuff is happening, not in forms that we previously had it happening, and so it has to be captured a little differently.  And so we need students in all of those fields to make sure that we document those things well and that we understand what impact and interphase it has on the economy as we go forward.
Story_ID: 650859
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your family.  Now you, you're, you, you, you have a son I know that, that was four at one time, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but who, who, who is in your family now?
Speaker 2: So you know, my wife Simone [Simone Frederick], we'll celebrate our--we, we have two anniversaries we celebrate.  But on February 5th and February 12th we celebrate our anniversaries on February 12th.  It'd be thirteen years, and February 5th it'll be twelve years.  We got married in Connecticut in a, at, with a justice of peace.  And then the next year we got married in Trinidad in a church ceremony.  She is, you know, she's the rock of the family.  She's the driving force behind what happens.  I mean, she makes all of this possible.  My two kids, Wayne II [Wayne A. I. Frederick II] was born four days before me, on June 3rd, 2004, very athletic young man, whose athleticism is far overshadowed by his academic fortitude.  He's a, you know, straight A student, doing very well, and very motivated, you know, to, to compete in a classroom.  And then my daughter, who's ten, Kirie [Kirie Frederick], is a precocious ten year old who has a lot of insight into the world and the things around her, insight that at times can be scary that such a young girl can think about so many complex issues in our society.  But she, she clearly is gonna change a lot of the, the paradigms I think that we accept today, you know, because of the ways she thinks and embraces difference, et cetera.  And she's, she's not a cliquish young lady, doesn't hang out with one group of friends in class but very empathetic about everybody and everything that's going on around her.
Story_ID: 650860
Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't discussed we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No.  I think you, I think you did a good job of touching all of it.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: You know, because of the way in which I grew up, the, the single most important thing to me is being a father.  And if nothing else, you know, I would like to be remembered as being a good father to my two kids [Wayne A. I. Frederick II and Kirie Frederick].  What that means is not so much the ultimate product of who they are and how they interact with society.  That's certainly one window into it.  But more importantly, when, you know, they lay their heads down at night, how they feel about me.  How they feel about the relationship that I have developed with them is the single most important thing to me.
Speaker 1: All right, thank you so much.
Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.
