 Little Thunder  Elizondo  This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is February 20, 2014, and  I   m interviewing Michael Elizondo Jr. for the Oklahoma Native Artists  Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at  OSU. We   re at Michael   s studio in Oklahoma City. Michael, you   re  Cheyenne, Chumash, and Kaw. Is that correct?  Yes.  You got your MFA from the University of Oklahoma in 2011, and you   ve  already distinguished yourself with some important group and solo  shows in Minneapolis and Washington DC, among other places. You   ve  won several grants and awards including Judges Choice at the 2012  Cherokee National Holiday Show. Thank you for taking the time to talk  with me.  Yes.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and I grew up in Tahlequah, Oklahoma.  Do you have siblings?  Yes, I have one younger brother, an older brother, and an older sister.  There   s four of us.  What did your folks do for a living?  My dad, he   s a retired art teacher, and he taught around Muskogee,  Hilldale, and all around Tahlequah. My mom, she   s a security guard  with Hertz.  5  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  How about your grandparents? Did you have a relationship with them?  Yes, primarily my grandmothers. My grandpa on my mom   s side, he  passed away when I was ten, and my dad   s dad, he passed away before I  was born, so I   ve been pretty close with my grandmas. They   re both still  here. My grandma on my dad   s side lives in Tulsa. My grandma on my  mom   s side lives here in Oklahoma City.  Your grandma on your Cheyenne side is a well-known bead worker.  What other kinds of other Cheyenne influences emerge in your art?  Yes. My grandma, I   m very close with her. She   s the one who   s been  taking me, took me, to our ceremonial grounds when I was younger. She  gave me a lot of influence with the Native American Church and our  Cheyenne Sun Dance. Whenever I was younger she always explained to  me the purpose of some of her designs that she made in her beadwork  through cradleboards, vests, moccasins. Whenever I was younger, I  really didn   t do that same influence directly as far as beadworking. My  way of expressing what she taught me was through painting, drawing,  and in time, it   s pulled me in the direction that I do beadwork, too. This  is kind of how it works together.  Yes, I   ve seen some really beautiful examples at your place. What   s your  first memory of seeing Native art?  Whenever my dad was attending Northeastern State University in  Tahlequah, I was in second grade, and I remember going to some of the  art shows that he would be invited to around the area of Tahlequah and  Muskogee. I believe Murv Jacob and Bill Rabbit, they   re among some of  the artist around the area, so as far as the subject matter of Native  American artists, those were some of the first examples.  What is your first memory of making art?  I don   t have one. For as long as I remember, I   ve been one   I   ve always  had the urge to make things, and whenever I got older, it just stuck with  me. It   s just been growing ever since.  How much encouragement from your family did you have to develop  your artistic skills?  I had a lot of encouragement from all of my family, primarily my dad  and my grandma. My dad, actually, was a art student whenever I was  younger. He would always encourage me and my brothers to tag along  with him. My brothers always seen it as a drag, but I was always pretty  excited to     6  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  To the art classes, you   re saying?  To some of the events that the school would have. Whenever he would  be working in, take for example, the pottery studio, I would run off in  the corner and play with the spare clay they had in the building. Then as  well as my grandma, she always took the time to not only remember  some of the oral histories that we have with our people but interpret it in  some kind of way through the arts.  Did you have any other relatives on either side of the family who were  artistic?  Yes, not as much on my dad   s side. His father, his step-dad, he was a  painter. I took a lot of influence from him, as well. On my  grandmother   s side, she   s the oldest of eleven, I believe. Eight of the  eleven are heavily influenced by making as many things like beadwork,  sculpting, yeah, just a number of things.  You also have Kaw and Chumash ancestry. Can you talk a little bit  about how those influences manifest themselves in your art?  Yes, the Kaw side I really have little knowledge about. My mother, her  grandpa, his name was Levi Chouteau. He was one in eight of the last  full bloods left of the tribe, and he passed away in 1980. I believe the  last full blood passed away in 2000, and so through that   he was a  orphan. Whenever he married my great-grandma, he decided to move to  Cheyenne country in El Reno. My mom, she primarily grew up with the  Cheyenne relatives, and so I can   t really say that I have any influence  that comes in through my Kaw side.  As far as my Chumash side, that really didn   t start coming around until  the past few years. I   ve only been to the reservation one time before  2012, which was when I was fourteen years old. I went to go meet my  great-grandma. She was sick, and she passed away after that visit, but I  was glad to meet her. After I graduated from OU in 2011, the Director of  Education, she invited me to do an exhibit out there. I believe the exhibit  was called Portraits of  a  People. She asked if I had any work that  might reflect that. I said,    Yeah, I have some portraits of my grandma  and my dad and a couple cousins, and they   re all descendants of the  tribe.     They invited me to take part in that. I shipped out my works and then got  to re-meet a lot of relatives I haven   t seen since I was a teenager. While I  was out there, I have some aunties out there who have a lot of  information on the rock art that   s out there. When I saw that, they   re just  7  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  beautiful, the color combinations, the organic designs. They said,    Here,  go ahead and take these, and whatever way they might influence you,  it   ll be good for you to learn about that, too.    So over the past two years,  I   ve been getting into a lot of drawings I   ve been doing with the  Prismacolor pencils, and I   ve been kind of reinterpreting what I might  see through those designs. Even though I really don   t know what they  mean, I just kind of pull in whatever influence I can out of them and  interpret them in my own way.  That sounds interesting. So what were your experiences with art in  elementary school growing up?  Most of the schools I went to when I was a younger kid, they really  didn   t have any art classes, so primarily it was just being around my dad.  Whenever I got into high school, they had a artist. His name   s Dan  Horsechief. He would do a couple of the after-school programs. He was  a great influence on me as an artist whenever I was coming of age, and  he encouraged me to do some research on other works. I really didn   t get  much art education until I got into the end of high school and then after.  And high school was at Sequoyah, right?  Yes.  Were you also involved in athletics there?  Yes, athletics surrounded my entire life when I was over there.  Whenever I was starting to get into my art, I started to become so  immersed into track and cross country that I pushed all my art aside.  (Laughs) So yeah, I did cross country and track, and that led me to a  scholarship to Oklahoma Baptist  University .  At Oklahoma Baptist, you decided you were going to major in art?  Yes. For the first two years, I really wasn   t thinking too much of a  major. I knew that it was going to pull me back into the arts, but  whenever I was a junior, after I got all my requirements out of the way,  that   s when I went head-on into our art project, our art program. Ever  since, I   ve been just fully addicted.  What kind of base did you get at Oklahoma Baptist University in terms  of art, what kinds of skills?  Okay, when I was at Oklahoma Baptist, a lot of it was, as many art  students would get, the fundamentals. Because I wasn   t just now starting  my practices of being an artist, a lot of times I kind of kept to myself. I  8  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  was able to pick up on a lot of the fundamentals pretty quick, so I kind  of skipped a lot of things and went straight into the advanced courses.  Some of the most important things that I   ve learned from that school  towards the end was how to work as a professional: the things that you  need, how to network, how to be able to promote yourself, how to be in  charge of the little things like your resume, your bio, and all those  things. Those are some of the main things that I pulled out of that  school. Other than that, they always let me do my own thing and let my  own experiences develop wherever my artwork was going to go.  Long independent study?  Yes.  When did you sell your first painting, or first piece of beadwork, I  guess?  Yeah, for a long time I didn   t get into the sales and exhibits of my  artwork. A lot of people were really pushing me to do so, but I don   t  think it was until 2010 until I started exhibiting. Out of that first exhibit  that I did, that   s when I got my first sale.  What was that like?  At the time, it felt like a long time coming because I was working  towards it, but I really didn   t want my work to be out there until I was  fully satisfied with it.  How did you get to the University of Oklahoma after college? Did you  go straight from Oklahoma Baptist University into the MFA program at  OU?  Yes.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  No time in between?  No. Yeah, I went everything back to back: high school to bachelor   s,  bachelor   s to master   s. I just kept the ball rolling.  How   d you find out about their program?  I just did my own research on the university. I looked around at other  9  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  programs, but some of the things they had, some of the information they  had throughout their collections, (take for example the history collection  they have of all the Native American tribes around the state) I knew that  was going to be information that I needed for my work. I knew that the  painting instructor, the painting chair over there, he had a very good  grasp of modern concepts, and that was something I wanted to pull into  my work, as well.  And who is the chair?  His name was Tommy White.  Were there some other professors there that were especially influential?  Yes. Marwin Begaye, he was a great influence on my experience at the  University of Oklahoma. The talks that I had with him as a graduate  student, as far as the subject matter of contemporary Native American  works, he was very influential in letting me know the things that might  be ahead as far as conversations with the work that I was doing and  exploring not only Native American tribes here in Oklahoma, around the  state, but looking at other indigenous cultures around the world. Those  are some of the things that Marwin brought to my work and my research  habits, so that   s just one example.  How did your style change while you were at OU?  Going into the program, one of the things that me and my former chair,  Tommy White, came to an agreeance was that whatever it is that you go  into the program with, it would be a waste of time if you came out of the  program with that same kind of work. Being able to challenge my work  on all levels was the main focus that I had at the university. Whenever I  came in, I was primarily doing portraits that came from historical  perspectives from my great-great-grandparents (none of them were  contemporary) and designs that I got from Native American Church.  They were very flat. They were pretty repetitive, but they   re kind of  static from my point of view. I wanted to take the time to learn how to  bring something new, as far as shaping the panels, building skills, and if  I was to do any portraits, I wanted to challenge the subject matter of how  is it relevant to today. On all ends, from realism to abstraction, that   s  how I always challenge my work. How is it relevant to today, and what  kind of influence did I get from history?  Was it at OU that you started working on panels?  Yes. Yeah, up to that point I never had any workshop to work with.  10  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  What happened after you graduated?  Well, the day after graduation, I remember laying in my apartment  thinking,    I don   t know what I   m going to do.    (Laughs) I was kind of  tapping my foot.    I   m going to get out there and see if there   s any  exhibitions going on.    When I got on my laptop, the first thing I saw  was an exhibition happening at Red Cloud Indian School up north of  Pine Ridge  South Dakota . I was like,    Well, I   m not going to lay here.  That   s all I know.    I packed my work up, drove all the way to South  Dakota, and delivered my works, and barely got in for the submission. I  got my first award right away after I graduated, and sold that piece at  that Heritage Center.  Then did you stay around for the show and the reception?  No, I wasn   t interested. (Laughter)  Wow, you won an award     Yeah, so from there        for Most Promising Young Artist, wasn   t it, or do you remember the     Yes, Outstanding Young Artist award. From there, people started  contacting me, emailing me, if I had any other works. I   ve been selling  from there, and it   s been one big snowball effect.  That   s wonderful. So you   re saying a lot of commissions basically came  through from that?  Yeah.  What was the piece that you had in that show?  The piece was titled Ishiwana, which is   I   ve been told a few ways of  how that translation goes. Like when the sun   s just now breaking, right  in the early morning, we sing those words a lot in our morning songs in  Native American Church. The painting itself was a tipi on the horizon,  and the sun was just now beginning to break. That was the piece that I  did, and I just wanted to see what kind of chances I would have if I  brought it up there.  Do you do booth shows very much?  Never have. I believe it was one year after I graduated from OU, I  11  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  became the Artist-in-Residence at the Jacobson House. The director  there at the time was Kricket Rhoads. She always liked to do art market  in the wintertime and the springtime. She   d always ask me if I wanted to  do any booths, but I just opened up the space and did open studio visits.  So up to this point, I haven   t been able to do any booth shows like  Indian Market in Santa Fe or anything, but it   s something that I want to  do.  How did the Artist-in-Residency come about?  Whenever I was still hanging around Norman after I graduated, I would  go by and visit, and she would be curious of what I would be up to. She  said,    Well, what do you want to do?    I said,    The main thing I know  unquestionably that I want to do is I want to continue to make my work  without any interruptions in my everyday routines.    She said,    Well, that  sounds good. We have an open space if you need it,    which is the  building just south of the main house at the Jacobson. She said,    Would  you be interested in using that space?    I said,    Yeah, I   ll use it.    She  said,    There   s no restrictions. You make whatever you want, and we   ll  give you a key.    I just really liked the support that they gave over there.  Yeah, so it was really support in terms of space, providing you with a  free space, and you were selling some of the stuff that you did to your  collectors.  Yeah.  What do you think has been one of your most important museum shows  so far?  I haven   t done very many museum shows, but I   d have to say that before  I graduated at OU they had the annual student exhibition. That was the  first museum collection that my works became a part of.  Was it at the Fred Jones  Museum ?  Yeah.  Okay.  I believe I got the award   what was the award called? Does it say on  here?  Well, I don   t have your CV.  Oh, okay. Yeah, so I got the collection award for that. That was my first  12  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  time I had my work become a part of any kind of museum collection.  Sometimes the hardest part of doing art is the business aspect. How do  you handle that?  Yes, it definitely makes you work twice as hard for whatever it is you  want to do. Whenever I   m starting to get into the groove of making the  work, I have to get it down and do the emails and do all the updates of  the information they want. I just try to make everything move together. I  really don   t get too many conflicts, but everything is trial and error as far  as learning how to ship works, who to ship works with, making sure that  whoever I   m going to be shipping through that the buyer is going to get  everything in a timely manner. Everything   s been trial and error up to  this point. Now that I   ve been doing it for a few years, I   ve been able to  kind of find the smoother routes of how to take care of my business with  other buyers.  Have you spent any time applying for grants, too?  I   ve applied for a few, but I   ve never got any.  That can be time consuming.  Yes.  You   ve taught art both as a graduate student at OU and at Bacone. How  has teaching art to others impacted your own work?  Whenever I was teaching courses with the University of Oklahoma and  teaching courses for Bacone, one thing that I really enjoyed was  whenever I was going to teach a subject, I would realize that I kind of  forgot a lot of information, so it made me go in and actually relearn a lot  of subjects. (Laughs) Whenever I was relearning a lot of the subjects  through art history or contemporary works that I was researching, I  realized that I missed something, so I   d bring it back into my work to  practice with. That way I could show them different ends of whatever it  is I was talking about.  You were at Bacone how long?  For one year, two semesters.  How did that come about, the teaching assignment?  Well, whenever I was Artist-in-Residence with the Jacobson House, I  would always like to hang out for the Second  Friday Art Walk  in  13  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Norman. I believe in that springtime of 2012, they were having a exhibit  at the main site with Tony Tiger, Marwin Begaye, a lot of those who are  involved with the Southeastern  Indian  Artists Association. I went to go  check it out because I knew they were all going to be over there, so I  went to go visit with them. Tony Tiger, we had a good visit. He said,     Hey, there   s only two of us who are instructing at Bacone: me and Troy  Jackson. If you   re interested, you could come join us. Just send me your  resume and your CV and everything.    I said,    Okay, that sounds cool.  I   ll do what I can.    I told him,    I won   t be able to move over there, but  I   ll be able to commute,    so I commuted twice a week from Oklahoma  City to Muskogee, which was pretty challenging. (Laughter)  I thought you gave a really good talk at the show Uncommon Brothers  at the Jacobson House when you showed slides of your work. How do  you handle the public speaking that   s involved with being an artist?  Sometimes it   s smooth; sometimes not as much. I don   t consider myself  a very verbal person as far as the things I need to explain in my art  because that is one thing that has drove me ever since I was a little kid,  to be able to express it visually. A lot of things that I can   t push out  vocally, I have to force it out through my visuals. Usually if I   ve spent a  lot of time on the visual work, it really helps me communicate it  verbally. Generally whenever I   m explaining an older body of work, I  can speak it a lot clearer to my audience. Whenever I have a new body  of work, it   s still kind of sinking in my mind, and I stumble around a  little bit.  That   s interesting. How much have you traveled out of state with your  work?  As I mentioned, South Dakota was my first. It was my first out-of-state  exhibit or taking part of any exhibit. I did that a few times. I believe I  made that trip four times. Then I   ve been able to travel to Santa Ynez,  California, to do that exhibit, and then going out to Santa Fe, just  meeting artists. I   ve never exhibited out there, but I met a artist named  Dyani White Hawk Polk. I think she   s the director of the All My  Relations Gallery in Minnesota. She asked me if I wanted to take part in  an exhibit up there in the summer of 2012. I wasn   t able to make that  trip, but I was reinvited to another exhibit in the summertime of 2013.  The exhibit was called Art from Indian Territory. I was able to make that  trip up there. Other than that, I   ve just been shipping works out to  different places around.  What other galleries have you found representation in?  Let   s see. I   ve never been fully represented by any gallery, but I   ve  14  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  exhibited in Marvin Embree Studios in the Paseo district. I   ve exhibited  at Tribes 131 in Norman. I   ve exhibited in Tulsa Momentum Artists  young artists exhibit, and Oklahoma City Momentum. Every year  they   re generally in different spaces. Those have been some of the main  places I   ve exhibited.  It   s been a mix of Native and non-Native venues.  Yes. I always try to keep all my options open. I never want to be  cornered off to contemporary mainstream galleries, and I   ll never want  to be cornered off in just being in Native American avenues. I kind of  like to get a little feel of both, and I like to expose myself to everybody.  It seems like your work is sort of roughly divided between the realism  and then the abstract work, and your website mentions that you like oils  for your realistic paintings and acrylics for your abstracts. Why is that?  A lot of abstract work, as far as a lot of the abstract work that I   ve done,  has been pretty hard edged. It comes in handy with the acrylics  whenever I   m using a lot of tape. I   m able to layer everything down the  way I want it, and all I got to do is pull that tape off to give it, my  designs, that hard edge I   m looking for. The design work, I kind of work  quicker with acrylics, which if I was to do those same kind of design  works with the oils, it gets a little bit too messy, and the designs don   t  come out the way I want it. As far as portraits go, I really like to take my  time. I don   t want to rush the textures and the surfaces of the portraits  that I do. I just really enjoy taking my time with the oils whenever it  comes to realism.  I would like to talk about your creative process a little bit more in detail.  Have you experimented with other media besides oils and acrylics?  I experimented with lithography for about a year and a half when I was  at OU. I   ve experimented with screen printing, a little bit of installation  work but I   ve never exhibited it, and a little bit of clay work, but in the  end it doesn   t really keep my attention long enough for me to continue  it. I won   t ever fully reject it because I think down the road I might find  more use for it, but up to this point those are the only things that have  been able to keep my attention long enough.  Was some of the screen printing in conjunction with the Southeastern  Artists Association or not?  No, this has all been on my own.  You haven   t been involved with them at all?  15  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  No.  I thought I saw some collage work of yours.  No.  What do you like about painting on Masonite as opposed to canvas or  board?  Yeah, I haven   t painted on canvas in probably about six years, primarily  because whenever I wanted to learn how build it on my own, I wanted to  get the full experience of knowing the piece inside and out. Whenever I  learned how to build Masonite and Bristol board panels, I started  experimenting a whole lot. I started experimenting on those quite a bit as  far as textures and how you handle the piece. Whenever you got a panel,  you can get as aggressive as you want almost until you break the thing.  Like, if I would have a pallet knife, I could scratch into it the way I  want. I could get different surfaces, different layers that I couldn   t with  canvas, because if I treated the canvas the same way I did a Masonite  panel, I   d probably rip the canvas.  Right, and you have some woodcutting equipment. Did you have any  kind of woodworking background before you started working with the  Masonite?  No. Prior to OU, I had zero experience with any power tools as far as  table saws and miter saws and all those. Whenever I was in my second  year at OU, I signed up for the TA position that they had available. One  thing that they had me do in that position was they said,    Well, you need  to fulfill so many hours for the week.    I said,    Okay.    They said,    You  can keep the woodshop open twice a week. Do you have any  experience?    I said,    No.    (Laughter) They said,    We   ll show you one  demo, and then you   re in charge.    (Laughs) So I got that one  demonstration, and from that point on I thought,    I better learn all these  tools before I start getting all the questions.    Sure enough, all those  questions came, and I learned it all on the spot.  That was a great apprenticeship   Yes. (Laughter)  The other advantage, of course, is that you can experiment with different  sizes and shapes that aren   t custom sizes. Why is shape such an  important part of the painting process?  16  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Whenever I got into shaping some of my first panels, there were some  designs that I had in mind from my grandma   s beadwork. She used to  explain one design the most that I could remember. It was called the  mountain design. I   ve tried to do narratives of some of the influence I  got from that design she was talking about, but they never really came to  life for me. I kind of got tired of trying to narrate it, so I thought,    I   m  going to shape it.    It took me a couple months to learn how to pull that  off, but whenever I learned how to do those shapes, it kind of brought in  a whole different aspect of building. From that time on, whenever I got  into the building part, I started finding myself a little bit more interested  in the building of an entire thing, though. You   d be able to look around  not just the front but the side and back, all around. It brought in a whole  different aesthetic excitement for me to build it like that.  So when you talk about narrative, you   re talking about a visual  narrative     Yes.     and when you   re talking about working those three dimensions, you   re  talking about pieces that actually are painted on every side?  Yes.  Oh, wow  Okay.  Yes.  Hopefully we   ll get to see one of those.  Yes, except for the back.  Except for the back, okay. In terms of making your own frames, you  taught yourself that, as well, I guess.  I had one demonstration, and then from the     Where at?  The University of Oklahoma. I was given one demonstration of how to  make a simple wooden frame. From there, I   ve learned a few different  ways to go about it.  You know, some artists would be like,    I don   t want to spend my time  doing that.    What   s the reward?  17  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Knowing that most people wouldn   t go through the time to do that, to  spend   . The way I feel is if a lot of artists get   they bring concerns  about other people copying their works. I   ve never felt that. If someone  was wanting to go through some of the loops that I go through to make  those things, I say,    Feel free, but it   s going to be a while before you get  there.    (Laughter)  Right  Good luck. (Laughter) Have you collaborated on any artwork  with other artist?  No, I haven   t been able to, up to this point.  I think I remember that your daughter was one of your models. Is that  right?  My niece was.  Your niece. Do you use live models when you do realistic portraits?  No, I just use photographs.  Do you do a lot of preliminary sketching?  No. I never really got into sketching too much. A lot of times, whenever  I get the urge to do something, it has to come out now, so I just get right  to it.  Do the fully finished drawing right away.  Yes. Every once in a while I   ll do one quick sketch, but other than that I  just go right into it and hope for the best. (Laughs)  How has your subject matter changed since you got your MFA?  The subject matter has been kind of along the same lines, but I   ve been  able to interpret it visually in a few different ways. I   ve been able to do  it more abstract. That   s been the trail I   ve been on for the past few years  is learning how to interpret it differently through symbols that might be  able to bring it to a different angle. I haven   t really done very many  portraits, though, since I graduated from OU. Yeah, the subject matter   s  been the same, but interpreting it visually has been kind of my main  focus lately.  What   s your favorite subject to explore when you   re painting?  I would have to say, let   s see, bloodline. Ever since I was a little kid,  18  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  I   ve always been interested in my bloodline. Of course, today many  people of my generation, especially here in Oklahoma, are pretty mixed  as far as our cultures go. My mom   s side is primarily Cheyenne, and my  dad   s side is Chumash, but he   s also part Spanish. Just researching more  about who I come from is always something that   s been able to keep my  interest because whenever I learn more about who I came from, it gives  me more motivation to share with my future generation, my daughters,  my nieces and nephews. That   s been my favorite thing to work with.  What kinds of research do you do?  I like to check out other artists. Of course, there   s the artists that are in  art history, but I like to check out what   s going on now. I get on as  many   I like to check out the contemporary galleries that are happening  in Tulsa and Oklahoma City.  You like to go to shows?  Yes, and then I like to check out what   s happening around the country.  A lot of it is, I   ve been able to find a whole lot on Facebook, artists that  like to put their pages up. I like to read their artist statements, read their  bios, see what kind of work they   re doing, and what works as far as how  they pull those three things together. Those are some of the ways that I  bring to my work, so I can bring those things together better for myself,  and, of course, researching their tribal backgrounds and how they  interpret it, as well.  But you don   t have your own website yet?  Not at this point. I need to. (Laughs)  How about your palette? How has that changed?  My palette is   as an undergraduate it was pretty much always just one  or two colors, three colors, four at the most. They never had that  sophistication of learning how to complement it, how to contrast it.  When I went through graduate school, that began to develop more  towards the very end, but over these past few years, I   ve been able to  focus on how those things work even better. My palette itself is I try not  to limit it to not only the simple things, but I try to pull in how those  things work together all around.  How important is humor in your work?  Lately, it   s been kind of serious. I want to bring some humor back into it  because the serious part can kind of feel like a drag not only to the  19  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  viewer but yourself sometimes. In time, I do want to bring in the humor.  Up to this point, it   s not very important. (Laughter)  Do you title your pieces?  Yes.  And how do you get your ideas for your titles? Does the image come  first and then the title?  Yes, a lot of my titles have been the secondary thing. As I mentioned  earlier, whenever I have an urge to get a visual out, it comes so fast that  my thoughts come second. That   s kind of been a challenge, too, because  if I   m invited to do a show and there   s a deadline, I pull the work out  and have all the work ready, but they say,    What   s your title?    I say,     Uh, hold on.    (Laughter) Yeah, it usually comes second. Usually, as I  mentioned, it takes time for me to sit with it for a little bit before it all  makes sense, and then the title comes.  How about your signature? Has that been difficult, to decide how to sign  pieces?  No, whenever I was an undergraduate, when I was doing my senior  exhibition I was talking to my grandma about it, and I said,    Did you  ever sign your work?    She goes,    Yeah. Everyone always knew me as  Mousetrail, so I used to put a P and make a little mouse design.    I said,     Oh, that sounds cool,    She said,    Your grandpas, they all do the same  with their work. Go check it out.    So I went to go check out my  grandpas   , how they did their signatures. My Cheyenne name is  Nahk  heameho which means    bear track,    so I decided to go with that. I  do an N that   s real big, and then the N turns into a bear track itself as I  put the E down.  I hope we get to see that in a minute. What is your creative process  beginning with how you get your ideas? Like sometimes people will  write things in a notebook, or they   ll just start working and something  will develop. What   s your typical process?  As I mentioned, I really don   t get too much into sketching. Sometimes it  comes out to that. For the most part, I like to keep some of my old works  around because whenever I get multiple works around, like if I have a  portrait next to me and I have another one of my abstract pieces next to  me, both of those things will kind of click together and bring about a  middle ground of what I might have missed in both of those pieces, and  they kind of feed off of each other.  20  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  So the new piece will be reflecting that middle ground.  Yes.  That   s interesting. You have a lot more years to go in your career, just  starting out here, but looking back from this moment, what   s been one  important fork in the road for you when you could   ve gone one way and  you decided to go this other way?  Whenever I was about to be done with school, one of my professors who  is an active, he   s pretty active in his art making and exhibits, he told me,  he said,    If this is what you want to do, just do it. Do everything you can  to not let anything sidetrack you from that. If you have to struggle for a  little bit, that   s what you   re going to have to work with, but just know  that it   ll come. It   ll start clicking off for you, and more opportunities will  come from it.    Whenever times get pretty hard I always think about that,  and, sure enough, things always open up.  What   s been the biggest highlight of your career so far?  At this point, I feel like everything   s still been more on the emerging  side of everything. I haven   t had the big awards or big fellowships yet,  but every award that I   ve gotten so far, like I   ve had the Outstanding  Young Artist Award in South Dakota, Jurors Choice Award from     At the Cherokee National?     yes, and the Fred Jones art collection. Those things, I see them all as  equal with one another because they give me motivation to push for  what   s bigger in the future.  What   s been a low point so far?  Let   s see. After I got done, whenever I decided to stay here in Oklahoma  City after I finished up the school year with Bacone, I had to re-reflect  on what I was going to do again because this time I didn   t have a  teaching position available. I didn   t have residency lined up, and it really  made me question,    What am I doing this for,    because at this point all  the advice that I had in school was before I became a father. Whenever it  looped back around and not have anything open, I had my daughter, and  I had to really think about,    Am I just doing this for me, or how am I  going to do this in a way that   s going to benefit my daughter?    That was  kind of a low point, but keeping back to that advice, it still has motivated  me to keep on this path until things work out.  Well, is there anything else you   d like to add or anything we didn   t cover  21  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  before we look at your work?  I believe that   s good until we go ahead and go through the work.  Okay, so you want to tell us about this fan and little turtle?  Yes, about two years ago, which was 2012, I had an uncle who likes to  go to the Native American Church meetings. I was just getting out of the  meeting that morning, and he heard that my daughter was just born. He  said,    Hey, I heard your daughter was born just a few weeks ago.    I said,     Yeah.    He said,    Hey, I got something for you. You know how to make  fan handles, or you know how to bead or anything?    I said,    No.    He  pulled out this red tail and said,    Here, learn. This is for your daughter.     (Laughter)  And you had never beaded a fan handle before?  No, I didn   t have any experience in beading at all. I thought that was a  great gesture, so it motivated me quite a bit to figure it out. It took me a  year and a half to figure everything out. This is my daughter   s first fan,  and it was the first fan I ever made. I wanted her to have something for  whenever she gets older if she wants to dance, she wants to go to the  meetings. It motivated me quite a bit to finish it the way it is. With our  kids, with our Cheyenne kids, my grandma always told me it   s very  important to make sure you get the last part of the umbilical cord that  comes off the baby, which is called the h  sta'he. She said,    Whenever  you get that, make sure that you keep it in a safe place. We usually put  the boys    in a lizard design, and we usually put the girls    into a turtle  design.    So whenever that came off, I decided,    If I   m going to learn  how to make a fan for her, I want to be able to learn how to make her  turtle for her, too, and I want those things to go together for when she  gets older.    That   s been the motivation and the story of how these things  came about.  Okay, Michael, you want to tell us about this painting?  This piece is titled The Widow   s Lair. The Widow   s Lair is  representational of the word v  'ho'e in Cheyenne which is interpreted for     spider    but was a word that we gave to the white Europeans as they  came into this country. It   s a recurring theme that goes in my work.  When I was younger, I did paintings to represent the v  'ho'e in literal  interpretations as in for portraits or whatever, but as I   ve been getting  older, I   ve been doing it more symbolically. The story itself stems off of  some things that my grandma used to tell me about the society that we  live in, that the Western European society that has developed into the  society that we live in today can be very unforgiving to Native people in  22  Little Thunder  Elizondo  Little Thunder  Elizondo  a lot of ways.  One thing how she used to explain it was if you were to get caught into a  lifestyle of alcoholism or if you get caught into a life of unhealthy  eating, such as diabetes, she has always explained that to me as being  caught into the spider   s web. She always tells me, she says,    Don   t allow  yourself to get caught in that spider   s web. Take care of yourself and be  aware of the things that don   t come from us that can harm us as a  people.    So for this piece, I used the symbol of a black widow, the red  diamonds that are on the black widow   s back. I tried to make the design  as simple as I could but to kind of bring it together in a way that brings  you towards the middle visually because that   s how easy it is to be  caught into the spiders web.  And there   s actually diamonds within diamonds. How about this  painting? What can you tell us about this?  This is also a recurring image that   s in my work. I   ve interpreted it  abstractly, but this is a literal interpretation of it. For us Cheyennes, it   s  known as the Noah  -vose Sacred Mountain in South Dakota, which is  located north of Rapid City. It   s known as Bear Butte. This place had  been a lot of influence on me culturally and through my art practices  because whenever I was younger, my grandma would always talk about  the design through beadwork. It always amazed me how many stories  have came from this location, not only about our history but about where  we   re going.  The first time I seen this mountain was whenever I was a teenager. We  came across it in the nighttime, and I just thought it was a very powerful  memory that I couldn   t see it in the daytime but seeing the silhouette and  how huge it was. It   s a memory that always sticks in my mind.  Whenever I do my contemporary works, as far as the subject matter that  that focuses on   I always have to reflect back on the stories that come  from this mountain to kind of see where about we   ve been as a people  and also reflect about these stories that come from our prophet Sweet  Medicine about where we   re going. Those things always help me come  to a more or less balanced approach of how I interpret where we   re at  today.  Thank you for sharing that, Michael. I appreciate your time today.  Yes.  -------  -------
