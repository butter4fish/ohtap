Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe; I'm interviewer for the HistoryMakers today.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is Sherman Beverly, Jr., S-H-E-R-M-A-N, B-E-V-E-R-L-Y, Jr.
Speaker 1: What is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born on August 3, 1927 in Port Arthur, Texas.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a retired educator.  I suppose you would call me, "professor."  I've been in education for almost as long as I can remember.  I've started every level of education.  I started back in 1951 in adult education in my hometown, Port Arthur, Texas and did that for about a year and a half, and then I came to Chicago [Illinois] in 1954--February 1954 and I swore I wouldn't teach again and I didn't for about three and a half years.  I drove a CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] bus for three and a half years.  And very interestingly a friend of mine from Texas visited me and was riding my bus reading the paper and saw where they needed teachers, and he said, "Man, you don't have any business driving this bus, you've got an education."  And the truth of the matter is most of the black drivers then were college trained and most of the whites were not you, know they had been there for a long time.  So I said, "I don't want to teach again."  You know something about me, I'm not lazy, but I get comfortable wherever I am.  I enjoyed driving the bus, I really did.  Of course, it wasn't as dangerous as it is today, but then, you know--but I really enjoyed driving the bus, got a lot of stories about that, too.
Speaker 1: But you got back to teaching, right?
Speaker 2: Right, I got back to teaching.
Speaker 1: And you retired from Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois]--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I retired from Northeastern [Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois] right.
Speaker 1: And what year was it that you retired?
Speaker 2: I retired in '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: Okay, I just want to establish what you did for a living.  And, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: What's today's date?
Speaker 1: Yes--
Speaker 2: It's August 25, 2003.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in Deerfield, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good, don't give your address, but you're home, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: In your home.
Speaker 2: That's right.

Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish questions, lightweight questions that just require a short answer, and the first one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food, dessert, or what?  I love pork chops. I love pork chops.
Speaker 1: Okay now, sir, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I really think brown and tan are my favorite colors, um-hm, though I wear a lot of black.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: A favorite time of the year, summer is my favorite time of year.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Destination?  I--we just love to travel; you know we go all over.  Now we do go to Florida every year during January, um-hm, on the beach, Treasure Island.
Speaker 1: Okay now do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "Yeah okay," that's--I use that quite a lot when I'm talking to somebody, "yeah okay," you know.  I don't know if that's what you're asking for but that's kind of what I do sometimes.
Story_ID: 186725
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask you about your mother, father and their sides of the family.  I'm going to ask about each one separately.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Katie Smart Beverly, K-A-T-I-E, S-M-A-R-T, B-E-V-E-R-L-Y.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, I wish you had--she was born in Morrow, Louisiana, M-O-R-R-O-W and she was born in 1890.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the date was October 31st.
Speaker 1: What do you know about your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Oh I know--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I can go back to my--I can only go back to my great grandfather, I think it is.  My grandmother and I were close, you know, and then I know about the great grandfather but not much more than that.
Speaker 1: Was he from Louisiana?
Speaker 2: They were all from Louisiana, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that were passed down about him or--?
Speaker 2: By him, no I can't remember--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Or about him or where his people came from, what circumstances--were they free or slaves or any of that information?
Speaker 2: I can't-no, I can't say anything about--this is my mother's side.  No, I don't--I can't speak to that.  Actually I only knew my grandmother and she was married to another man at the time, she wasn't married to my grandfather [Willie E. Smart], it was my step-grandfather, I guess.  But I don't know--her name was Armstead, Mattie Armstead [ph.], and I don't know much about the Armsteads.  Now my sister [Marie Yvonne Phillips] is doing the family reunion, I don't know if we can interrupt this for any reason, but she has--I can show you some stuff on that, you know.
Speaker 1: Well we rather just talk about the stories right now--
Speaker 2: No I can't give any stories about him.
Story_ID: 186726
Speaker 1: Well tell us about your grandmother.  What did you know about her?
Speaker 2: Well she lived in Morrow [Louisiana] when we were young, and she was a sharecropper.  She was married to her second husband, Mr. Moses was his name and, by the way, his name was Moses Armstead so, you know, the first husband was not Armstead.  As I said previously, but at any rate, they were sharecroppers, and we would go down there and we would visit them every year during the summer as kids.  My mother [Katie Smart Beverly] and I and my sister and brother [Harold L. Beverly] would go down there very year and visit them.  She was a tremendous cook.  One son lived with her, and I can remember chickens running around in the yard and all that sort of thing, and I can remember her cooking a great many meals.  I remember the church that we would go to every Sunday.  I can't remember the name of it, but we would get in the buggy because there were horses and buggies.  They--I used to-I would go down, I would race my cousins in picking cotton, you know.  I couldn't pick cotton, but they could, and so I would try to race with them.  I remember one time I got very, very sick--delirious--and my grandmother went out and got some bitter wheat tea.  Bitter wheat tea, I don't know what that tea was made of but it was bitter.
Speaker 1: Did she pick it herself or did she--
Speaker 2: She picked it herself and boiled it and gave it to me, and I was okay the next day, you know.  I don't know if it was the bitterness that made me get well, or if it had some medicinal value, but I think it had the medicinal value, you know.  That story I remember vividly.  I remember being from Port Arthur, Texas, a sort of industrial town, we were city people out there and I used to tip toe across the yard and across the lawn, you know, 'cause chickens were all around, and there was all kinds of mess throughout the area, and I would pick at my food.  You know, every little dark spot I would pick it and my grandmother said, "What's wrong with that boy, make him eat, Katie," that was my mother, you know.  And they would try like mad to make me just eat naturally as a youngster and I just--I couldn't do it.  I finally learned, you know, it wasn't long, I sup--I don't guess I did that that long, but I can remember that quite vividly.  My cousins were just running around and, you know, and just eating everything.  You know, those are some of the kinds of things I can remember about my grandmother.
Story_ID: 186727
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your mother [Katie Smart Beverly].
Speaker 2: My mother?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, What was your mother like and what did she do?
Speaker 2: My mother was a--well she was primarily a housewife.  I guess during Christmas--just before Christmas or some other holiday she would do some domestic work, you know.  You know, I, just very haphazardly she would go out.  Sometimes she would take washings and--but not on a regular basis.  She was primarily a housewife.  She was--she was kinda--she was accommodating, you know.  She didn't argue a lot, she didn't necessarily argue her point or her stance to a great extent.  She wasn't a weak woman because she had her way of getting what she wanted and what she needed without confrontation and all that kind of thing.  But she was kind and she really loved us, you know, my sister [Marie Yvonne Phillips], brother [Harold L. Beverly] and I.  I can remember a story, when we were in college, and we would come home for vacation and go to church and the pastor would recognize returning college students and have us stand up and say a word.  Well, one time he didn't recognize us, and she stood up after he had gone through the recognition ceremony, she stood up and said, "My children are here from college, you didn't recognize them," and we wanted to go through the floor, you know.  And so he said he was sorry. Well, she didn't let it go at that, you know, she went after him after church and said, "You always do this kind of thing."  So she was really protective of us and, you know, wanted us to be recognized, and all that sort of thing.  Her children were very important to her.  She sang in the choir.  You know, I was listening to some gospel music the other day and heard her favorite song, her solo 'In the Garden,' and I think about her every time, you know, that song is sung.  My father [Sherman Beverly, Sr.] ruled the house, you know, but she was always there to sort of intercede with her--you know, with him to ease up or to, you know, let us do some of the things we wanted to do.
Story_ID: 186728
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father [Sherman Beverly, Sr.].  Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Can I do what?
Speaker 1: Give us your father's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Sherman Beverly [Sr.], I think he started going by senior after I was born, right.  But that was his name.
Speaker 1: What is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born on July 26th in Morrow, Louisiana and he was born a year after my mother, 1891.
Speaker 1: Okay now what do you know about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: Now this is interesting, my sister [Marie Yvonne Phillips] who was doing the family tree, she started it with a white Beverly, that's all.
Speaker 1: You said your sister was making a family tree and she started out with a white Beverly-(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My sister--yeah on his background is a white Beverly and then Willis Beverly was his son and so--and Willis was my dad's--I may be getting this all mixed up--was my dad's father.  We've just gotten into trying to do the family tree and really came up with the first document for the first family reunion we had this year--last month.  So we're all learning more and more about our--but that was the grandfather there and I think Willis was probably the great-great-grandfather.  I knew some of Aunt Mary Ann-- she was for all practical purposes white.  She lived in Morrow.  Whenever we would go there, we would go to her house and sit and talk with her and all that kind of thing.  She had long, white hair so we knew there was some of that somewhere in the family.  But that's about what I know about my dad's family.  One of the things that we found out about my grandfather is that--my father has, I think, four sets of half brothers and sisters because his mother named Herbert, Herbert is spelled H-E-R-B-E-R-T, pronounced E'bear [ph.], she married and had children by four different men.  My father was the only one from her and Willie Beverly, yeah, and then she married some others and they are some first cousins of mine.
Story_ID: 186729
Speaker 1: So are there any stories from--well the--you're talking about Willis Beverly back in the 19th century, but are there any other stories from your family that passed down about your ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: I can talk about my father [Sherman Beverly, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how they got to [Morris] Louisiana in the first place, or were they always from there?
Speaker 2: I don't know how they got to Louisiana.  The Missouri Pacific [Railroad] ran through Morrow, Louisiana, and I don't know how they got to--all I know is--that's all I know.  Their origin was-you know, that they were in Morrow, Louisiana, that's what I know about them.
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Well tell us about your father.  What was he like and what did he do?
Speaker 2: My father from what I understand left home when he was very young and he was on his own, and he was a very independent guy, you know, throughout his life.  He struggled as a youngster.  I think my father got to tenth grade, my mother [Katie Smart Beverly] only went to sixth grade, but tenth grade.  When he was about--when he was in his early twenties, he and a friend left Morrow on their way to California and they stopped in Port Arthur [Texas].  They were standing on the corner in Port Arthur--the corner of Seventh Street and Texas Avenue-- and a man--a white guy drove by in a pickup truck and asked them if they wanted to work, and, of course, that's why they were going to California to get some work and so they said, "Yes."  My father's friend said no he was going to California, my father said, "Yes," he wanted some work, and he started once he drove him out to Gulf [Oil] refinery.  My father worked at the Gulf refinery for fifty some-odd years until he retired, and that's what he was doing all through my life, working at the Gulf refinery as a laborer.  He never--that's all--that's what blacks were designated, as laborers.  Now he did painting--he was a painter's helper and actually did some of the painting.  He worked a bit with chemicals, you know, because the refinery had all these chemicals.  He worked a bit with chemicals, but he was a laborer when he retired, and he stayed there.  Now he was also a barber, and what my father did, he would come home after leaving the Gulf Refinery, take a quick bath, mama would have dinner ready for us.  We would all sit down and eat, and then he would get on his bike and ride to the barbershop.  He rode his bike to the refinery, too.  That bike was his mode of transportation, and he would go to the barbershop and he would cut hair until nine or ten o'clock that night.  And he would very, very often pick up a watermelon and bring it home, or a quart of ice cream and bring it home for us.  He didn't show a lot of emotions and reach out and love--what we call--all that touchy-feely kind of thing, but he took care of us.  There was never any question about whether we were going to college or not.  I mean, that just didn't--that just wasn't--we knew we were going, it was a given we were going to go to college.  Where that drive to send us to college came from, I don't know, but it was there, and it just wasn't a question, and we did, you know. Two jobs: the Gulf and barber.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother and father met, do they have a story?
Speaker 2: No, I've never heard it, we need my sister and my brother here; the three of us could probably--I do know that when he left to go to California, he stayed--I hope I'm getting it straight--he stayed here about a year and went back to Morrow and married my mother and then came back here--I don't mean he stayed here, he stayed in Port Arthur for about a year, and then he came back after he married her and spent another year, I think, in Port Arthur before he sent for her.  He sent for her and they were together until he died first and-no, I'm sorry, she died first and then he died a couple of years later, um-hm.  But I know that story, you know, that--and they were together throughout the [Great] Depression and all that stuff.
Story_ID: 186730
Speaker 1: Can you tell us-- what was your first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My first childhood memory, I think--I don't know if it was my first but I can remember for some reason I didn't think--I was the middle child, and I didn't think I was the favorite child, and I just thought that my brother [Harold L. Beverly] got away with everything.  I remember one time he broke a toy of mine, this might have been during Christmas, and I thought he had done it on purpose, you know, and that bothered me, you know.  And I told mama [Katie Smart Beverly] and them about it, and they didn't do that much about it.  But I always thought my brother broke that toy on purpose.  Now why I thought that, I don't know but I guess it's that middle child syndrome.  If you want a significant memory that-- sticks with me, we used to buy sunhats every year; we would get a sun hat.  Mama would take us downtown to get a sunhat. Now in Port Arthur [Texas] we lived on the west side, that's where black folks lived, and to get downtown we had to cross the tracks and then we had to pass through--by pawn shops and all that kind of thing, which we really did not particularly relish going that way.  But one time my mother stopped at one, and we saw some sunhats as children did, and we wanted to go in and try them on. Well, none of the sunhats, after we got in, none of them fit, and we didn't want them, and so my mother said, "No," and the man was continuously trying to sell her a sunhat and said, "This is good."  So she said, "No" and fought her way out and he said something about--well, "Get out of here, you son of a bitch," you know.  And I can remember, you know, trying to pull away from my mother, I don't know if I was going to kick him on the shin, or what.  But she pulled me out, and she said, "He wasn't talking to me, he said son of a bitch--I'm a lady."
Story_ID: 187057
Speaker 1: You know, my mother [Katie Smart Beverly] said, "He wasn't talking to me, I'm a lady."  Well, it does something to a young fellow--I think I may have been about seven or eight--it does something to know that his mother is--to know that the man was talking to her, and yet she is telling me that he wasn't, you know, and I know that it's not true that she doesn't believe that, and, you know, that kind of confuses a young fellow.  Now, in retrospect, and it didn't take me long to realize what she was doing--you know, she was protecting me, and also her own dignity, you know, but that's one of the first memories I have about being directly confronted with, you know, that kind of attitude--that kind of racist attitude.
Story_ID: 187058
Speaker 1: What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Some of the sights and sounds and smells of Port Arthur [Texas]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and did you all live in town or were you outside of Port Arthur?
Speaker 2: No we lived in town; we lived across on the west side, as I said.  Port Arthur is an international seaport, so we had ships coming in from all over the world for oil, and grain, and coal and that kind of thing.  There were about seven refineries from--around Port Arthur.  The Texaco and Gulf [Oil] -- the Texaco was the closest to the city, Gulf was the next one.  They were the biggest ones, so the smell--the stench was terrible.  We sometimes think that those fumes contributed to many of the illnesses that people who worked out there later got--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So Port Arthur is very hot, too, year-round?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a hot town.  There was a fishery, this fishery was about twenty seven miles from the city near what is called Sabine Pass [Texas], and the boats would come in, and they would-- cure the fish and sometimes make whatever they make out of the fish, and when they-- when the boats would come in and they would start working on those fish, man the smell was something.  Do you know about the meat packing plants in Chicago [Illinois]? Well, that was the way it would be in Port Arthur, and you'd get those smells sometimes-- but, like in Chicago, you get used to it accept that it would--you know what the smell was.  No, you wouldn't get used to it, you would always smell it, but you would get more tolerant of it.  There was nothing you could do about it anyway.  Then, you know, Port Arthur had a lot of mosquitoes, so you had to spray, you know, the mosquitoes and that kind of thing, and so that was another one of the smells.  Those two smells dominated the scene, though.
Speaker 1: Was Port Arthur uncomfortable place to live with the heat and the smell and the mosquitoes (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No it was--that's what it sounds like, no Port Arthur wasn't uncomfortable to live in.  We really--listen we have Port Arthur reunions every year in different parts of the country.  We hosted it here in Chicago in 1995, and so people were close.  We had only one high school there, [Abraham] Lincoln [High School later, Memorial High School, Port Arthur, Texas]--no one school.  We went--I went to school from first grade all the way up through twelfth grade at Lincoln High School, and so we all knew each other.  We were a black community, for the most part self-sufficient, you know, except when you had to go down and get the store-bought clothes and all that sort of thing, and people had money because it was an industrial town.  We called it "little New York" because a whole bunch of things happened.  We had night clubs; we had all this kind of thing in Port Arthur.  No, it wasn't uncomfortable to live in Port Arthur.  The weather was hot, you got the smell but, hell, everybody thought--we thought every city has its smells, and of course it did.  You go out in the country, you're going to smell cow manure and all that kind of stuff, you know, and I would rather be in the city as a kid than in the country putting up with all that kind of thing.  So it's a tradeoff, I guess; you know, it wasn't uncomfortable.
Story_ID: 187059
Speaker 1: What did you like to do when you were a little boy?  What kind of things did you like?
Speaker 2: Well we finally got bicycles, and we would ride the bikes.  The most vivid well not--I keep saying the most--I've written sort of extensively and going to write some more about my godfather, and I can call his name, Willie Hollier [ph.] was his name.  My godfather was one of the best and kindest person I know.  Now, he had a plot of land--no, he didn't own the plot of land.  He lived about a block and a half from the Texaco refinery, some of the tanks out there, not the refinery itself, but the storage tanks. And next to that was about a block and a half, I guess, between the street he lived on and the tanks, and he used to cultivate that strip of land.  Man, I can remember he raised corn, he raised sweet potatoes, peanuts-- you name it. It was a little farm out there, and my brother and I used to bike to his house and we grew all that stuff and ate it, you know, and I remember that.  I learned so much from him.  He was a [United States Boy] Scout--he started the first black Scout troop in Port Arthur [Texas].  He was an excellent cook and we could go--my brother and I always said, if we ever ran away from home, we were going to run to pere [ph.], that's what we called him, pere.  I don't--someone told--I found out a while back that pere comes from the French, it means something about dad or something.  But we--I remember that vividly about my godfather.  Port Arthur had a tremendous high school football team.  Now it was tremendous because Port Arthur would not join--we [Abraham Lincoln High School, later Memorial High School, Port Arthur, Texas] were called the Bumblebees.  The white school, Thomas Jefferson [High School, later Memorial High School, Port Arthur, Texas] was the Yellow Jackets but we were called the Bumblebees.  The Bumblebees went thirteen years undefeated (laughter), but there's a reason for it.  We didn't join a conference, so we had guys who were not in school who were out there working and everything.  They would come back for football season and play football, you know, not all of them.  We--Professor Sampson [ph.], our principal, didn't want to lose.  We had a great coach, Bowie [ph.] was his name, and--but we didn't lose a game.  We loved to go to football games.  Football even today in Texas is the thing, that is the thing, you know, and it was back then.  It was the only game in town.  We didn't play a lot of basketball; we played baseball, but not as a team sport in school.  Baseball was a neighborhood thing, and-- we played that, but we all played football and went to the games. And when I go to visit now during football season, people still go to those football games.  That was another thing we really enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: So the players would--they would just be recycled again after their term ran out? (laughter) They'd bring 'em back?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--sure they would but there were always young ones coming up.  It was a mixture, but these guys played, you know.
Speaker 1: (laughter) Was that a common practice of the South?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know, we were not in the conference, and so we didn't necessarily--we would play the three Houston teams and the--but we would also play teams from Oklahoma and places like that.  I don't know how common it was, I do know that when the war came, and a lot of the guys -- you know, the older guys were leaving and going--were being drafted, and we younger guys were there, and we wanted to play some football and--because the principal thought that we would be losers, he eliminated football.  So in high school, I didn't play football because--we had rag teams and that kind of thing but we didn't play competitive football.  We did play tennis.  Now that's--that was unheard of then.  I don't know why, but our school--we had two tennis courts, and we took up tennis and my brother and I have been playing tennis since we were about fourteen, fifteen or sixteen years old, and became quite good at it.  We were, you know, we were the only black high school around there that had tennis courts.
Story_ID: 187060
Speaker 1: What were your favorite subjects in grade school [Abraham Lincoln High School, Port Arthur, Texas] and who were your favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: In grade school.  I think my favorite teacher was a lady named Ms. Edgar [ph.] in grade school.  I was in Ms. Robinson's [ph.] too but I think Ms. Edgar was my favorite teacher.  She was a neighbor of ours too.  She lived in the same community well all of us did.
Speaker 1: What did she teach?
Speaker 2: Well she taught--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: She taught all the subjects?
Speaker 2: Right, right and she was kind, and I was her pet, you know, I think and she was my favorite teacher in the grade school, right.
Speaker 1: What were your favorite subjects in grade school?
Speaker 2: My favorite subjects in grade school?  And now you're talking about--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Throughout, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah my favorite subject has--it was history and English, I think.  Those are the ones--I've always-- I can't remember when I didn't love to read, and I've been reading--my sister [Marie Yvonne Phillips] started by reading the comics to us and I think my mother [Katie Smart Beverly] read them to her and she read them to us, and I've been reading all my life.  So, it was English and history have--were my favorite subjects--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay--
Story_ID: 187061
Speaker 1: Did you have a lot of music around the house when you were growing up?  Did you have a radio?
Speaker 2: Okay, we didn't at first, you know.  You've heard the story where everybody would go to one house to listen to Joe Louis' fights and all that.  Well that was, that was the case, one person would have a radio but we didn't have it at the house.  I can remember our first radio, I don't know the age that we got it, but it was for Christmas and my father [Sherman Beverly, Sr.], you know, bought the radio for the family for Christmas, and it was delivered and set up before he got home. And so we turned it on, and we heard a big (makes clapping sounds) and all that kind of thing and we turned it off, you know (laugh) and we were afraid to turn it on, and that's my mother [Katie Smart Beverly]--that's all of us.  So when he got home, and he turned it on, we said, "That's the sound," he said, "That's just the audience applauding," it wasn't static or anything of that sort; it was them applauding.  So that was our experience with the first radio.  It was a Philco, I remember that.  Now he had--he knew radios because there was a radio at the barbershop, you know, and that kind of thing.  But we as a family did not have it, and we were quite--you know, we weren't babies when we got it, we were up there.  Same with the phone, we didn't get a phone until we were, you know, older in school.  It may have been high school before we got a phone, or maybe later than that, I'm not sure, um-hm.  We got a record player, too, you know, eventually.  This was when we got older and had all these '78s and that kind of thing and when we left home--when I went to the [U.S.] Army and came back, my mother had thrown all of our records away.  We said, "How could you?"  She said, "Nobody was around here playing them," and I said, "But they were--"-- she had gotten rid of them, and so all those are gone and we couldn't--really, really couldn't play--they were very Christian.  My father was very Christian, my mother too but she wasn't as--she was a little looser, that's a terrible word.  She wasn't as strict, I don't think.  Her belief was as strong but she was looser with it.  My father was stern and that kind of thing but we couldn't play some of our music when dad was around, you know.
Speaker 1: What did he find offensive about the music?
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't, it wasn't Christian, you know, it was Lucky Miller, and it was the devil's -- music, you know.  My father--we couldn't play tennis on Sunday, he didn't want us to play tennis on Sunday.  My father played baseball on Sundays when we were little (laughter), then when we got older, you know, playing on Sunday, you know, was a sin but we found ways to play, anyway.

Speaker 1: Was church a big part of your life? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultanoeus) Now where were we? Oh church was a big part of our--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Rock Island Baptist Church [Port Arthur, Texas], all three of us [Beverly Sherman, Marie Yvonne Phillips, Harold L. Beverly] were baptized at Rock Island Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Why did they call it Rock Island, do you have any idea?  Was it on Rock Island land or something or (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I don't know, Rock Island this is the rock that--who was it who built his church--Paul?
Speaker 1: Peter--
Speaker 2: Peter built his church on the rocks so this was Rock Island.  I'm speculating but I suspect that's where the name originated from.  I've--I wrote something for--about the church and its role in our lives.  I wrote something about a Sunday at church, what it was like, you know, for the family reunion the other day.  You want to know a little more about the church?
Speaker 1: What did you write about it, what's the essence of what you wrote?
Speaker 2: Well, I wrote first about Sunday, it began Saturday night.  Men, back then, you know, really--I mean shoes you could almost shave from your shoes.  So, my brother and I--our job on Saturday night was to get all the shoes in the house, you know, shined and ready to go to church, and so that was one of our jobs, and then the next was to--my mother would lay our clothes out to go to church so we would be ready to get dressed, and then we would bathe and then Sunday morning we would get up and have a big breakfast, and we would dress after breakfast because we couldn't mess up our clothes, you know.  Then we would go to Sunday school.  That was nine o'clock, I suppose.  My father [Sherman Beverly, Sr.] would go to Sunday school, and he taught the men's class, and we would go to the children's class.  My mother [Katie Smart Beverly] didn't go to Sunday school.  And then we would stay for church at a eleven o'clock service.  And, very often we had a three o'clock service.  Now if there was a three o'clock--our pastor lived in Beaumont, Texas, which was about seventeen miles from Port Arthur [Texas], so he would come there every week and between services, he would stay with one of the members at one of the member's house, and eat and do all that sort of thing. And our house sometimes where he would--we hated it because (laughter) you know, he would come and sometimes they would be visiting ministers, and they would come, and they would get all the best of the chicken, or whatever, you know, was for dinner.  Well, you've heard that story a bunch of times, too, I'm sure.  And then (laughter) and then after-- evening service--after that afternoon service, which was a special service, and I guess we'd have an afternoon service once or twice a month, then we would have BYPU [Baptist Young Peoples Union]--
Story_ID: 187063
Speaker 1: That [Baptist Young Peoples Union] was, you know--and then there was evening service.  Now, so we would spend first Sunday when there was communion--we would spend, you know, all day there and then--one Sunday there was testifying where people got up and sang and then testified about how good God had been to them.  But one of the things I wrote about it, was that we money to put in church.  Well, there was a store across from the church, you know, and so between Sunday school and church we would go over and buy gum.  The store would open just at that time (laughter), and all the kids would go over there and buy some stuff, chewing gum, or candy, or what have you and eat it between service.  We sat on the second row at church.  We--sat on that second row with our parents until we were college--in college and once we got in college, I guess, we kind of rebelled and we sat in the back with the rest of the kids.  You know, everybody else was sitting back there where--it wasn't the children's section, but that's where they would sit, and you know how children would do.  But we sat right up front with our parents.  Now, listen, going to church was a habit, and we were really felt it.  You know, I mean, we weren't just there, we really--you could feel the spirit or whatever in the church and you got something--we got something out of it.  My father was a deacon, my mother was a--in the choir, but we still sat on the second bench wherever they were, and it was just a part of--life.  I think it was that kind of--it might have been that kind of a routine, that sort of caused us to kind of stray away from it later on in life.
Speaker 2: It was too intense at that time or something?
Speaker 1: I think so, um-hm. And I can remember when I was in college [Bishop College, Marshall, Texas] coming back home, and I can remember my dad [Sherman Beverly, Sr.] asking me to teach the men's Sunday school class. And, by the way, we used to have children's day at the church and some of us would talk and preach and sing. It was children's day, and so my dad would ask me to teach the Sunday school class. And the verse was, "Honor thy father and thy mother so their days may be long," and so I raised a question with the group, "Suppose your father and mother are not honorable," you know, "to be honored" (laughter).  I never taught the class again, you know.  My father said, "What were you talking about, boy?"  I said, "Well--there are some mean fathers and mothers"--
Story_ID: 186738
Speaker 1: I would lose half of my students after the first session, because I say, "We create our gods in our image, we create our gods, and then have that God we created like everything we do," and so people would say, "Dr. Beverly, I know you--you're right that's true but I'm just not ready to challenge that or to go into all of that and they would drop out and it's okay with me.  It wasn't angry or rancor or anything of that sort, it's just that they weren't ready to wrestle with those kinds of questions.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the idea of questioning religion frightens people, basically.
Speaker 1: I think it does. I think it does. It shakes their whole foundation.  They have grown up with it, they believe it and it's not just Baptist.  Catholicism has messed up so many particularly white women because I've had classes where we've discussed--telling them how many kids--all this kind of thing.  And of course we see it's messed up a lot of young men.  We're learning that recently because that's not new either.
Speaker 2: How did that make you feel as a youth having those kinds of thoughts in the church?  Did it make you feel isolated--or did you have allies who felt the same way-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh the kids were--you see one of the--
Speaker 2: The kids are skeptical (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well yeah, I mean they were just there; they were accepting it and listening all that sort of thing.  It was sitting back in the church having a good time, laughing, whispering and I'm up there with my mother-- That's what made me feel isolated (laughter) not the thought and ideology and all of this sort of thing.  What has happened to most of my friends, though, is that they kind of--they have grown much more fervent about it than some of their parents were.  Now, in their adulthood, I go back home, and my friends in the choir-- they're serious, and they are talking about God and Christianity and all that sort of thing, continuously.  That's most of them, they're deacons in the church and all this sort of thing.  But then, that's not unlike me, either, when I came back--when I came to Chicago [Illinois], and when I got married and had children we wanted our kids to have some kind of religion, you know.  My wife [Eve Beverly] was Catholic when we married, I was Baptist, which says something about how we felt about religion, too, I guess.  I was Baptist, and so we compromised and became Lutherans, you know (laughter)--I won't say any more about that. We became Lutherans, Missouri Synod at that, and--but it was a black church, and that became--interesting.  So now we don't even--the wife and I don't--attend except special occasions sometimes, you know. We love gospel singing, and we have some records, and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 186739
Speaker 1: When you went--you were in the same school, [Abraham] Lincoln [High School later, Memorial High School, Port Arthur, Texas] right?  How many high school students were there when you started high school?
Speaker 2: Well every black kid in the city--no, we had a catholic school across the street from--St. Mary's Catholic School [Port Arthur, Texas] so some kids went there.  I suppose--when I graduated--my graduation class, I think I have a picture of it here somewhere, my graduation class only had thirty-some-odd kids in it, but that was, that was during the war [World War II, WWII] and all that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: There were a lot of drop outs, people drafted, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--there were only seven boys; we called ourselves the magnificent seven, you know. Right, and even the girls, we only had a few girls.  I don't understand that, really. But we-- it wasn't a big school.  It was a big school, but it encompassed every--all grade levels, and like you say a lot of the--a lot of our classmates did drop out and go to work and things of that sort, right.  And then the boys went to the [U.S.] military. Girls stayed in and they became teachers.  Most of the men were, you know--even the teachers were marrying laborers, [U.S.] postal workers-- things of that sort, right, um-hm.
Story_ID: 186740
Speaker 1: What kinds of activities were you involved in, in high school [Abraham Lincoln High School, Port Arthur, Texas]?  Did you try to play football in high school yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but my mother [Katie Smart Beverly] came out there the one-- the day I went out to play football and grabbed us-- grabbed me and said, "You're not going to play ball."  I said, "Mama, but--", she said, "No, you're not going to play any football."  It wasn't organized ball. They had--the school had allowed us to use some of the-- uniforms,  and we would just coming up with a little ragtime team and we were going to try to get some games with some of the other schools, but--
Speaker 1: That's right, because they used all the old time--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right my mother didn't--wouldn't have football for us.  I went to college and then went out for the team,  but I was only practice material by then,  right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What other activities in high school?
Speaker 2: I sang; I was in the choir, and in the traveling choir.  We would even go up to Thomas Jefferson High School [later, Memorial High School, Port Arthur, Texas] and sing for them,  and--yeah we would sing for them--
Speaker 1: That's the white high school?
Speaker 2: That's the white high school, yeah (laughter).  That was one of the activities.  We formed a little quartet, too.  I guess kids have been,  forming these little quartets.  We called ourselves The Lincolnaires [ph.]. That was after--what was the name of the--The Southernaires.  Do you remember the--you've heard of--? Yeah, well we called ourselves The Lincolnaires, and we were pretty good, and we sang sometimes like the Ink Spots, and we even sang in the theater from time-to-time.  My dad [Sherman Beverly, Sr.]--we didn't attend--we didn't go to the movies, except when [Joseph] Joe Louis [Barrow] had fought, and they would have the replay of that--
Speaker 1: Newsreel (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Newsreel, and Bojangles' [Famous Chicken 'n Biscuits] was,  at the theater, what have you.  But we didn't see many movies; I think that's why I'm a movie buff now; I still love movies.  But that was-- we went on--  we had picnics; we had a lot of family gatherings.  I had an uncle who lived in Beaumont [Texas]--I guess you're talking about--you talking about as we were younger or are you talking about school activities?
Speaker 1: I'm talking about high school, you know as you, as you were getting ready to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I sang in every-- choir there was.  The small octet, I was tenor and did a lot of singing.  What else did we-- I can remember a play. I guess we had several plays, but I can remember one play where I was--I can't remember the title of it, but I was the male star, and a-- girl I really liked was the female star, so that was fun (laughter).  What else did we do?  They had--there were assemblies,  during the school year and we would have to--all the students would have to do something, perform or do something.  I would recite poetry, Paul Laurence Dunbar primarily, and those were some of the kinds of things we did.  We did experiments--science experiments.  That was a part of the class, but, those were some of the--everybody took manual arts.  So we made--we,  my mother had a whatnot and a coffee table that I had built-- until we were adults.  It was right there in the living room, a coffee table.  You know what whatnots are? Yeah. She would have them-that was the easiest thing to make and we all made them and had several of them around the house.  Those were the kinds of things we did.  The school had a big picnic every year and we would get on the train and go to the picnic grounds.  It wasn't but fifteen or twenty miles from where we--  from the city but we would go out there and play for four or five hours and eat and all that sort of thing, and then go back in the afternoon and go home.
Speaker 1: Now when you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We played a lot of ball, intramural softball, baseball and that kind of thing.  On the playgrounds we shot marbles, shot a lot of marbles, you know.  I had boxes of marbles that we would win.  We would spend--you see you've got me talking--we would spin tops, and we would compete in the tops.  We'd--draw a circle and you would spin the first one, I guess, I don't remember how we started the game.  Somebody would spin first and then somebody second and we would try to knock that top out of the circle,  and go on and win like that.
Story_ID: 186741
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers in high school [Abraham Lincoln High School, Port Arthur, Texas] that influenced you?
Speaker 2: Who were some of the teachers?  You want names, is that what you want?
Speaker 1: Yep--
Speaker 2: I can remember Mr. Alton [ph.].  I wrote a little story about Mr. Alton.  He was the manual arts teacher, and he was a serious man and he had to have a-- assembly, too.  He had to organize an assembly.  I can remember the assembly--one assembly he organized where the man was standing up there crying, and he was saying we're the only people on the earth without a flag,  and without a country.  I can remember that as if it was today.  He was very, very serious about that. And--
Speaker 1: Was this man a part of the Universal Negro Improvement Association [UNIA], Marcus Garvey--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaenous) You know I don't know that--
Speaker 1: It sounds like what they might say (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It sounds like what they might--
Speaker 1: Garvey's presentation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah and this was--I was born in '27 [1927].  I was in high school at that time, so that was in the early '30s [1930s], the late '30s [1930s] or something, but--
Speaker 1: It could have been at UNIA or something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He had certainly heard of Garvey, I know that.  But I recall that, and it had to have made an impression on me because I didn't forget.  Because our school had Paul Laurence Dunbar, Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver and [President] Abraham Lincoln, you know.  That's why we were named Abraham Lincoln High School.  Phillis Wheatley's picture was up there, so we learned about what was known,  about black history during that time.  I don't remember us talking about Garvey,  which makes sense.  I don't even remember us talking about [W. E. B.] Dubois way back there.  We had ['The Story of] Little Black Sambo' [Helen Bannerman] in the reader, but I can remember Mr. Alton during that.
Story_ID: 186742
Speaker 1: Now he married Ms. Street [ph.] who was a chemistry teacher.  She knew that chemistry, and she was very firm and that kind of thing, and I can remember one of my friends, Heywood Gordon [ph.], he was a smart mouth, you know he-- Our class was one of the favorite classes there, but we were trouble.  We were the only boys around there weren't many boys around there at that time.  Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The seven of you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Say what?
Speaker 2: The seven of you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah and we called ourselves the magnificent seven so,  we, as mothers would say, we were smelling ourselves.  But at any rate, Heywood was doing a--an experiment there with some kind of explosives or what have you,  gunpowder or whatever it was.  And I guess he put too much or something (laughter) in there, and Heywood and Ms. Street, she became Mrs. Alton, but Heywood and Ms. Street used to always go back and forth.  He was a smart--he was the brightest kid in the class.  I mean he was the absolute wiz, and so that thing exploded and Heywood went--he took off down the hall, and all this sort of thing and came back to school with a butcher knife after lunch and he said he was going to kill her.  We said, "Heywood, you're kidding."  We talked him out of it.  He thought she had purposely tried to kill him, but--and we talked him out of it.  She didn't try to kill Heywood, but that's what he thought because he knows he had driven her up the wall in some cases.
Speaker 2: Oh so she prepared his experiment?
Speaker 1: Say what?
Speaker 2: She prepared his experiment for him (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Well she was certainly overseeing it and telling him what to do and how much of this and how much of that and all that sort of thing, you know.  So if she had seen danger, I'm sure she would have stopped him,  and he claims,  she let him go on and do it.  I wrote another story about they called me "poot butt" for a while in school.  I was in Mr. Ellis' class, he was another strict guy, his algebra and no noise, no talking in there.  So I had to sneeze, and I was stifling this sneeze.
Speaker 2: So you were trying to stifle a sneeze.
Speaker 1: I was stifling a sneeze but it had to come out somewhere.  So it came out in-- behind and it was loud and so Mr. Ellis--and of course I'm looking at the chair,  and the desk, and Mr. Ellis turned around and was looking out the window and just shaking, he was laughing.  Well everybody knew he was laughing and so they started--the class started snickering, too,  and so Ellis turned around as if he was angry and they stopped--then he asked me, "Sherman, do you have to step out for awhile?"  I said, "No, for what?"  and so he turned around and started laughing again.  I had about three fights that day, people calling me "poot butt" and after awhile I say, Well, I can't fight everybody.  So it lasted a week or so and then we found somebody else to jump on, you know.  But the story as written is funnier than my telling it,  but it's-- I remember Mr. Ellis, and he was a nice guy--
Story_ID: 186743
Speaker 1: Now when you were on the verge of graduation from high school [Abraham Lincoln High School, Port Arthur, Texas], what did you-- did you have a firm idea of what you wanted to be?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be--I actually wanted to be an airline pilot,  but that was--I could forget that. And I wanted to be a lawyer, and one of my favorite teachers is the one who planted that idea to my mind because--she was an English teacher, Ms. Porter--Eva Porter [ph.].  She--I must have given her a paper or written something for her or something and she said, "Sherman you would make a good lawyer, you would make a good lawyer," and she says, "you ought to go to the University of Wisconsin [Madison, Wisconsin]."  You see, people really they--going to college wasn't the issue, they knew you were going to go to college, and that stuck with me.  I really felt good about that; I think I may have felt good about her telling me that and saying it than believing that it would actually happen and my folk were not-- they saw lawyers as what they are shysters and that kind of thing (laughter), you know.  So they weren't about to pay for me to become a lawyer, you know.  So I really wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do when I went to college [Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas].
Story_ID: 186744
Speaker 1: Now how did you choose Bishop College [Marshall, Texas]?
Speaker 2: I didn't, I went to Prairie View [Normal and Industrial College later, Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] first.  I went to Prairie View first and interesting--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Prairie View is in Texas?
Speaker 2: Prairie View is in Texas.
Speaker 1: Prairie View A&M.
Speaker 2: Prairie View University, now.  It was Prairie View AM&N at that time.
Speaker 1: AM&N?
Speaker 2: AM&N--agriculture, mechanical and normal, I guess, because that was teaching.  I went to Prairie View--I-- graduated [from high school] in January '45 [1945], that's when I finished school.  I didn't get my degree until June [1945] because they didn't have midterm graduations and went straight to Prairie View; in February I was in school at Prairie View.  The first semester there I made the honor roll, the dean's list, the second I discovered girls and,  unlike most kids where the first semester is the one where they blow, well I blew the second one and,  was threatened with being kicked out or what have you.  So I--the third semester I made the dean's list again which was an indication I could do it when I put my mind to it and made up my mind to do it. And then my mother called me and wrote me-yeah, she called and said that I had a draft letter and I said, "Okay."  I didn't go home and she kept telling me, and I said, "Okay I'll be home for Christmas."  So when I got home for the holidays, I went down to the draft board and said, "I understand you've been looking for me."  They said, "What's your name," and I told them who I was, and they said, "Yes, where have you been?"  I said, "I was in school; I just came here to find out if there is any need of my going back to school after the holidays."  They said, "No, you're going right to the service; the first thing: smoking," those were their words.  I said, "Where," they said I was going to Fort Benning, Georgia.  I walked out of there and went down to the [U.S.] Army Air Force[s] [USAAF] recruiting station and volunteered for the Army Air Force.  My wife [Eve Beverly] as I told her that story she said, "Well,"  "on the record you would be a volunteer."  I said, (laughter) "That is true, but anybody that knows me, I wouldn't volunteer for the service," but that's exactly how the record shows, which says something about historiography, too--true history and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: That's right, you're actually going down in history on the record as someone who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As a volunteer--
Speaker 1: Someone who took the initiative rather than as someone who had to be forced into it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, I would go down in history as a volunteer, (laughter) I'm glad we're having HistoryMakers so that we can get that straight, you know. Actually, I did volunteer, and I stayed eighteen months, only eighteen months.  This was in '46 [1946] when I went in and I got out in 1947 after spending eighteen months.  But-- and it was in the Army Air Force, there was no independent [U.S.] Air Force at that time.
Story_ID: 186745
Speaker 1: Where did they station you in the Army Air Corps [sic, Forces]?
Speaker 2: In San Antonio [Texas], I was in San Antonio for about twelve months--a year and then one day I went into the headquarters office and I saw that they were looking for volunteers to go to the Philippines, and I volunteered to go to the Philippines, and I spent about six months in the Philippines, and then came home and was discharged, right.  That army career was interesting, too, but back to when I came back from the military.  I went back to Prairie View [Normal and Industrial College later, Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] for another semester, and then I just decided to drop out of school because, like I said, I didn't know what I wanted to do and there was money to be made in Port Arthur [Texas].  And so I dropped out for about--just one semester, and then some of my friends--friends have made a big difference in my life, you know.  I told you about the friend who said (unclear).  Well this time some of my friends came by the house to say goodbye to me.  They were going off to school in September, and I know my mother told them to drag him out with you, and they came and they said, "Man, you ought to be going back to school."  They were going to Bishop [College, Marshall, Texas]--"you ought to be going back to school."  "I don't want to go to school" and they said, "Yeah, come on, you're going," and so I got up and packed and went to Bishop, and that's where I graduated from.
Story_ID: 184819
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers at Bishop [College, Marshall, Texas]--now, you were at Prairie View [Industrial Normal College, Prairie View, Texas] previously but you end up at Bishop after the war--so who were some of the teachers at Bishop that made an impression on you?
Speaker 2: I remember Chambers [ph.], a young woman teacher who taught humanities.  I remember a minister who taught religion, Porter [ph.] was his name--Reverend Porter taught religion down there.  I guess it was the bible he taught rather than just religion.   Right off the bat those are the only two that I remember from Bishop.
Speaker 1: Okay now what degree did you graduate with?
Speaker 2: History and political science.
Speaker 1: So did you--start teaching at high school right away or sometime afterwards?
Speaker 2: I went back home [Port Arthur, Texas], and I didn't start teaching at high school immediately, in fact I never taught at high school down there.  I substituted one day in high school in Port Arthur.  I did teach, like I said, adult school for two and a half years right after I got out of college.  And--then I decided to leave Texas--leave home.  I really--I'm not sure I would have ever developed into a mature human being, a man staying at home, you know.  I was working, I was making pretty good money, but I was at home, I was also wasting it,  and--because I had a bed to sleep in and that kind of thing.  I don't--I'm not even sure if I would have survived if I had stayed home.  My mother was--had mixed emotions about my leaving when I left, you know. But--I left.  My brother-in-law--my sister and brother-in-law were in Chicago [Illinois].  My brother-in-law was at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and working for the Urban League, and I wasn't here a month before he had, I guess the Urban League had interceded to get CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] to begin hiring more blacks and so he sent me down there and I had a job--
Speaker 1: What year was this when you--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: That was in '54--1954, and I drove with CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] for three and a half years until 1957.
Speaker 1: Now wasn't that the CTA, the Chicago Transit Authority, yeah you were driving a bus, but--did they have good benefits and that sort of thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Had what?
Speaker 1: Were the benefits good, the salary and benefits package (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah they had--for us it was a good job, it was a good job.  As a matter of fact, there are some people who made a career of it but--and I enjoyed people, so I enjoyed driving CTA and we had to--one of the other jobs that I wanted to be as a child was also an engineer on a train, you know.  Well I became a motorman with CTA (laughter), that was the next best thing and I sort of enjoyed that, too.  I worked Cottage Grove, I worked Western Avenue, you know I worked I worked some of those long--Wentworth--some of those long routes.  I had a lot of fun driving CTA, a lot of stories about it.
Story_ID: 184820
Speaker 1: But then my friend came up again and said, "You need to be teaching," and we went down to the [Chicago] Board [of Education] that Friday and that Monday I was in a classroom, you know; in a classroom teaching second graders.  I knew not the first thing about second graders, so I've often wondered what happened to those young people but--
Speaker 2: Did they keep you in that position for the year--the balance of the year?
Speaker 1: For a semester, right and it was at Brown [W] Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois] that's over on the West side near the stadium [United Center, Chicago, Illinois], and Brown had just added a section to it--it had expanded.  They had added a section to it, and the--I was in that new section in a classroom where there were no desks or anything in there, they hadn't been put there yet.  So the kids sat on cardboard boxes that first two or three days when I was there, and we had classes there.  Now I was teaching spelling by just going through the shortest words there are; "it", "to" (laughter)--no system whatsoever.  I think if those kids were saved, and I think they were, because I liked kids.  I was doing the best I could, and we were working out well.  I think the next semester I was in fifth grade, and I was more at home there, though it was on-the-job training for me; I learned on the job and stayed for eleven years with the--well, ten years with the Chicago Board and loved most of it, you know.  And then when we moved out here in 1967, I wanted to be close to the kids out here, so I took a job at Deerfield [Illinois] in the fifth grade and taught a year in Deerfield with no intentions of staying.  I just wanted to be near the kids and the wife [Eve Beverly] took a job in Highland Park [Illinois] teaching.

Speaker 1: Now when you moved out here in '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967], yeah--
Speaker 1: Were there very many black residents in Deerfield [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: We were the first ones to buy out here.  There was a black family who lived in an unincorporated area further west of here, and there was a black minister.  I can't think of his name, he was a-- sort of a hermit and he was over at the [North Shore] Unitarian Church [Deerfield, Illinois], I think.  He lived in that unincorporated area but we were the first to buy a home here in Deerfield.  And, gradually others moved--now it's no (laughter)--I wouldn't even call it integrated today, you know.  There are black folks out here, but it's--the percentage is still--I gave a speech one year to the--to HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development].  There was a meeting here in Chicago [Illinois], I was a member of the (unclear)--Chicago Housing--oh I've forgotten what (unclear) means but we were supposed to be working the realtors and the feds in trying to--
Speaker 1: Urban Renewal is that it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No--it was North Shore--
Speaker 1: That's alright.
Speaker 2: Anyway, I was working with them and gave a speech at a national conference down there and I mentioned that when we moved to Deerfield--we were five/eighteen thousandths of the population because there were only five of us of eighteen thousand people.  I said but now it has grown and we are now fifty-eight/eighteen thousandths of the population (laughter), to show that there was not that much of a growth. And we had big fight just getting an open housing ordinance here, you know.  But yeah, it was in '67 [1967] and I taught one year here.
Story_ID: 184822
Speaker 1: A good year, I really enjoyed my year here.  It was a challenging year.  I--before I left Chicago I had done a little operetta that I called it on the life of W.C. Handy.  It happened that my class in Chicago, a fifth grade class was reading something about W.C. Handy, and we decided to do a little play on W.C. Handy.  They did it and we took that play up to National College of Education [at National Louis University, Evanston, Illinois].  We put that play on a number of times for different people.  Well when I got up here, I was still teaching social studies and history,  and so I wasn't going to--I'm going to still teach the history as I know it,  and so we were looking at W.C. Handy and I told them about it and they said, "Can we do it?"  I said, "Well yeah, why not," and so they put--that play on.  They said, "Dr. Beverly, can we shade our faces a bit?" I said, "Well yeah, if that's what you want to do."  The principal said, "Sherman, I think that may be a little--that may be taking it a little too far."  I said, "Well, whatever you say, but the kids wanted to do that."  They did a magnificent job of that play.  It was videoed and they showed it the parents and they put it on for the parents a couple of times, you know.  Those kids learned as much black history as they had heard all of their lives because I don't--history can't be separated.  It can't be separated, and so it was a good year, and I still see some of the parents of those kids, and my daughter met some of my students, from that time.  I only taught a year, so when I went in and told the principal I was leaving the superintendent--he thought I was going to leave and then come back because there was a big raise.  Now, the union--there was no union here, and the teachers were begging for a raise, and I wrote a long letter to the newspaper--they put it, ran it on the front page talking about how teachers were not valued and a whole lot of things. And the superintendent said he thought I was going to then resign and then come right back.  He said, "Now Sherman, you know if you come back you'll be starting again at the bottom."  And I wasn't at the bottom, I had ten years experience, they allowed you to have-- I said, "I'm not coming back;" I said, "I'm going back to the city.  The girls are safe out here; everything is going to be okay.  So I'm going back to the city where I think my work is," and he said, "Okay then," and so I resigned.
Story_ID: 184823
Speaker 1: When we moved out here the first day we didn't bring the kids that night because--you don't know the history of Deerfield [Illinois] do you?
Speaker 2: What is the history [of Deerfield]?
Speaker 1: What is it?  Okay in 1959 a group from the East coast had been experimenting with housing up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I think, and New Jersey, and they had built some housing--some developments, and they reserved one fourth of them for minorities at that time minorities meant black.  They would get into the community first and get all of the necessary documentation to build--the permissions and all that sort of thing and they had been successful out there.  So they're going to come to a community in Deerfield and do the same thing, and so they had permissions and all that sort of thing and had built one house over there on Wilmot Road [Deerfield, Illinois].  Had built one house when it leaked what they were doing, that they were going to reserve one fourth of it for blacks.  It blew the city up, man.  If you go back and look at some of the papers, it made international news, because churches were against each other, they-- I mean ministers had to resign their congregations and all that sort of thing.  So they--what do you call it--when they take the property.  They had built that house and they condemned it--they didn't condemn it but they took it by demand.
Speaker 2: Imminent domain (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, imminent domain and said they needed some more park space.  So they took that property, it's now Mitchell Park [Deerfield, Illinois] and the house that they had that's where the park district supervisor lived.  They supervised his housing up until just a few years ago, you know.  So that they still use that house and Morris Milgram was his name--the developers name was run out of town.  Well that's the town we were coming in a few years later and we had no intentions of moving to Deerfield.  We wanted to--the wife [Eve Beverly] wanted to live in Highland Park [Illinois], there was a substantial black community there, but the housing in Highland Park, which is right on the lake, was out of our category, and the realtor was showing us frame houses that needed a lot of work, and my wife said, "No, don't show us anything you wouldn't live in."  So she said you know from your description we may have just the house you would want in Deerfield, we laughed, "Deerfield what are you talking about, we're not going to move to Deerfield."  And so she said, "Well, just come and look at a house in Deerfield."  She said, "Well, my husband and I are going to be separating before long, we're going to go for a divorce, and my house is going to go on sale, come look at it."  We went, it was exactly what my wife--my wife couldn't have drawn the blueprints herself, you know.  So she [Eve Beverly] said, "Well when are you going to move," she said, "Well not right now, but there are a lot of houses around here like this one and they are always for sale."  But that's the way we got into Deerfield.  Now that story is longer than that, but that's not what you want hear.  No realtor showed us inside a house here, but the community was ready to make those people who had been silent before, they were ready to, move forward, and they didn't want the same thing happening here again.  So there had to be a hundred white families in this community looking for--there was a human relations commission looking for housing for us, at that time.  So finally we got somebody who was willing to sell.  He increased his life insurance--his families insurance between the time he committed to selling to us and the time we took over the house.
Speaker 2: Now after you took over the house, were you threatened, or intimidated (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well yeah, after he--he got calls threatening his family but he was strong cat, and he sold us the house and we stayed there for thirty years.  We just moved here in '95 [1995], you know.  So that's how we got here and she--we liked the house and we raised our kids there.
Story_ID: 184824
Speaker 1: You were at a juncture, career-wise, when you are going back to Chicago [Illinois] to teach--
Speaker 2: I went back to Chicago and went back to Brown [W Elementary] School [Chicago, Illinois].  The school I started from--now I had worked at seven or eight schools between that time--well not seven or eight but--and I went back to Brown School.  The same principal was there, and I worked for one semester and then I went over to Malcolm X [College, Chicago, Illinois].  That was when Charles [G.] Hurst was there.
Speaker 1: Now he's the famous Charles Hurst who--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Infamous Charles Hurst or famous whichever you-scratch that.  You're going to edit this aren't you?
Speaker 1: No we're not.
Speaker 2: Yes you are (laughter).  Charles Hurst had just come into the city and I worked there for, I think one semester and a summer and Wellington Wilson who you probably know--you're going to interview him or have you already interviewed him?
Speaker 1: Probably--
Speaker 2: Yeah Wellington Wilson was putting together--
Speaker 1: Who's now the president of Kennedy-King College [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Was putting together a black studies department at Kendall College in Evanston [Illinois].  It was a two year college at that time, and its mission was to get the north shore--it wasn't just necessarily the north shore but north shore students who were sort of deficient academically, ready for a four year school and it did a magnificent job.  It did a great job of that and had a small faculty, small--and Wellington was brought on a year and spent a year putting together a black studies program because they wanted to introduce black students to the--to Kendall College.  And the following year they brought one hundred black students from Chicago into Kendall College.  And by that time Wellington had a faculty.  And you know who his administrative assistant was, [HM] Wayne Watson.  Wayne Watson was his administrative assistant, and they brought--did Wayne talk about that in his interview?
Speaker 1: I don't remember--I don't know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they brought one hundred students there.  They assembled a faculty.  I was one, [HM] Iva Carruthers--I know you know Iva and Ann Whitaker was one.
Story_ID: 184825
Speaker 1: --[Wellington Wilson] hired four of us to be part of that [black studies] department and it was one of the highlights of my career.  I think all of us would say that because we brought those hundred black kids up there, and we were just like family, man.  Wellington would have us at his house sometimes for dinner and they came out here for chili and they would babysit and--it was great.  We--the young people really developed, for the most part, and many of them, succeeded.  I went to a retirement for Keith Cooper who actually was the assistant--the second in command of one of the correctional districts here in the state.  He had been a warden for many, many years.  Keith was one of the success stories.  It was a good--this--Kendall [College, Evanston, Illinois] had a pretty good drama department, but the black students had not been in many plays.  Well Kendall's semester was--Kendall's schedule was such that you had a whole month of January where faculty could explore any area they wanted, do whatever they wanted to do outside of their field with their students.  And so we produced--I had our students produce Douglas Turner Ward's 'Day of Absence' and 'Happy Endings.'  They did those plays the kids were the directors and everything, and I was the old white man saying, "Where they going."  They did a great job.  We filled the theater two straight weeks.  We did it at the Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois], too during Black History Month; you can look at the pictures in there.  After that the person who was over the drama department--after the first week came in and asked, could she kind of help with the presentation.  I said, yeah we can take your help," and she came in,  and made a few suggestions and all that sort of thing.  But after that, black kids were in most of the plays that Kendall gave,  but they had been sort of ignored up to that--well they hadn't been there, but they had always had a few, but they hadn't been in theater.  And so I saw one of the girls at a play a few years ago and she was the producer of that play on Langston Hughes up at the [Fleetwood-]Jourdain [Theatre, Evanston, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Fleetwood Jourdain (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Fleetwood Jourdain, yeah.  I stayed four years there and that was one of the highlights of my career.  It ended when we got a new president, and his mission was to make it fiscally sound, and the first thing he did was to look at programs that were expendable in his mind.
Story_ID: 187064
Speaker 1: Okay. So what happened next after the budget was cut and things started to dwindle at Kendall [College, Evanston, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so then I went to Northeastern [Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois] where I had been doing some part-time work anyway, and I went there full time.
Speaker 1: Tell us about Northeastern.  Now you were at the Center for Inner City Studies, right--
Speaker 2: I was at the Center for Inner City Studies which was actually Northeastern's response to its urban mission and it was--the Center was a comprehensive educational center.  It wasn't just academic, it served the community to a great extent, it was there for use.  We had--at first--are you going to interview Don Bailey?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: No, okay.  Well at first the center was developed for the purpose of training people to teach in the inner city.  It was a teacher training center, it was taking teachers--white, black--helping white teachers understand how to teach black students.  That was part of its mission, and at the outset many of its faculty--well, a significant portion of its faculty were white professors.  Now by the time I got there in '72 [1972], I think the center started in '68 [1968], yeah by the time I got there in '72 [1972] it had become almost all black faculty.  Nancy [Levi] Arnez was the director of it, Bailey [ph.] was the--well I don't want to get into all of that, I'm not sure who but Nancy was there and Andy was there and Anderson--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: This was Dr. Anderson Thompson (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Anderson Thompson, Bob Starks and Bill Smith was there and Dr. Lattimore--Dr. Peace [ph.] was not there at that time.  Sitoli--you know Dr. Elkin Sitoli [ph.]
Speaker 1: From South Africa (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, was their ethno-musicologist and it was a strong faculty and it evolved slowly from just dealing with teachers--training teachers to the Center for Inner City Studies where we were trying to develop a discipline of Inner City Studies.  And so we had--we created a major--first you could get a Master's in Inner City Studies and here we were just trying to help whomever--people who were working in the city--in the urban area begin to understand the populations--to understand the cities.  What it is that makes--you know, how cities function and how they really neglect a lot of people and, if you're really interested, how you can--that's the kind of thing we were doing.  And then we--it evolved where we had a--an undergraduate degree also, and I think that's where it still is.  We offer masters and also--but it's expanded much more, it's broader than that at this particular time.
Story_ID: 187065
Speaker 1: That was a good time of my career, too.  The students were enthusiastic.  It was hard work because, some of them were not college--they were first time college students, many of them--
Speaker 2: And older students (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) and the first in their family.  Some of them were older students.  Now some came with a lot of skills.  You know, some had been working in the city, government, social workers, teachers, but others came in, and, you know, there was a lot of work to be done. And the academic life was kind of difficult.  We really had to adjust; we had to adjust to them as they had to adjust to us.  It became--the Center [for Inner City Studies, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois] became more or less a family, too, where people could come and feel comfortable there and take their course work.  And what we did, we offered all of the prerequisites that are required by the university--we found a way to offer them at the Center.  The department of inner city studies was located in the Center for Inner City Studies and I don't know if you remember when it was at--when we had to temporarily vacate where we are now.  I still say where we are now--where it is now and go to 45th [Street] and Drexel [Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois] because the building where we are now was being rehabbed.  We--we brought about that rehabbing of the building.
Speaker 2: You're talking about the 700 E. Oakwood [Chicago, Illinois] building (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 700 Oakwood Boulevard, I wish--
Speaker 2: It used to be the Abraham Lincoln Center (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was the Abraham Lincoln Center.  Some people still refer to it as the well they call it the old Abraham Lincoln Center.
Speaker 2: It was a building that was designed by--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Frank Lloyd Wright, or some of his students or something.  It was under his direction, I think.  But the exterior is as it's always has been since its--but the interior was completely--it was gutted.  I wish you would have seen that building before it was--and we had a black architect.  What was his name, Herd [ph.] I think his name is.  He did the architectural work and, you know, the building was--it's a new building inside, you know.  It's during that period of time when I was chair of the department for a while, you know, when we were in that building at 45th and Drexel.  But that was a transformation of the building.  It was a--and it's a nice building now, you know, um-hm.  So that was, you know, that was the Center for Inner City Studies and the Department of Inner City Studies.
Speaker 2: You said it was remodeled, what year was that?  You came in '72 [1972] and they remodeled it--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seventy-two [1972], I was doing part-time work in '73 [1973] I went on permanently--well full time.  That was in the '80s [1980s].  It may have been '86 [1986].  That was in the '80s [1980s] when the building-no, I'm wrong.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was in the--it had to be the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: That was in the '70s [1970s], right, because I can remember we went to Africa with the--we were meeting at the building--'75 [1975] I know we were in that other building.  So it was in the mid-'70s [1970s] or early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: It had to be fixed by '77 [1977] because I know when I came here in '77 [1977] it was already fixed--it was remodeled.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it must have been '75 [1975]--
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975], '76 [1976] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know we were in the old building--it was being remodeled in '75 [1975].  I can remember us meeting over there so it must have begun around '72 [1972]--well we were fighting to get it for a long time.  So it must have been around '73 [1973] or '74 [1974] when they began.  It was already there when you got--right--
Story_ID: 187066
Speaker 1: You taught a variety of courses at the Center [for Inner City Studies, Kendall College, Evanston, Illinois] and a wide range--everything from West African history to human relations and education courses.
Speaker 2: Yeah I have that list on that-(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Right, I saw it with all the different courses--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: One that I really enjoyed--well I enjoyed the black churches--I enjoyed all the courses that I taught and developed--
Speaker 1: Well, you were going to talk about the black church course.  You referenced it early on, and so do you want to tell us about that one?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, it's the black history as a political instrument.  I think the one I was attempting to develop in that course is that, religion--religions are human-made institutions, developed to serve human needs. And that's a little--that's separate from the belief in a supreme being or what have you, you know.  You can do that without the institution.  And, that institutions by virtue of them being human organisms developed for the benefit of human beings, they are going to be developed to serve the human need, and they are going to be developed to serve those needs as they see them.  There is nothing out there--they are by nature of their existence political. And black folks like to talk about the separation of church, you know, the secular and the spiritual as if they are two separate things.  The church cannot be not political by its very existence.  So, and we were talking about, you have all these different religions, they develop--I threw out the phrase, something about, We create our own gods, well, that's where people--you know, some of them were separated from the class.  I would lose, as I said, a substantial number of students after the first session because they were not ready to wrestle with that kind of question as it relates to religion.  And I was really attempting to say, So, since you know that, use your religion as a political instrument.  After all that's what [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.]--and that's part of our history.  So for us to live with blinders on and all that kind of thing and talk about we're not political--our leaders came from--they were politicians, you know, and not always right, but they were politicians, and they understood that that's the way-- And where does a black politician get his followers from? The church.  Now, your political persuasion may be different from that of the church, but you don't leave the church because of that.  You try to, you know, kind of influence the church to do.  I--most churches I have left, and that's since I've been out here, I leave them when they don't--when their social mission clashes with what I think they ought to be doing.  You know, if you're not doing some kinds of social things that ought to be done, I don't have time for you, you know.  So in that course, it was a great course and people who stuck it--we just had a ball in it and I taught it regularly.
Story_ID: 187067
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what some of your hopes and concerns are for the black community today?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Some of my hopes and concerns for the black community today.  Well some of my--I guess it's easier to deal with the concerns first.  I think some of my concerns have to do with us not really knowing our history.  Now that sounds so--you know, we really don't--let me back up--one of my concerns back in--let me give you an example.  I was doing a graduate course on black history and my students--these were older guys--every time you go to define black history, what is blackness, people began to talk about what is not black.  And so it's been a semester with them dealing with what is not black.  So the final exam was to give me a definition of what is black.  Well I got the same thing on the exam, and so we got to talking about it, and so a guy said, "Well, Dr. Beverly the other day I was going to play tennis, and I was walking down 57th Street and I saw these guys on their yacht just laughing and having a ball and sailing out there into the lake," he said, "Now you know, that ain't black."  I said, "Well, you were going to play tennis," I said, "There were a group of kids throwing an old basketball up at a fruit basket nailed to the wall, they saw you and all your white garb and your tennis racquet and your cap and this sort of thing; they looked up at you and said, 'Look, he's going to play tennis, you know he ain't black.'"  You see, I--my hope is that we quit pointing fingers at who is the blackest.  That we begin to see that we, at least begin to try to understand where each of us is coming from and where we begin to try to support each other. And I don't like to have a conversation with anybody where I don't learn something or I don't help somebody learn something.  I mean, I just don't--I hate to waste my time in trivia, you see.  Look some of my ideas clash with some of my col--I'd like to see us in a society where we can put any topic out there on the agenda and discuss it. You see, the young fellow [John McWhorter] who wrote the book recently, I guess he wrote 'Authentically Black' that was his second one but he works up at Boston College [Newton, Massachusetts], I think.  What's the name of the book, at any rate, he wrote from his experience of--he says that we're anti-intellectual, you know, and he sees this in the college.  We are separatists and the other one, three things, and he give a lot of evidence supporting it.  You know, the young cat is partially true, but he--I think he goes too far and all this sort of thing.  But I have friends who won't even read the book.  A friend of mine in New York called me and asked me to read it because I hadn't read it, I didn't know anything about it, and said-- and then call him back and we'd discussed it.  Well, you know, we discussed it, but he had friends who said, "Man you're reading all that sort of thing, that cat's nothing but a racist."  I think we have to listen to all of that--
Story_ID: 187068
Speaker 1: Let's face it, I've been in [Wendell] Phillips [Academy] High School [Chicago, Illinois] where I've done some consulting work and all that sort of thing.  I've seen a young fellow sitting down studying and trying to struggle with a problem and some others tell him, "Man, what are you doing studying all that."  You know, and that--I've seen that kind of thing.  I think we have to recognize that that is a possibility, now what do we do about it, you see, and then we as educators must begin to--it seems to me, we must begin to show our enthusiasm for learning, our enthusiasm for asking all the hard questions, our enthusiasm for responding to all the hard questions.  There should be nothing out there that we can't put on the agenda and discuss and struggle with, you know, that's what it's all about, it seems to me.  I was in a class one day, I do--I have done a lot of demonstrating in classes in my consulting work. And a young fellow--I took a hymn but we were talking about--they were watching 'The Wizard of Oz' which they had seen many times but these high school kids didn't know why there were watching 'The Wizard of Oz'.  I said, "Why are you watching 'Wizard of Oz'?"  The teacher said he was looking at not irony--whatever the term is, I forget--where you look at one thing as a symbol of life and that kind of thing, you know.  But the kids didn't know, and so I asked him to let me do it at the next session, let me show-- and so, when I got in, I said, "You were looking at 'The Wizard of Oz' and you didn't see why you were watching it the other day," and they said, "No."  I said, "Well after this period, you'll know why you're watching it.  Just shut up and wait and see," what--and so I had--I don't know if you know this song, "Life is like a mountain railroad with its engineer that's brave,"--that's one from way back.  I found that song and I took the words in and I let them--now I started the class and asked them, "What is life," and they came up with all these sensible things, "it's a struggle", it's a-we looked at Langston Hughes' 'The Stairs' and that kind of thing and then I brought out that song.  And they--a young fellow said, "Dr. Beverly, that's sounds like something Tupac Shakur would write."  I said, "Really," and he said, "Yeah."  I hadn't heard that much of Tupac, I knew who he was.  The teacher said, "Oh, he's just a rapper."  I say, "You're a rapper?"  Now, you see the difference in the tone, how I said it and how the teacher said it.  I said, "You're a rapper," and he said, "Yeah."  I said, "This sounds like something he would write?"  He said, "Yeah."  I said, "can you put this is in rap?"  He said, "Yeah, I can do it," and I said, "Well do it for the next period."  Now, before I left that school, I bought--you know rapping is not new, it's now new.  If you've heard the 'Signifying Monkey' and if you've heard 'The Titanic' and this kind of thing, we've been doing it for ages.
Story_ID: 187069
Speaker 1: I bought the book that--that thick book with all the history of literature and that kind of thing, I'm losing my memory.
Speaker 2: Oxford History on American Literature (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, I bought that for three kids who were rappers and I said--and I let them read that and they looked at that, "Look at what Dr. Beverly showed us, look at this," look at 'The Titanic,' you know, I said if you put that to rap, you would get all the old people my age listening to that.  That was part of my culture--that was part of what we--it amazed them.  Now they began to turn around.  What do I see for blacks?  I see us finding ways of helping people become the best they can become.  Listen, a young fellow at Kendall College, I'm standing up there pontificating and talking and so he--they are going to always try you--he said, "Dr. Beverly, I don't know why I need to be in here, I'm a successful pimp."  So kids, you know, they kind of snicker, "Now let me see what he is going to do with that."  I said I don't know what you call a success, but I know of successful pimps with their headquarters down at the Hilton.  They have a place at the Hilton where they do their business.  I said, "That may be called success," I say, "but I know one thing, you need to know some medicine, you need to know some management, and you've got to have psychology," and I used his term and I said, "you've got to keep your stable happy."  I said, "you ought to read Iceberg Slim, you need literature."  I went down the whole thing about--I said and you need some law, you need to know--I said man I can't think of anything you don't need if you want to be successful.  He laughed and said, "Dr. Beverly, you're something else."  You know, now he read in the paper about six years later where I was doing the inner city careers thing, and I was running some small business workshops.  I had business people coming in and talking, and he called me and asked me could he come in and run one of the sessions.  I said, "Well what are you doing now?"  He was running--he was over the foreign investment for Continental Bank at that time, and I went by his house--fine house, wife and kids, and he had a great job.  And, you know, I said, "Well yeah; let's discuss what you would talk about."  You see, now I could have shown my revulsion for, you know, for a pimp, I could have said you need to be dragged behind the cars or something of that sort, but I would have lost him.  I'm not there to drive people away from me, I'm there to pull them toward me because I can't help them if I drive them away.  You see, I believe if we spent our time in trying to understand and trying to--and see that our mission--these young fellows at Phillips High School said, "Dr. Beverly are you a minis--are you a preacher?"  I said, "No, but I'm on a mission."  They said, "Yeah, what's your mission?"  I said, "To make young fellows like you realize how much you already know and how much you can know it--"

Speaker 1: At this point your public life is not finished, but how would you like to be remembered?  I'm sorry what would you consider at this point as your legacy first?
Speaker 2: I think my legacy has been my teaching career; my actually sharing my knowledge and being willing and able to learn from others.  I can't walk down the street without meeting people whose life--who says that I have influenced them.  I don't know them and they'll walk--Dr. Beverly they could hear me talking and say you're Dr. Beverly and then they talk about something that I said, one or two things that I said that has stuck with them and they have shared their grandchildren and all this sort of thing.  I think that's my legacy, I think quite frankly I don't think I've ever taught and I should refer you to a whole lot of people to talk about me but I don't think I've left many places the same as they were when I got there.  I think I have been able to bring about some kind of change in the environment where I have worked and the many groups that I have worked with and things of that sort.  I think that's where my legacy lay.
Story_ID: 182104
Speaker 1: Sir, then how would you like to be remembered?  That's slightly different from legacy.
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as someone who tried to do the best he could in everything that he undertook.  Now--but also remembered as one who has grown, who realizes and is grateful for the fact that he is not now what he was when he was eighteen and nineteen or even thirty years old.  That I want to be remembered as one, who was always curious, always interested in others but who always saw that he was the most important person in his life.  Meaning that my welfare you see or this whole discussion of selfishness.  I want people to understand that I was selfish throughout my life.  That I understand that my welfare, my self interest lies in the people around me.  I cannot live my life making all kinds of enemies and stepping on people and all this sort of thing, disregarding people and abusing them and expect to be happy, you see.  I used to tell my students, "You can--I don't always want to see you when you knock on my door or when you walk into my"-- I said, "I don't want to see you, but don't let that drive you off because I'm not going bite you, I'm not going shoot you because three minutes after you are in there, we get into some of kind conversation, you've got me hooked and I'm going to be there for as long as you want to."  I said, "Because I love it, I love it and if you've got something out of it," I said, "If I would rather be on the tennis court, I would put you out of my office."  I said, "I'm doing what I love to do and I need you to be able to do it."  You see what I'm saying?  All of our welfare, myself interests doesn't lie.  I think it's the--who is it that says something about one enemy is too much; one hundred friends are not enough.  I don't need enemies; it's not in my best interest.  So I want to be remembered as someone who learned his whole life and continued to grow, was growing at seventy six years old and will be growing at eighty six if I live that long because every day is a learning situation, you see and certainly as a teacher who was really into his career, I'm into sharing.  That's how I want to be remembered and also as a--and I'm not just throwing this in as a good husband, as a good father, as one who--you see when we talk about what is black, black is human (laughter), you know.  My daughters [names]--we've traveled a lot and my daughters have been--they've traveled with us.  We gave them that legacy.  I took them skiing and I can't ski, I stayed at the foot of the mountain but let them--my wife [Eve Beverly] and I, we've been whitewater rafting, we've rode the balloon.  I did some mountain climbing and all that kind of thing.  Life there is a lot about life and I should not be denied any of it just because I'm black.  Tennis is a human game that blacks, everybody can enjoy.  I don't think there's anything off-limits to me, you know, that's not off limits to all human beings.  So I want to be one who tried to live a full life and understood that every minute counts and didn't want to waste any of them.

Speaker 1: Go ahead; just give us who is in the photo, about when it was taken and what the occasion was.
Speaker 2: That's my oldest daughter, Sherene Lukathy Beverly [ph.] and me.  We were playing at a Kappa tennis tournament, and we had won, I think it maybe second place in mixed doubles.
Speaker 1: About what year is that?
Speaker 2: I haven't the slightest idea.
Speaker 1: It might be the '80s [1980s] to me, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was probably the '80s [1980s].  Look on the back of it.  Okay that's the team I coached.  I think we went to championship.  I always coached the team that the girls were on.  That's my nephew in the middle.  He was visiting us from New Jersey and he just joined me as a coach that year.
Speaker 1: Okay that's 1980.
Speaker 2: That's my brother [Harold L. Beverly] and me when we--I guess we were ten or twelve.  He was maybe--I don't know I look like I must be about twelve years old, he was ten.  That's our house in Port Arthur, Texas.  That's 801--no that's 500 West 12th Street in Port Arthur.  My brother's name is Harold Lloyd Beverly.  This is Marie Vaughn Beverly, Phillips now and me.  That's my sister, same house as my brother and me.  Anything else?  She's older than both of us.  That's my sister again, she's a freshman at Prairie View College and I was a senior at Lincoln High School visiting her on campus anticipating joining her as a student the next semester.
Speaker 1: About year was that?
Speaker 2: That had to be 1945.  This is my high school choir and I'm back there.  There's an arrow, can you see that arrow pointing, that's me right there.  I was one of the first tenors and I think the date on there is '45 [1945], no that couldn't be '45 [1945], '46 [1946].  Can you see that date?
Speaker 1: Forty-four [1944]--
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: This is '45 [1945] when you graduated.
Speaker 2: That's me as a high school graduate.  That's my mother [Katie Smart Beverly].  I don't know when that picture was taken.  Katie Beverly is her name--Katie Smart Beverly.  We are on the ferry and going from Port Arthur to Galveston, crossing the Galveston Bay.  That's my father, my three daughters, my wife and me.
Speaker 1: Year do you remember?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: What year approximately?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy [1970]--
Speaker 1: This is in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.  We were vacationing down there.  That's my brother Harold and his wife Mary and that's my wife and me at a monument there.  I waited until I was in my sixties before I decided to try to climb a few mountains.  This was in a class where another professor and I were sort of experimenting on experiential learning and I was out there with about twenty young people eighteen to twenty years old.
Speaker 2: That's in the 1990s, right?
Speaker 1: Ninety-one [1991] I think.  I'm a real youngster here dressed to kill.  Probably ready to go to church.  Any date of that?  Wait just a second, I've got that picture in, yeah and I may have a date.  Beverly senior, he's my great grandfather, Willis Beverly Senior.
Speaker 2: What date do you think it is?
Speaker 1: What date is that?  I don't know.
Speaker 2: That's your grandfather?
Speaker 1: Yes, great grandfather.
Speaker 2: So that's around the turn of the century or may be back further.
Speaker 1: That's my wife and me, Eve Beverly and Sherman Beverly.  That must be around 1970.  That's my grandmother on my mother's side, my maternal grandmother, Mattie Tompkins Armstead and I don't know what year that was in.  Here's that little picture, I don't have a date on it.  My mother and father, Sherman Beverly and Katie Smart Beverly.  I think that picture was probably before we married.  That may be 1959.  Sherman and Eve and it's hard for me to even believe that I once went without a beard but there I am.
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959]?
Speaker 1: Yeah somewhere in there--
Speaker 2: You've got the continental tie and everything.
Speaker 1: My father, he was an avid fisherman.  He could fish too.  This is in Texas next to our junk house, we used to call it.  He kept his tools and all that sort of thing in that house.  My wife and me at a formal affair.  That was in probably 1991 or 1992.  There's the family, we had a delayed camera and we put it on the floor and put our heads together.  That's the heads of the Beverly's.
Speaker 2: What year and then go clockwise.
Speaker 1: Okay that's me Sherman, that's my wife Eve, that's Tashma, that's the youngest one, that's Sherene, she's the oldest.  Tashma is an actress now.  Sherene is a doctor and there's Lisa with the big hat.  She's a hat wearer, she is a teacher.  We vacationed at a dude ranch out in Colorado one year.  This is--this must be 1989 or '90 [1990] but I was riding a horse.  We're out on the ski trail.  Is that what you call it?  That's my little and my oldest daughter and me.  If you see I have no ski poles.  In 1995 we had a Port Arthur reunion here.  I was the president of the Chicago Club and put it together and that's me on the right.  I don't know the other--I should know them but I don't.  Sherman in white, Sherene the tall one, our daughter and Eve on the right.  That's in the '90s [1990s] too.  Even in China and there we are in the soldier outfits.  That was in 2000.
Speaker 2: You look pretty authentic there.
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: You look just as natural, authentic.
Speaker 1: Yeah I bet I do (laughter).
Speaker 2: The African presence in ancient China.
Speaker 1: Yeah you know we were in Africa, too.  I couldn't find any of the African pictures.  White water rafting; is that the one with the whole family?  No this is just Eve and me.  This was in Colorado, that's the Arkansas River and we had a lot of fun.  The leader fell off in there and we were surprised that it only came up to his waist.  Music, you asked on the interview did we--but you were talking about my childhood.  We tried--all of them played some kind of instrument.
Speaker 2: Is that the oboe?
Speaker 1: Yeah that's the oboe; she was good, played first chair in high school.  The oldest one played the piano and the violin and the middle one with the guitar, she tried the clarinet, the guitar and she--they are all musical and they all music, that's one the thing the whole family loves music.
Speaker 2: And what year is this?
Speaker 1: What year was this, you keep asking what year is this?  They were not out of high school.
Speaker 2: She looks like she's in grade school.
Speaker 1: Yes she is because let's see, she was born in '65 [1965], that's in the early '70s [1970s], right.
