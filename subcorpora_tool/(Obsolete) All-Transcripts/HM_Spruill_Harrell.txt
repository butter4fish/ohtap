Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was established oh, about three years ago.  And we give scholarships.  By the way, you didn't ask me, but I we give scholarships to various churches.  We supplement the programs that the school has.  In other words, we put emphasis on math, science, and English.  It's a six week course, and we, right now we are supporting four churches.  And the kids come to my farm as a means--they spend one day at the farm.  And my wife goes over the things which are planted on the farm.  Of course, she does a, does a better job than I do.  And see, she goes over the things which are planted on the farm, and she expose the children to the things that are growing and whatnot.  In the meantime, I'm working on the farm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now, sir, what is today's date?

Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 611651
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions we always ask as a kind of a warm up.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I really don't.  I like most foods, most foods.  I don't know of any drink that don't I like except coffee; I don't like coffee.  It started, well, it started a year--years ago.  And what happened was, my younger brother [Albert Spruill] and all--both of us used to drink coffee.  It was the, when we were six years old.  And the teacher told us that, if you drink coffee, you wouldn't grow.  And of course, I decided that I wasn't gonna drink no coffee, and I didn't drink any coffee.  And my brother drank coffee.  He kept on growing.  But I didn't drink any coffee, (laughter) it look like I, I, I stayed one size.  And he became real tall, and I was sort of the runt in the family, and I was short.
Speaker 1: So you look back at that time and think you should have kept drinking?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I, I built up a hatred of coffee though, and I not even today, I don't even like the smell of coffee.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now you were six?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was six years old.
Speaker 1: Six years old, so you were drinking coffee at age six?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, back in those days, we, we, we used to make our own coffee, you know, and coffee was rather cheap.  And my mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill] and father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] drank coffee and had coffee every morning, and the kids had coffee too.  And of course, that was the beverage, coffee and milk.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, second question is, do, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Color?  I really don't--I really don't.  I think maybe red is about my favorite color, because I just bought a red truck about two, two years ago, and I love that truck (laughter).  It's red.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: No.  I love both of them.  I think we should have a balance, the summer and winter.  I love the winter because it's sort of chilly.  And I love the spring of the year.  I like to see the flowers begin to grow and the grass begin to sprout and the trees bud.  And of course, the fall of the year, I like the trees growing, shedding their buds and whatnot.  And I don't have any favorite.  I just love the nature.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: You know, unfortunately, growing up we didn't take no vacation.  You had to, you, you worked all the time.  And even to today, I don't care that much for taking a vacation.  When the children [Kevin Spruill and Kecia Spruill Johnson] were small, we, I had to take a vacation to show them different parts of the country and different parts of the eastern section of the, of the, of the world.  In fact, we went to Puerto Rico, is one of the places we went out of, out of the United States.  But we used to travel to California, Florida, and Puerto Rico and whatnot.  But as far as me favoring vacation, I don't.  Unfortunately, I guess, I guess my father instilled worth ethic in me so strong, until I feel like I'm playing hooky when I go on a vacation.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Now, the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I think my wife would always tell me: he who has, more shall be added unto it.  He who has not, that that he seem to have had, shall be taken away.  And I always refer that to people who, who just lay around and don't do any, anything for them self.
Story_ID: 611652
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] side, but I'm gonna ask about your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Her full name is Georgiana, G-E-O-R-G-A-N-N-A [sic.].  And she really didn't have no middle name other than the--Wynn, W-Y-N-N [Georgiana Wynn Spruill].
Speaker 1: Okay, W-Y-N-N, and okay.  And what's, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in July.  I don't know an exact date.  I think it's around the 9th of July, 1889, I think it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: Creswell, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Crest--
Speaker 2: Creswell, C-R-E-S-W-E-L-L--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about your mother's ancestors.  How--can, can you--how far back can you trace her side of the family?
Speaker 2: I can't go very far.  The only people that I know was her--she had one sister, one whole sister, we call it.  And she had one half-sister.  Her whole sister, I guess, was, her name was Carrie Wynn [Carrie Wynn Ralson (ph.)].  Of course, she married a Ralson [ph.].  They were very close.  The other half sister was named Laura [ph.].  And they weren't too close, but I know she was a relative.  We used to see each other when we were growing up.  And then she--then I said that she had a brother, too.  He died soon after I got to the point where I could remember things and that sort.  And to tell you the truth, I've even forgotten his name (laughter), forgotten his name.  But I know he was a big fellow, and he used to tell a lot of jokes when I was small.  But he never was a great part of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories from her side of the family about, about Reconstruction or slavery that go all the way back that far?  Did anybody ever talk about that?
Speaker 2: No, my mother didn't talk very much about her, her parents being in slavery.  I guess she wanted to sort of forget about those days.  I do know that she talked about having to work long hours on the farm.  And of course, but yet and still, that didn't deter her from trying to instill in her children the benefit of working hard on the farm.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was, did she attend school in, in--
Speaker 2: She went as far as the third grade, but she had a great wisdom.  She could read and write very well, and she was sort of our teacher, sort of an inspiration to the whole family.  We all loved her.  She could get along with anybody.
Story_ID: 611653
Speaker 1: Did she [Spruill's mother, Georgiana Wynn Spruill] have any stories about growing up herself that she shared, about things that she did when she was a little girl?
Speaker 2: She didn't talk very much about her life.  She used to like to read.  'Silas Marner' ['Silas Marner: The Weaver of Raveloe,' George Eliot] was her--and then, of course, in the biblical, in the Bible she used to like in Daniel and the lions' den.  She used to talk about that quite a bit.  And her favorite song was 'Amazing Grace.' And of course, we were all churchgoers, go--we used to work--walk two and three miles to church.  And you had to go to church regardless of whether the weather was bad or whether it was good.  You went to church anyway on a Sunday, whether it was snowing.  It was something you had to do.
Speaker 1: Seem like it would be tougher in the rain in some ways.
Speaker 2: Well, they used to have these little cart that my father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] used to put all of us in the cart and the mule and whatnot.  It was tough on the mule walking on those icy roads and whatnot.  But we used to go to church. And sometimes we were wet when we got to church, but we used to sit around the old stove and whatnot and dry off and listen to the sermons.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But it was a part of us.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of our church?
Speaker 2: Chapel Hill Baptist Church [Columbia, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now does, does that mean that it--were you all close to Chapel Hill, North Carolina?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It was just--okay.
Speaker 2: Chapel Hill was just the name of the church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The train was in Travis [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Chapel Hill was just the name of the church.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I thought I'd ask 'cause I don't know much about the geography.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When I heard Chapel Hill, I said oh, that's (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's just the name of the church.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now why, how it got its name, I never did find out really.
Story_ID: 611654
Speaker 1: So your mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill] basically grew up around the same area and that she, that, that you were born in, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's that basically it?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] grew up in Travis [North Carolina], but you know, those, during those days, you had to either walk or ride a mule or a horse and whatnot two and three miles.  Of course, that means hours apart, you know.  I never did find out how my father met my mother, because they were really about five miles apart.  And as I say, during those days, five miles, it took you hours to walk five miles, you know.  So but anyway, they met and they married, and he brought her down to Travis.
Story_ID: 611655
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Solomon Spruill [Solomon Spruill, Jr.].  He didn't have a middle name, as I know.  I don't think he had a middle name.  He was named Solomon Spruill, but he was named after his father [Solomon Spruill, Sr.].  And I am supposed to be Solomon--Harrell Solomon Spruill, III [HistoryMaker Harrell Spruill].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, but your father's name was, was, was it Harrell?
Speaker 2: No.  Now let me go back.  Really, I told you at first my name is Harrell Solomon Spruill.  Really, my name was Solomon Harrell Spruill.  It's in the courthouse as Solomon Harrell Spruill.  And let me go back.  When I went to school [Travis Elementary School, Travis, North Carolina], the children--my father was such a, a very stern person.  And the matur- the, my brothers and sisters used to tease me about being the, Solomon Spruill, and they used to call me Sol.  And for some reason or another, I just didn't want to--I resented the name Sol and Solomon.  So I changed my name to Harrell Solomon Spruill.  I should have tone you--told you that in the beginning.  I changed my name to Harrell Solomon Spruill.  Yeah, even in the courthouse it's Solomon Harrell Spruill.  And I never thought about that until I got ready to get my social security money.  And the peoples told me that you, "Your name is Solomon Harrell Spruill?" "Yeah, that's right--and really, it's Solomon Harrell Spruill."  And it goes way back to my first grade when the kids used to tease me, my sib- my sisters and brothers used to tease me about being Solomon Harrell Spruill because my father was rather stern.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he never resented that.  He never told me anything about it, changing my name and whatnot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so your father's father was named Sol--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Solomon Spruill, too.
Speaker 2: Solomon Spruill, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Story_ID: 611656
Speaker 1: What was your father's [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] date of birth?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: You know, I real- my father, I don't even think he even celebrated a birthday.  He was born in March.  He was born in March.  He died at age of sixty-two.  But I really, I don't--he really didn't celebrate a birthday.
Speaker 1: So, what year did he die?
Speaker 2: He died 1949.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, sometime in the 1880s I guess he was born--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What stories did he tell about his family?  I bet he can go back a little bit further, right, since he, he--
Speaker 2: No, you know, he--
Speaker 1: --could go back to his father [Solomon Spruill, Sr.].
Speaker 2: --my father sort of kept to himself.  During the early stages of our life, he kept sort of to himself.  The only thing he used to teach us is work.  Now he used to--on Sunday morning we had prayer.  And after we joined church [Chapel Hill Baptist Church, Columbia, North Carolina] we became baptized and whatnot in the--in the Baptist, in the Baptist area you are baptized, and you're a member of the church.  And after we were baptized, he used to have each one of us to pray.  But when it came down to telling stories and whatnot, the only thing he would tell us is, "You are supposed to pray; you are supposed to go to church; and you are supposed to work for a living."  And he instilled that in us.  And he didn't tell us stories other than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He sort of kept to himself too.
Speaker 1: Well, well, do you know anything about his, his father?  Was he alive when you were--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --growing up?
Speaker 2: His father died before I was born.  My mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill] used to tell me about his father.  His father had a--used to own several pieces of land.  And he was very stern I understand.  But he never told us about his father.
Speaker 1: Well, well, what did you hear from your mother about his father?
Speaker 2: Well, you probably didn't read the book ['Harvesting the American Dream, From Farm to Classroom: The Spruill Journey,' Harrell S. Spruill].  But we used to live in an area where my father had one house, and my stepmother [sic. paternal step-grandmother] had another house, which was about maybe ten minutes away.  They were all in the same row.  And my uncle used to live in the other house.  And my mother said after my grandmother died, on another piece of land, he built a, a house for her.  And when he died, she was supposed to move her family to this house.  By the way, she had about four or five children.  And when she died, instead of her moving her family down to the other house that he built for her, she moved her, her, her children down to this house.  And she moved her family, and she stayed in the house that my father had before, while they were married, and my father always resented this.  He hardly wanted to speak to her, and that went on the, I guess the whole time that I grew up.  She finally died and before I came.  But it, it became in something that very bitter to him.  He really did not like that, the fact that she was going to inherit this house and the fact that he just didn't resent.  And, and, and to, to top it off, her daughter, my aunt, married into the family.  And of course, he sort of resented that.  And they were in close speaking distance to each other; you could holler at them, and you know, and wave your hand and you know, you could--it's just that close.  But my, my father resented this.  And it was a, it was a bitter pill for him to swallow.  And it sort of created a, a problem with the families.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, I suppose he had probably contributed a lot of work to the development of the place himself.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, he grew up there [Travis, North Carolina].  Yeah, he grew up there.  His brothers and sisters grew up there, and they did a lot of work there.
Speaker 1: Now from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And for another family to come in and take over, he just didn't like it.
Story_ID: 611657
Speaker 1: From what I read [in 'Harvesting the American Dream, From Farm to Classroom: The Spruill Journey,' Harrell S. Spruill], you can trace your father's family back to slavery.  You can--your, your, your father's father's father had been a slave, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is what my mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill]--my, my mother was the one who used to told me, tell, told me about that, 'cause my father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] didn't.  He, he didn't go back there, that history like that.  My, my mother told me that, that her mother was sold in slavery; and of course, they became free.  But I never did figure out how he got to the point where he owned this land, because he owned two parcels of land.  And back in those days, very few blacks had land--
Speaker 1: You're talking about--
Speaker 2: --back in the--
Speaker 1: --your grandfather?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, yes.
Speaker 1: Your, your, your father's father [Solomon Spruill, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Matter of fact, my father bought his farm from his father.  My father didn't believe in giving children land, because he said that that sort of ruined them.  They're, they're getting something for nothing.  And he sold my father his thirteen acres of land for four hundred dollars, and he took some, some time to, to pay that four hundred dollars off.  But anyway, he bought it.  And my uncle also bought some land from my, my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so let's see.  So about how many laker--acres of land did your father have when he bought--
Speaker 2: My father owned thirteen acres of land.
Speaker 1: Thirteen, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, thirteen acres.  He used to farm that land as though it was fifty acres, because, 'cause he had ten children.  And we never used any chemicals to kill the grass or get rid of the bugs.  The children used to pull--every time a piece of grass used to come up, we were out there pulling the grass out.  So our farm was very clean, and naturally plants will grow very well if they're not bothered with weeds and, and grass and whatnot.  And of course, later on, bugs--we used to have to make sure that we take the bugs off the, off the plants.  And we would use, when we were small to be doing things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 611658
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, about their talents, their dispositions, and their, their--who, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I try to think--I think in terms of my mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill], I, I think I took her personality.  Of course, she could get along with anybody.  And I, yeah, tried to take his work ethic, and I tried to combine the two of them and make a person, a good person out my, myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the implication is here that your father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] really wasn't very sociable.  I mean--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --not--is that what you're saying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He really wasn't sociable.  In the book ['Harvesting the American Dream, From Farm to Classroom: The Spruill Journey,' Harrell S. Spruill], I was the one that used to follow him in the plow and uncover the plants.  In other words, the plow would cover the plants over, and sometimes I would uncover the plants.  I was the one that followed him.  And we would spend hours, and very few words were said, other than the fact that, "Make sure you uncover the plants, and make sure that they are not covered up."  And then after he would get through, he, he used to have what we called drains, and I used to use a shovel to scoop the drains up.  But he wasn't a very sociable person, no.
Speaker 1: The, the what, now?  I'm sorry, the dray?
Speaker 2: Cover the drains.  In other words, when you have class land--that was long before irrigation was--you had ditches, and then you had a small drain to lead over to the ditches.  And when you plow, you cover the drains up.  And we used to have shovels to make sure that the drains were uncovered so that the water would go to the ditch and carry the water out.  And that's what I used to do afterwards.
Story_ID: 611659
Speaker 1: From your book ['Harvesting the American Dream, From Farm to Classroom: The Spruill Journey,' Harrell S. Spruill], from what I understand, you started working at the age of three.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I guess he [Spruill's father, Solomon Spruill, Jr.] started me out because maybe because I was named after him.  He felt like that I guess his children should start early.  And one morning, I recall, he told my mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill] that we--he's gonna take me out there and show me how to uncover the plants.  And that's when I went out behind him and started uncovering the plants, at age three.  And he would saddle the mule up, and I would walk behind him uncovering the plants.
Speaker 1: So, do you have an earliest childhood memory?  Is, is that it?  I mean, I, I just wonder if that's your earliest memory, is, is work, working with--
Speaker 2: That is the earliest memory.  I do know, of course, we used to have--make fires.  And he always shows me to make the fires.  I started making fires when I was about five years old.  I would be the first one to get up in the morning and make the fires up.  Everybody else was laid in bed, you know, but I was supposed to get up and make the fires.  And of course, everybody else would be able to get up and go into a warm room--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and 'cause we didn't have no fire in, in any other room except the, what we called the living room.
Story_ID: 611660
Speaker 1: What kind of house did you live in [in North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: We had, it was a wooden house, block, on blocks.  Them blocks were--the house used sit up about, about fifteen inches on cement blocks.  And I never found out until later--I really didn't even question why he [Spruill's father, Solomon Spruill, Jr.] had such a big space underneath the house--what it was for, drainage.  And he used to also think in terms of the chickens laying eggs underneath the house too.  And we were supposed to go under there and get the eggs and whatnot, and it was also for drainage too.  But it was a place for snakes and rabbits and everything to make their nest under the house too.  And we used to fear going underneath the house because of that concern.
Speaker 1: 'Cause of, okay, because the snakes and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --other things that might be under--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --there, huh?  Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  We had to go underneath the house because of the chickens.  We had a--the house used to sit on a area about an acre of land.  And in that acre of land he had a fence around that area.  In the fence and that acre of land, he had chickens, geese, hogs, some hogs were in there, dogs, cats.  Actually, it wouldn't even grow grass.  During the springtime, my mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill] used to have brooms, and we used to sweep dust in that acre of land, because no grass would grow.  Everything used to run in there.  You know, they would inhabit that little space and whatnot.  And it was kind of interesting.  You know, and when I went back, back in April, and all this--the barn was, had fallen down, and I saw all of this grass and whatnot.  I said gee whiz, the area wouldn't even grow grass (laughter), and now it's filled up with grass.
Story_ID: 611661
Speaker 1: We were talking about growing up.  Sir, what were some of the--can you describe the place you grew up in?  And you were describing it before we quit.  And can, can, can you tell us what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well, it was rather refreshing insofar as clean air is concerned.  You certainly lived out there, and there was not--the only odor you had was, was human odor because you, you know, you didn't have no restrooms.  You had to--whatever you did, it had to be done out in the open or behind a tree or whatnot.  It was--I think I was about twelve, maybe twelve or thirteen before the county or the state decided to put a toilet--that each farm family had to have a toilet.  And then me--it had to be so many distance away from the house.
Speaker 1: Was this an outhouse or a toilet?
Speaker 2: This was an outhouse, outhouse, outhouse.  Of course, the state--you had to pay fifty dollars, and the state came in and dug the outhouse.  It had to be a certain specification whatnot.  The only odor that you had was when my father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] used to have cattle, hogs and whatnot.  And he used to, we used to have to go and clean the cattle stable out and, and, and, and, and mule stable out.  Of course, those were odors that we used have.  And they used to pile that.  In the wintertime they used to pile it in the, just away from the barn.  And he used to build a compost with dirt and whatnot.  And in the spring of the year he used spread it on the land, and he used that as fertilizer.  But those are the type of odors that you would have in the process of growing up and whatnot.
Speaker 1: What, what kind of sights?
Speaker 2: When it came down to sight, we--actually, growing up, I only saw the world as the, as--I said my not--aunt, Aunt Cole [ph.], who used to--who married the, my stepmother's son [sic.].  They were the ones that lived next door. And then, of course, I--so, the next house was my uncle's house.  And the, the woodland, of course, was thick trees and whatnot, other than the cleared land of the farmland.  And as far as I was concerned, that was the world itself, you know, of course when you had to go to school and walking to school and walking back.  Of course, we didn't have no buses to take us to school.  We had to walk back.  So we used to pass farmland and whatnot.  And a lot of times the kids in the white buses, the buses would pass, and maybe we were walking on the road, and mud would splash up against the kids and whatnot.  Seemed like the driver used to do it purposely.  But anyway, we used to have to go in the field and whatnot to keep--you know, when you saw the bus coming, we'd have to go to the field and whatnot to keep from getting splattered up in mud and whatnot.  But they, they had buses carrying the white kids to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those are the sights that we used to see.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about sounds?  Any particular sounds?
Speaker 2: Sounds was the birds.  You get up in the morning, and there's always a crow flying over or some of the birds were singing and whatnot.  It was a beautiful sound, really.  I used to enjoy getting up in the morning and going out early and listening to the birds chir- sing and whatnot.  And then I had a habit--we had three hickory trees.  I used to get up early in the morning and go out before my brother got up, and the other brother and sisters go up, and go out and collect the hickories.  And of course, when they got up, there weren't any hickories left.  And I collected about, I guess about ten or fifteen thousand hickory nuts.  And I used to enjoy--enjoy doing that.  And I was small then.

Speaker 1: You said your, your house [in North Carolina], you got like one, was it-- was it one fireplace you had to start up or--
Speaker 2: We had one fireplace, and we had a, a kitchen.  And of course, the kitchen was detached from the house.  I used to make the fire in the, in the house and also the fire in the kitchen.
Speaker 1: So the kitchen was a separate building from the rest of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a separate building, but you had a little walkway to the kitchen.  Those were the way kitchens were built back in those days.  They weren't really connecting.  I guess it's because of the fact that sometimes the kitchen would catch on fire.  And people back in those days, they built a kitchen separate from the house.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when, when you ate your food, did, did you eat it in the rest--in the house, or--
Speaker 2: No, the kitchen.  We did--
Speaker 1: And you, you ate, you--
Speaker 2: --in the kitchen.
Speaker 1: --you ate, ate in the kitchen, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So the kitchen was pretty big.  It was big enough for--
Speaker 2: Well, it was--it wasn't that big, not, not when all the family got together.  You had to be--some of them were, you know, sitting all around.  (Unclear) table wasn't large enough when all the family got together.  But for somehow or another, we were--and see, there were five of us, and then they left; then there are five more.  So you had room for the, you know, those that were there.  We had room for them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when you had a family, all of them came together, you didn't have enough space.
Story_ID: 611663
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: How many what?
Speaker 1: Brothers and sisters, or.
Speaker 2: I had ten brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: And where do you fall--can you name them and, and put yourself in--now you're the oldest, right?  Are the oldest?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay, all right.  We'll start with first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I am next to the youngest.  I'm next to the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My oldest brother was James Welton Johnson.  James--I'm sorry--James Welton Spruill [James Spruill], my oldest brother.
Speaker 1: He was named after James Weldon Johnson?  Sounds like it.
Speaker 2: My mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill] might have named it, 'cause she used to read quite a bit.  She might have named him after that.  The next was Carrie Spruill [Carrie Spruill Whitaker].  Carrie was, of course, a girl.  She was the inspiration to all of us.  They didn't let schools for blacks to go any further than the seventh grade during those days.  And she went to Elizabeth City and finished high school in Elizabeth City, North Carolina.  That's about twenty-five miles from--no, it's about sixty miles from (unclear).  My father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] had a sister living there, and she stayed there, and she stayed there, and she became a teacher.  And she was sort of the inspiration to the rest of the family.  Then we had Johnson [Johnson Spruill]; he was the third.  Johnson was the third, Johnson, Elbert Johnson, Johnson Elbert Spruill, rather; he was the third.  And then there was William [William Spruill].  Now Johnson finished school in Columbia [North Carolina].  By then, a private company gave the county some buses to transport black kids to school.  And he was one of the--and of course, we had a man by the name of S.P. Dean [Simpson P. Dean], came down and started a school, Tyrrell County Training School [Columbia, North Carolina].  So he all built in the community, built the high school.  I understand that the county didn't put any money at all in the high school, but--
Speaker 1: This is one that Mr. Dean built?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: S.P. Dean, he built the school, and that's when Johnson went to school.  The, and the private organization gave them some buses to transport the black kids to school.  Then came William; William also finished that school.  It was called Tyrrell County Training School.  Then it was Estella [Estella Spruill]; Estella died at the age of three; she died at the age of three.  And then there was Elijah [Elijah Spruill]; Elijah spent a year, years in the [U.S. military] service.  He also finished Tyrrell County Training School.  Then there was Von Beulah, Von Beulah Spruill [Von Beulah Spruill Jordan]; she became an educator, and she was very dedicated.  And of course, by the time she came to finish high school, the county had--the state had taken over the school system, and they now had state buses.  So they had a big improvement in the transportation sys- system for black youngster.  Then there was Eva [Eva Spruill Pope]; she would also became an educator.  And then I, I, I was born after Eva, and then Albert [Albert Spruill].  Albert probably went further than any of the rest of them as far as education is concerned.  He got a doctorate degree at Cornell University [Ithaca, New York].  And he was the head of the graduate program at A and T College [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] until he died.  He was the, sort of the speaker for the whole family for years. You know, so, and of course, you had ten of us.  I think I've named ten of us.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And who did you say the school was built by, a man named--
Speaker 2: S.P. Dean.
Speaker 1: S.P. Dean, okay, okay, the Tyrrell County Training School (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tyrrell County Training School, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 611664
Speaker 1: From age three, you're doing farm work with, with your father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And now did you have time to pursue any other interests, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, when I became around twelve, my father permitted me to go out and hire myself out, and be, as he called, hire yourself out.  A gentleman wanted me to work for him.  And I worked for him a year making a dollar a day for twelve hours of work.  And of course, I had to walk there, and he, about two and a half miles from my house.  I used to walk there.  You started work at six o'clock in the morning, and you had one hour for lunch.  He had an area that he would feed me a lunch.  And of course, you lunched after you ate.  You went out in the barn and rested until one o'clock.  And then you go back to work, and you work until whatever you--you didn't get off until six o'clock, and you came back.  And he thought that was a lot of money.
Speaker 1: Now, now this is the summertime?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is summertime (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was summertime.
Story_ID: 611665
Speaker 1: So you had a chance to go to school nine months out of the year or ten months out of the year or--
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How, how, how, how many months did you go to school [Travis Elementary School, Travis, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: We started school in, in October.  Your white schools started in September.  We started in October because, you know, we had to get the craw--the cotton crop had to be, cotton had to be harvested.  And of course, and that was the way it was back in those days.  And your school, of course, ended.  We had--ended in, in April, and the white schools ended in May.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we really were two months behind the white school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so like seven months a year, huh, I guess?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So did you complete a grade a year, or?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What happened also, the seventh grade, I took a test in the sixth grade.  And they moved me from sixth grade to the eighth grade.  I made such a high score on the test until they, they didn't--I skipped the seventh grade altogether and went directly to high school [Tyrrell County Training School, Columbia, North Carolina], in the eighth grade, 'cause we had the eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh.  And after you finish the eleventh grade, you had an high school education.  You didn't go as far as twelve, twelfth grade.  Twelfth grade was added on the next year after I finished.
Speaker 1: Now the white kids, they went on to twelfth grade, right?
Speaker 2: They went on to twelve years, right.  It was only after I finished, which was, I think it was in '40 [1940], '41 [1941], or '42 [1942], '41 [1941], '41 [1941], in fact, that I finished, in '40 [1940], '41 [1941]--
Speaker 1: Didn't--
Speaker 2: --that they changed to the eleventh grade--twelfth grade.
Speaker 1: You know, when you think back on it, do you think that the, the white power structure is trying to make sure you didn't graduate from high school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you graduated, I mean, you had a paper, a piece of paper, but you haven't spent the mon- the amount of time that they did.
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you--
Speaker 2: You had--
Speaker 1: --if you only go to the eleventh grade though--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that would stop you from getting into a college even in some other state or something--
Speaker 2: That was considered--
Speaker 1: --wouldn't it?
Speaker 2: --you considered a high school diploma--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --when he--
Speaker 1: --after eleventh (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when you pass eleventh grade, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] understood.  If you read my book ['Harvesting the American Dream, From Farm to Classroom: The Spruill Journey,' Harrell S. Spruill], my agricultural teacher--that's how I got into Hampton.  My agricultural teacher had a father, son, daughter banquet.  And he invited the dean of the school [sic. dean of women] at Hampton down to speak.  And that's when I got acquainted with her [Flemmie Pansy Kittrell].  She was at Hampton.  And I talked to her about the work study program that they had there.  And she got me into Hampton on a work study program.
Story_ID: 611666
Speaker 1: Let me go back a little bit to growing up.  Can you give me an idea of--this is such a different life than people lead today.  Can you give me an idea of what your typical day was as a, as a, as a youth, you know, growing up on the farm [in North Carolina]?  When would you get up, and, and then what--say it's a school day.  Just tell me what you would do.
Speaker 2: Well, since I was sort of the--I was depended upon, on the family to make the fires, I would get up sometimes around four o'clock in the morning and make the fires and make sure that everybody was comfortable by the time they got out of the bed.  Then during the, the, the wintertime (unclear)--wintertime, of course, naturally, depends on what you were doing that day.  My father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] used to kill hogs, you know.  If it was the day that we're gonna kill hogs, I would also go out on the wood pile and make sure that the fire was made for the pots and whatnot.  And of course, so when the men start to killing the hogs they would have hot water.  And after you've done all those things, you get ready to go back.  I mean I would I get ready to go to school and to walk to school.
Speaker 1: About what time would that be now?
Speaker 2: Oh, you, you give yourself at least a hour and a half to two hours to walk the three, three miles to school.
Speaker 1: I mean, so when, when--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --when would--about what time did you start walking?  Or, what, what, what time--
Speaker 2: I would imagine--
Speaker 1: --did you have to be at school?  Okay.
Speaker 2: --about seven o'clock.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause you had to be at school by what time?
Speaker 2: Eight o'clock.
Speaker 1: By eight, okay.
Speaker 2: Eight or 8:30, something--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --like that had to be there.  And of course, I would make sure that--and of course, my, my brother, Albert [Albert Spruill], used to also go along, and Eva [Eva Spruill Pope], until she finished high--the three of us you walked together to school.  And of course, walking, we would also pick up other children.  Other children would be walking to the school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you like--you all would walk and talk and--on the way--
Speaker 2: Right, talk and whatnot.
Speaker 1: Okay, on the way to school.
Speaker 2: And coming back, after school was out, we walking together, you are also concerned about when you came home, my father used to always make it a point to make sure that you had work to do.  If you--he hadn't assigned you work, you should find some work to do.  And of course, he usually has work planned for you.  And we would--in the wintertime--we would go out in the woods.  And in the woods there, there's a lot of dark soil.  And we used to rake up the soil and pile it up for a compost.  And that's when the, the mules and you can take the, the stable, the stuff from the stables and pour out there on the compost.  Then you take the, the dirt from the trees and whatnot, the soil, the rich soil, and put on the compost.  And by the spring of year that compost is way up there pretty, pretty big because you've been out there every day after school and built that compost up.  And that was your job.  You found something to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, about when did school let out?
Speaker 2: School was--
Speaker 1: About what time did school--
Speaker 2: --let out I suppose about three o'clock was the typical time.  Of course--
Speaker 1: And so, in, in the wintertime it'd be dark when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --get off--
Speaker 2: --you find yourself time (laughter) go out there and do something, do something.
Speaker 1: Even in the dark, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, even in the dark, yeah, yeah, 'cause the first thing he would do is ask, "What have you done today?" When he came home.  That was his--, "What have you done today?"  Now, my father, even though he was a farmer, he had work at most of the white far- people's farm either digging ditches or killing hogs.  He was very good at killing hogs.  And he knew how, what to do, and whatnot.  And they used to give him a lot of the meats that they, you know, that they didn't eat, because it's a funny thing about the white culture; inside--anything inside the hog they wouldn't eat it.  And my father used to always--they used to always give that to him.  And my mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill] used to have jars and jars of chitterlings and hog feet and whatever inside, livers and whatnot, whatever was inside the hog.  Some of it she used to give away.  So he used to have a job.
Speaker 1: So she'd like, pickle those things?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 611667
Speaker 1: So how long would you work when got home from school?  Say, say you got home and you could see and everything.
Speaker 2: Well, you'd work at least an hour.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You'd work at least--you, you got--you, you had to do something so you could tell him [Spruill's father, Solomon Spruill, Jr.] what you had done.  And of course, he'd inspect it; he went out.  And he didn't go that particular time, but he went out there and to see what you had done.  He made sure that you weren't lying.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but he himself, when you got home, would be someplace else on the property or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he would be--
Speaker 1: --he might be doing-
Speaker 2: Not on--
Speaker 1: --some other job?
Speaker 2: --not on the--he had a job--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had a job.  Once the crop was--he had a job with the county [Tyrrell County, North Carolina].  He had a, he had a very good white friend that used to use him for grading roads in the roads and whatnot, and he used to drive machinery.  If he wasn't doing that, he'd be killing hogs for white people or digging ditches with the white farmers.  So he always had work to do.  He was sort of jealous--most of the people were jealous of him because he always had work to do, and people used to always call upon him to, you know, to work on their farm or whatever.  He was very honest too.  Other words, if he gave you a good day's work, you, you knew that he worked.  And he gave you a good day's work, and I suppose that's why they used to hire him.  But he always had work.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they knew they were paying for, for a real work when they, when they when they hired him.  They knew they would get their money's worth.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, then, okay, so, you would do your homework after the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we used to do our homework by a lamp, a lamplight.  You'd have a lantern and whatnot.  And of course, we did our homework.
Speaker 1: So I guess it would take about an hour to get home from school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a--okay, so you'd get home about 4:30 maybe or something, or--
Speaker 2: Four-thirty or five o'clock or whatnot.
Speaker 1: And then you'd work and do a hour's worth of work.
Speaker 2: Then you'd work about an hour.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Then you'd go in and, and you'd do your homework.
Speaker 1: Now when was supper served?  Was that, was that like--
Speaker 2: Well, now, now, now we did sit down and eat supper.  We all used to sit down together.  And that is one thing my mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill] used to make sure, that we all ate together.  As far as time, I can't pinpoint that.  But it was after we had worked--
Speaker 1: Okay, after you worked.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was it before you did your homework?
Speaker 2: Yeah, before we did homework.
Speaker 1: Okay, you had supper.
Speaker 2: After you worked out on the farm--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --worked out in the wood and whatnot.
Speaker 1: Then everybody'd come in and have supper.
Speaker 2: Everybody, right, came in and had supper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we did our homework.
Speaker 1: Did your homework, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Then, about what time did you get in the bed do you think?
Speaker 2: Well, it was soon after you did the homework, which was about 9:30, maybe, maybe 9:30 or 10:00 you were in bed or before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course, it got to be automatic getting up in the morning because I just got up.  I mean--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --no time clock or whatnot.  I just automatically got up.
Speaker 1: So there was--that's a good point, 'cause there wasn't an alarm; you had no alarm clock, or did you?
Speaker 2: No, no, no alarm clock--
Speaker 1: You just--
Speaker 2: --no.
Speaker 1: --just get up when--
Speaker 2: And we used to sleep in the bed, Al- Albert [Albert Spruill], my younger brother, and myself, and Elijah [Elijah Spruill] used to sleep, all three of used to sleep together.  And of course, my sisters used to sleep upstairs.  We had what they call a, well, a parlor where you had a piano.  (Unclear) to have a piano, a Victrola.  I used to call it a Victrola, whatnot.  And of course, you had your fancy chairs.  And, and this is where we used to consider the, well, the play room, you know.  And it was always--nobody went and stayed in there, but once you had company, you would bring them in there and listen to the Victrola and--so it was quite interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had the kind you wind up and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the kind, that's the kind we had, right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause, 'cause you didn't have electricity out there, right?
Speaker 2: No, you didn't have no electricity, no.
Speaker 1: And how'd you get your water?
Speaker 2: You had a pump; you had a pump.  And unfortunately, my father didn't want the pump at the house.  The pump was about twenty-five feet away from the house.  And of course, the pump used to freeze in, in the wintertime.  And you had to heat water and go out and un- unthaw the pump so you could, you know, pump water.  But--
Speaker 1: So you had to save some water to heat up so you could--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.  You--and then in the evening you always got enough water to, you know, to last overnight.  And certainly in, in case something happens you always had enough water, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you used to get all of that from the pump. And later on, I used to--my mother, she tried to persuade my father to have one at the house.  And he said, "No, it makes you lazy," (laughter), you know.  So that's what he used to do.
Story_ID: 611668
Speaker 1: Now he [Spruill's father, Solomon Spruill, Jr.] sounds like pretty tough and stern (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was very stern.  He was very stern.  I don't know--of course, I'm getting ahead of myself now.  But years later I tried to talk to him, and he didn't want, didn't want to hear what I had to say.  So, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Now what did he think about school?  Was he en- did, did he encourage you?
Speaker 2: He never--he, he always encouraged us.  And my mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill] used to be the inspiration insofar as education is concerned, but he never discouraged it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He never discouraged it.  If we had any homework to do, he used to make sure that my mother was available to help us out with the homework.  And she was very good at helping out with the homework, even though she had only finished the--hadn't very--went, went, went very far in school.  But he, he really didn't impede any of our education, yeah.  I'm, I'm also getting ahead of myself, because when Von Beulah [Von Beulah Spruill Jordan] finished high school and was getting ready to go to Elizabeth City State to college [Elizabeth City State Teachers College; Elizabeth City State University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina], he gave her twenty-five cents (laughter) to go to school.  If I hadn't of helped her, I don't know--she just probably wouldn't have made it.  She, she (unclear)--
Speaker 1: He gave her twenty-five cents?
Speaker 2: Twenty-five cents, and he told her, he said, "As long as you're here," he called food grub, "you have grub to eat, and you have a roof over your head." And said, "Now, this is what I'm gonna give you for--." He gave her twenty-five cents.  Now how I knew because for some reason or another, he always, always take me in the, in the cart with him, and he was taking her to the train station to catch the train to the Elizabeth City [North Carolina].  And he gave her twenty-five cents (laughter).  I'll always remember that.
Story_ID: 611669
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about school, now.  We, we haven't talked about that in detail, but how many students were at your school?  Now you were at the county (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The--
Speaker 1: --the Tyrrell County Training School [Columbia, North Carolina], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and this, and this is in high school?
Speaker 1: Now, no, grade school.  Let's start, let's, we'll, we'll, let's start with grade school.
Speaker 2: Grade school, okay.  In grade--
Speaker 1: Now what was the name--
Speaker 2: --school, you had about thirty children, and, and the desk there was no place to put your books and whatnot, so you had to put them down on the floor.  And we used to have this cold coal fired stove that you had to fire up.  And of course, you naturally sometimes you're hot, and sometimes it's cold in the, in the, in the wintertime and whatnot.  But that was all you knew about.  And then, of course, you were comfortable.  The teacher was a very good teacher.  She made sure that you learned.  I mean, she was very attentive to all the children.
Speaker 1: What, what was your teacher's name?
Speaker 2: Skinner--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --S-K-I-N-N-E-R.  And the principal was Baccor [ph.].  I think they were husband and wife.
Speaker 1: His name was--I'm sorry.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What was his--
Speaker 2: Baccor, B-A--I think it's B-A-R--B-A-R--B-A-C-C-O-R.  All I know is Baccor.
Speaker 1: Now he's black, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't have white teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'll, I'll, I'll tell you something about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what, what, what was the name of your grade school?  Was it--
Speaker 2: Travis Elementary School [Travis, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Travis, oh, okay.  So they didn't call it Travis colored school or anything like that or--
Speaker 2: No.  It was just--
Speaker 1: It was just Travis Elementary, okay.
Speaker 2: --Travis Elementary School.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how, how, how big was this stra- I mean, you had about thirty kids in your class or in the whole school?
Speaker 2: Well, what you had was, see, you had the, see, first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh, which mean that you had two classes in one particular room.  They had from first grade to seventh grade.  And you had about five rooms.  You had about five rooms.  I never did find out whether this, it was a state.  I guess the county built the school, 'cause it was a pretty, pretty good built school.  I guess the county built the school.  From my recollection, in some of your classrooms, there were two classes in one.  And there was also a, sort of a gymnasium.  And when I say gymnasium, where they used to have plays, a stage where you have plays and whatnot.  Of course, naturally they had--that room was used for a classroom too, which means that if you play in there, you had to move the tables and everything out when you had programs.  And my mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill] used to walk to any type of PTA [Parent Teacher Association] meeting that we had at night.  And she used to walk to also teacher's meetings; she used to walk out there.  And my mother was a very heavy woman.  She was about--when I was growing up, she weighed about three hundred pounds.  And to walk three miles, three hundred pounds (laughter) (unclear).  But she used to walk to every teacher's meeting.  And every conference that we used to have at that school she used to make sure that she was present there.  And it was interesting.  We--they were really dedicated teachers.
Story_ID: 611670
Speaker 1: Now did you, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, I, I loved it.  First of all, Carrie [Carrie Spruill Whitaker] at that particular time was teaching.
Speaker 1: That's your sister, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my sister Carrie.  And of course, she was an inspiration to the rest of us.  And of course, I knew that I couldn't make a living on the farm at an early age, and I knew that I did not want to be a farmer.  And of course, I, I said the only way that I'm gonna progress were, was to be, to get a good education.  And that's when I set my sights on a good education, even in elementary school [Travis Elementary School, Travis, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: So all the experience you had with your father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.], following him and, and, and shadowing his work, and that didn't inspire you to become a farmer?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, I always thought in terms the economics.  Farming, you couldn't make money (laughter).  And unfortunately, you needed money in order to survive and to move ahead.  Now I loved farming.  I love to see things grow.  But I got to be a realist in this.  And there wasn't enough money to even buy a farm.  And I certainly didn't want to do any sharecropping, 'cause you, you know the history of sharecropping (laughter), not very much--not very good.  So, I (unclear) at the early age I didn't want to be a farmer.

Speaker 1: Now what was your favorite subject in, in school?
Speaker 2: My favorite subject was math.  I, I loved math.  But unfortunately, when I got to high school [Tyrrell County Training School, Columbia, North Carolina], the dean of the school, S.P. Dean [Simpson P. Dean], used to teach math.  He was a very good math teacher.  But he had started this credit union [Light of Tyrrell Credit Union], and he was more involved in the credit union than he was teaching, and I became sort of lax in math.  I had a lot of problems out of English because one of the teachers that I had used to--I used to glorify this teacher.  She moved from the high school to A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] in my first, my freshman year.  And then we got this young fellow who wasn't interested in teaching.  He was just interested in bragging about what he'd done.  And he sort of crippled me in high school, and it was unfortunate.  But I made good grades, but grades is not what was important to me 'cause I knew I was going to college.  And he just didn't do a very good job of teaching and neither did my math teacher do a very good job.  Now I had a physics teacher, and I had chemistry teacher that was very good, and they really did a good job.  And it just shows when I went to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and took the test--because I had planned to go into premed at Hampton, and I passed the test for premed.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite teacher in, in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This, this was my favorite teacher, Mrs. Kroon [ph.]; she was my favorite teacher.  And she used to take pride in all of her students.  But unfortunately, I needed these other subjects in order to be well, well rounded.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I went to Hampton I didn't think I was well rounded, but I was willing to work hard and succeed.
Story_ID: 611672
Speaker 1: Now did you have a lot of friends growing up or, outside--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] used to keep us isolated.  The only people we could go see is my cousin, which lived a couple of doors from us.  But that's the only--and of course, it was sort of isolating.  And the kids used to tease us because my father was kind of--they called him stingy (laughter), didn't want to spend money and whatnot.  And they used to say, "You just like your father; you don't wanna do this, doing that--." And sort of, and, and we were sort of isolated.  The whole family was sort of isolated.
Speaker 1: Is, is that teasing that really caused you to change your name around, you know, switch your name around a little bit.
Speaker 2: I think that's, that also, that also.
Speaker 1: I mean, did you ex- it sound like may- maybe your brothers and sisters and maybe other people--
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: --kind of made fun of your father's stinginess and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, strictness.
Speaker 2: That was, that was, that was, that was it.  And my sisters and brothers--
Speaker 1: And then they, they would try to put you in it too (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they'd try to put me (laughter)--and then they, you know, there might have been a little jealousy because he used to always call upon me to do these things, you know.  He's always, "Harrell [HistoryMaker Harrell Spruill], you do this, and Harrell you do that."  And of course, you know (unclear) I got my brother, Elijah [Elijah Spruill], he's older; he's still staying there, and then you got Al [Albert Spruill], who's younger now.  And, but my father used to always to call upon me to do these things.  I remember very vividly I was behind the--working with him, pulling the grass and whatnot, and they were over in the garden.  And it was a big patch of corn between the garden and my father.  And everything got quiet.  And they were only supposed to be pulling weeds and pulling bugs and off the plants.  And apparently, he slipped over there and found them talking about him.  And lo and behold, he told, "I'm gonna beat you, and that's what he did."  He, instead of beating them, he waited until the next morning, you know, when they were partially undressed, and beat them the next morning because they were talking about him.  Probably was saying the (laughter), saying, saying the, the truth.  But they were talking about him, and he actually whipped them because of that, the next morning.
Speaker 1: How old were, were they then?
Speaker 2: They were--my brothers--I supposed they were maybe thirteen or fourteen, something like that, in that age group, in the age group.  And of course, I was, I suppose I was about eight or nine, eight or nine years old.
Speaker 1: Now would you get a lot of whippings in those days?
Speaker 2: I didn't get that many whippings.  No, I didn't get that many whippings 'cause I was very obedient, you know.  I, I, I so, so could read him and tell what he wanted, and then I used to try to do, you know, what he wanted.  The only thing I used to hate so bad--and of course, you haven't gotten to this yet--is holding out the cow.  We used to have these milk, milk cattle that we used to have to--the, the, the grass, no grass was growing on the, the acre of where the, where the house was.  And we had to carry the cow along the road, the side of road and let the cow graze on the side of the road.  And kids used to pass by and laugh at us because we were holding this cow.  And you spent hours holding that cow beside the road and let the cow eat.  And my younger brother, Al, and myself used to have to do that.  And we did it for years, and we had to do that.  That's something that we had to do.
Story_ID: 611673
Speaker 1: Now in high school, did you, did you have time to be involved in high school activities?  Now I know you were a member of New Farmers of America.
Speaker 2: New Farmers, yeah, New Farmers of America.  The--we did have activities, and my brother, Al [Albert Spruill], used to excel in that.  We had these, these conferences at A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], judging con- con- contests at A and T.  And my brother, Al, used to always excel.  He was a very good talker, and he always, always excel in those.  But we did go to A and T a couple of years and judge cattle, whether or not a, a cow was gonna be a good milk cow or whether or not a horse would be a good farm animal.  And we used to have judges and, and judges, judging contests for that.  And--
Speaker 1: I mean, how can you tell if, for instance, if--
Speaker 2: We used to go by the teeth, used to go by the teeth.  So many--I've forgotten all the details in it, but something has to do with the teeth (unclear) and it's gonna be a good farm animal.  And of course, the cattle, you go by the, the breast and the size of the breast and whatnot and the size of the teats, you know, used to go by that.  And, and I got to be pretty good at that.  But--and then, of course, I also recall the very first time I left Tyrrell County [North Carolina] was because of my agriculture teacher [at Tyrrell County Training School, Columbia, North Carolina], who is the same person that invited the teacher [Flemmie Pansy Kittrell] from Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] down.  He was the one that took us to A and T to the judging contest.  And he--that's the first time I'd ever been out of Tyrrell County, at the age of I guess about thirteen, age of thirteen.  And of course--
Speaker 1: Okay. So you'd never even been out of the county at that point and--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no (unclear)--
Speaker 1: So you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Gas was about eighteen cents a gallon.  I never will forget that (laughter).
Story_ID: 611674
Speaker 1: You said earlier your father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] had a car, a little car, right?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, my father--
Speaker 1: No, he didn't?
Speaker 2: --never had a--
Speaker 1: Oh, he never had a car?
Speaker 2: No.  He wouldn't even--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --ride in a car, even when we got cars.  He would rather drive the mule to Columbia [North Carolina], which was about six miles away.  I don't know whether or not it was because of his independence or what.  I recall going after--I came home, and my brother had a car because he was studying at--brother, Al [Albert Spruill], he was studying at Cornell University [Ithaca, New York].  And I passed him on the road.  He was walking to Columbia, and he wouldn't even get in the car and ride with me.  He'd rather walk; that's right; that's a fact.
Speaker 1: He kind of--he thought it would make you lazy if you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know his reason (laughter).  I don't know his reason, but he never--he didn't care that much about cars.  He'd rather ride the mule than get in somebody's car.  That's what he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Yes, he's a very independent person.  And he wanted--he was very controlling too.  He wanted to control everything.  It wasn't until 1947 that my sister, Von [Von Beulah Spruill Jordan], persuaded him to put electricity in the house.  You know, she was able to persuade him to put electricity in the house in 1947, 'cause she was teaching about thirty miles away, and she was able to do that.  And she also put plumbing and a bathroom in the house about that same time.  But I would imagine that he probably had to control it, control the people who did it (laughter) and everything, because he was, he was very good at saying, "This is my house, and if you can't do what I want you to do, there's the door."  He was very good at that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 611675
Speaker 1: Now did you play sports at all in high school [Tyrrell County Training School, Columbia, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No.  The only sports they had in Columbia [North Carolina] was, was basketball.  My brother, Elijah [Elijah Spruill], used to excel in basketball.  He was very good.  I thought maybe if, if he had gone to college, he probably would have been a professional basketball player, but he never did go to college.  He spent his time in the [U.S.] Navy, and he loved the Navy, in fact.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you were in the New Farmers of America.  That, that, that's like the black version of Future Farmers.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) the new, I guess the--
Speaker 2: The Future Farmers of America [National FFA Organization].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 611676
Speaker 1: Now, you graduated early, right, from high--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --high school [Tyrrell County Training School, Columbia, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I graduated.  Actually, I was just, I would have been sixteen--I graduated fifteen.  I would have been sixteen that August, but I graduated at the age of fifteen, and I suppose the eleventh grade had something to do with it.
Speaker 1: So you--
Speaker 2: But I did, I did get a certi- high school diploma and everything at the age of sixteen.
Speaker 1: So you were going to go to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], but from what I read, you, you went to work first.  You worked, you worked for a year?
Speaker 2: I, yeah, I stayed out of, stayed out of school.  I wanted to build my cash reserves up.  And I stayed out of school a year before I went to Hampton.  And I think I was--in the book ['Harvesting the American Dream, From Farm to Classroom: The Spruill Journey,' Harrell S. Spruill] I say I got this job working at the sawmill.  And I was making seventeen dollars a week, and I thought I was rich.  That was a lot of money.  I used to ride my bicycle the six miles to Columbia [North Carolina], and I mean that was a lot of work, believe me.  I used to work what they call a green alley.  And that's when the, the logs--the boards came directly off the log.  And you had to pick those boards up, and take them to a certain distance, and then come back and get the next board.  And, but I, I survived; I survived it, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really wasn't old enough, because you had to have a social security, you know, when you do it and when you did that.  And fortunately, the gentleman found out that I didn't have a social security.  He let me continue to work.  I suppose because I was a good worker he let me continue to work.
Story_ID: 611677
Speaker 1: So, at the end of a year, you went on to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went on to Hampton, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, what was Hampton like for you?  What, what, what was your first day like at Hampton?
Speaker 2: My first day at Hampton, they, they had some very good student helpers.  They really made us feel at home at Hampton.  And of course, it was the very first time I had had a physical.  They sent us to have a physical.  And I hadn't been to the doctor.  Let me see; I don't think I had ever been to a doctor--I really, I really don't know--until I went to Hampton and I got a physical examination and whatnot.  And, but before, my mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill] used to use the homemade remedies for colds and whatever else that we had.  Of course, I went to Hampton, I got the sort of royal treatment.  And then, of course, naturally, you're a freshman, they decided--now then, back in those days, freshmen, you were really a freshman they used the initiation (laughter).  They--you, you really went through a period of initiation.  And, but I felt welcome at Hampton.
Speaker 1: But what would you have to do to be initiated?  I mean what, what, what kind of things would happen to you?
Speaker 2: Well, the upperclassmen would come in and make you bow and scrape and all of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And as long as they weren't physical, then nobody said anything about it.  And that was all, all right.  You know, of course, it was later on that you joined the fraternities and sororities and the, the social groups that you began to, you know, do a lot of the crazy things that I thought was unnecessary.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the first year I was at Hampton, I took what they call a work study course.  I didn't take the full amount of courses.  Your full amount would have been at least fifteen semester hours.  I only took nine.  They wouldn't let work study students take any more than nine, and I took nine semester hours.  And the times that--I used to work in the, in the carving shop, and the times that I had free, I started to working in the cafeteria, because I had too much free time.  And, and I didn't have too much social life because I think in the book ['Harvesting the American Dream, From Farm to Classroom: The Spruill Journey,' Harrell S. Spruill] I said when I did go to dances, I was sort of afraid of girls and whatnot.  And I used to--one of the girls I used to like very well I was scared to say something (laughter), scared she might turn me down.  And I never will forget that, that girl.  But that's the way life was then that first year.  And then after the first year, I went in the [U.S. military] service, after the first year at Hampton.
Speaker 1: You started Hampton, I guess, in 1940?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-two [1942].
Speaker 1: Forty-two [1942]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '42 [1942].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: Well, you were--
Speaker 2: Sep--
Speaker 1: That's, that seems like longer than--let's see.  Well, you, you were born in '24 [1924], and you graduated at fifteen.  That's 1939, so, let's see.  And you, you went to Hampton in '42 [1942].  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was at Hampton.
Speaker 1: --what happened from, from, from, from '39 [1939] to '42 [1942]--I mean to, to '42 [1942].  That's like four years.
Speaker 2: No, you mean--what are you saying, by graduation when I--
Speaker 1: Yeah, what, what year did you graduate from high, from high school [Tyrrell County Training School, Columbia, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I think it was in '41 [1941].  I'm, I'm not sure, but I think it was in '41 [1941] that I graduated from high school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because seem to me the war [World War II, WWII] was just started. I can go back and get the records, but I think it was around '40 [1940], '41 [1941].  I stayed out a year.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It might have been '40 [1940], 'cause I stayed out a year--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --before I went to Hampton, before I went to Hampton.  I stayed out a year, and I graduated at fifteen.  But when I went to Hampton I was eighteen years old.  I graduated--
Speaker 1: Now that's three years--
Speaker 2: --in '50 [1950].
Speaker 1: --in between there (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I graduated--
Speaker 1: So what--
Speaker 2: --in '50 [1950], so--
Speaker 1: So what did, what did happen in that, you know.  Did you work in the sawmill that whole time, or did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I worked in the sawmill.  I worked in the sawmill.
Speaker 1: So you were there about three years then--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I guess.
Speaker 2: I don't recall working in the sawmill over a year, 'cause--
Speaker 1: Okay, so maybe--
Speaker 2: --when I first started working in the sawmill, I didn't, I didn't have a social security card.  You had to have a social security card in order to be sixteen--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in order to have a social security card.
Speaker 1: So you're like still on the farm during that period of time before--
Speaker 2: I was still staying--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --with my father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I still had to give my father a certain amount of money.  I think I was giving him about something like a five dollars a week for my staying there.  And of course, I used to buy food and whatnot.  As far as the time factor is concerned, I'd have to do some research (laughter) to get these, these dates into, in- (unclear).  But I do know--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --when I was working at--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that sawmill I didn't have a social security card.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I didn't get a social security card until I went to Hampton.  That's when I got a social security card.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were eight- eighteen then, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eighteen, yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you went to Hampton.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And--
Story_ID: 611678
Speaker 1: The next year, the very next year you, you enlisted in are--in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, they forced us (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the [U.S.] Navy, right?
Speaker 2: They drafted us.
Speaker 1: Drafted, okay.
Speaker 2: They drafted in April of the next year.  I was sent to one of the--I think it was Fort Monroe [Virginia], I think.  I'm not so sure it was Fort--it was just somewhere in Virginia.  And they--I was thinking they were gonna send me in the [U.S.] Army because I'd had this ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] training.  And I was thinking they were gonna send me to the Army, but the Navy needed some people, so they picked me and a few other guys to go into Navy.
Speaker 1: Now had, had you ever heard much about the Navy before you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, with my brother, my young--
Speaker 1: And you would--oh.
Speaker 2: Elijah [Elijah Spruill] was in the Navy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he talked so bad about the Navy in the beginning, but he got used to it, and he loved it.  But he told--
Speaker 1: Well, it changed after a while too, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, they used to--
Speaker 1: In those--
Speaker 2: --sleep in these, they used hammocks.  And, and, and of course, if one person fall, the whole group falls.  So when they used these hammocks, one--here's a person right here; there's a person right here; and, and when, you know, and, and if you're sleepy or you fighting the night, you know, when you touch that other guy, he touches some other guy, and first thing you know, the whole line of people are falling down (laughter).  And, and of course, they got, got rid of the hammocks, and they started sneezing--sleeping in bunks, in the bunk beds and whatnot.  So that's why, you know--he came through Annapolis [Maryland].  That's where he's, when he first came to Annapolis, then Navy.
Speaker 1: Okay, now the, lot of the black people I've interviewed, that were, that joined the Navy in those days say that all they want you to do is be a cook in the Navy.
Speaker 2: That's until Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] started.  Now Hampton started a diesel school even before I'm in the Navy.  The, Hampton was the centerpiece of the naval training school for diesel, and most of them were blacks, and that was before I went into the Navy.  Hamp- the Navy built a building at Hampton to train diesel, also they called them seamen, a person who worked on the boats and whatnot.  But they did establish a school at Hampton for the naval--for the Navy.  And within eight months after I went in service, I came back to Hampton to that school, naval diesel school, so I was back on the campus again.
Story_ID: 611679
Speaker 1: How were you treated initially?  I know this, this is segregated [U.S.] Navy and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, when I went to Great Lakes [Naval Station Great Lakes, Lake County, Illinois], it was really, you really had to toe the line.  It was segregated, and of course, you have these people there who are supposed to be company, company commanders who were trying to make a name for themselves.  And you had to make sure that you, you stayed in line with what's going on in the, in the Navy.  Of course, they used to require you to make up your bed.  They used to require you to, certainly, get up in the morning.  And when they say get up, you'd better get out of that bed.  And of course, they used to have these black guys who were making, trying to make some brownie points.  They were, we used to call them snitches (laughter), and they, they were pretty good at reporting you.  And, but you learn how to deal with them and to deal with the--
Speaker 1: How would you deal with--
Speaker 2: --white commanding--
Speaker 1: --how would you deal with the snitches?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, you make sure that you don't--stay out of his way.  You make sure that you stay out of his way.  I recall one time that, you know, I wasn't used to following, following crowds.  I hadn't done--this is something that was sort of new to me.  And we were on KP [kitchen patrol] duty.  And at Great Lakes we were in this dormitory, and it was my week to go on KP duty.  That's working in the kitchen.  They didn't allow you to talk to women or to even to wave at the females.
Speaker 1: Even walking around the, the base or--
Speaker 2: The females, right--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --walking around the, the, the base and whatnot.  So, we were--there were three or four of us were waving at these girls, and of course, I was the one that got caught.
Story_ID: 611680
Speaker 1: So you get in trouble for waving at, at some women [at Naval Station Great Lakes, Lake County, Illinois].
Speaker 2: I got in trouble for waving at the girls.  And the thing about it, I looked around and all my buddies were gone.  And I was the only one that was caught.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You're standing there waving (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm still waving.  And I said from then on out, I said when I get any--when it comes down to gangs, I make sure that I have done something, you know.  I will make sure that I have--and, and when I'm caught, I have done something on my own and not follow somebody else's advice.  So I had to--they caught me.  I had to go around--I think they gave me, I think around ten hours of extra duty.  And that meant that you had to carry a rifle, a loaded rifle, over your head for a certain length--certain many hours.  And you had the--they have a backpack, and you had a guard around there, looking at, making sure that you kept that gun over your head.  And I had to do that for twelve hours, not continuously, but I think I, I think I did two hours at a time.  I think I did that, and I did it.  And from then on, I, I, I sort of isolated myself (laughter), and I made sure that I don't follow gangs.  Whatever I do, it's me; I have done it myself and not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now how did the--
Speaker 2: --because of somebody else.
Story_ID: 611681
Speaker 1: Well how did [U.S.] Navy treat you for the most part at Great Lakes [Naval Station Great Lakes, Lake County, Illinois] and in training?  I mean, did, did they--
Speaker 2: After I left Great Lakes, Great Lakes--I came--
Speaker 1: Well, well, wait a minute.  Don't, let's not have you leave yet, 'cause--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I wanted to ask you some questions about Great Lakes.  Did you, were you familiar with the guys that are the in band at Great Lakes [Great Lakes Navy Band]?  'Cause they had one of the greatest jazz bands in, in the history there with--
Speaker 2: Well, we used to go--they used to play at what they call happy hours.  But I'm, I'm not familiar with--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, the individual.
Speaker 1: 'Cause guys like Clark Terry, and there was a, there was almost an all-star black band--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at Great Lakes--
Speaker 2: They probably--
Speaker 1: --during the time that you were there.  Now they toured the country.  They, they might not have been on the base--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you were there, but I don't--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Had, did you hear about them at all, the band?
Speaker 2: I probably did, but I wasn't e- even into that; I, I really wasn't.  They treated us very good.  The, the, the people in the community used to invite us to their houses.  We used to have--I think that was when the USO [United Service Organizations] was first organized.  And you could always go in town in Chicago [Illinois] and get a meal or go to the movie.  Most of the time that I--extra time I used to spend in the movie and going to the USO and whatnot.  But--
Speaker 1: I can imagine now--correct me if I'm wrong--you didn't go to the movie much when you were growing up.
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't go to the movie at all--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --except Columbia did have a theater, but you sat up in the, up in what they call a balcony.  And you--father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] didn't--
Speaker 1: This is Columbia, North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, Travis [North Carolina] was about--
Speaker 1: Travis, okay.
Speaker 2: --six miles from Columbia, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's Columbia, North Carolina--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --six miles.  That was the, I guess you call it the, the capital of Tyrrell County [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: County seat.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So this is where you went for all of your supplies and whatnot.  And they used to have a theater in Columbia.  And of course, you sat way up in the balcony.  You didn't sit downstairs.  And you didn't go to the mo- you know, you couldn't see very much (unclear).  Most of the time when I recall going to the movies when I was at Hampton, Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] used to have their own movies and whatnot, own theaters and whatnot, so they were very good at that.
Story_ID: 611682
Speaker 1: Great Lakes [Naval Station Great Lakes, Lake County, Illinois], now you were there for what, how long, a few months?
Speaker 2: Sixteen weeks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was (unclear)---let's see, I went in service in April, so I was there until about October.  I think that's when I went down to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] to the diesel school at Hampton.  And I spent two months--two months there.  Hampton, we left Hampton in April of forty--'44 [1944].  I think it was, April '44 [1944] and moved to Great--moved to Corpus Christi, Texas.  And that's where I spent time there, at Corpus Christi, Texas.  I recall, and it's in my book ['Harvesting the American Dream, From Farm to Classroom: The Spruill Journey,' Harrell S. Spruill], there was a rape in, in the community.  And all of the soldiers were--I mean all of the solders--all of the sailors were taken out and lined up.  And this white girl came by.  I guess she called herself trying to identify the sailor.  And she didn't find anybody.  And come to find out, it was a off-duty sailor, white sailor, that had raped the, raped the girl.  That's what they found out.  But it was really segregated.
Speaker 1: So, so they lined you all up and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --she walked through and looked at--
Speaker 2: She walked through and looked each one of us in the eye to see whether or not you were the person.
Speaker 1: Now she knew full well it wasn't--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --one of you anyway.
Speaker 2: --oh, she knew; oh, she knew.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But this is the way--
Speaker 1: But how did that make you feel, being treated like that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I was sort of used to that.  You know, I knew--I, I accepted segregation.  And it was nothing I could do about it, 'cause I knew if I rebel, I would get in trouble.  And so I just accepted that.
Speaker 1: Now did they call you the N word in, in the [U.S.] Navy?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  That was, that was something that you listened to, and you don't hear it.  It's something you--I recall going to, traveling to Texas.  And they used to have this--before you cross the Mason Dixon Line, they, everybody was mingling together.  But after you cross the Mason Dixon Line, the whites moved to one car, and the blacks moved to another, and then they pull, used to pull this string across to make sure that we were segre-separated.  But other--
Speaker 1: And so if you, you were in the same car, they'd put up a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --barrier up, a curtain up or something.
Speaker 2: Right.  You wouldn't mingle together.  You didn't mingle together on a train, even on a train.
Speaker 1: So what was the trip to Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: There was, there, I was going (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) interesting in the fact that you--
Speaker 2: --from Hampton.  Huh?
Speaker 1: No, I'm just saying is the--was the trip--I mean, getting--going to Chicago must have been like a new experience, being in an integrated situation--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I guess.
Speaker 2: Right, it was an integrated situation, but you--in the Navy you had--your commanders were still whites.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And you still abide by, you know, the law, you know, because it was segregated.  It was a segregated society.
Speaker 1: Well, I know the Navy was--yeah, I just want to make this point.  Anybody watching this, the Navy was still segregated, but in, when you went into Chicago, you could go to the movies or do whatever without having to--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, you could go to the movie and whatnot.
Speaker 1: You could do--and you, you weren't necessarily segregated in the City of Chicago, right?
Speaker 2: No, not in the city, not in the city.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But I'm saying you're on the base, and you abide by the Navy regulations and whatnot.
Speaker 1: Which was still--
Speaker 2: And the Navy was highly segregated.  Now, when I moved down to Texas, when I was going down to Texas, as I say, they pulled the line to make sure that you didn't mingle with white sailors and whatnot or even the white crowd and whatnot.  And of course, as far as the N word is concerned, you accepted that.  It's just one of those things that was a part of it, a part of your life.
Story_ID: 611683
Speaker 1: And, of course, down there, well, I started out as a, a rank of a fireman first class.  That's when I finished the diesel school [at Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  The [U.S.] Navy had some very good educational ways of moving up as far as the rank is concerned.  They had--you had to take sixteen tests in order to qualify for the next rating.  And they gave you pamphlets to study.  And I studied these pamphlets and took these tests and passed the test so that I could be recommended by my superior.  And that's when I moved from fireman first class to auto- automo- automo- auto mechanic.  They call them the auto mechanic the first--third class, third class.
Speaker 2: Now what, what, what is a fireman in the Navy?
Speaker 1: Fireman, it's a pay--it's, it's, it's a way of selecting the pay grade.  You're not a regular fireman.  It's, it's a method of finding out, you know, whether or not you make more money or whatnot.
Speaker 2: It's a title that doesn't really--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --have much to do with the occupation?
Speaker 1: Had nothing--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to do with fire, firemen and whatnot.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then, of course, motor machinist and of course, motor machinist third class is what I, after I passed those sixteen tests.  Okay, now, in another year, if I pass more tests, I can be recommended for another rank.  And that means that I have to, I've got to study the book and pass these other tests so I can be put on the list for my commander to recommend me for a higher, a paying grade.  And that's what I did, and I was made motor machinist second class.  And I stayed down there until they wanted us to take special training to go to California and then to the Hawaiian islands.  And we were going to be on the first wave of transporting troops to invade Japan.  And that's when they dropped the atomic bomb.  And when they dropped the atomic bomb, we were con- considered surplus.  And that's when we came back to California, back to Norfolk [Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia] and was discharged.  I might be moving too fast now.
Story_ID: 611684
Speaker 1: So what you're saying is, once they dropped the atomic bomb, the invasion plans were sort of nullified--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --made moot--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or null and void.  There's no reason to invade now with--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --'cause the Japanese gave up.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Though there, though there was an occupying force in Japan.  It was the [U.S.] Army basically, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but--
Speaker 1: No need to invade.
Speaker 2: --they had assembled at least a million men off the Hawaiian island.  And of course, I was going to be one of the engineers in one of transports to transport the troops from the ships to the island.  And I was supposed to be an engineer there.  And they were--you were supposed to be taking special training in the Hawaiian island.  That's when they dropped the atomic bomb.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we were spared that.
Speaker 1: Now, at the time, like, what did you think about the atomic bomb.  You know, I mean did you have any thoughts about it?
Speaker 2: Well, it saved our lives, that no doubt about it.  They had expected to lose at least four or five hundred thousand people.  Even to, to invade Japan, they expected to lose that many.  And I'm sure, being among the first waves, I would have been gone too.  But we--that's, that's what they anticipated.  They didn't want to lose that many men.
Story_ID: 611685
Speaker 1: You were discharged.  It, it was in forty--?
Speaker 2: I was discharged in, see, '46 [1946].  I think it a, a, was it April of '46 [1946]?  Yeah, April of '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: So you were discharged in, in Norfolk [Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia] or, did you say, or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Norfolk.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: It was in Norfolk, Virginia, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did--
Speaker 2: I was discharged there.  And then I came home, left the [U.S.] Navy and came home.  I started to stay in the Navy, but the type of life that the, the Navy had didn't really appeal to me.  You, you get into the point where you really don't care for things.  You know, you, you gotta be careless.  And I, I cared for people, and I wanted to be able to live in a society where I cared for other people.  And the, the Navy, that, that, that doesn't exist.  And that's why I came out of the Navy and decided to go back to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay, so now you got the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] to pay for it, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now I don't have to work, work study.  When I came back to Hampton, and of course, I was--I didn't have that many core- I think I had eighteen semester hours.  And I had taken this course to--I mean taken the test for premed.  But I had spent so much time in the Navy, and I wanted to get on with my life, and becoming a premed would take me about ten years really to get established.  So I said well, I'm gonna follow my field in the Navy, and I'm gonna be a diesel mechanic.  And that's when I went back to Hampton to finish diesel.  And I studied diesel for three years at Hampton and finished with a diploma and a certificate.  I didn't go into industrial education.  I decided that I was gonna open up a business.  And, and another fellow and myself had located some land in Portsmouth, Virginia, and we were gonna go in business together.  Am I going too ahead, too fast?
Speaker 1: Well, no, not necessarily.
Story_ID: 611686
Speaker 1: Well, let me go back just to one story.  I know that I read that you had been sending money back to your mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill].
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: So that's a kind of a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You want to tell that story?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.  I--when I was in, in the Hawaiian island, of course I had so much time on my hand I decided to get a extra job.  And I worked in this barbershop, and it paid very good money in my spare time. And of course, the, guy--I was sweeping the barbershop, you know.  And they left tips and whatnot, and I made quite a bit of money.  And I was sending all this money back to my mother.  And when I got home (laughter), I asked my mother, "Where is the money?" 'Cause I had planned to put the money in the credit union, you know (unclear), you know (unclear) and whatnot.  She said, "Harrell [HistoryMaker Harrell Spruill], let me tell you.  I had to send Von [Von Beulah Spruill Jordan] and Eva [Eva Spruill Pope] to school."  And she said, "I used your money to send Von and Eva to school."  Oh, did I get angry.  I was so angry I didn't know what in the world--I, I, I, I think I stayed in bed (laughter) for just--I, I, and I thought about that thing; I thought about.  I said, "Why did you have to--why didn't, why didn't you tell me?"  So she said that she needed the money, and Von had to finish school.  She was teaching.  She didn't have no way of--you know, she was working her way through school [Elizabeth City State Teachers College; Elizabeth City State University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina].  And I felt bad about it because Von came home, and she had saved most of the money, and gave me most of the money.  And I felt, I really felt bad.  Now here I am trying to help other people, and I can't even help my sister.  And I really felt bad about it, and so much so, until the money that I had left, I put it in the credit union.  I put that money in the credit union, and do you know that credit union went bankrupt?  Around three thousand dollars back in (laughter) 1946 was a lot of money.  I put that mon- what money I had in the credit union.  The credit union went bust, and I lost everything.  I didn't for, for, I think it was thirty years I got the notice saying--no, I got three hundred.  They said, "Your last payment."  I got three hundred out of the money that I had saved over the year, and that's all I got.  And I said, "Maybe that punish--that's God making it--punishing me for complaining about helping Von."  And that's what--that, that, that's the way it end and--
Speaker 1: What a story.  That's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But fortunately, I guess, well, you, you had the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].  You were able to finish Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] without (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --having to--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I was able to, oh yeah, able to--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --finish Hampton.
Speaker 1: Okay now--
Speaker 2: I went on back to Hampton, got my degree.
Story_ID: 611687
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] or any mentors or people that, that took special--
Speaker 2: Mr. Tiger [ph.] was the auto mechanic teacher.  He was my favorite teacher.  The--I also had some--Dr. Kittrell [Flemmie Pansy Kittrell], who was the--I didn't meet with her over a couple of times, but she was also a favorite person of mine when I was at Hampton.
Speaker 1: Now, now what did she teach?
Speaker 2: She was the dean of--she, she, she--
Speaker 1: She was dean.
Speaker 2: --was the dean of--she was the one that came down and inspired me to go.  She was a dean when I went back to Hampton.  She was a dean.  But she was--I had thanked her when I came back.  And I told her I don't know what my life would have been, had it not been for her getting me into the school there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when did you graduate from Hampton?
Speaker 2: I got my B.S. degree in 1952, but I got a certificate and the diploma in 1949.  Yep, it was, I think that was the same year that my father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] died, in nineteen forty--'49 [1949].
Story_ID: 611688
Speaker 1: Your father died, from what I read, he, he was working in the fields and died (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he was working in the field.  And my mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill] saw the mule up there to the post, and she went to see what was going on.  And he--she went by the haystack, and he was dead by the haystack.  She tried to revive him, and that was it.  He had a heart attack, yeah, yeah.  You know, before he died, I came back.  After I came from Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], I came back and told him that I was gonna work with him from April until I went back to Hampton.  And he was very proud of me and the fact that I was gonna work for a while and wasn't gonna charge no money.  I was gonna help support the family.  And I was gonna do it.  There into the work, I had worked about a month and a half, and he and I was getting along very well.  Then my sister, Eva [Eva Spruill Pope], who was graduating from Elizabeth City [Elizabeth City State Teachers College; Elizabeth City State University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina], called me and said that she wanted to come home, and she wanted me to come up and pick her up in the car.  Now, instead of me telling him that I was going to leave and pick her up, I didn't tell him.  I just went on and picked Eva up.  When I came back he was furious.  And I, I said well, what--I said to myself, "What is wrong?"  'Cause we didn't have no social contact to find exactly why, you know, he was angry.  He just acted upon--you know, this is the way he just act; he just acted a--and I didn't--
Speaker 1: You could tell by just his demeanor--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --that he was angry.
Speaker 2: --that he was, he was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --very angry.  And I started to getting things straightened out so I could go in the field with him.  And he picked up this, what they call a single--swingletree.  That's the part which the mules pull, hooked to the plow.  And I thought the guy was gonna hit me with (laughter)--so, instead, instead of, of me con- trying to retaliate, I decided to move out of his way.  And from them on out, I had no contact.  That--
Speaker 1: But, I mean, did he say something to, to you?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: He didn't say nothing.
Speaker 2: He didn't say anything.  He just--
Speaker 1: He just picked this up and--
Speaker 2: --attempted--picked the thing up, attempted to--I, I caught--I said, I thought he was gonna hit me; I thought he was gonna hit me, didn't even--
Speaker 1: So, 'cause he actually came towards you with it?
Speaker 2: He actually came toward me with the swingletree; he actually came towards me.  And I just moved out of the way 'cause I anticipated what he had planned to do.  And that night, I asked him if I could talk with him.  And he said, "What do you want to talk to me about?"  I said, "Well, why is it that we can't sit down and talk to you with a civil conversation?"  And he told me that, "There is the door.  If you don't obey me, you don't live here."  So the next day I had to leave.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I had to leave, and I went down to my sister [Carrie Spruill Whitaker], who was (unclear) lived in Swan Quarter [North Carolina].  She taught in the school system down there.  I had to stay until I went back to school at Hampton.  And of course, I couldn't stay at his house.
Speaker 1: What, in retrospect, do you have any idea what he was up--he didn't want you to go pick your sister up--
Speaker 2: He did--
Speaker 1: --or what, what was it?
Speaker 2: He wanted to control everything.  I should have told him that I was gonna pick up my sister, and I wouldn't be working for a while.  I guess he had planned everything out for what I was gonna do that particular day.  That's the only thing I could--'cause he didn't tell me that.  That's the only thing I can think of.  But he was very angry, and, and I had to leave, because if I had stayed there, he and I would have clashed, and I didn't want that to happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I never did see him again until he was dead.  He died that--I never did have a time, a chance to tell him goodbye, or we never did have a, had, did have a chance to resolve the conver- the conversation, never did.  He never did.  He was very controlling, and he expected to have his way in everything, everything.  But my mother loved him, and she loved him.  And when he died, people came to court her.  And she said no, there was only one man for her, and that was Solomon [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] (laughter).  But I, I, I love him even in his death, more than I did through--be- before he died, because the things that he taught me was so important to me in my life, so important.  But I didn't realize it that particular time.  But I enjoy the things in which he taught me while I was, did stay with him.  I, I think I'm living the type of life that he would have wanted, want me to live, you know.
Story_ID: 611689
Speaker 1: So you went to live with your sister [in Swan Quarter, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And now she's, she's like, not too far from where your par--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --she wasn't that far.
Speaker 1: This is Eva [Eva Spruill Pope] or, or--
Speaker 2: Carrie [Carrie Spruill Whitaker].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, Carrie, okay.
Speaker 2: She was Carrie.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is--
Speaker 2: She taught down in that Hyde County [North Carolina], which is right next door to Tyrrell County [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She taught there, and I stayed there.  I think, I think it happened in May.  I stayed there from May until September, and then I went on to school in Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] in September.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, now did you finally start to have a social life when you, when you stayed with your sister?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I didn't have too much social life.  And of course, it was rather boring there because she had a little farm.  And I used to take care of her plants and whatnot, so that did keep me--give me something to do during the, you know, during the day.  But there wasn't too much of a social life in the--the only contact I had with my mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill], once in a while I used to come home and see her.  And, but very seldom do, did he [Spruill's father, Solomon Spruill, Jr.] and I, we'd speak and that's all; that's all it was, we'd speak.
Story_ID: 611690
Speaker 1: So you went on to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] then for, to finish your, your degree.
Speaker 2: No.  Then I finished my diploma and certificate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I stayed out a year before I went back to Hampton to get my teaching degree--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in industrial education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I stayed out a year and came back home and took care of my mother's farm, because my brother, William [William Spruill], was staying there after my father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.] died.  And he was the one that sold all of the kid--all of the pigs, the cattle, the wood, and then moved back to Richmond [Virginia] with his family.  And he was going to do that and not even tell my mother [Georgiana Wynn Spruill] anything about it.  And I stayed home to get her acquainted with the farm life, and I took care of the farm until the following September.  Then I went back to Hampton to get a degree.  And--
Speaker 1: So your brother just came and just basically sold everything that he could sell and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --left your mother there--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --by herself.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he sold trees that my father wouldn't--had been, maybe been around for three hundred years.  And he sold cattle that they had around there for milking and whatnot.  He sold hogs that my father had around there.  He sold all that.  Because, see, he was being paid.  When my father died in '49 [1949], he was being--he, he said he would come home and farm.  And those that were working and, and getting a salary decided to contribute because he was--decided to give up his job in Richmond and come down and take care of my mother.  And of course, I wasn't working anywhere, so therefore I couldn't even get in the conversation because I couldn't contribute.  There was about--let's see; there's Eva [Eva Spruill Pope], Von [Von Beulah Spruill Jordan], Carrie [Carrie Spruill Whitaker], and Johnson [Johnson Spruill] was sending a certain amount of money home to give William so he could take care of my mother.  And after a year or two, he decided that he was gonna go back to Richmond.  And this is when I stepped in.
Story_ID: 611691
Speaker 1: We're at 1952 now, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you're, you're about twenty-eight years old, I guess, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you, you're teaching, started teach- now where, where did you teach first?
Speaker 2: Well, after I finished Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] I got two offers.  One was at Alcorn University in Mississippi [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi] to establish all auto mechanic program.  And the other one I got was at a high school in Rockville, Maryland.  I chose the one to Alcorn State in Mississippi, because I thought maybe that I could do a better job in establishing the auto mechanic program down there.  I had to start it from scratch.  And I went down there in July.  And I wondered why I was--he wanted me to come down there so early.  But I think really what happened, he wanted to find out--he wanted to check my credentials.  He wanted to find out whether I could actually do the work.  So he gave me this cement mixer.  I think I have it in the book ['Harvesting the American Dream, From Farm to Classroom: The Spruill Journey,' Harrell S. Spruill].  It was a old cement mixer.  I say it was made in 19--1917, but it was pretty old, one of the first ones they made.  And I fixed that thing up, and it was--you know, painted it and everything.  And it--they used that thing.  Matter of fact, when I stayed there for a couple of years, and they were using it when I left.  It was an old cement mixer.  And I think I told you that there they gave us all the equipment.  After then they gave us all the equipment that they--we needed, because they didn't want the kids to be going to the white school, and they, this, they really equipped the auto mechanic shop up.  I design- devised de- devised a program, a four year program for industrial education, emphasis on auto mechanics, body finish spray painting.  And the first year I had thirteen students.  I was also hired to take care of, maintain the equipment.  In other words, they had their bus to travel to take the athletic basketball team to Jackson [Mississippi] and whatever schools they were playing.  And they wouldn't buy anoth- another bus.  As matter of fact, they didn't have enough money to buy another bus.  They were always given enough money to repair, but not to buy anything new.  So I had to make sure that those things were running, all of the lawnmowers on the campus.  Of course, then you had your, your farming was the thing that they did too.  I'd take care of all the tractors.  And of course, I hadn't trained any students, which means that I had to do most of the work myself, and that was quite straining to one person.  But anyway, I did it.
Story_ID: 611692
Speaker 1: And then on top of that, they said that I had to teach a course in mathematics [at Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi].  And for one semester I taught college mathematics.  I said, "Now gee whiz, now they don't realize that some mathematics I had to struggle to get through at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]?"  But apparently, they looked at my (clears throat)--grade point [grade point average] and found out that I could teach math.  But anyway, I struggled through that for a semester.  And after a semester they got, they, they hired--no, the next year.  I taught it for two years--a, a year.  And the next year they got enough money to hire a professor, and I didn't have to teach it but one year.  But that was quite a taxing on me, because that meant that I had to change over.  I had to change clothes to teach auto mechanics body and finish spray paint.  Then I had to have these kids to come down to the classroom, and I had to--I couldn't sit up there in my clothes that I taught auto mechanic in, so I'd change clothes.  And that became quite a, quite a thing to do.  So, it was rather taxing, but, and of course, I had to study real hard because I had to make sure that the students were, were learning something.  I didn't wanna send no crippled student out.  You know, I had to study ahead of the student to make sure that they learned something out of my classroom.  And some of them said they did learn something out of the classroom.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, so you were in charge of the motor school for the whole (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --the, the whole, the, the school as well--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and maintain the buses.  How old was the bus that you had to work on?
Speaker 1: The, the, there were some that were given to--almost, almost as old as that old cement mixer that I was telling you about.  Later on, I understand after I left there they got some new buses.  But while I was there, I had to, even sometimes, you used to even have to ride the bus in order to keep the bus running.  Because something that's been used and used and used, you can't do but so much repairing.  I don't care what it is.  It was quite taxing.
Speaker 2: So you had trouble with parts breaking off and bolts and stuff like that and like that?
Speaker 1: Well, you, you had problems with that, yeah.  Yeah, but you had to be so careful that you don't break nothing (laughter), you know, inside--
Speaker 2: That seem--people that have used cars know that the, the repair may look simple, but when you started--
Speaker 1: Yeah, because--
Speaker 2: --something might--a screw might strip or a bolt break off or you, you know, 'cause it's old.
Speaker 1: Yeah. You had to be very careful because you can't put but so much pressure on a bolt, putting a bolt in, because you put too much pressure, you're gonna break it off.  And then what's gonna happen, you're gonna have to, to dig back in there and get that bolt out of there in order to put something in there, because that's pretty important.  So I never had that problem.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, I was always--well, first of all, today they haven't because you got these, these wrenches automatically, you know, that, impact wrenches they call them, you know, today, but you didn't have that many back in those days.  You know, you had to use it by hand.  And you, you didn't have but so much strength.  So, but today you got those impact wrenches, and you can put all kind of pressure on a bolt and whatnot.  So it's different today.

Speaker 1: How long were you, were you at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] then?
Speaker 2: At--
Speaker 1: I mean at--
Speaker 2: --at the Alcorn [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Alcorn State, yeah.
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Alcorn State.
Speaker 2: I went there in July of '52 [1952], and I left October of '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now did--were there any significant stories about Alcorn?
Speaker 2: Well (laughter), I, I enjoyed the people, working with the people down there, but the president [Jesse R. Otis] was the, the type of person that would fire you if he didn't like what you said or didn't like what--the way you looked.  And he would give you a thirty day notice.  And of course, I, I didn't want to live under that type of situation.  So, when I was offered this job at Bates [Wiley H. Bates High School, Annapolis, Maryland], I decided that I was gonna--tenure, they offered me tenure and everything.  I decided to leave there and come up here.  But the president was very--was the type of person that you had to stay in, in favor with.  He got people who always catered to him.  Before I left he offered me a mighty big salary to stay there, but I was afraid to stay.  Matter of fact, I'd already given him the notice that I was gonna leave, and I'd already signed the contract to come up here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you came up to Bates, this Bates High School in Annapolis [Maryland], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, in 1954.
Speaker 2: It was October of '54 [1954].
Story_ID: 611694
Speaker 1: Now you met your first wife, it was in, in Mississippi, or, or was it here?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Here?
Speaker 2: I met (clears throat) I met Claudine [Claudine Spruill] she was a teacher at Alcorn A and M College [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi].  She was a chemistry teacher there.  And we met, and we married after I left Bates [Wiley H. Bates High School, Annapolis, Maryland].  I mean, I'm sorry--after I left Alcorn.  We married at her house in, in Dermott, Arkansas--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Dermott, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Now there's a story here, from what I, I have here, that, that the, there's an extravagant wedding.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And there were some--and so, tell, tell, tell me about this extravagant wedding.
Speaker 2: This was an extravagant wedding.  She--the, the, the--I had never seen this before.  I had never seen--matter of fact, I hadn't been to that many weddings.  The carpeting was laid down.  We walked on the carpet and everything.  My brother, Al [Albert Spruill], and my sister, Von [Von Beulah Spruill Jordan], came down to the wedding.  And we had this big wedding.  And the only thing that--then we had went to this hotel (laughter) in Greenville, Mississippi, and that's where we stayed overnight, because I thought that she had money (laughter); you know, we could stay at this big hotel.  And she had--
Speaker 1: Well, who was initially paying for the wedding?  Who, who--
Speaker 2: She paid for the--her mother paid for the wedding.  The mother paid because father, he didn't, he didn't want her to get married.  So he paid--she paid for the wedding.  And after we got married, I guess they thought that I had money, and I'm supposed to take her to this big hotel.  But I didn't have no money, and so, but we went to this hotel.
Speaker 1: So this is a black hotel in Greenville, of course, 'cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was black hotel--
Speaker 1: --Mississippi is segregated, 'cause--
Speaker 2: --in Greenville.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a black hotel in Greenville.
Speaker 1: But it's an expensive hotel, huh?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't no expensive hotel (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right, all right.
Story_ID: 611695
Speaker 1: We couldn't stay at an expensive hotel.  That's where we stayed overnight [in Greenville, Mississippi].  And she [Spruill's first wife, Claudine Spruill] persuaded me--she didn't have that much money, and I didn't have that much money.  And I had this '52 [1952] Ford.  We were gonna vacation down in Florida.  I guess she wanted to tell her--the people that, you know, the teachers that she was working with, that vacationed down in Florida.  We got down in Florida, neither one of us had that much money.  I didn't have no credit card.  She had a credit card belonged to her father.  And we--I had to find a place to stay, and it wasn't no hotel.  We didn't have enough money to stay at the hotel.  We stayed at, find a rooming house down in Florida.  That's where we stayed, and we stayed there for a week.  And the only thing we did was go out on the--look at the water.  We didn't have enough money to (laughter), to go any, you know, in any expensive place.  The lady used to cook for us the time that we were there.  And after that we were--after the time was up, I put her on the bus to go to, I think it was, she was teaching at somewhere in Alabama (unclear)--or was, it was Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama] I believe it was.  She was teaching at Miles College in Alabama.  And she--put her on a bus to go there.  I came back to Annapolis [Maryland].  And it was off and on.  I got this apartment at, on Spa Road, and that's where we stayed.  She used to come up one, on Christmas, and maybe sometimes after school.  And that went on for about seven years before we--I finally told her that I couldn't take it no more (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, this is unusual wedding.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It was unusual.
Speaker 2: I mean marriage, in--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) An unusual wedding--
Speaker 2: --terms of the distance.
Speaker 1: --and unusual marriage.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So--
Speaker 1: I think--I don't think--
Speaker 2: --so she, she didn't--I mean she, she taught at Miles.  See, that's a long, that's a long time to be away from your husband and wife, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so you just--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, back in those days people were doing that.  Husband and wife, one taught at the one college; the other taught at another college.  And they would get together during the summertime or on holidays and whatnot.  I, I couldn't deal with that; I couldn't deal with that.  And I guess she accepted it, but I didn't, I couldn't accept that.  But I, I didn't want to divorce her, because her father thought that I married--he was a doctor.  He thought that I married anyway for her money.  And she did promise me a lot of things that she was gonna do for me (laughter), what I mean, whatnot.  And I--but some of the things I guess I fell for it, being from a very poor family and whatnot.  And they had a, a lavish house and whatnot.  And he was a doctor.  He was a very good doctor, and he lavished his money on his daughter.  And we had all these wedding gifts and whatnot that she had charged, and we was--I was supposed to help pay for it.  And of course, I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She bought her own wedding gifts?
Speaker 1: She bought her own wedding gifts.  It was something like four or five thousand dollars' worth of plates and stuff like that.  And I'm suppose to help her pay for it, and, and I, I said, "I'm not gonna pay for it; I'm not gonna pay for it."  And we went on seven, around seven years before I, I did divorce her.  And it was, it was quite a thing about the divorce, because she wanted me to--she wanted alimony from me for divorcing her.  And of course, naturally I fought it and didn't want to pay alimony.  And she came up here, and we had a, a lawsuit, and we went to court.  And the judge ordered me to pay twenty-five dollars a month to her because I was making fifty dollars more than she was making.  And then he ordered me to pay her twenty-five dollars a month in ali- alimony.  And that's the way it ended.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, that didn't work out too well.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No (laughter), no.
Speaker 2: --you, you didn't have any children, did, did you?
Speaker 1: No, no--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --there was no children.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There was no children.
Story_ID: 611696
Speaker 1: So you really taught at Bates [Wiley H. Bates High School, Annapolis, Maryland] for how, how many years?  What, thir--
Speaker 2: Well, before integration, I taught at Bates.  Integration started in '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I was still at Bates, but I was under the Annapolis High [Annapolis High School, Annapolis, Maryland].  I was under the administration of Annapolis High.  But I was still at Bates because that was the only place that they had the body and finish shop.  And I--but I was under the administration of Annapolis High.  And after--
Speaker 1: After integration, huh (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, after integration.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Then, of course, after I, I moved from Bates to what they call Shaw welding shop [ph.].  The industrial education set up a--county set up a place on--what is it--Chinquapin Round Road, for a shop.  And that was before they built the school in the south county.  They built a vocational school in South River [Maryland] where you could have, house all of the trades together.  And that wasn't until '79 [1979].  But until then, that's where I was on Chinquapin Round Road in the Shaw building and before I moved to the regular industrial complex for the county where all the trades were taught.
Story_ID: 611697
Speaker 1: There was a desegregation struggle here in Anne Arundel County [Maryland] back in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s].  And so, can, can you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know (clears throat) I, I, I stayed away from really getting involved in too much in, in that.  One of the reasons--and this is why I do so many things today, is because I didn't participate back in the struggles, when those guys were on the picket line.  And I said to myself, "If I ever got in the position to help minorities, this is what I will do," and this is what I've, I've chosen, I'm doing now.  But there was quite a struggle.  They just did not want you to go to that school.  I had no problem insofar as when they did integrate schools with white teachers, white children; I had no problem.  But I did have one student, I did have one student to call me a nigger in my first year of teaching.  But he begged me pardon. And of course, it, it had to be reported, and of course, he was taken out of the shop.  A lot of friends of mine got arrested because of the lunch counters and, and whatnot.  And a lot of friends of mine got arrested, but I didn't participate.  And I thought that I could use my talent a different way in order to bring about integration, and this is what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I mean, so, how did, how did it affect your, your job, I guess?  When, when integration came, did you, you, you still maintained the same, same job basically but in, in a different--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What happened, the (clears throat) year of integration, which was 1966, Dr. Clopper [ph.], he was one of the administrators down at the board of education, called all of the faculty at Bates [Wiley H. Bates High School, Annapolis, Maryland] into the library at Bates.  And I guess they had worked out the schedule, where he was gonna send black teachers to integrate the white schools.  And at that particular time I was married to Pearl [Spruill's second wife, Pearl Spruill].  And Pearl was assigned to Southern High School [Harwood, Maryland], and she said she was--Southern High School was supposedly one of the worst schools as far as integration is concerned in the county.  And she told me that she wasn't gonna work.  And we were buying a house in--matter of fact, the first we had--was buying a house in Edgewater [Maryland].  And she said she wasn't gonna work.  And we would need--using both salaries to pay for the house.  (Laughter) So I said, "You've got to work; you've got to work."  And she went down there and really she was wit- it was really one of the best schools in the whole county as far as integration is concerned.  They did their best to make sure that black teachers were treated the same; they did their best.  And as now--as long as he stayed there, he, he was, he was just that way.  Dr. Wingate [ph.]--I think his name is--I, I don't know whether he had a doctor degree or not, but he was very good at that.  And she enjoyed it; she enjoyed working down there.  The other people had some problems, like Glen Burnie [Glen Burnie High School, Glen Burnie, Maryland].  And some of the other people had some problems with the Southern, which it was supposed to be have been the one of the worst, was really one of the best.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 611698
Speaker 1: Now you bought some land in, what is it, '56 [1956]?  What is it I have here, a note that you, you bought a farm?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, it wasn't farm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A fellow by the name of John Prann, he and I taught together in Bates [Wiley H. Bates High School, Annapolis, Maryland].  It was in 1956 that I was interested in trying to own property.  And he told me that he knew where some property was that was for sale.  He said he knew that the other groups would have been trying to buy the land, but he wanted to save it for a minority to buy it.  And of course, I, I didn't, didn't think I could buy it because I didn't have any money.  I wasn't making that much money, and of course, I had obligations.  I think when I left Mississippi I was making $375 a month [at Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi], and I came up here and I was making about $325.  I take a lower, a cut.  And then too, in Mississippi I was working the year around.  Up here I was working only ten months, so.  Now, what happened was Mr. Turner [ph.] owned the land.  A fellow by the name of Truxtun Beale had a plantation right outside of Annapolis [Maryland].  And I understand he gave all of his black servants a certain amount of land.  And Mr. Turner had sixty, fifty acres of land that he was, was saving.  And he wanted to--I wanted--I didn't want to buy but three acres.  But he said, "I'm not gonna sell nothing but fifteen acres."  And I said, "Well, I can't pay for fifteen acres."  And Mr. Prann said, "Well, I'll loan you the money to pay the down payment on fifteen acre of land."  And he gave me a check for three thousand dollars.  And, and this is when I bought the land from Mr. Turner, and this is when I bought the fifteen acres. But Mr. Turner--I'm getting ahead of myself now--before he decided that he would--I, I didn't want to buy but three acres, didn't have enough money to buy but three acres.  But Mr. Turner said, "I'm not gonna sell you the land.  I'm gonna sell the whole thing to somebody else because they got the money."  And what happened, I took three hundred dollars in my pocket, three hundred in one dollar bills, and drove to Washington [D.C.].  And I found out what, what time Mr. Turner got off from his job and whatnot, and I went to his house.  Now can you imagine three hundred dollars stuffed--one dollar bills stuffed in your pocket at twelve o'clock at night in Washington, 'cause things weren't that bad in Washington.  This is what I did: I went to his house, knocked on his door.  And he asked me to come in and everything.  He sat down and talked with me, and I told him that I wanted to buy the fifteen acres of land, that Mr. Prann was gonna loan me the down payment.  And at first he said no.  And I started to pulling this three hundred dollars out in one dollar bills, and he got excited.  I had heard that people who had money, when they see money, they get excited.  And I counted this three hundred dollars in the one dollar bills.  By the time I got it, you know, it's piled way up here.  And Mr. Turner went for it.  And we signed the form, a contract, on an envelope.  And he signed his name saying that he was going to sell me this land, and he was going to at a certain price and whatnot.  Two days later, he said he wasn't going to do it.  And I told him he had my three hundred dollars.  I have a contract, binding contract.  So I said, "Either you do it, or I'll take you to court."  And he--a couple of days, he sent his real estate agent out to sign the contract, and that's how I got the fifteen acres of land.
Story_ID: 611699
Speaker 1: And I built my first house on the fifteen acres of land, and I had a little garden there.  And then, of course, in 1987, then the county began to knock on my door.  They wanted some of my land.  I didn't know at first they were gonna take my house, because they want to take my house too, and that's what they did.  At first they weren't gonna pay me very much for it.  But after a while I got a good lawyer, and after a while they came up with the price that they should have come in with the first place.  And they gave me--and that's when I bought the farm down here [in Anne Arundel County, Maryland], nineteen eighty--'88 [1988] is when I bought the farm down here.  Rather than to pay tax on it, I transferred it and bought, bought the farm.  And that's how I began to move up.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So what, how did you use the land to, to move up, I guess?
Speaker 1: Well, the fif- the fifteen--I bought the farm, but I still had--the, the county didn't take but five acres of land.  Now I still got ten more acres of land, yeah, and it became valuable; the ten acres became valuable.  And by the time, by the time people began to build around me, and then hotels came.
Speaker 2: Oh, those acres were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Then roads were built.  I built another house back behind the other house on the, on the, on the, a portion of the ten acres, and of course, that became very valuable.  Then the county decided they were gonna put another road in there.  And of course, they paid me for building the road, taking my land from building the road.  Land has gone up since then.  Then, of course, a gentleman wanted to have a tennis court on five acres of my land.  And so he leased the tennis court and built up a swimming pool on the, on the land, and that became very valuable.  And when I started selling off land it became very valuable.
Speaker 2: So he didn't, he, he didn't buy the land out right.  He just, he, he rented it and built, built a, the--
Speaker 1: The, the guy, the guy--
Speaker 2: --pool?
Speaker 1: --on the--had the five acres and the, and the tennis court, he just leased the land.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He just leased it for as every, every--I think it was every three years I had to sign another contract.  And of course, he went bankrupt.  He went bankrupt, and he sold it to another firm.  And this firm found out that when they built the, the parking lot, they were infringing on my five acres.  And they had to pay me for infringing on that five acres of land.  So I got a few dollars out of that.
Story_ID: 611700
Speaker 1: You were telling me about some of the uses of the land that you bought [in Anne Arundel County, Maryland] and you know, with the development coming to the area and the highway and you know.  So you were able to, to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it became (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) make some of your money, yeah.
Speaker 2: --it was then quite valuable.  And then, of course, the house that we built became quite valuable too.  And of course, naturally, taxes began to go up.  The more valuable your land is, the more tax, more you have to pay in taxes.  So you've got to decide whether or not to stay there or, and continue to pay taxes or whether or not to sell, because there comes a time where you can't continue.  Unless you're developing and start making more money, you can't continue to pay the taxes as a, as a residential entity.  So, this is when I decided I was gonna sell the, the house.  I sold the house, and I think it was 2.3 acres of land.  And (clears throat) it worked out very well because I had a couple of people who wanted to buy it.  And it was--it wasn't exactly a bidding, but I got the best offer.
Speaker 1: This is in '87 [1987], or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, no?  This is earlier?
Speaker 2: This is in, let me see.  When did I sell?  Now this was in '90 [1990].  This is--I sold the house in '90 [1990], '90 [1990], '91 [1991] or '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is a house you built in 1988, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Eighty-eight [1988].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the house I built (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --in 1988, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 611701
Speaker 1: Well, you had retired already from the school system [Anne Arundel County Public Schools] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I retired from the school system in 1973.
Speaker 1: Eighty-three [1983], right?
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1983]; I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Eighty-three [1983], yeah.
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1983].
Speaker 1: And you were there for twenty-nine years.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the school [Wiley H. Bates High School; Wiley H. Bates Heritage Park, Annapolis, Maryland] planted trees in your honor--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and in honor of some of your--oh, and some of your brothers and sisters did attend a ceremony and--
Speaker 2: Right and came down--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --(unclear) my retirement; they came down.  Matter of fact, my brother was, brother Albert [Albert Spruill], was the principal speaker at the, at the retirement.
Story_ID: 611702
Speaker 1: Since that time, you've devoted a lot of your energy to civic causes and education of youth and that sort of thing.  So tell me some of the things that you've done since you retired.
Speaker 2: Well, I started, I, I really started this when I was married to, to, to, to Pearl [Spruill's second wife, Pearl Spruill], because she was interested in the same thing.  She was an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], and--
Speaker 1: Let, let me ask you then and like how did you all--now, now she was teaching at Bates [Wiley H. Bates High School, Annapolis, Maryland].
Speaker 2: She was teaching--
Speaker 1: She, she came to Bates--
Speaker 2: She came to Bates in 19--
Speaker 1: What, '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: --nineteen fifty-eight [1958].  No, she came--
Speaker 1: It was '58 [1958]?  Okay (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --fifty-eight [1958]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause we were, we were married in '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Claudine [Spruill's first wife, Claudine Spruill] and I divorced in the early part of (laughter) '62 [1962].  (Laughter) I married Pearl the later part of sixty--'62 [1962].  So that same year I married Pearl.  And she was involved with the Boys and Girls Club [Boys and Girls Clubs of Annapolis and Anne Arundel County, Annapolis, Maryland], just as I was involved in the Boys and Girls Club.  We used to give--have meetings.  As a matter of fact, she was on the board.  I was never on the board.  I was asked to be on the board, but I was never on the board.  I was just a interested citizen, I guess, when I worked with the Boys and Girls Club, especially when I brought them down, down to the farm and let them become interested in projects, garden projects and whatnot.  So, and I enjoyed doing that, but it sort of got out of hand because it looked like that they didn't--they weren't interested in the work ethic, and I was.
Story_ID: 611703
Speaker 1: I recall one time Channel 9 [WUSA-TV] in Washington [D.C.] came down to interview me.  And there was about ten or fifteen boys and girls from that Boys and Girls Club in Annapolis [Boys and Girls Clubs of Annapolis and Anne Arundel County, Annapolis, Maryland].  And I was showing them how to pull corn off the, off the stalk.  And they took pictures of all of that.  And but the, the kids had not grown the corn.  I was the one that grew the corn.  And (unclear) and just like you, you, you--and then they put it on television the next day, that e- in fact, that evening, as though they have done all the work.  And, and so I got, just got disgusted out of that, because they only wanted--it seemed to me they were only trying to get more people to join the Boys and Girls Club.  And I couldn't--
Speaker 2: So they were kind of using that false--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --kind of way--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to make it seem like these kids had done this--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --work, and they really hadn't.
Speaker 1: Well, and they haven't done it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I just couldn't, I just couldn't see that.
Speaker 2: They were just posing with some corn.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And they took about--stayed down there about an hour, taking all these pictures of these kids going out pulling corn, and the same thing with that, there was, there was a national garden association came down from Connecticut.  I think it was in Connecticut.  And they gave us a thousand dollars to promote gardening, and they came down and took pictures of the kids and whatnot.  I just couldn't deal with that because the kids haven't, they haven't done very much to promote this.  They haven't done any work.  And of course, they were only following that supervisor's, you know, that, that--and the supervisor was only following what their supervisor was doing.  So I just got disgusted and decided that I just was going to move away from the Boys and Girls Club and go to some other entity and think maybe that they would be interested in this.  But that didn't work out too well.

Speaker 1: I went to my fraternity.  My fraternity is the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.].  And we've had--we started out very good.  They used to bring boys out on a Saturday morning, was selling, selling vegetable and whatnot, and the fraternity used to come down to help me.  The very first year they helped.  That went on for about a year and a half.  And after a year and a half, the, the interest died down.  I continued to work with them.  And matter of fact, about three years later they had thirty-some thousand dollars in their treasurer as a result of the farm, selling farm produce.  But the interest and for what it was designed to do, wasn't there.  Because I wanted to help youngsters, and they wouldn't participate in bringing youngsters out in the stand anymore.  They couldn't get up in the morning, Saturday and whatnot.  And then I got the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] involved.  Of course, they were working with the Alphas and whatnot.  They would come out there and sell vegetables, and sometimes they would have to go home during the time that we were selling vegetables.  They were getting a percentage of what was being made.  Now, they're getting all this stuff free.  I'm the one that's supporting.  I'm spending the money to buy the seeds.  I'm spending the money to harvest this stuff.  All this is coming free, and they couldn't even stand on the stand and sell the products.  And this is what happened to them.  So I decided to go, go away from the Alphas to the church.  I decided that I was gonna have First Baptist Church [Annapolis, Maryland] selling this thing.
Speaker 2: Well, this had to work, right?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It's supposed to work right.  This is a religious organization.  They're gonna work.  For about one year they came down, and they were so excited.  They were gonna do this, and they were gonna do that.  And after a while, that began to falter.  They just didn't want to do farm work.  And I had them for about ten years.  It was not until I let the--turn this thing over to the college, Sojourner Douglass College [Edgewater, Maryland].  And we got a Spanish person to come down and see what we could actually do with this project.  And it was not until the--and that was the summer--not until then that the--when I can I say that we're gonna beginning to move this thing off the ground.  And it's really gonna become to--the, the, the work in which I have done is really going to fruition, because it looks like as though it's going to happen, because they bring--he brings workers out.  Those people work hard, and when they finish one task, they're ready to go to another task.  And you don't have to push them.  They're ready to work.  And these are youngsters.  These are young kids, look like they be twenty.  Maybe some of them could be about fifteen or sixteen years old.  I, I guess they're documented because I'm sure he wouldn't bring nobody down to the farm that wasn't, but I'm sure they are.  But they worked.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I think the program is gonna get off the ground now.
Story_ID: 611705
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You've donored--donated money.  I saw a picture of you donating six hundred thousand dollars to Sojourner Douglass community college [Sojourner Douglass College, Edgewater, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that now.
Speaker 2: Now what happened, that also involved giving it to Uncle Sam.  (Laughter) I said give it to Uncle Sam, taxes; that also involved taxes.  In order for me to clear and keep to having to pay money in taxes, I would have to give it to a charitable organization.  And I chose the college, because I thought that they would be the best entity to give it to and would be able to educate children and help them, especially minorities, and they really needed help.  But I had no idea about giving them farm project, as I am doing now.  I had no idea they would be involved when I gave them the six hundred thousand, even though we talked about putting a building there.  But I didn't know that it would really come to fruition.  But it seems though it's gonna come to fruition now.  I sold some land.  I think I was telling you about the five acres of land I sold, and I got pretty close, pretty close, $4 million out of that.  And I've got to do things for either a charitable organization, or it's gonna go into taxes, and this is when I chose the, the college to do this in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I'm re- (clears throat) it's luck I (unclear) a certain--and, and also planning.  You have to plan your life out.  And I had, I think I have planned it out pretty well so far.  I kind of pat myself on the back for having planned years ago, and now it's coming to fruitation.
Story_ID: 611706
Speaker 1: So what do you do with your money to, to re- I mean to have your money work for you?  I mean, I know you invested in real estate; you buy real estate.  But what else do you do?
Speaker 2: Well, I invest now in the CDs [certificate of deposit] (unclear)--CDs now.  I don't invest in stocks and whatnot.  I don't believe in them.  That's what I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course (unclear) actually in real estate because I have the farm down there [in Tracy's Landing, Maryland].  And I have children [Kevin Spruill and Kecia Spruill Johnson], you know, and they, they, they want (laughter) to do something (unclear).  And I also spend money on my children too.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you re--you, you were able to raise 4 million--to earn $4 million through CDs, basically, or how-
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  That came from selling of land.
Speaker 1: Selling some land, okay.
Speaker 2: Selling, selling the land.
Speaker 1: All right, yeah.
Speaker 2: I also established the Har-Pearl Foundation [Har-Pearl Spruill Foundation, Inc., Annapolis, Maryland] from the selling of the land.  The Har-Pearl Foundation at one time or another was worth over $3 million.  We've had to spend some money for the capital, but we make around $120,000, what we spend on various programs, scholarships and also church programs too.  We have four churches that we extend the educational benefits for the children.  They get six weeks of training and follow them in math, science, and English, and they put emphasis on that.  They hire qualified teachers.  They got to be certified before they can work with these children.  And so far we've been rather successful.  They come down to the farm once during the six weeks.  And my wife, Annetta [Spruill's third wife, Annetta Turner Spruill], takes them on the tour of the farm.  And she explains--she can explain these things much better than I can, and she explains these things to the children.
Story_ID: 611707
Speaker 1: We were talking when you came in about work ethic and that sort of thing.  I suppose that's the thing that really concerns you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what, what are some of your other hopes and concerns about the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it seems as though somehow or another we haven't instilled work ethic in minority children.  Even I haven't instilled it, instilled it in my own children [Kevin Spruill and Kecia Spruill Johnson].  I have tried, but for some reason or another it hasn't worked.  I want to know from experts.  I want to get some advice from experts how we can integrate.  I was talking to the minister yesterday, and he doesn't have no answer for it.  I've tried; I've tried to, to get kids involved.  But I think what really has happened, that a lot of the children, your minority children, have come from the South.  They were sharecroppers, and their parents have instilled in them the idea of working on a farm just wasn't in their interest.  And it's, it's a wrong thing to do, because you're not teaching them so--you're not teaching them to be a farmer, but you're just teaching them work ethics.  And I, I just don't see how we can solve it; I really don't.  I'd like to solve it, but it's gonna have to be somebody be, besides me.  I don't have the, the, I don't have the expertise in this.  I've tried.
Speaker 1: Now have you had some students that have an appreciation for farm life and for growing food and, and the outdoors, I mean?
Speaker 2: Not, not no--I haven't really had any minority, other than Earl Jones.  Earl Jones works for me.  I had him in high school [Wiley H. Bates High School, Annapolis, Maryland], and he works for me now.  He's about the only student that I've had that has an interest in working like that, but I haven't had any more.  They just don't want to work.  We had another gentleman.  I won't call his name.  But Dr. Fairley [HistoryMaker Charlestine Fairley] had picked him to head this project.  And he came down there, and he wanted me to spend even more money to get the project off the ground.  I think I'm spending enough money to get it off the ground.  He wanted to borrow money, even more money from me in order to get the program off the ground.  So I knew he wasn't the type of person that she wanted to head the program.  But when this Hispanics came down, the Spanish person came down, he had a different view of how to solve this problem, and I think he's gonna solve it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I've had several people before, and I've been able to understand where they're coming from.  But this guy, he really is tops; he really is.  And I'm proud of the fact that Dr. Fairley has gotten him to work with--work it out, because I think he wants the program to be a part of the college [Sojourner Douglass College, Edgewater, Maryland] too.  After we establish the programs that we are working on, he want the farm project to be a part of the college too.  Now how they're gonna implement, I don't know, but he does.  And we are making progress, and I'm proud of the way that he's doing the things that he's doing.

Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point in life--and now, now you're a millionaire, and you seem to be in fa- fairly good health and everything--what would--is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Well, what now?
Speaker 1: Is there any major thing that you would do differently in life if you could?
Speaker 2: The only--I, I think I told you before, the only thing I'm, I'm sorry, that I wasn't able to teach my children [Kevin Spruill and Kecia Spruill Johnson] the work ethic that I hoped to impose on other people.  I wasn't able to teach my two children that.  That's--
Speaker 1: Is--do, do you have an idea of, of, of why--I mean, when you look at it, is it because thing--times are different and because conditions are different, or both?
Speaker 2: I, I think it was that sort of a conflict between the two children, and at that particular time, Pearl [Spruill's second wife, Pearl Spruill] who was the mother of the two children.  I think that it was more or less a different outlook between her and I and the children.  I think that was the reason for not mem- my, me not being able to expose them to work ethic as I had, because the children have a tendency to follow the least resistance (laughter).  And of course, she was very good at selling stuff, but she wasn't very good at producing it.  And I think that was where the, the problem lie (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think you told me when, when we came in that, that she, when she saw this farm setup [in Tracy's Landing, Maryland]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --she said, "Well, I'm not getting out there with a hoe," (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what she told me.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She said she would sell it.  She said she would sell it, but she wasn't gonna get out there (laughter) and help you farm it.  And she was true to her word.  She, she would take it out in her car before we moved down to the farm.  She would take produce and take it in her car and go around the county and sell to people.  Matter of fact, we had tried to establish a, a inter-Greek organization.  And we had $1500 that she had made selling vegetables.  But she didn't produce it now, but she was willing to sell it.  So, I got to give her credit for, you know, at least for selling them products because that's the important thing too, is, is, is not only producing it, but selling and selling the product too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I wanted her to instill in the kids, is the main thing I was trying to do this thing for, is my children, and I wasn't able to do that.

Speaker 1: Your wife Pearl [Spruill's second wife, Pearl Spruill] passed away, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she passed--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --away in '95 [1995].
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have two children by her, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what, what are their names?
Speaker 2: Kevin, Kevin Harrell Spruill [Kevin Spruill] and Kecia Yvette Johnson [Kecia Spruill Johnson].  She's married now.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Kecia is living at the farm [in Tracy's Landing, Maryland].  She's living at the farm.  She will inherit quite a bit.  With Kevin, of course, he's a, he works for the IRS [Internal Revenue Service].  And I had some problems with him, but he will inherit some things.
Story_ID: 611710
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done again, what today would you say is your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I've always been interested in helping people.  And I, I think, I, I think I told you, that's, I think I got it from my, my father [Solomon Spruill, Jr.].  He didn't realize how much he was instilling in me.  But he really instilled in me the help he--remember I told you that he, when he killed hogs, he used to make sure that people, the poor people, got a portion of the, of the hogs.  And in the fall of the year, he used to kill steers, and he used to give people (unclear).  And he was always very liberal when it came down to helping other people.  When--you know, you know, in those days, they would get together.  Say for instance, they had to put up a barn.  They would get together and spend maybe two or three days in putting up a barn.  And it was very cooperative among the, them those days.  But we've, we've lost that connection now; we've lost that.
Speaker 1: You, you're saying that the community would get together to help--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --one person build their barn?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then, you know, they could count on other people to help them do--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a lot of togetherness of the people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard that when a hog is killed, it takes a lot of people to deal with that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It takes more to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When my, my father used to kill hogs, he used to always invite at least two or three men to help him kill hogs.  And of course, the women used to help to clean the intestines out and everything.  And it was a fun day with them.  And by the way, I've, I'm starting a museum.  At least Ms. Fairley [HistoryMaker Charlestine Fairley] wants to start a museum in my barn over there.  And I went down to North Carolina, Travis rather, and picked up some things that my father--in my father's barn.  And one thing I picked up was one of the old pots that they used back in those days.  This was the smaller pot, about twenty-five gallon pot they used to use for washing clothes and also for killing hogs and whatnot.  And we gonna put up a museum over at, over at the farm [in Tracy's Landing, Maryland] in the barn and whatnot.  And this is what I'm going to work on and spending time, now that I've leased--and now that I'm giving them the acres, and they are gonna take it and work with it.  I will spend the rest of my time trying to develop this museum.
Story_ID: 611711
Speaker 1: Is there anything else we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No.  I think I've--I, I think we've covered about--
Speaker 1: Oh, there is one other thing.  You got married again ten years ago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about it.
Speaker 2: After Pearl [Spruill's second wife, Pearl Spruill] died.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: After Pearl died, I spent a year of loneliness.  And I'd already met the girl.  I'd already met Annetta [Spruill's third wife, Annetta Turner Spruill].  We used to have social--matter of fact, she used to come by the house and talk to Pearl.  She was a very good friend of Pearl.  She helped us move from the farm--the house on Route 2 [Maryland Route 2] to the house in Annapolis [Maryland]; she helped us move.  And I had no idea whatsoever that this would ever take place.  But after Pearl died, and we got together.  After two years we got married.  And I'm certainly glad that, that we did because she has been very helpful, very helpful to me.  I don't know where or what would have happened to me had it, had we not got married.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you mentioned that when we came in.  And in fact, I thought we might have to have two of you all in camera.  So, but this is (laughter) something that you want to talk, talk about her.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, she has been very helpful to me.  And I, I, I say she's my left hand; she's my left hand.  And she produces all of the things that you see on the counter there.  She files all of those things, and she takes care of mo- a lot of my business interests and whatnot.  She takes care of all of that.
Speaker 1: Now she's a retired teacher--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as well, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's a retired teacher.  Yeah, she has a master's in guidance counseling and whatnot.  And she works very hard with the church and also with the, the sorority, works--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --very hard with that.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah--
Speaker 2: And she is a member--
Speaker 1: --what, what's the name of your church?  I didn't (unclear)--
Speaker 2: First Baptist--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --First Baptist Church--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --of Annapolis [Maryland].
Speaker 1: And she's an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].  She was just talking about the convention on the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, off camera too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's gonna work at the convention.
Story_ID: 611712
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, as a person who, very humble and tried to help other people find their way in this life, especially youngsters.  I'm interested in developing young minds because this is a tough world out here.  And if you don't develop a way of--first of all, good education; you've got to have--be well educated.  If you're not educated, you're not gonna survive in this technological world; you're not gonna survive.  It's the first thing you need to do, is to get a good education.  And I'd like to feel that I have helped somebody re- re- get a good education.  I like to feel that I've helped other people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
