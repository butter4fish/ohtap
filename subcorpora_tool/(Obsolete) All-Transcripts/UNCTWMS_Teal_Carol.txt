RACHEL SEIDMAN:  This is Rachel Seidman.  Today is July 11, 2012.  I&#8217;m here in Raleigh, North Carolina with Carol Teal the executive director of Lillian&#8217;s List.  We are in a conference room at her office, and I&#8217;m interviewing Lillian as part of the project on the Long Women&#8217;s Movement in the South.  I think I said I&#8217;m interviewing Lillian.  CAROL TEAL:  Yeah, you did.  RS:  I&#8217;m sorry.  I mean Carol, as part of the Long Women&#8217;s Movement in the South.    CT:  But the spirit of Lillian is with us.  RS:  Yes, the spirit of Lillian.  So Carol, let&#8217;s start with your early life and why don&#8217;t we start by, I know you were born in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Was your family from this area for a long time?  Did you have roots in North Carolina?  CT:  Well, I was born in Raleigh, but my parents were both North Carolinians.  My mother grew up in Siler City, and my father was from a little bitty town in Anson County called McFarland and they met at Chapel Hill.  RS:  And what did your grandparents do?  CT:  Well, two very different groups of grandparents.  My mother&#8217;s parents my, her father was an engineer.  He graduated from State in civil engineering. And he went    to MIT and my, her mother graduated from UNC Greensboro [transcriptionist note:  probably at that time North Carolina College for Women or State Normal and Industrial College], which was sort of rare for women in that day and age to do.  She was an only child.  My father, his parents, neither one of them graduated from high school.  He&#8217;s the youngest of the family of four and he grew up in the Depression during very challenging economic times.  So my parents came from very different backgrounds economically.  And they met at that great melting pot in Chapel Hill.    RS:  And what were they getting degrees in?  CT:  My dad was a business major.  He was an accountant, which was kind of why I followed in that path and my mother was a French major.    RS:  And did your mom work after you were born?  CT:  She, she worked for a little bit before I was born, and I have a younger brother, and she stopped working, and she was a stay at home mom for the entire time.    RS:  And how, what do you remember about growing up in terms of, I mean you said you followed in your father&#8217;s footsteps.  What do you remember about their expectations in terms of gender roles for you and your brother?  CT:  I think that both my brother and I were very, very fortunate to have parents who raised us to believe that we could do anything that we set out to do.  So there were no, although my mother was a stay at home mom and my dad worked in the world, I never felt any expectation that I do that, and I always felt encouraged to follow my dreams just as much as my brother.  RS:  What was your mom like as a person?  CT:  She was very quiet.  She was the smartest one in the family.  She was the valedictorian of her high school graduating class.  She, we all just sort of readily acknowledged that she was the smartest one in the family.  Very quiet, very committed to family.  My dad was the gregarious one.  So they were opposites in a lot of ways.  I think one thing that you wouldn&#8217;t know to ask about but I'd like to share because it was sort of a defining moment in my childhood and my early years, when I was nine years old and my brother was seven, my father was in an airplane accident and left him paralyzed for the rest of his life.  He was in a wheelchair.  So my mother had to take on the role of caregiver also and had two children that were not small children but still kind of in the middle of our growing up.  And that was a real defining moment in our family, and it made us come together and be closer in ways that I don&#8217;t think we would&#8217;ve otherwise been.  But that was kind of a real defining moment in my childhood.    RS:  Did you and your brother have to take on new responsibilities I mean&#8212;  CT:  No, looking back on it I see that my mother really shouldered all of that and she was just made our lives as normal as possible.  And she was really the one that shouldered that.  RS:  It must&#8217;ve been hard as a child to go through all that.  CT:  Yeah, yeah, right.  And so I think for that reason our dad was around maybe more than he would&#8217;ve been.  He was a controller Broyhill Furniture in Lenoir.  My family moved to Lenoir when I was in the fourth grade.  So this was, was born in Raleigh and grew up there until the fourth grade and then my family moved to Lenoir.  So he was around a lot more, and I remember helping him with accounting projects.  So that&#8217;s kind of maybe&#8217;s my how I got into that thinking about that line of work.  RS:  So he was able to continue working.  CT:  Um hmm.  Yep.  He was out of work for maybe a little over a year, and then he went back to work.    RS:  What kind of, what do you remember about high school and your life as a student and social life?  CT:  Well, I remember my mother was concerned about moving to Lenoir because she wasn&#8217;t convinced the schools were as good as they were in Raleigh, and that was probably the case.  I think that high school was not particularly academically challenging.  And I think that I thought I was smart when I got out of high school and graduated in the top ten percent of the class and headed off to Chapel Hill.  And it disabused me of that notion because I realized that I had no study skills, and I was not prepared to do that from the background that I had coming out of high school.  But it took me a year or two to figure it out, but I figured it out.  But&#8212;  RS:  So you were an education major?  Is that right?   CT:  Um hmm.  RS:  What drew you to that major?  CT:  Well, I think I started out in some other majors and just kind of circled around to that to maybe a practical reason, looking for a job, and also a lot of people almost everybody in my father&#8217;s side of the family was in education.  So it was something that was sort of ingrained in that side of the family anyway.  So I saw that as a natural thing to do.  RS:  So you were thinking about being a teacher.  CT:  Um hmm.  RS:  But then you got a master&#8217;s degree in accounting.  CT:  Yeah, I actually the first thing I thought about being at Chapel Hill was a physical therapist, and this was because of my father&#8217;s condition, and physical therapists were held in high esteem by me.  And I was in a pre-physical therapy program at Chapel Hill for a while, and the reason I veered in to another direction was a good choice.  We, I had to go on rounds with a physical therapist to see some of their patients.  And I remember this was a Durham rehab.  The first patient that we went in to see was a you guy probably about my age who had been in a motorcycle accident, and his head was in traction.  I walked in and took one look at him and just passed out cold.  So I tell people that that&#8217;s how I became an accountant.    So but yes, I graduated with a degree in education and actually never taught.  I did some substitute teaching for a while and just kind of ended up in other fields, and I guess my first real job after college was with the Department of Social Services in Durham.  I was an eligibility specialist for them and that gave me a look at life that I wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have that I think has really shaped how I view the world.  RS:  Can you talk more about that?  What does an eligibility specialist do?  CT:  Well, at the time and this would&#8217;ve been see, I got married in &#8217;75, &#8217;76.  So that was mid-seventies.  At the time it was called Aid to Families with Dependant Children.  So an eligibility specialist determined the eligibility for people for that federal public assistance program.  And at the time you had a caseload, and you visited people that were receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children.  They had different people who determined initial eligibility when I was doing that.  So, I had a caseload and people would come into the office like every six months to have their eligibility re-determined, and we had to go out and do a home visits for a certain percentage of the renewal things that we did.  So, all of my caseload was in probably one of the roughest public housing projects in Durham, and I was young and na&#239;ve at the time.  But looking back on that, I would&#8217;ve been more concerned than I was as a very young woman for&#8212;but it gave me a look at life that I wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise have had.  It gave me an empathy and understanding for what it means to have incredible economic hardships and the children and young women that struggle with that.  And it made me feel, it made me appreciate what I had had.  Even though, my father lost his job when I was a freshman at Carolina.  And I remember being like Dad, how could you do this?  I mean he of course didn&#8217;t do it.  But after that experience of understanding or seeing on a real level the economic struggles that so many people had it just made me realize how privileged I was.  And so it&#8217;s always, and that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s always been with me, and I feel very fortunate to be able to have that perspective that I wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise had.  RS:  Do you remember any specific stories or people that really, that you visited or that came to you that really shaped your understanding of what this was like?  CT:  Well, there were a lot of grandmother&#8217;s taking care of grandchildren for various reasons.  And I just remember thinking wow, that&#8217;s, what a struggle to do this and because some of them were elderly and infirmed and had their own health issues and they were caring for a bunch of little grandchildren that would have challenged anybody.  And then just the young mothers that in retrospect when I was an older mother many decades after that, realizing what a challenge and a struggle it can be for young women that don&#8217;t have the economic security or the family support and trying to raise children.  And I think that too informed how I feel about women being able to control their reproductive lives.  I think that&#8217;s so, so important and think it should be a woman&#8217;s decision, period.  And if she wants to consult with her doctor or family or anyone else, that&#8217;s fine.  But I think it&#8217;s the woman has to have control over that.    RS:  So, but you didn&#8217;t stay in social services.  CT:  I stayed in that for five years.    RS:  Oh you did.  CT:  I've done a lot of things for five years, and actually this Lillian&#8217;s List is the only thing that ever over the span of my working life that I've done for more than five years.  But yeah, I did that for five years, and then after being an eligibility specialist I was a child support and enforcement officer with the Durham County Department of Social Services for a while, and that was an interesting and fascinating job too, another look at a part of life that it wouldn&#8217;t have been exposed to otherwise.  So we were trying to get court ordered child support and enforce court ordered child support.  We did some civil cases and a lot of criminal cases.  So I worked in the, worked with the county attorney on bringing actions and enforcing actions for child support.    RS:  And what was your role there?  I mean you weren&#8217;t an attorney so what did you do?  CT:  No.  The counties, if someone receive public assistance the counties, all counties in North Carolina and other states have child support enforcement officers that will work and try to enforce and collect child support for the children that are receiving public assistance.    RS:  But did you actually go door to door and try to get the money or how did you do that?  CT:  Not door to door, but we did try to find people and we did assist the county attorney on doing garnishment procedures against people.  So it was part detective, part trying to find somebody and working with the county attorney to enforce orders.  RS:  And I would guess most of those you were trying to find were the men, the fathers.  CT:  Most of them were.  Yeah, there were one or two that were the mothers and that the children were in the custody of their grandparents.  But I would say ninety-five percent of them were men.    RS:  Did you see yourself at that time or did working on these issues around, that focused so much around well, parenting and the problems of these young mothers and in some cases fathers who abandoned families, was that shaping what you would call a feminist sensibility?  Did you see yourself as a feminist at that time or were these jobs you were doing that didn&#8217;t kind of connect to an identity or--?  CT:  I think that&#8217;s an interesting question.  I think that even from a very, very young age I had very strong feminist inclinations.  Even the first kind of thing that I remember being incensed about was, this was kindergarten.  It was Fred Olds Elementary School in Raleigh that&#8217;s still here.  There was a principal that was, his name was Fred Anderson.  It&#8217;s funny the things you can remember.  He would, in the lunchroom every day he would pick a table to have lunch at, and this was a really big deal when the principal was sitting at your table.  So I remember the day that the principal was sitting at our table and maybe three or four other kids around, and he was asking everybody what they wanted to be when they grew up.  And I said I wanted to be a psychiatrist of all things.  I don&#8217;t remember where that came from.  I remember him saying, &#8220;Well, are you sure you want to do that?  Don&#8217;t you want to get married and have children?&#8221;  And I still remember being incensed as a kindergartener.  It&#8217;s like what?  I can&#8217;t do both those things?  And I remember going home and talking to my parents about that and they were like, &#8220;Well of course you can dear.  You can do anything you want to do.&#8221;  So I guess it was my parents, the way they raised us to feel like we could do anything in the world that we wanted to.  So I guess the first time I butted up against someone that was suggesting I couldn&#8217;t do anything that I wanted to do, I remember feeling incensed about that.  So I guess it was my parents just making me believe that I could do anything that I wanted to do as long as I put my mind to it.    There were many, many other things along the way.  I got married very young because I was just real lucky and found a wonderful feminist in Bill Wilson and married him.  But we, well Bill was in graduate school in Syracuse.  And I went there with him and ended up selling televisions at Sears Roebuck and Company because I was such a horrible typist I couldn&#8217;t get a job with the university.  They employed a lot of spouses.  But I remember applying for a credit card with Sears Roebuck.  At the time if you were a graduate student not only Sears but everybody in the world was sending you free credit cards, apply for this, just because you were a graduate student.  So Bill had gotten one of these from Sears, and I applied a credit card with Sears and was denied.  So I kind of marched in there and asked why.  They said, &#8220;Insufficient income.&#8221;  It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, I work for you.&#8221;    Sears was a, when I first moved to Syracuse and was looking for a job, they were trying to comply with a court order against Sears for gender discrimination.  So I just happened to be in that place at that time, and I was, I was the right gender and some college education.  So they were like a-ha, okay, we can--.  So they were placing, they were purposely trying to hire women and place them in big ticket sales departments because I guess the lawsuit had found that they discriminated against women and put them in jobs that weren&#8217;t kind of the big ticket sales jobs.  So that&#8217;s how I came to be employed in the television department at Sears in Syracuse, New York when Bill was in graduate school.  RS:  Did you face any resistance from the other salesmen?  CT:  Absolutely.  RS:  What was that like?  CT:  Well, it was difficult because it was three guys that were supporting their families, and the way the big-ticket sales departments worked was you had to sell so much before you rang this bell, and then you got like three percent of what you sold.  So the only way you really made any serious money was to sell a boatload of product.  And if you didn&#8217;t kind of make that threshold, your base pay was very, very low.  I mean it was a little bit better than minimum wage.  It was pretty pathetic.  So placing me into that department meant that there were four people that had to divide the sales.  So there was a lot of resentment from the three men there, one of whom was laid off from Carrier Air Conditioning.  I understood that and I had some empathy for them, and actually I don&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;d considered this a sell-out, but we really recognized that there was not enough traffic, not enough volume for four of us to make, to make any decent money.  That was a calculated move on the corporation&#8217;s point I&#8217;m sure.  So I just decided that I was not going to compete with them, and I was gonna, so I read lots of novels.  I just let them have the sales.  And I rang up the sales; I stood behind the cash register.  After we kind of came to that realization, I wasn&#8217;t making any money, but they were very generous and nice to me and that was kind of the truce that we had there.  And I knew I was going to be there for a very finite period of time.  And we were living in married student housing and had accepted that vow of poverty for a while.  RS:  And was there, this was in the [19]70s?  CT:  Yeah.  RS:  Were you aware of a kind of feminist movement in Syracuse?  I mean did you see that going--  CT:  Not so much in Syracuse.  I mean definitely at Chapel Hill when I was a student there.  I was thinking about when I was cleaning out some things in our basement the other day, I came across my original version of Our Bodies Ourselves from the [19]70s, and it&#8217;s in other versions.  So Chapel Hill in the [19]70s was very much a politically active time, much more so than I think it is now.  And I was very, my eighteen-year-old son says, &#8220;Mom were you a hippie?&#8221;  It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Everybody was then.&#8221;  So, yeah.  RS:  What year did you graduate?  CT:  I graduated in &#8217;77.  I would&#8217;ve graduated in &#8217;76, but I got married and went to Syracuse with Bill at the end of my junior year and then I came back and finished up after we were in Syracuse.    RS:  And so you were aware of all this stuff going on, but you weren&#8217;t involved in a consciousness raising group or were you, in stuff like that? The sort of movement activities or organizations?  CT:  Well, I maybe not consciousness raising groups.  I was in [19]72 when I was a student in Chapel Hill that was the presidential election in [19]72.  And so I guess I've always been involved in political races of some sort.  That was my first involvement in a presidential campaign.  And I worked on George McGovern&#8217;s presidential campaign in 1972 and what we did as college students then that were involved with the McGovern campaigns, we were canvassers on the weekends.  So we would get shipped out, mostly for me it was some towns in the eastern part of the state, Rocky Mount, and I can&#8217;t remember where else and we would canvass neighborhoods.  And I do remember knocking on doors and having women answer the door, young housewives or middle aged housewives, and your question was &#8220;Do you know who you&#8217;re going to vote for in the presidential election?&#8221; and being astounded by giving frequently some version of &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know.  My husband hasn&#8217;t decided yet.&#8221;  It&#8217;s like what?  So but that was 1972 and that was not an unusual response to that question.  RS:  If somebody said that to you, what would you say then?    CT:  I was just, I mean, we had scripts we were following so I was just thinking &#8220;Oh wow.&#8221;  How can you say that and as all scripts you say, if they answer this then you go to this question.  So I don&#8217;t really remember.  I mean it wasn&#8217;t my role to kind of get into a philosophical conversation.  We were id-ing voters.  So&#8212;  RS:  Right.  So then when you came back, when did you then go on to get your Accounting?  CT:  That was in like 1985, I think.  RS:  So significantly later.  CT:  Yeah, significantly later, and I guess the, worked in the Department of Social Services both as an eligibility specialist and as a child support enforcement officer.  So it was some time after that that I decided to go back in accounting and got a master&#8217;s degree in accounting.  This was, probably at my father&#8217;s urging and I was ready to do something different.  And I think at that time there were not very many women in accounting.  So I think I've always had this kind of chip on my shoulder of having to prove that women could do anything that men could do.  So I went back to school in the MAC program at Chapel Hill that was very, very new at the time.    RS:  Was that an acronym?  CT:  It&#8217;s &#8220;Master&#8217;s of Accounting&#8221; and it&#8217;s grown.  It&#8217;s pretty big now.  So when I got out of the MAC program at Chapel Hill, they were very heavily recruited by what was then the Big Eight accounting firms.  Kind of being in the accounting world that&#8217;s like the top of the, that&#8217;s like the Ivy League.  So they were very active in kind of picking off the graduates of this new program at Chapel Hill, and the business school at Chapel Hill had a great working relationship with all the Big Eight accounting firms.  So if you graduated from that program, you could get a job with a Big Eight accounting firm.  So I had three job offers when I got out of the MAC program.  One was with a Big Eight accounting firm, and one was teaching accounting at North Carolina Central University, and one was being an assistant controller for a corporation in Butner, North Carolina.  I thought these were three really great options.  Actually no, before I went back to get my master&#8217;s degree, I actually worked in a public accounting firm.  If you change jobs all these times, it&#8217;s hard to keep up with all of this.  So I, I actually went back to school at Chapel Hill and took the undergraduate courses that were necessary&#8212;this might have been like [19]81 or something&#8212;so I could take the CPA exam because my dad that was his insistence.  If you&#8217;re going to do this you&#8217;ll always be a second-class citizen unless you have that CPA title.  So you need to do that.  So I just took the undergraduate courses that I needed to take the CPA exam.    And then I worked in public accounting.  I worked for a firm in, this is an interesting story about gender equality.  I worked for a public accounting firm in Durham for five years; I&#8217;m on the five-year plan with lots of things.  I worked in an office with two guys, one of whom is a partner there now.  One&#8217;s a controller somewhere else, but we were about the same age and we got to be really, really great friends.  And we were all in this office together.  We would go out for drinks after work on Thursday.  During the course of this evolving friendship with these two guys I came to realize that one of the guys that we were both hired within six weeks of each other was making 4,000 dollars more--and that was some real money then&#8212;than I was.  It was like what?  We both had the same amount of experience.  I had actually passed four parts of the CPA exam and he&#8217;d only passed two parts.  But very, very similar experience.  So I was like, uh this is, this is not fair.  This is not right.  My dad, I always had this wonderful relationship with him and we talked about everything.  He was a great sort of life coach and advisor especially to me in sort of the male dominated business world.  And I remember talking to him about all of this and he said, "Well, this is interesting."  This is not fair.    I remember it was Business Week came out with an elite article, and it had the scales on the cover and the scales were lop-sided and the man was standing on this side of the scale and it had the more dollars on it than the woman was.  The article in Business Week was about how to protect your company from being sued for inequality in pay.  It was things you had to do to protect yourself against lawsuits.  I thought, hmm, this is interesting.  So I put this Newsweek, when you came into our office there were desks and then there was this credenza where our partners would come in and drop the files of stuff that we were to work on.  This little table was there.  So I just like put this article right on top of where if you came in to drop off stuff for us to do, you&#8217;d see this article.  I remember one of the partners coming in and like, hmm.  Dropped off work and I noticed the next day that the magazine was gone.  Great.  So about some short period of time later, some maybe that next week, I was called into the partner&#8217;s office.  And they always did raises at the same time of year.  It was like after tax season they saw what they, that was their big time of the year, they saw when, how much their revenue was and then they figured out what everybody&#8217;s raises were.  So this was like totally outside of that normal time for raises and I was called in and the partner said, &#8220;Carol, we just want to tell you that we are so pleased with your work.  You&#8217;re doing a great job.&#8221;  Blah, blah, blah.  &#8220;We&#8217;re going to give you a raise,&#8221; a $4,000 raise, exactly.  I just said, &#8220;Thank you very much.&#8221;  And I think we both knew what was going on, and so that&#8217;s a favorite story of mine on how I got a $4,000 raise because of Business Week.    RS:  That&#8217;s great.  CT:  So, I think I've always in my experience and just my inclination have been very committed to doing what I could to make sure things were fair for women.    RS:  It was interesting, I mean you took a very creative approach, but not a confrontational approach.  You didn&#8217;t sort of march in and say, this isn&#8217;t fair.  Do you think if they hadn&#8217;t responded, you would&#8217;ve taken things to another level.    CT:  Yeah, I think I would have.  I think I would have.    RS:  You were patient.  I think I would&#8217;ve been like--.  CT:  Well, I remember talking to my dad about it because my first inclination, I remember calling him that night after I'd been out with my buddies and had come upon this amazing bit of information.  I remember calling my dad and I was very upset and this isn&#8217;t fair.  So he probably counseled me to, he&#8217;s always counseled me on, sleep on it and see what it looks like in the morning, which is always good advice.  RS:  That&#8217;s great.  So during this period were you also involved in Democratic politics?  CT:  I have always been involved as a volunteer especially presidential campaigns really grab me and interest me.  So I've been involved in campaigns as a volunteer a lot.  The first campaign that I was really heavily involved with was Paul Luebke when he first ran for the General Assembly.  He was a neighbor of ours in Durham.  This is kind of much later on in life.  It was before Zach was born, but I served as his campaign treasurer for ten years.  And he&#8217;s a very, very liberal, smart wonderful legislator in the General Assembly.  So that was my first really kind of real substantive other than being a volunteer and doing canvassing and phone banking for people.  My husband also has sort of been involved in political campaigns.  It&#8217;s kind of a point of common interest of ours.    RS:  So okay so you were working in the public accounting, and then you got your master&#8217;s after that.  And then what?  CT:  So after I got my master&#8217;s, after being in public accounting for five years, I got a master&#8217;s degree in accounting.  It was that experience of being in public accounting and realizing kind of what that&#8217;s like and tax season and everything that made me, working for the Big Eight accounting firm was kind of the first thing to get checked off the list.  Although that did have some appeal to me, I think just ego-wise to work for a Big Eight firm.  So I was most intrigued by teaching because I remember my husband saying, &#8220;This is the perfect job for you.  You get to talk; people have to listen.  People have to listen to you; this is perfect for you.&#8221;  So I chose the accounting job at Central, and actually, I've been so fortunate to always have jobs that I've really, really enjoyed.  But I really loved that one, and it was being on a campus and being in, working with young kids and a lot of them from rural North Carolina.  It was great.  I really enjoyed my five years teaching at Central.  RS:  And it must be a good feeling also to be teaching people something that you know is practical and they can go out and use.  CT:  Right.  Yeah.  RS:  What was it like being at Central in particular?  CT:  I loved being at Central.  It was, I guess also it gave me the opportunity to know what it&#8217;s like being a minority, but in a very supportive, wonderful environment.  So it just makes you think of what it would be like to be in a minority when that was not the case.  But I made a lot of great friends there, and I was just really kind of taken into that academic community.  The business school was fairly small so we all knew each other and it was a pretty tight knit group.  RS:  And then why did you leave?  CT:  I left because I was almost forty and pregnant for the first time after being married for twenty years.  That was kind of the surprise, a surprise in life.  Bill and I had planned to start a family about ten years into our marriage, and it just, it didn&#8217;t work out and we kind of went down all the infertility route and adoption and all that, and we kind of given up on that and accepted that that just wasn&#8217;t going to be part of our lives.  Then surprise, surprise, at thirty-nine I was calling my husband saying, &#8220;Guess what, dear?  I&#8217;m at the doctor&#8217;s and they say we&#8217;re going to have a baby.&#8221;  So that was a surprise.  I was actually planning to attend the Central law school the next year.  Because when I was hired at Central, and I really loved that job and I just kind of wanted to stay there forever, but there was a policy that you had to have a terminal degree to be on a tenure tract there.  And I didn&#8217;t have a terminal degree, and at that time they had trouble hiring people that had, in accounting anyway, because people were lured for economic reasons in other areas.  So that&#8217;s kind of how I was able to get this job at Central teaching with a master&#8217;s degree in Accounting and five years of accounting experience.  But what was your question about?  I can&#8217;t remember what you asked and I veered off onto&#8212;  RS:  Oh I had asked why you left Central, and you said you had a baby.  CT:  Right.  But I was going to, I could go to law school there in their night program and get a terminal degree.  So my choices of getting a terminal degree were to get a Ph.D. in Accounting or to get a law degree.  Just kind of the thought of getting a Ph.D. in accounting is something I couldn&#8217;t bear.  I know all that I want to know about accounting.  But the law degree would fulfill that.  But then I found out I was pregnant and life took a different turn and I was delighted.  I stayed home with Zach for five years.    I actually got involved in some advocacy work, and that was kind of the next job that I had after he was about five.  When Zach was little, both of my parents, their health was deteriorating.  I told you my father was a quadriplegic, and so he was starting to have some real health issues and so was my mother.  They ended up needing long-term care.  And at the same time I was thinking about going back to work and looking daycare for my son I was also looking for long-term care for my parents.  And the similarities and the things I was looking at, like staffing ratios and that sort of thing led me to an organization called Friends of Residents in Long Term Care that was an advocacy organization for people in nursing homes and adult care homes.  And I started volunteering with them, and I actually fell in love with their founder and got involved in that organization and I ended up being their first executive director was kind of my first job after Zach was born.    So Zach was, I guess he was about four years old at the time that we were doing this.  So there was kind of a history, there&#8217;s kind of a thread in my life I see being an activist on things that I care about too.  I remember having Zach with me, and I was involved with this organization that I had come across and trying to get into the long-term care world.  We were working on a piece of legislation to change the staffing ratio in adult care homes in North Carolina on the night shift.  It was like an unbelievable one to fifty on the night shift, which I remember first being this has got to be a typo.  This really can&#8217;t be true.  So we were working on that and Zach was four and he was with me all of the time.  And we were at a rally at the General Assembly that I think the Justice Center back then had probably arranged, and it was a kind of an array of different groups with different kind of agendas about what they were interested in.  And I remember I had Zach on my hip, and I had my three minutes that it got to talk about the staffing ratio in adult care homes.  Zach, his grandparents were in adult care home, and he was with me all the time as I was navigating that.  And he came up with this perfect, perfect sound-byte just being his little four year old self that I remember him putting his hands on his hips and saying, &#8220;One person cannot take care of fifty grandmothers and granddaddies.&#8221;  I&#8217;m like yes that&#8217;s it.  That is the message.  So he got to say his message after I did my little three minute thing, and of course the crowd loved it, and that was kind of our little sound-byte.  We got that law changed.    RS:  Wow that&#8217;s great.   CT:  So I think that it&#8217;s like, I was hooked, yeah, citizens really can do something to change how government treats people.  So that was a really defining moment for me too.  It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re hooked then if you&#8217;ve had the privilege of being part of something that is concrete and specific like that.  I was hooked.  And I did that for five years, worked for Friends of Residents in Long Term Care.  And I left that organization after about five years, and it was kind of, both my parents died within a couple of years of each other, and it was around that time that I just kind of stepped back from that.    And then after a little break in the action there, I became aware of this job with Lillian&#8217;s List, and they were, they had reached the point in their sort of evolution of the organization that they were ready to hire their first executive director.  And it was like this is perfect for me.  I know how to run a small nonprofit.  I've been the first ED [executive director] before.  I know how that kind of all works together.  This is, women&#8217;s issues.  This is trying to elect pro-choice, Democratic women.  I had been sort of aware of EMILY&#8217;s List in the past.  And that is what this organization is modeled after.  So I applied for the job.  RS:  That&#8217;s great.  So tell me more about Lillian&#8217;s List, and so it&#8217;s modeled on EMILY&#8217;s List.  What is the, what&#8217;s the origin story of Lillian&#8217;s List.  First of all why don&#8217;t you tell for the recorder who it&#8217;s named after.  CT:  It&#8217;s named after Lillian Exum Clement who was the first woman to serve in the General Assembly in 1920 before women even had the right to vote.  She was elected in Buncombe County so that&#8217;s who the organization&#8217;s named after.  This organization has been around about fifteen years, and I think EMILY&#8217;s List has been around they celebrated their twenty-fifth year three to four years ago.  And it&#8217;s a similar story.  Ellen Malcolm the founder of EMILY&#8217;s List was an IBM executive, and she was involved in some races, and she realized when a friend of hers was defeated in a race, I can&#8217;t remember what state it was in, that women needed to have the early money to be able to put together a campaign.  And EMILY&#8217;s List is, Early Money Is Like Yeast, it makes the dough rise.  There&#8217;s not an Emily that it&#8217;s named after.  So she got her seven closest women friends that were also had achieved, they were powerful women that had achieved ranks in business and government, and they all got together and combined their rolodexes and just all ponied up to give some women running for office some early money and resources that they needed, and that&#8217;s how that started.    So Lillian&#8217;s List started, Laura Edwards in Chapel Hill one of the two founders, worked for EMILY&#8217;s List before and then Jan Allen the other founder, she was an IBM programmer, and she got downsized and when she got downsized, and Jan Allen is a dedicated feminist from way back.  She worked on the Equal Rights Amendment in North Carolina.  So she really wanted to do something to make a difference for women.  So when she got downsized with IBM, she said well&#8212;she had been a member of EMILY&#8217;s list, and she said, &#8220;We need something like this in North Carolina.&#8221;  And she got hooked up with Laura who had worked for EMILY&#8217;s List, and they just decided they were going to start an EMILY&#8217;s List like organization in North Carolina.    There are organizations like, we call them sister list organizations in about fourteen other states that are modeled after EMILY&#8217;s List.  So we get together once a year in Washington, and EMILY&#8217;s List brings us all together and we talk about what we&#8217;re doing and how we can do it better.  There are a couple of other organizations, the Eleanor Roosevelt Society in New York and California List that have been around longer than we have, but we&#8217;re one of the older organizations and there are new ones that pop up all the time, Florida and Texas and Georgia.  It really does make a difference where you&#8217;ve got a concerted, focused effort to do something.  South Carolina, South Carolina I think is, if they&#8217;re not fiftieth, they might be like forty-seventh.  We kind of keep up with where everybody is in the rankings in number of women overall.  Rutgers is the ones that keep all this information up, keep their little cheat sheet here about where everybody, what everybody&#8217;s rankings are.  But it really does make a difference where there&#8217;s a concerted effort.  South Carolina has just an abysmal number of women period, Democrats or Republicans representing them.  New Hampshire is number one with the most women, and we used to be number one in the Southeast.    And you can see steady, steady progress back from 1920 when there were just no women there.  In the [19]70s you started seeing some building of that, and we did a video that I should share with you that somebody did for our tenth year celebration.  It interviewed a lot of people like Bea Holt that was in the General Assembly, and she talks about what it was like to be there when there really was not critical mass of women in the General Assembly, about how they were viewed.  And she talks about how things change, when you get to the tipping point of a critical mass of women when everybody realizes we&#8217;re not going anywhere.  We&#8217;re here to stay, and she talks about how it starts to change the culture, but only when you get to that tipping point of critical mass.    So we were feeling really good about ourselves until 2010 hit, and it was just an abysmal year for women in elected office.  I mean for the first time ever the number of women decreased in Congress; it decreased in North Carolina and just about everywhere else.  It was just a really, a wake up year.  And we all had to kind of sit back and think about, are we doing what we do in the most strategic way possible.  So we kind of had some focus groups and some little meetings with some of our major donors and other people to talk about how we were doing, what we were doing.  It was through those conversations that we decided to create this other entity so we could expand our building the pipeline in our training programs.  So that kind of came out of that, the defeats that everybody faced in 2010.    RS:  The other entity being--?  CT:  The Lillian&#8217;s List Action Fund, which is our c(4) organization.  RS:  So do you think it was, I mean I know it was a major blow to women, but since you focus on progressive women and it was a major blow to progressives in general, how much of what you saw happened was progressives being sent out of office versus women being--.  CT:  Well, progressive women took the biggest hit from that for sure.  There, but there had been an increasing number of Republican women in the General Assembly over time also.  There always have been more Democratic women in the General Assembly.  What we were really, the fallout from the 2010 election of course was that the Republicans controlled both chambers of the General Assembly, and they were able to dictate the redistricting process, and that will paint the picture for what it looks like for the next decade.  And interestingly, I was just reading the newspaper this morning, that court case over that is moving along at a glacial pace, and they&#8217;re now trying to determine what records that relate to redistricting that they have to turn over to the people that have filed the lawsuit against that.  But what the fallout in redistricting, we had twenty-five women that served in the General Assembly and forty percent of them were, Democratic women were double-bunked or drawn into a district where it was impossible for them to run.  I maintain that there&#8217;s no way that you can say that wasn&#8217;t deliberate.  There was no other group of people that was targeted like Democratic women were targeted.  Republican women were not targeted like that at all.  I mean, there were fourteen Republican women one of them was double-bunked, but she had already decided that she was not going to run anyway.  So that didn&#8217;t even count in my book.  There were some other people that were double-bunked but nobody like Democratic women.  I mean they, I just think on the evidence you can&#8217;t say that it was anything other than deliberate.  So we had a lot of people, a lot of women that had served very well, smart progressive women--Jennifer Weiss was one of them--that when you look at all these districts and the strange sea animals that they all look like, in case after case--.  Her district was drawn in such a way that the line, I mean the line snakes out and comes back and here is Jennifer.  And she should&#8217;ve, it would&#8217;ve been very easy to leave her in the district where she was.    RS:  Okay.  So you started this new training organization.  What is the emphasis going to be for that, and how much have you already started doing at this point?  CT:  We were given some seed money back at the end of last year, and we&#8217;ve got some people that are investing in this.  Will, that you saw upstairs is a full-time employee of this entity, of this new entity.  I am the executive director, but he is the one kind of doing the program part of this.  And we, he&#8217;s primarily involved in identifying pipeline candidates, and so we&#8217;re trying to use different resources to pull together a bench group of women that we could, that might be interested in running for General Assembly and later on, other things as well.  So we have done some research and identified women serving on city councils, county commissioners and school boards.  We&#8217;re having conversations with other groups of likely candidates like Association of Women Attorneys, Nurses&#8217; Association.  We&#8217;re trying to build a pipeline of people, of women, progressive women that we can talk in to running for office.  So that&#8217;s part of it, is kind of the bench building, the pipeline building.  The other part of that is once we identify and find these women and sort of vet them on their progressive values, then we want to provide them with training.  We&#8217;ve already done this training that we&#8217;re doing this weekend will be the sixth training that we&#8217;ve done so far this year.  We&#8217;ve done trainings on developing your message, on delivering your message, on fundraising.  We did one with Planned Parenthood about how to talk about choice, and then we&#8217;re doing this training where we&#8217;re looking at a collection of progressive issues to give people kind of the policy briefing on that and then be able to, being able to talk about it during campaign.  RS:  So Lillian&#8217;s List fits in a kind of political landscape in North Carolina where, we were talking about this before in the interview, there are a couple of other organizations that train women, or at least one other.  But Lillian&#8217;s List trains, even in this new non-partisan section, is aimed at progressive women which includes pro-choice, I mean pro-choice is part of it.  Can you talk a little bit about why, why that remains such a core issue for Lillian&#8217;s List and how you see that fitting into that political landscape?  CT:  I think the two women that started Lillian&#8217;s List felt very, very passionately about choice as an issue.  Different generations of women have kind of come into this maybe from a different perspective.  But both of the founders of Lillian&#8217;s List felt very, very strongly that reproductive freedom, or women being able to make their own decisions about their reproductive lives, was a core theme that all women had to be in control of that part of their lives or they didn&#8217;t have any control over any part of their lives.  And I think they attracted a group of women and men that shared that core foundational belief, and so, like any nonprofit organization that comes together you come together and pool your resources and talents to do something that compels all of you.  So the commitment to reproductive rights for women is just a core foundational thing for us, and it would, even kind of moving into the training realm it sets us apart from other organizations that just train women.    And I think you always have to go back to what your core organizational values are, and that&#8217;s one thing that I think has led to Lillian&#8217;s List success is that we&#8217;re very clear about that.  I mean a lot of nonprofit organizations can have mission creep, and they try to do so many things, and they kind of lose their way and end up doing a little bit in lots of things and not having a kind of a clear strategic focus.  So, I've appreciated that from the staff side of working for an organization that is very, very clear about what our focus is.  We&#8217;re interested in identifying and supporting and promoting pro-choice women that want to run for office.    We can see in this last General Assembly anyway how very, very important it is that women are in these roles and making these decisions.  I mean, there were decisions made in this last General Assembly, the women&#8217;s right to know legislation, the defunding Planned Parenthood that I think we saw all the bad things that could happen, happened this last time.  And so what happened in this last session has really galvanized a lot of progressive women to say, &#8220;Yes, I may not have thought that I necessarily wanted to run for the General Assembly, but we&#8217;ve got to step up and do this.&#8221;  This is a, I think women coming to this come to it more out of an obligation to be the ones at the table that are making decisions about their lives and their family&#8217;s lives.  Certainly a rational person wouldn&#8217;t do it for money or fame or glory.  So but it&#8217;s really galvanized a lot of people to say, women we have to step up and we have to serve because it&#8217;s important who serves.  RS:  So do you think we&#8217;ll see a significant change in the coming years?  CT:  I think we will make significant strides in moving in that direction.  We, this time around Lillian&#8217;s List has been around.  The Lillian&#8217;s List PAC has been around for fifteen years.  We have more feature candidates now than we&#8217;ve ever had before, twenty-six, which is a lot more than we&#8217;ve ever had before.  So we&#8217;re biting off a lot and, but there&#8217;s just a lot of interest.  It will, it may take more than one election cycle to get where we want to be, but I think we&#8217;re making strides in that.  The redistricting has made it a lot more challenging with the way the districts are drawn, but you know, you don&#8217;t get to just give up because it's tough.  We want to always make sure we&#8217;re doing what we&#8217;re doing in the smartest way possible.  But we&#8217;re not going to throw up our hands and throw in the towel.  RS:  So you said that a lot more women have been kind of galvanized by the attacks on women&#8217;s rights that we saw recently.  I've, and maybe that, well I've read in some academic literature that it really often takes someone, a woman in particular being tapped on the shoulder to get them to think about running.  CT:  It does.  Yeah.  RS:  What else, so what else does it take to--.  You said you&#8217;ve gone out and tried to identify women.  I was interested to hear like nurses&#8217; organization, like thinking broadly about who would make a good&#8212;  CT:  Legislators.  RS:  Legislator and candidate.  Are there other sorts of categories of people that you think when we think about women, we think differently than when we think about men.  Like do you I&#8217;m just trying to think, if broadening out who can be a good legislator.    CT:  Right.  RS:  What other groups do you sort of look toward, or how do you identify women if they&#8217;re not already&#8230;  CT:  Well, yeah.  I think maybe to back up a little bit and we kind of come at this at, there are many women in different walks of lives that would be excellent legislators just because of their life experience.  Educators are always, we always love to have people who are educators there.  Nurses, we&#8217;ve recently begun to make some inroads into looking at, especially retired military women as a great source of people that have the background and experience to really be strong leaders.  But we also kind of come at this from the perspective, and this is just a strategic perspective, is that every year and this year was a little different because it was a redistricting year.  But we&#8217;re on a two-year cycle for General Assembly seats and there are 120 in the House of Representatives and fifty in the Senate.  So you&#8217;ve got 170 seats.  Every two years only about a dozen of those races are really in play just because the way the districts are drawn.  So you first of all have to kind of hone in on those twelve places where it&#8217;s possible.  And then you start, then you delve into that community, and you start looking for women that served in some elected office before.  That&#8217;s a natural place to look, and it&#8217;s people that have the experience and inclination.  But also to tap into local communities and in all communities there are people that I think of as connectors, and they&#8217;re frankly a lot of times women, the people that know everybody in town.  They&#8217;re involved in a number of ways in connections to their communities.  If you find out who those ten women are, they can, they can identify that these are the four people that you need to talk to.  So women I think are very horizontal in their connections and relationships that they have with each other.  So we&#8217;ve always sort of approached our, once we figure out the twelve places we&#8217;re going to look we kind of get local and look to see what women might be interested in serving.    The interesting thing and the research that we were talking about earlier, women have to be asked three times to do this.  And so we just want to get out there early and ask a lot of people.  It&#8217;s very difficult to talk somebody into running for a General Assembly seat.  It&#8217;s on many levels a thankless job.  The pay is not good; the hours are long.  You really have to be doing it for the right reasons or there&#8217;s no rational reason that anybody would do it.  But you have to be asked about three times, and women have to have an opportunity to think about this for a while too because when you, I've spent the last six and a half years trying to talk women into running for office.  And there are a lot of reasons why a rational person would not want to do this, and so you have to keep asking and people have to consider this as a possibility.  It&#8217;s also especially challenging for women because the way our General Assembly is, it&#8217;s allegedly a part-time job.  Economically speaking you really have to be retired, independently wealthy or married to a breadwinner who doesn&#8217;t mind you having this kind of job.  So it makes it a real challenge for anyone, not just women to consider doing this.    RS:  What is would you say is the, I mean, there&#8217;s forever been this kind of divide in the women&#8217;s movement or a tension among one group says women should run for office because they&#8217;re different from men.  They bring a different perspective; they are more, more, better peacemakers, moderators, whatever.  They have special women&#8217;s qualities.  And then the other group says women should run for office and be in office because we&#8217;re the same as men, and we&#8217;re fifty percent of the population, and we should be equally represented.  What do you think, does Lillian&#8217;s List have a kind of basic fundamental belief in one or the other of those?  Because I think that the organizations that just train women tend to from my experience come down on the women are better at X and Y.  We bring special womanly quality, and that&#8217;s why we should be in there.  Does Lillian&#8217;s List have kind of a fundamental belief in one or the other of those?  CT:  That&#8217;s a very interesting question, and it&#8217;s kind of the same debate I have with my eighteen-year-old son who just sort of jokingly kids me that it&#8217;s not fair that you just recruit women to run.  So it&#8217;s a very interesting question, and it&#8217;s one that we all kind of grapple with a lot.  I think our kind of premise is that women are underrepresented and I joke with Zach, when we get close to, we&#8217;re fifty-two percent of registered voters.  I said, &#8220;When we get close to fifty percent, I&#8217;ll stop.&#8221;  So I think we start from the premise that women are underrepresented, and that it&#8217;s beneficial to everyone, men and women, that you not have a terribly underrepresented, any underrepresented group in our representative democracy.  So we, we don&#8217;t feel that women are inherently better than men, but we feel like that our government will be better, that any system will be better if everyone is somewhat represented in that.  So I think we start from that premise.    The other thing that is interesting is that we while we do, our progressive values are core to what we do.  And we&#8217;re not just recruiting and training any woman.  In the General Assembly we are, this is the world that my son has to live in just like other people&#8217;s daughters and so I&#8217;m looking for people that will make this a better world.  And I don&#8217;t think women are inherently superior to men in that regard.  So in our looking at where we&#8217;re going to recruit people to run, if there is a progressive Democrat, this is my Josh Stein example, we would never run anybody against Josh Stein because he&#8217;s wonderful.  So there&#8217;s so many other places that we could go and look to, and we need progressive men there as well.  So we&#8217;re not looking to take over&#8212;  RS:  Unseat men.  CT:  We&#8217;re looking to&#8212;yeah.  Progressive men.  There were, this time some very unprogressive men that had voted against what we would think of as women&#8217;s rights that we would recruit somebody to run against them.  RS:  Right.  Right.  Right.  What has it been like for Lillian&#8217;s List to have a woman governor?  Has that made any difference to the organization or--?  CT:  Well, I think it&#8217;s something we definitely all felt very proud of.  She&#8217;s, and we supported her in that regard.  I think she, she stepped into a situation that was a horrible situation to step into, that there were a lot of economic things that were not of her making.  Just like Barack Obama stepped into an awful mess that was not of his making either.  So she&#8217;s had some real challenges in that regard.  But no, we were very proud of her and proud to have the first woman governor of the state of North Carolina, and I think that will, it make other women and little girls.  RS:  Whoops.  CT:  Wow.  See that&#8212;  RS:  The lights just went out.  CT:  They don&#8217;t know that&#8212;it doesn&#8217;t know that we&#8217;re in here.  We have to move around.  Yeah.  The motion detector.  So and she was also supported by EMILY&#8217;s List so we were happy to have a female governor in North Carolina.  RS:  In addition to organizations like Lillian&#8217;s List that support women running and recruit and train, what else do you think is going to need to happen, or what other kinds of organizations might we need or what role should academics play?  I mean, what is going to need to happen before we get parity in the halls of the legislature.  I mean we&#8217;ve been moving at such a slow&#8212;  CT:  Glacial pace.  RS:  Pace.  CT:  I think the biggest threat to democracy right now is Citizens United.  That&#8217;s not specific to a gender thing.  But I think for us to get to where we need to be in gender equality, in our represented office, we&#8217;ve got to have a more engaged citizenry that feels like we own this democracy and that we&#8217;re engaged and participatory in it or we&#8217;re not going to get there.  I think the biggest obstacles to that right now are the incredible money that&#8217;s able to float into campaigns.  And this goes back to my accounting and kind of business background that our Supreme Court would decide on a free speech thing, issue that corporations are people and that they should have the same rights as everybody else is one of the worst Supreme Court decisions, right up there with Dred Scott,  I think that they&#8217; ever made.  And I think it&#8217;s a huge, huge threat to our democracy and because it means that we are losing control.  The citizens, it&#8217;s no longer a democracy of and by the citizens.  It&#8217;s going to be of and by corporations, and we&#8217;ll never get there as women unless we can somehow figure out how to blast through that roadblock.  RS:  So how can we blast through that roadblock?  CT:  Well, there are some people that are contemplating what it would take to kind of reverse a decision like that, and those are people that are smarter than I am.  I really, really don&#8217;t know.  I mean it&#8217;s a, it was a Supreme Court decision.  And I think we&#8217;re going to have to really rethink, but I think people are going to have to own this democracy and be responsible for participating in it or you cede your responsibilities, and we&#8217;re end up being run and controlled by mega-corporate interests, and I think any time you have concentrations of power it&#8217;s not a good thing.  Tolkien [Tocqueville] was right.  And whether it&#8217;s all men or all corporations, power is a dangerous thing and I think it has to be dispersed, and I think it has to be dispersed along in many different categories and levels, and it has to be dispersed between men and women.  But mainly citizens need to say, &#8220;This is my democracy.  I own it; I control it.&#8221;  But to do that we have to be responsible, and we have to participate in it.    And I think also one thing that gives me such hope for a next generation and not necessarily my generation is the ability to critically look at issues and make your own decisions.  I remember the health care debate, the health care debate early in Obama&#8217;s administration about whether we were going to have a single payer system.  There was a recess in Congress, and that was when the tea party really kind of came to action and had this ridiculous debate in the airwaves about the death panels and all that.  At the same time my son was on the debate team at his school for four years, which I just absolutely love.  I think our democracy would be so strengthened if everybody were required to participate in a debate program.  They were, they debate lots of different topics and one of them was the health care one, and the kind of debate that he did was where you have to argue either side.  And during the course of a debate tournament you&#8217;re arguing either side multiple times.  And to see, I mean that&#8217;s people, young citizens owning the debate and making decisions based on evidence and based on who has the best argument.  And I think that&#8217;s what we have to do in our democracy, and that&#8217;s the kind of things that we have to promote.  I think the academic community could be a huge resource in helping citizens frame the debate in a way that&#8217;s intelligent and based on evidence.  RS:  I was just reading the Texas Republican state party platform, did you see this?  That part of the party platform says, &#8220;We oppose,&#8221;--it&#8217;s in their education section&#8212;&#8220;we oppose the teaching of critical thinking skills.&#8221;  Literally.  It&#8217;s unbelievable.  CT:  Wow.  Wow.  We can just all be lemmings and march into the sea.  Yeah, I mean, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s dangerous to a democracy.  I think we should always challenge each other and that was something that I think is a legacy of growing up with my father is we, we loved to debate things and take the opposite positions.  I mean, that was something I grew up learning to value.  We don&#8217;t value that in our democracy, and I think, I used to tell my students at Central that I wanted them to be able to think critically and make their own decisions and evaluate different courses of actions.  I mean accounting is using, is about allocating scarce resources, and you have to be able to critically evaluate different options and using that kind of information, and you can&#8217;t blindly accept anybody else&#8217;s dogma, and I used to tell them, &#8220;When I&#8217;m an old woman, I want you guys to be making critical decisions that affect everybody&#8217;s lives.  It&#8217;s okay to have a different position.&#8221;    That was also the other thing I loved about debate is you get to construct an argument, and somebody else is going to tear it down, and the only way you come to the best decision is if those two sides can compete with each other, and the best argument and the best position is going to win.  And we don&#8217;t have a debate like that going on in our country.  The other thing that I really love about it is you have to compete with your ideas, and you have to do it in a civilized fashion because if you don&#8217;t, the judges are just going to kick you out of there.  But, and we don&#8217;t do that in this country, and it&#8217;s a real, real loss.  And I think that the more educated people are the better able they are to have that kind of dialogue and to have the best ideas and the best solutions emerge.  We&#8217;ve got some really serious problems, and we need to have some intelligent solutions too.    RS:  You&#8217;ve had this really interesting career, this kind of education and accounting, and political advocacy, and activism.  Looking back over that, the course of that, is there anything that strikes you about your own sort of development or your own path that is of interest to you?  CT:  Well, I think it has, you get more reflective the older you get, and I think it has made me realize in lots of different levels and ways that we&#8217;re all in this together and that we have to figure this out together.  I think you&#8217;re, the kind of political philosophy and the religious philosophies that we have are just really about how we are all playing in the sandbox together.  I think that&#8217;s at the end of the day you just sort of start reflecting on that and how you are in the world and how you treat your fellow human beings is really all that matters.  I think you realize that as a parent too and what you, the values that you want your children to have in the world.  You want them to be happy, but I remember somebody said, &#8220;Do you want your children to be happy or to be good?&#8221; and what you want is if they&#8217;re good, they will be happy.  So&#8230;  RS:  Is there anything that I didn&#8217;t ask you about that you want to talk about or reflect back on?  CT:  No, I think we covered a lot of territory.  RS:  Well, thank you very much for sharing your story.  CT:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
