 Finchum  Hunter  Today is April 14, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. Today we   re in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to speak with Zella Mae  Hunter, and this is regarding our 100 Year Life Project, so thank you for  having us today. Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you  were born.  You ready?  Yes.  Nineteen eleven, August 29, Porter, Oklahoma.  And what did your parents do for a living?  Farmers.  Were they from there, or had they moved?  From Paris, Arkansas, to Oklahoma.  Well, a little ways. Did you have brothers and sisters?  Oh, yes.  And how many?  Three brothers and one sister.  And where were you in the order?  The baby.  5  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  The baby. Did you get out of doing chores?  No, because she had lost some in between. She was a mother of nine, but  only four of us survived. Farmers in the new country and all of that had  its effect on them.  What did they farm?  Cotton, corn.  So you had to pick cotton?  Oh, yes.  Well, did you go to school?  Oh, yes, I went to school here in Tulsa, high school.  What about elementary school, first grade?  Porter, in the country.  I   m not sure where Porter is from here.  Close to Wagoner, in Wagoner County.  Okay. It   s a smaller town?  Yes.  Can you talk a little bit about the house that you grew up in?  The house?  Yes.  Well, it was more or less a shack. My grandfather lived with us, and he  knew how to make shingles. We had a cellar that we went in when it  stormed. Just poor folks. That   s all.  Did your mother do a lot of canning?  Yes, when she was able to can. When I say that, I mean that there wasn   t  much to can on the land where we lived: a few chickens, a cow or two, a  couple of dogs, (Laughter) and my kitty. I had my cat.  6  Bishop  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Bishop  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Did he have a name? What was the name of your kitten?  Kitty Cat. (Laughter)  Did you have to milk?  No, I had to churn. You don   t know anything about that.  Oh, yes.  Homemade butter?  Butter, oh, yes.  Do you remember seeing your first car?  Yes, I do.  How about the first ride you took in one?  My brother-in-law bought a  Model  T Ford, and I got to ride in that. I  wasn   t very old.  What about your first airplane?  I   ve had several airplane rides here from Tulsa to California, Florida,  Texas, Kentucky. I   ve been around a little bit. (Laughter)  It sounds like it.  Well, I   ve done a lot of church work, and that necessitated my travel.  What did you do most of your life, relative to the church?  Whatever I was asked to do. Small congregation.  And what was your role?  Oh, teaching children, yes. I have a few of them around now, and they  check on me, and one or two that live far away, and they call and check  on me.  Did you sing in the choir?  Oh, no, I could not sing. (Laughter) That I have to deny. Oh, I couldn   t  7  Finchum  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Finchum  sing. I enjoyed a little singing.  When you were growing up, what were some things you did for fun?  Oh, I played basketball in high school.  Where did you go to high school?  Here.  What was the name?  Booker T. Washington.  What position did you play?  Center.  Center. Tall. Was it half-court? Was it a half-court game at that point  for girls?  Yes, I guess you   d call it that. I kind of forget some things.  I think for girls they just did half-court early.  Oh, yes, you didn   t go across that line.  Yes.  I have fun with some of the younger people. I let them know that my  team at Booker T. was the first team to wear shorts. They weren   t really  short; they come to my knee. (Laughter)  Well, before shorts what did you wear? A skirt?  Bloomers. Did you ever see those? They were pleated and had elastic.  That does not sound very comfortable.  Yes, they were very comfortable.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Shorts, though.  8  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  When you   re a kid, everything   s comfortable, you know, if the teacher  lets you do it. (Laughter)  I assume you   re the oldest living alum from Booker T. Washington  today?  Yes, they tried to get me into this celebration, but I just didn   t feel up to  it, the physical part, so I just had to deny them.  Can you tell us a little bit about your days in high school at Booker T.  Washington? Do you remember anything?  Well, since that   s as far as I went in school, it was the joy of my life. We  had good teachers. We loved them. Booker T., of course, was the only  black high school. Tulsa wasn   t big. We got to know everybody. We  knew kids. I lived in what they called the Lansing Addition close to  Lansing  Avenue , and then there were kids that lived in the Greenwood  Addition on that side of town. Then we all came together in the seventh  grade at Booker T.  What year did you graduate?  Thirty-one was my class. Dr. John Hope Franklin was my classmate, my  class president. He just died. The two of us were the last two living in  the class. I think he was ninety-four. He did a lot with his life. His dad,  of course, was a lawyer, a salaried man, you know, and was able to do  for his family.  I think he was a professor, wasn   t he?  Historian, he wrote books.  And after high school, what did you do?  I went to work as a domestic. Worked for a lovely family, and my life  today is as easy as it is because of them. They were a good family, two  adopted children. They are gone, naturally.  And then when did you get married?  (To granddaughter) You remember?  Well, then, let   s go back. How did you meet your husband?  In high school. He went to high school at Haskell and came to Tulsa and  9  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  finished here.  So probably in the   30s is when you married him?  Now, isn   t that funny. It must have been 1929, I think it was. (To  granddaughter) What year was your daddy born? Nineteen thirty.  That   s okay.  Kind of bumfuzzled there.  It was during the Depression?  Yes, yes.  Well, one of the questions I have, because Tulsa has a history, were you  in Tulsa at the time of the race riots?  No, I came here in 1925.  So you missed all of that.  Things were still kind of bad then, but we survived.  They   ve been talking a lot about the history of those riots recently.  They   re a very interesting history.  My oldest brother was here working.  You got here about the time of the Depression then, just before.  Yes.  What was that like?  That was terrible because it was    made work    they called it. I think my  husband worked about fourteen days a month, made work, you know.  The Dust Bowl and all of that was during that time. People started  leaving Oklahoma and going to California.  Did your parents stay here in Tulsa?  Yes.  They didn   t move again?  10  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  We moved from the farm to Parsons, Kansas, for a year and then to  Tulsa. I was about twelve, I think, eleven or twelve then. I remember  going to Dunbar  Grade  School in the fifth and sixth grade. At least  that   s the way I remember it. (Laughs)  Were any of your siblings in the war?  The oldest brother, I guess. He never did come back to the farm when  the war was over. He came to Tulsa.  Well, when your parents moved here, did they still have a farm?  No, we never owned a farm. We were sharecroppers, if you know what  that is.  I do, rough life.  You could buy a sack of meal, I think about twenty-five pounds, and a  fifty-pound sack of flour and a sack of sugar. You got that at Porter from  the merchant. Your crops paid for that, so you started all over again,  borrowing so you could make it. I can kind of remember those things.  Hearing people talk about them makes me remember more. We made  our sorghum syrup on the farm. (Laughs)  It   s good on homemade biscuits.  Oh, yes. I still can   t find any cornbread dressing like my mother used to  make. (Laughter)  I can   t either.  Did she pass that secret off to you, that recipe?  No, that   s a pretty good cook over there. It kind of fell on her.  (Laughter)  Skipped a generation.  Yes.  Can you talk a little bit about your family, you and your husband,  raising children? What was that like?  My family played out, died out, and that was strange because when we  moved to Tulsa, the two last boys to move here became merchants. One  ran a fish and grocery market, and the other one ran a grocery store.  11  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Each one of them had one child, and one of them a whole lot of  grandchildren, but the other one didn   t have any grandchildren. The one  that went to war did not have children. My sister had one daughter. She  lived to be thirteen and passed.  Of course, they were teenagers when I was born, and that made me not  really grow up with them until we moved to Tulsa. We loved one  another, you know, but the black family was different because of  slavery. I had a friend, the first woman to finish Tulsa University. She  was in a class, and they were talking about blacks and whites. She told  me what the conversation was like. The black family sent their daughters  to college, but the boys stayed on the farm, did the farming. I think my  brothers were the exception in that they were able to have good wives  that worked with them to produce like they did for so long. That   s it.  How many children did you have?  Just the one son, but I   ve got a bunch of grandchildren. (Laughter) I  have two granddaughters that live here in the block, and they see after  me, and a great-granddaughter lives across the street over there with  children. That keeps me alert.  What was it like for you to be a mother?  Joy of my life. My son went to Booker T., was one of their best football  players. That made my husband and me proud.  Was he aware that you were on the first team to wear shorts?  Yes because I had my picture in the book.  Okay. (Laughs)  It   s here somewhere.  I know when you play sports, you pass your stories on to your kids.  (Laughs) He played football, and that made you pretty proud. Did you  go to a lot of his games?  Oh, yes, wouldn   t miss one. Sat there with my heart beating until my son  would get up and I   d know he was all right. I went to the games to take  care of him. (Laughter) No, that was fun, going to the games. As I said,  there wasn   t too many people in Tulsa then, so we knew everybody.  Now, when you went to Booker T. Washington, you talked about the  teachers. During your time at Booker T. Washington, was there a  12  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Joyce  Hunter  Joyce  Hunter  teacher that you remember that was very important to you?  Oh, yes, yes, the subjects that I liked. I loved my English teacher. I  really loved my sewing teacher. That became my hobby. I passed it on to  her. She sews. I loved music class because I love to hear them sing, be  able to carry notes, but I really couldn   t carry a note. The teacher tried,  but it was one of those things I wasn   t blessed with. (Laughter)  Did you make quilts?  Oh, yes, sure did. My mother did a lot of quilting. That was her hobby  and what she did to make the living. Quilts, made quilts for folks. That  was here in Tulsa when we moved here.  Did she use cotton feed sacks, flour sacks, to make her quilts?  When we were in the country, she used the cotton sacks for sheets for  the boys    beds. The bottom part would be worn out. She   d take them and  sew them together. Those fifty-pound flour sacks, she made sheets for  my bed and her bed. We made it.  So you were in Tulsa when desegregation was going on? In the   60s, you  were here     Yes.     the   60s and   70s, when desegregation     I was at a meeting at First Baptist Church, black, and heard Martin  Luther King speak. I also heard the woman that sat on the bus.  Rosa Parks?  Parks, I   ve heard her speak, yes. I   ve seen a little history in my time.  Yes, just a little. (Laughs)  I laugh and tell everybody I   ve lived to see   tell her, Joyce.  What?  I   ve lived to see how many presidents? Nineteen isn   t it?  I think so.  Nineteen presidents. What else? Oh, I know now how I put it. I said I   ve  13  Finchum  Hunter  Joyce  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  lived seven generations of my family, fifty years of marriage, what else?  Nineteen presidents.  And nineteen presidents. Seven generations of my family. Let   s see. My  mind is getting me stuck. Then I had a hobby of cutting out articles and  pasting them in a book if I didn   t want to forget them. The one article  that I cherish most, since it was just stuff, and I just got this last year, the  United States    last fifty years. What   s the president   s name?  Obama?  Clinton has the highest IQ, Jimmy Carter, the second, and Kennedy the  third. I have fun asking everybody that question. (Laughter) Do they  know those presidents with the highest IQs? Articles like that I kept  because I didn   t want to lose that little knowledge, and every once in a  while when I could see I would look at the book.  Well, part of your history has been electricity and running water     Yes.     microwave.  Yes, all of that good stuff.  All that good stuff, I guess, and now cellphones.  Yes, I don   t like that. (Laughter) She brings hers over, and I use it.  Different from having a party line.  Oh, yes, yes indeed.  I want to know, in terms of going back to the   50s and   60s, what was  the Civil Rights Movement like here in Tulsa? Were you involved in any  way, or do you remember any of the things that went on in Tulsa?  No more than we tried to stay together. We   ve always had NAACP. The  name of that other one just skipped me. We tried to stay together and do  what was best for the community. It was tough. You   d go in a store to  buy something, and if a white person come up, they   d let you stand there  and wait until that person was waited on. That hurt. You couldn   t eat  anywhere but at Chris   , and that wasn   t very pleasant. They didn   t want  to wait on you. It was rough.  14  Finchum  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  You were lucky coming out of the Depression. That   s the reason I say  my life hasn   t been so bad, in that I made a pretty good marriage and  worked for a good family and had one son, so I feel like I did pretty  good. It could have been a lot worse, but it wasn   t. That   s about all.  Well, would you travel to Boley any?  To Boley? Oh yes, we had a church at Boley and used to go down there  for meetings, and one of my best friends is from Boley. When I had my  hundredth birthday celebration, her daughter from California sent me  fifty dollars. (Laughs)  Only fifty? I would have expected a hundred dollar bill.  Well, I was glad to get fifty. (Laughter)  Did you eat at  Charlie  Truelove   s Hamburgers in Boley?  Truelove?  Truelove Hamburgers?  I guess I did because I ate everything they had around there. (Laughter)  That was fun.  They had places to dance, too, from what I understand.  Yes. It was a black town, and they had a bank. They had everything. It  just was a small town, and the whole community around there was  black. They had a nice high school.  I   ve just heard a lot about the hamburgers. (Laughter) They   re supposed  to be very good.  Yes.  Did you expect to live to a hundred?  Oh no, no, no way. I have to wonder why the good Lord is letting me  stay here.  He   s not finished.  You wonder what it is he has in mind.  I don   t know. (Laughs)  15  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  I wrote to my brother-in-law the other day, and you ought to see me  writing it. (Laughs) I told him I was easing up on 103. (Laughter)  How old were your parents when they passed?  My dad was seventy-one, and my mother was eighty-seven.  So has anyone lived to be a hundred in your family?  No.  Goes back to churning butter. (Laughter)  Yes.  So I want to know, how important was religion in your family? Can you  talk a little bit about the importance of religion in your family?  Oh, very important, very important. Yes, very important. My parents  held no leading positions, but they were very cooperative and really saw  to it that I went to Sunday school and church.  That   s what I thought. (Laughs)  Yes.  If they had to discipline you, who did, your father or your mother?  Oh, my mother. My dad never would have laid a hand on me. I was his  little girl. He was so proud of me, and he didn   t want anybody to bother  me. (Laughter) I got away with a lot.  That   s the advantage of being the baby of the family. What do you think  contributed to your longevity? What   s your secret?  Well, I would think first of all was my religion, the guidance that I had,  and I had good parents. My mama was strict on us, but it was for good,  and it helped me to choose good friends. I don   t know what else.  And do you have a philosophy or a motto you live by today?  I have a very good younger friend in my church, very inspirational. Does  that answer your question?  Well, I want to know is there something, a philosophy or some type of  16  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  motto, you live by?  No more than trying to issue all of the good that I can, and I can   t do a  lot now, but I just believe in living right. That has been my principal  thing, is to be sure that I live right, try to be an example to younger  people. I have that coming back to me now. Talk to somebody,    Oh,  Mrs. Hunter, I can remember you when you used to come to PTA. I  remember when you       and it   s encouraging.  What   s a typical day like for you today? When do you wake up? What do  you do? When do you go to bed? What   s a typical day for someone your  age?  I usually wake up around seven o   clock, and I still fix my own breakfast.  I   m very slow in the mornings because I have this condition of my feet  and they   re painful, so I dread moving on them. I still ask her to let me  do what I can for as long as I can, so I do a little laundry, I change my  bed, and she does the cleaning. (Laughter) Otherwise, it wouldn   t be  clean. I can   t do anything heavy anymore because I can   t see, but what I  can feel to do   I haven   t lost my sight so long ago that I don   t  remember where I have things, so I can put my hands on them. It   s been  painful to lose two of my good senses, my hearing and my eyesight. I  would love to have kept them, but I   m like I was by my son   s death. I  said,    Well, the good Lord let me keep him sixty-two years, so he let me  keep these two senses for a hundred years, so I won   t complain.    I do as  little complaining as possible. She might catch more than she needs to,  but   . (Laughter)  Well, she   s family. That   s okay.  Yes. So that   s it.  What time do you usually go to bed at night?  Anywhere from twelve to one thirty     Oh, wow.     but I   m sitting up sleeping. (Laughter) I wish I could go to bed and  not know anything.    Look what time it is     So then I try to rush and get  into bed.  Do you read a lot, or did you used to?  Oh yes, I used to read a lot. That was one of my joys.  17  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Bishop  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  What were some of your things that you used to read, or your favorite?  Junk. (Laughter) The newspaper, magazines, different articles, you  know, things that I could keep up with.  You must like current events.  Oh, yes, Jet Magazine, Ebony.  What about the Bible?  Oh, twelve o   clock at night when I come from back there to the  bedroom, I read my chapter before I go to bed. I   m thinking I   m in the  bedroom, I   m looking, my Bible is right beside my bed. It   s the kind of  Bible that when my pastor could tell I was losing my eyesight made me  a present of it. It has the thin white sheets, and believe it or not, that   s  the only thing that I can read comfortably is a Bible. So yes, I read the  Bible.  I imagine you   ve read it through a time or two.  Oh, yes, yes, I sure have. I   m just finishing up Paul   s letters to the  churches.  Well, is there anything left on your wish list you   d like to do?  That I   d like to do. I   ll tell you, I enjoy peace and quiet now and a few  friends that still come. They know my schedule. They know I like  Jeopardy and they may as well not call. (Laughter) In other words, I like  to see other people use their brains even though I can   t, so that   s that.  When history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  That she only emphasized the fact that she tried to be a good person,  helping others. I   ll give my last nickel almost to help someone. God has  so blessed me that I have been in a position to help kids, you know, so  that   s it. Just generally a good person is all. Fortunate to know good  people, and good parents.  And a good sense of humor.  I think so, yes.  Anything you want to add before we shut the camera off?  The camera   s been going? (Laughter)  18  Finchum  Hunter  Finchum  Hunter  Yes, ma   am.  No, nothing more.  Well, thank you. It   s been a pleasure. Thank you very much.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
