Story_ID: 303354
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Nander Brown] side.  We'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother name is Mattie, M-A-T-T-I-E, Lou, L-O-U, Brown.  Her maiden name was Lewis.
Speaker 1: Okay, L, L-E-W-I-S.
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is her place of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in 190- 1916.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was born in Eastman, Georgia.
Speaker 1: In Eastman, Georgia, okay.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side, I mean who far can you trace your mother's family?
Speaker 2: I can probably trace my mother's family back to Cecil Dunn [ph.], and that's where really my family really began.  And she [sic. Brown's maternal great-grandfather, Missouri Dunn] married an individual Augusta Reynolds and from that they became parents of Itone Touchstone who married Henry Lewis and from that union of Itone and Henry, was born my mother.
Speaker 1: Now how do you spell Itone?
Speaker 2: I-T-O-N-E.
Speaker 1: I-T-O-N-A-E [sic.] and her last name was?
Speaker 2: Lewis, no I'm sorry Itone Touchstone.
Speaker 1: Touchstone that's an interesting name?
Speaker 2: T-O-U-C-H-S-T-O-N-E.
Speaker 1: That's--is there a story behind that name, cause the whole both of it is, I mean both you know the surname and, and the?
Speaker 2: Well it, it's Touchstone that was my mother's side of family, so I don't know too much history about that.
Speaker 1: That's kind of a singular name, Touchstone you know you don't hear anybody (unclear) with a name like that?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And Itone, is there any story behind Itone?
Speaker 2: Well as we did into my family that was the first Itone and I have a sister named Itone and she has since named one of her grandchildren Itone as well.
Speaker 1: Is there any sense of where that comes from?
Speaker 2: No, only from the beginning of, of my mother apparently.
Speaker 1: Okay, there's a story there some, somewhere, we just--it may be lost, but there's a story there.  So she married--Itone Touchstone married Henry Lewis?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how far back does is this Cecil Dunn?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think.
Speaker 1: How far back does she go?
Speaker 2: I think it goes back to, as far as I can recall is probably in the early 1900s maybe in the 1890s I'm, I'm not that knowledgeable.  I'm sort of one of the members of my family who don't really know too much about my family.
Speaker 1: Okay, but we would guess if your mother was born 1916, this is like two generations back.  We're talking about probably at least 1870s or so?
Speaker 2: I would speculate, that's, that's, that's accurate.
Speaker 1: It's probably the generation right after the Civil War?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and they were as far as you know the family originated in around Eastman, Georgia?
Speaker 2: Yes, in that part of the country.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, are there any--and which generation came to the Detroit [Michigan] did your grandparents come to Detroit or--?
Speaker 2: No my mother, was, was raised when she was born they moved to Cleveland, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's and that was when she was like eleven months old.
Story_ID: 303355
Speaker 1: Yeah, so your, your grandparents moved to Cleveland [Ohio] when you mother [Mattie Lewis Brown] was eleven months old?
Speaker 2: Yes, and she was the only child born to Itone [Itone Touchstone Lewis] and Henry Lewis.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now are there any stories about Georgia, that are told or handed down in your family about what life was like in Eastman, Georgia?  And what, what is your ancestor do there?
Speaker 2: That I, I, don't know too much about my parents beyond my mother.  I haven't done that research, I have a sister you really who's into that, but I, I can't say for sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know what kind of work you grandparents did in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: Probably, they probably worked on plantation like most black people did during that era.
Speaker 1: Wha, no, no in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh I'm sorry in Cler- Cleveland.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I was gonna say, there would be a story there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah no, I don't, no I don't, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean were they professionals or were they laborers or were they?
Speaker 2: Laborers, yeah but I don't know what particular field.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Again coming up with thirteen kids we just kind of dealt with the present didn't deal too much in the, in the past.
Speaker 1: Okay so no stories from Georgia about growing up there what life was like Georgia or grandparents?  Did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I, I no by the ti- when I was born my grandparents were had already passed.  So I didn't really know my grandparents so that was another reason, why I'm sort of cloudy on, what was like back then.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did your mother talk about growing up in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: Yes she did, she was sort of handed from a family to family.  Because her parents came from a family of fourteen, so there was like fourteen sisters and brothers of, of, Touchstones.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So from what she would tell being the only child, as her mother sort of was--had some medical issues.  She was kind of like passed off from aunt to uncle.  And she was raised by one of, one of her aunts, which was a Coleen Touchstone.  And so that what a really kind of know what she used to always discuss about, in her childhood.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interested name though, Touchstone, that's first I've even encountered that name.
Speaker 2: Now what's interesting about the Touchstone name, the relatives of the Dunn family that reside in Detroit [Michigan] had the name Touchstone, the relatives who are reside in Cleveland have Tutstone, T-U-T-S-T-O-N-E
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's spell them both again?
Speaker 2: Touchstone, T-O-U-C-H-S-T-O-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, that's in Detroit?
Speaker 2: That's in Detroit, most of the gro- the family who have the Touchstone name that reside in Detroit use that spelling.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And for some reason unbeknown to me, is the relatives from Cleveland uses T-U-T-S-T-O-N-E.
Speaker 1: So Tutstone is in Cleveland, all right?  That is interest there's a story there somewhere.
Speaker 2: So, that's, that's one thing that I do know as part of a story line.
Speaker 1: Okay, Tutstone okay, alright did you mother have a chance to go to school in, in Cleveland (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes she, yes she went to high school, she did not go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, did she have any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: The only story that again is being passed from family to family you know so that was, that was the extent of it.
Story_ID: 303356
Speaker 1: Now did, did she [Brown's mother, Mattie Lewis Brown] discuss why she--how she wound up in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: I think she wound up in Detroit when she probably met my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: No, not that I know of, no, no.
Speaker 1: All right, but, but about when did they get together?
Speaker 2: They were married, almost 'cause she really remained with, with--as I indicated one of her aunts until she met and married my father.  Whose name is Nander, N-A-N-D-E-R.
Speaker 1: Nander Brown?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and when did they get married do you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: They were married forty-nine almost fifty years so probably, probably she, probably was married probably in the mid-1930s.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: She would have been sixteen or seventeen?
Speaker 2: I'm thinking exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause you know back then people got married real early.
Speaker 1: So they were married to the 1980s.
Speaker 2: Yes, until, until he passed.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: In 1984.
Story_ID: 303357
Speaker 1: Your father's full, full name is Nander Brown?
Speaker 2: Nander Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Alabama.  I don't, I don't know too much about his side of the family.  Because all our associations for the most part was done on my mother's [Mattie Lewis Brown] side of the family.  You know we used have a lot of family reunions, but it was always her side of the family.  We didn't do too much on his side of the family because his family were a lot more older than we were.  So I'm, I'm not too familiar with his family.
Speaker 1: Do, do you know his date of birth?
Speaker 2: He was probably born in 190- probably in 1904 or something along that.
Speaker 1: Okay in what part of Alabama?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I, I have no idea, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he--did he--talk about growing up in, and where he went to school or did he have a chance?
Speaker 2: I, I know what he talked about, he was really a good with mechanical things.  He was sort of like a handy man he would fix washing machines and all kinds of appliances around the house.  So I know that's one of the things that he always kind of talked about how he, he really had a love for working on things.  And he worked at a company I don't if you recall was Budd Wheel [Budd Company] at the time.  So he worked there and that's what he did as he, as he raised the thirteen of his kids.
Speaker 1: Bud was it B, B-U-D?
Speaker 2: B-U-D-D,
Speaker 1: D-D.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Budd Wheel in Detroit [Michigan], okay.
Speaker 2: And he had eighteen brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: And you don't know what part of Alabama that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Are there in relatives in Alabama now, you'd think with eighteen brothers and sister (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well all of his brothers and sister are--had, had since passed.
Speaker 1: Oh that would be great (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right 'cause he was one of the younger of the brothers and sisters.  And for the most part I'm not aware--some of them still live.  They live in Detroit, some live down south, some live in New York.  I would, have to say better much, mostly probably in Georgia, Alabama in that area.  But I'm not sure where my dad was, were he was born.
Speaker 1: Did he have any stories about growing up that he told or?
Speaker 2: He just talked about how he worked hard and he just wanted make something of his life.  I don't know beyond high school, I don't think he went to college you know.  So those were just you know some of the stories.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about moving to Detroit--when he moved to Detroit and how he-well--
Speaker 2: Well we, as I indicated I was born in Inkster [Michigan] so I, so he moved to Inkster I think when they first got married.  And we stayed in Inkster until I was born.  And then we moved to Detroit and that was in 1947.
Speaker 1: Okay, just since we mentioned Inkster, there's a story I think around Inkster and I would be good to have somebody from Inkster tell the story so.  What so how did Inkster, how was it created and how was it named, do you no the story?
Speaker 2: I think Inkster was sort of created through Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan] for its black employees to have some place to live.  So when they worked at the plant you know they would be close by.  So think that's sort of a little history of how Inkster came, came to be.
Speaker 1: Okay so, it's created for the black employee basically of Ford Motor Company (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, because back then they couldn't live in Dearborn [Michigan], which Dearborn was, essentially, Ford Motor Company.
Story_ID: 303358
Speaker 1: Talk a bit about your parents [Mattie Lewis Brown and Nander Brown] personalities, and, and who do you think you take after?
Speaker 2: Well my father always worked, I mean well obviously with thirteen kids you know, you, you can't be home.  So he, he was always work, very quiet man, but you respected him.  I mean he was from the old school, that you weren't afraid of him but you respected him.  And my mother was sort of the disciplinarian, I mean she was the person that handed out the punishment you know.  So, and she had the personality of you know go to school, make something of yourself as long as you do right then there will be no problems from her.  Whereas my father by him working all the time, it was necessary for him to come back to the house and if there was anything that we might have done that he didn't approve of, he would just state his case and we did it.  You know I was never disciplined by my father because my mother took care of all of that.  My mother never worked, she never drove, but she was five foot three and she carried a big stick.  So she kept us in, you know, she kept in line.
Speaker 1: So who do you think you take after, or what traits do think you take after?
Speaker 2: I think I take after both of them, but probably more so my father.  I think I take after him because of his sternness and his philosophy on, on hard work, being positive and accomplishing the jobs that he set out to, to accomplish.  But I still have my mother though, you know and the side of my mother is that she was always focused on how she spent her money.  And I mean she managed that money obviously when you have twelve kids and you go to the grocery store (laughter) you had to manage it.  And, and I see myself, how she saves money and that the side of the personality that I think that I really you know got from her.  And she was always happy positive even with all the kids, you know I never saw her down and out.  And so that's, that's the personality and that's side of her that I that I really project.
Story_ID: 303359
Speaker 1: So you have twelve brothers and sisters?  Well eleven I guess?
Speaker 2: Twelve.
Speaker 1: Twelve, okay, so you're, you're number thirteen?
Speaker 2: I'm thirteen, right.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you're the youngest right?
Speaker 2: No I'm fourth from the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was twelve of us and my father [Nander Brown] had a child so that the thirteenth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I'm the fourth from the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay so a lot of you, when you were growing up a lot of your brothers and sisters were much older than you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Were they, were they like additional parents?
Speaker 2: Only, only one that was one of the sisters [Angela Brown] who is my oldest, or second oldest sister.  She was the one that really thought that she was my mother.  Right and still to this day you know.
Story_ID: 303360
Speaker 1: Do you have a, an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember one day--well Christmastime, I remember Christmastime was really a challenge for us.  Being from Detroit [Michigan] they used to have what the call Old Goodfellas Day [Old Goodfellows Day].  That's where the newspaper company [Old Newsboys' Goodfellow Fund of Detroit] would get these gifts and they would pass out these boxes of presents for people who, who was needy.  And with a family of thirteen of course we were needy.  You know there were needs and so there was sometimes when we just barely, you know, had enough presents to really celebrate Christmas.  So the boys would get a box and normally would come with a shirt or a toy and box of candy.  And they girls would get a doll and a few pieces of clothing and a box of candy.  And it was always just a, just a happy sight to see that big truck roll up and drop off all these boxes.  'Cause we indeed know that would have something to celebrate Christmas for.  So I really, really remember that as, as part of my childhood.  And still to this day it's very important for me to celebrate Christmas.  And make sure there's always something under the tree.  So that's what I remember, about my childhood.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that even with your father [Nander Brown] working at Budd Wheel [Budd Company] you know which is a industrial job.  You know in those days it's still not, not you know still lacking some funds to you know to (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Exactly especially since he was the only breadwinner in the house of thirteen.  And based in a house of thirteen what he earned was to, to pay the essentials.  You know obviously to pay for the mortgage and the utilities and to have a car and of course food.  And when you got thirteen you know mouths to feed and a lot of them are young you know, you know you had a lot of young people that that ate a lot of food.  And would have a lot of energy to burn back then.  So yes it was not enough to go out and just for Christmas and shop for thirteen and that case fourteen people to provide Christmas presents for.  I mean there were times when we would just be happy to have a Christmas tree.  So you know that, that was still something that was--that, that we needed--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to supplement you know our Christmas.
Story_ID: 303361
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, can you describe now where you grew up?  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well like I said I was born in Inkster [Michigan] but when I was born, we moved to Detroit [Michigan] because our house too small.  So I literally never grew up in Inkster, I grew up in Detroit.  I grew up on the west side of Detroit, I went to Chaney High School, I'm sorry Chaney Elementary School [Henry A. Chaney Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How do you spell Chaney?
Speaker 2: C-H-A-N-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then from there I went to Condon C-O-N-D-O-N Junior High School [Detroit, Michigan].  And then eventually went to Western High School [Western International High School, Detroit, Michigan] and that's where I graduated from.
Story_ID: 303362
Speaker 1: And the sights and sounds, I always had a paper route I had a paper route at the age of twelve and I kept that paper route until I was eighteen.  And with that, that was how I really kind of grew up to develop into a responsible, sort of of a entrepreneur kind of thinking individual.  The smell is at the time you know you had the Detroit Tigers you know we used really be into the Tigers and the Lions [Detroit Lions].  The Pistons [Detroit Pistons] weren't a force then and hockey was not something that we were interes- but it was mostly the Detroit Tigers.  So I kind of grew around, grew up around the paper station.  You know where I had the guys that you would throw your papers and then you would meet back at the station.  So kind of how I grew up in Detroit [Michigan].  And by doing that I allowed me to sort of develop an independent sense of, of having my own money, you know.  Coming from a family again of thirteen, I didn't have to go to my father [Nander Brown] and say okay do, do I have any allowance money, 'cause we didn't get allowance.  So I was able to have my own money and sort of spend the way that I wanted to without having any restrictions.  So therefore that was something that I truly, truly enjoyed as growing up.  And other boys would have paper routes as well, you know we kind of had our own little club.  You know where we could buy our own bikes at the time, and buy a baseball glove, 'cause these were the things that were extra that my family just couldn't afford.  So with a paper route it allowed me to do those kinds of things.
Story_ID: 303363
Speaker 1: Now did the Tigers [Detroit Tigers] afford you like some economic opportunities having the stadium so close by I mean?
Speaker 2: It, it did it, it provided jobs for people in the neighborhood.  But I personally did not, you know, work at the stadium parking cars or selling being in the concession stand, I didn't do that.  Because I had the paper route and between the paper route and going to school you know that was all the time that I afford to and outside activity and still you know be productive in school.
Speaker 1: Now in those days, did, did the Lions [Detroit Lions] play at Tiger Stadium [Briggs Stadium; Tiger Stadium, Detroit, Michigan] too.
Speaker 2: Yes they did, the Lions did play and and at that time that's when they had the Darris McCord, Roger Brown the Fearsome Foursome, I don't know if your familiar with that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Right, right Night Train Lane [Richard Lane], Lem Barney and all those yeah, those were, those were the good old days yeah.  But I couldn't afford to go to game but we would listen on the radio.
Speaker 1: So you're right by the stadium but you couldn't afford go--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to the games.
Speaker 2: Could not afford to go, we could afford to go to the Tiger baseball games because back then you could get in bleachers, bleacher seats I think they were seventy-five cents to a dollar.  So you could you know still have access to that, that sporting event.
Speaker 1: Okay other than I think like the Tigers had Willie Horton (unclear).
Speaker 2: They had Willie Horton they had Jake Wood, Ozzie Virgil, Ozzie Virgil was their first black ball player at that time.  So yeah Ozzie Virgil, Jake Wood, Willie Horton, Gates Brown--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And then you had a guy who had a controversial past because he was recruited by Billy Martin who was a manager when he was in prison at Jackson State [Jackson State Prison; Michigan State Prison, Jackson, Michigan] and that was Ron LeFlo--Ron LeFlore, so yes I remember those days very vividly.
Story_ID: 303364
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a kid growing up?  I mean what were--you were entrepreneurial, obviously you know and taking care of business, but--
Speaker 2: Well I would describe myself as a good kid, I didn't get into trouble.  Back then there was not--even though they had gangs but it was not prevalent as it is today.  And so I kind of focused on going to school.  I went to school every day, I never missed school I was never--I used to have perfect attendance I mean that's something that I prided myself on.  Because one of the things that my mother [Mattie Lewis Brown] would say that we knew that if you didn't go to school then you would be sort of subject to, to work detail.  You would do work around the house and so we would always say, "Hey wait a minute we don't want to do work around the house" so therefore we weren't going to miss school, and I didn't miss school.  And one of the proudest things that I was very proud of is I think that back in 1967 we would, we had this huge snow storm.  I think we got over like twenty-six inches of snow in two days.  And I got up that morning to go to school and then I was going to school, it was a long way called Western High School [Western International High School, Detroit, Michigan].  And the buses weren't running, but I was determined to go school, so I could not miss any day of school.  I think it took me all that morning to get to school and when I finally got to school the school was closed.  And that's the first time they ever closed school in the Detroit [Michigan] public school system [Detroit Public Schools] during my time going to school.  But I was proud of that.
Story_ID: 303365
Speaker 1: Just going back to clarify some, some things, we talked about before earlier on the first reel that Mary Dunn not Cecil Dunne, but Mary Dunn married--
Speaker 2: Cecil Dunn.
Speaker 1: Cecil Dunn?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And Mary Dunn was born in 1806?
Speaker 2: Eighteen hundred and six [1806], correct.
Speaker 1: You guys go way back and Augusta Reynolds was your [maternal] grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And okay, and all right.
Speaker 2: And my, and my, and my da- my father's [Nander Brown] I th- I think I said was born in 1904.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And was born in Alabama.
Speaker 1: In Greensboro, Alabama G-R-E-E-N-S-B-O--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, Greensboro, --O--, right.
Speaker 1: --R-O-U-G-H [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 303366
Speaker 1: Okay, we left off, we were talking about--now I'm confused (laughter).
Speaker 2: I think you were, you were talking about my childhood.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Growing up, what else, we were talking about, we were talking about the, snow storm, right arriving at school in 1967 at Western High School [Western International High School, Detroit, Michigan] and the school was closed, but you made it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, yes, yes but I made it, right.
Speaker 1: So I mean it's an example of perseverance's I guess, and wanting to go to school.  So you liked school apparently?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Yes, well, well really--are we on?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well really I, I think that that says and I think that sort of set the pattern for me that even in today's environment I still value being on time.  And if you can't be on time even in my business--you can be the smartest individual have all the degrees--but if you can't be on time and show up for work it doesn't matter.  You can give me someone who is, who's a average student or a average work as opposed to someone being a A worker, if that A worker can't come to work and you can't rely on them.  You know it doesn't mean anything, so that's something that I value today.  If I got a meeting at eight o'clock I'm gonna be here a quarter to eight and if I'm say I'm gonna show up then I'm gonna show up.  So that's something that I learned very early in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay, now who is some of the teachers that you had in school that had an impact on you going all the way back to Chaney [Henry A. Chaney Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Probably there was a teacher by the name of Ms. Chapelle [ph.], she was like a co, she was the counselor and I was always just intrigued by her.  And she just seem so professional, and she just always taught us to be the best at what we could be and study and, and have some dreams.  So it was her in elementary and then at Condon [Condon Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan] it was a gentleman by the name of Mr. Perkins [ph.].  He was sort of like our, as the shop teacher and he was very masculine, good looking man, dress well and was stern.  And I always just kind of felt that I, I like his professionalism how he handled himself.  And I always say you know I, I, would like to be like him one day.  And then in high school there was a counselor named Mr., I think his first name was Craig.  I can't think of his last name right now.  But he was again always very positive a lot of energy upbeat and his name was Mr. Craig, that's his last name Mr. Craig.
Speaker 1: Craig?
Speaker 2: Craig, C-R-A-I-G.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I always was impressed by him.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: En- English, I really liked English, I, I always like to write.  I wasn't really that good in math, but, but I was always for some reason always excelled in writing.  And I always liked writing.  So English was one of my favorite subjects.
Speaker 1: Did, did you write any stories or anything or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Not really in school but I've written a lot of poems.  I've done a lot of poetry work, I have a dream that you know when I settled down, I wanna write a book on my life.  So, but mostly I haven't done a book, but I've done a lot of poetry writing.

Speaker 1: Now you didn't tell us earlier that your father [Nander Brown] was a minister as well had his own church (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, my father had his own church.  We sort of grew up around the church.  Religion was always in our life.  We had to go church all the time on Sunday, sometimes during the week and I didn't really like that that much.  So by having the paper route again I talked about independence and freedom.  That gave me the opportunity to not be at church because on Sunday you have to deliver the paper.  So I didn't go to church so which was, which was fine with me.  And one of the things on Sundays you know the family used always used to get together going and go out either for, for dinner or go visiting people.  And by me having my paper route I kind of always sort of like did my own thing.  And I kind of still to this day, it's like that.  I mean like church but I don't just go to church every Sunday.  And I think because my father said you had to go to church, so that's one of the things that that I just felt I was forced to do even though I didn't want to do it.
Speaker 1: Now what denomination was your father and what was the name of his church?
Speaker 2: Friendly Baptist Church [ph.].
Speaker 1: Does it still exist?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was--yeah it's Baptist.
Story_ID: 303368
Speaker 1: I guess I have to ask this question, it just popped in my head but is Thanksgiving, was Thanksgiving a big deal when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, Thanksgiving and Christmas, but Thanksgiving was a big deal.
Speaker 1: Detroit [Michigan] is, was known for the big parade and football game and all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right the J.L. Hudson Parade that, that was huge.  And, and my mother [Mattie Lewis Brown] would cook all the food and make pies.  And I mean one of things I re- you're talking about--remember as childhood experience is around Christmas and Thanksgiving my mother would just seemed like she cooked for days in preparation for this holiday.  I mean she would cook sweet potato pies and pound cakes, lemon meringue pies, upside down pineapple cakes and it was just, just a lot of food.  Obviously you know the turkey and all the trimmings that come with that and that's something that I really looked forward to.  'Cause you know that there's as going to be some real good eating during, during the holiday period.  And she would just start cooking seemed like a week in advance, to have this big meal.  So Thanksgiving without a doubt was big huge day for us.
Speaker 1: Yeah 'cause in other parts of country you always see the J.L. Hudson department store parade out of Detroit and then the football game was played later on that day.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) it seemed like everybody in Detroit was having a good time.
Speaker 2: Yes right 'cause the parade would go down Woodward Avenue and then the Lions [Detroit Lions] would play and I would always remember Lions would normally always win on Thanksgiving Day.  And during at the time they would always play the Green Bay Packers, so it was always the Lions and the Green Bay, pay-Packers.  And then as the year's progress they changed opponents but I grew up it when it was the Lions always playing the Packers on Thanksgiving Day.
Speaker 1: I think now they play Dallas [Dallas Cowboys] or somebody like that  (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 303369
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [Western High School; Western International High School, Detroit, Michigan] did you have time to be involved in high school activities and clubs and--?
Speaker 2: I did play sports I played football.  Because when I grew up I as a big kid, I mean when I say big kid, I was a big kid I played defensive tackle.
Speaker 1: Big in terms of weight?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you're, you're not, how tall are you, you're like?
Speaker 2: I'm 5'9".
Speaker 1: Five nine [5'9"].
Speaker 2: But I was, at that time I weighted close to three hundred pounds and I was a defense tackle.  Matter of fact my nickname the guys who were my paper route buddies they would call me Tank.  I mean that was my, that was my name.  And one of the things that I remember playing football, when you would have your football drills you know you would have to piggyback you know another member of the team.  And maybe run twenty or thirty yards and then you'd come back.  Well I remember I would carry the guy that I had to carry.  I just carried him down like he was nothing.  Then it was time for me to get on his back, we went down to the ground, 'cause I just weighted so much, so.
Speaker 1: You were almost three hundred pounds?
Speaker 2: I was three hundred pounds.
Speaker 1: You were three hundred?
Speaker 2: I was three hundred pounds.
Speaker 1: Now that's in high school at five nine?
Speaker 2: I was three hundred pounds.
Speaker 1: And strong I guess too or strong enough to carry somebody on your back?
Speaker 2: And, and was and a lot of people don't realize this but during that time I was a C and D student.  And then when I turned sixteen I decided I wanted to go the prom and I said I'm gonna lose weight 'cause I know a girl's not gonna want to accompany me to the prom.  So I had a paper route as I indicated earlier and during the year I think it was 1963 the Detroit News went on strike.  So therefore during the period the Detroit News went on strike, I didn't have any money to buy the food that I normally eat, had eaten.  Which most of the time was you know junk food, as we name it today.  And so we got out of school that June, from the time we go out of school and went back in September I went from like 305 to 165 pounds.  And I have kept it off since then.  That is my discipline and that's I, I, still to this day there are friends or sometime family member I hadn't seen in a while that some that don't recognize me.  And my grades went from a C and D to a B and an A.  I went from a size eleven and a half shoe, to nine and a half.  And I went from a size and for the first time in my life I could buy clothes off the rack that didn't have to be altered.  So that was probably the essential moment in my life.  When I lost it and I promised that I would never gain that weight back again.  Because anybody can lose weight, it's the art of keeping it off.  I mean we're talking today how obesity is such a prevalent thing in our society.  But that said why I am disciplined, why I'm consistent and why I'm focused on everything that I do, in business environment as well.  So but, but then in 1962, so it's been sixteen, it's almost been, almost forty years.
Speaker 1: That is difficult to do then 'cause a body gets used to being big.  And it's hard and then I think the, the--your body tries to get back to the size it was.  You know, people would say your it's hard to lose weight when you get to a certain weight 'cause the body thinks that is it's normal weight.  And it tries to get back there, but, but so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, so that was a turning point in my life.  That was really a turning point in my life.
Speaker 1: So, so that's a lot of weight to lose.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's over 150 pounds or so, or almost
Speaker 2: Yeah and sometimes I look back and I don't know how I did it.  I, I look back today and say, wow how did I do that?  And sometimes you know to maintain when I am trying to lose ten pounds (laughter) you know it's like I can't get rid of these, get rid of these ten pounds.  But, but I'm proud of the feat.
Story_ID: 303370
Speaker 1: Did you remain a football player I mean you must have been the anchor of the line (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, right back then I went from being defensive tackle to being defensive back.  Then I started playing a lot more baseball.  I always played baseball, and I played but not in high school [Western High School; Western International High School, Detroit, Michigan] and then I started playing basketball and running track and you know and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: Yeah okay so when you were growing up was Roger Brown one of your idols or something 'cause he was the biggest player, one of the biggest players in the NFL [National Football League] I think?
Speaker 2: Not so much Roger Brown it's probably Alex, Alex?
Speaker 1: Karras?
Speaker 2: Alex Karras, and I mentioned Darris McCord, Roger Brown, Joe Schmidt and all those guys, yeah.  But I just liked football at the time 'cause that was one of the sports that was, that was very popular.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Detroit [Detroit Lions] had like great defensive football team (simultaneous) at that time.
Speaker 2: Right, right they always had a great defensive football team yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so, so you started running track and doing other things.
Speaker 2: Started getting in other things very active in cycling today.
Speaker 1: Did you play basketball on the team?
Speaker 2: No I didn't, I didn't, I didn't play organized baseball I just you know just backyard, YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] type basketball, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so did you play football all through high school?
Speaker 2: I played just a couple year, just I think that year and then after, after that year I don't think I played that much you know 'cause I began to be a senior so.  But, but that was the extent of my high school career.
Speaker 1: No did you run for class office or anything like that, or did you?
Speaker 2: No, no I did not.
Speaker 1: So when you were in high school would you consider yourself like a popular kid or--?
Speaker 2: No, I, I would just say I was student just went to school did, to get his education.  And also by me having a paper route that was sort of my extra, that was sort of my extra school activities.  Because at the time a paper route took up a lot of your time and I had a big route.  And then eventually I remember another sort of highlight when I was in high school eventually I, I moved to station captain.  The station captain was a person that was responsible for passing out the papers.  You were sort of like, if will you were sort of like a manager, management.  And so I remember when I was graduating I had my cap and gown on and I'm delivering papers in it, because one of the paper boys didn't show up.  So you had to go out and do the papers but I was proud of that.  You know because you know it allowed me to have my own money, save money and prepare for school you know.
Speaker 1: Now did you get a date to, to the junior prom?
Speaker 2: Yes, not in high school, I don't think school, well when I graduated I, I didn't go.  But I did end up taking my wife [Angelina Caldwell Brown] to the prom, when she graduated a couple years later.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't reach your immediate goal, but you, you got there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right but I did go there.
Story_ID: 303371
Speaker 1: When you were a senior in high school [Western High School; Western International High School, Detroit, Michigan], what were your prospects?  What were, were you looking at going to college or getting a job or what?
Speaker 2: Well I wanted to go to college, but my mother and my folks [Mattie Lewis Brown and Nander Brown] couldn't afford to send me, we just didn't have, we didn't have the money.  So I, I remember I also tried to get in Highland Park Community College [Highland Park, Michigan] and I didn't pass the test, so I couldn't get in there.  And my mother didn't know about all the kind of funding that you may be able to find to, to pay for college.  So at the time the Vietnam War was being to go full-blown.  So I joined the [U.S.] Air Force, so I figured if I go to the Air Force then I would be able to take advantage of the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].  (Cough) Excuse me take advantage of the G.I. Bill and then I would be able to pay for my school when I got out.  And that's what I end up doing.  So I went to the Air Force in 1965 and I got out in 1969.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1965 now where were you stationed in the Air Force?
Speaker 2: I went to--did my basic training in Lackland Air Force Base [Bexar County, Texas] which is in Texas.  And then from there I went to Hamilton Air Force Base [Hamilton Army Airfield] which is in California.  And then from there I went to Thailand, a base called Nakhon Phanom [Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Navy Base].
Speaker 1: Now how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: I think that's N-A-K-O-N, Phonon, P-H-O-N-O-N [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's near the Laos border and I stayed there for a year.
Speaker 1: And that's during the Vietnam War?
Speaker 2: Yes, definitely during the Vietnam War.
Speaker 1: So the U.S. was flying out of Thailand (unclear)?
Speaker 2: They were flying out of Laos.
Speaker 1: Laos?
Speaker 2: And we were support operation in Thailand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I ended up back at Selfridge Air Force Base [Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Harrison Charter Township, Michigan] and that's where I was discharged from.
Story_ID: 303372
Speaker 1: You obtained the rank of sergeant in the [U.S.] Air Force--
Speaker 2: Yes I did.
Speaker 1: --that was--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you--did you have a specific job that you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I was, I was a in administrative and I worked in the Air Police Command.
Speaker 1: Air Police.
Speaker 2: So I was in the administrative department.
Speaker 1: Okay was that like the MPs [military police] in the [U.S.] military?
Speaker 2: No, yeah that's, that's yes it was like the MPs right.
Speaker 1: Okay all right do you have any stories from the service that (unclear) are interesting?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh yeah.  Probably my biggest story was--and has have impact on my life today.  Is you know in the military you drink a lot I mean it is not much to do.  And then plus liquor was very inexpensive you go to the PX [post exchange].  So I remember one day we all drinking at the club the airman's club.  And we had all these drinks on the table at the time I was drinking screwdrivers.  And there were so many drinks on the table and we're all drinking and I just couldn't drink anymore.  So I ended being up under the table and at the time the used to call me, I can't what did they used to call me? It will come to me, but they used to call me maybe Downtown Brown or something like that, and "Come on you can drink some more," so I'm trying to drink this liquor and I just I passed out.  And I remember I was out for like two days.  But I got up that morning and I said I'm gonna have some breakfast anyway. Bad mistake.  So I ended up just got sicker than you can ever image.  Went back to bed I remember my chief master sergeant says he said that I was drunk and I said, "No I'm not drunk I'm sick" and he wanted to discharge from the Air Force.  And from that day forward I've never drinking hard liquor.  The more I didn't like the way it made me feel and plus I just felt that I was not in control of all my faculties.  That you got you know just drunk that, that you just passed out.  And so from that experience that, that taught me that you know never again would I even not be in control of myself.  So that was my lesson that I learned when I was in the Air Force.  But other than that, that was sort of the negative side but we used to party and have fun.  And you know people would send the Jets over and the Ebony magazines.  And my mother [Mattie Lewis Brown] would send cakes packed in popcorn and all the guys would gather around not only eat the cake but they would eat the popcorn too.  So, so I had a good time in the service.  It, it's really gave me some direction what I wanted to do when I got out.
Speaker 1: She packed the cakes in popcorn I trying to image this now.
Speaker 2: That kept it fresh, that kept it fresh.
Speaker 1: Really so the, the cake would go in a box and she put popcorn around it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that kept it fresh, kept it fresh. Now the popcorn was stale but when your overseas (laughter) you know you know you eat anything yep.
Speaker 1: All right, okay any other stories from the service?
Speaker 2: The others, the other really story one when, when I got out of, I had eighteen months left when I was leaving Thailand.  And I was going to be assigned to Germany.  But Germany was a three year assignment and I didn't want to reenlist.  So they told me to go home, you know which I was coming back, told me just stay home and they would reissue me new orders.  Well they forgot about me, so I ended up calling in I said I think it was like after like thirty-five days I'm at home.  I said, "Where's my orders" and they forgot that I was at home.  So they said, "Were you want go" and I could have named any place I could have went to Andrews Air Force Base [Joint Base Andrews] which was outside of Washington, D.C., which was a good assignment.  So I choose to just finish it up at Selfridge Air Force Base [Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Harrison Charter Township, Michigan], which is outside of Detroit [Michigan] which is Mount Clemons, Michigan.  And I stayed there and then eventually got out nine months early out when they recognized that I was not gonna reenlist.  So that, that was kind of funny you know that here I'm home on leave and, and I didn't want them to think that I was AWOL [Absent Without Official Leave] so I took the initiative and called and said, "Hey you know I, I don't have any orders," so.
Speaker 1: Perhaps if you had not called it would have?
Speaker 2: I could've been AWOL, if they'd discovered it yeah, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay or maybe you just you know would, would they have blamed you if you'd--?
Speaker 2: I don't know but I didn't want to take that chance.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 303373
Speaker 1: So you get out of the [U.S.] Air Force in 19--?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969], now when you were in the Air Force were you aware of the, you know the protest against the Vietnam War?
Speaker 2: Oh yes matter of fact one of the saddest days of my life a couple of really significant occurred during when I was in.  Number one, there was when Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated and I kind of felt that here I am protecting this country and they killed one of our great leaders.
Speaker 1: Can you remember where you were, when, when?
Speaker 2: I was, I was in Thailand, I was in Thailand matter fact I was out of the country.  And it's was just a very eerie feeling among the African American soldiers at the time.  And, and plus they were rioting back in Detroit [Michigan] as you know Detroit had a bad riot--Watts [Los Angeles, California].  So it was like wow their tearing down our city were supposed to be protecting this country and yet our homes are, are going up in smoke.  So, I, I felt real low maybe really that proud to be representing America where we were not getting our just due back home.  So that was a significant event.  The other significant event not so devastating as, as that was in 1968.  As you know Detroit Tigers won the World Series and all the years that I was a staunch Tiger fan I couldn't be there to participate in that celebration.  So that were sort of of two highlighted events that kind of stood out while I was in there, I was in the service.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so, now how did the--how did the white servicemen react to Dr. King's death?
Speaker 2: It was nothing out of the ordinary, I, I, think they kind of everybody was calm.  I mean there was no friction among the troops.  It was I think they were sensitive to what was going on and they kind of understood what we were feeling.  So there was no incidents.
Story_ID: 303374
Speaker 1: So when you, you came back you went right back to Detroit [Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I came back to Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay and is, is this when you enrolled in Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] at--?
Speaker 2: Yes I did, well I did, I didn't enroll in Wayne State.  One of the things I had talked about that the thing that I kind of had a when I was in school I was always good with mult- with essay type questions and I had a difficult time with multiple choice type questions.  Because one phrase or one word would change the answer even though all four answer could possibility be correct.  So I had a hard time taking the exams and even when I went in the [U.S.] Air Force the first time I took the exam I didn't pass.  And then so I took it the second time and I passed.  And the first time I went to college so in 1969, Wayne County Community College [Wayne County Community College District, Detroit, Michigan] was formed.  And all you had to be was a high school graduate and over the age of eighteen.  And I said here's that door that I had been waiting to open, to prove that I was--could do college material.  So I went to Wayne County and enrolled and I went there for a year.  And after a year then you were able to transfer to a four year institution which I transferred to Wayne State University.
Speaker 1: Okay And so, and I was doing all this while I was working at Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan].
Speaker 2: So you working on Ford, now what kind of of job did you have a Ford.
Speaker 1: Right, well 1969, I when I first got out of the Air Force I was working at a bank.  I think at the time it, it, the--I think it was Manufacturers Bank [Detroit, Michigan].  And I was told that Ford was taking applications.  And it was applying for some type of typing job.  And for some reason I was always a fast typist so I could type like a hundred words a minute.  So I took that, took an application, filled out that application.  Took the test and I passed and they hired me as a part time employee to work at world headquarters in Dearborn [Michigan].  Basically in the computer division sort of stuffing envelopes and decollating enve- jobs and that's how I started my career in automotive business.
Speaker 2: So they didn't employ you to type you know that was the impressive (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yes so, so that's how I and, and that allowed me to go to school during the day.  And I was able to make enough money to pay for my education and then also I was taking advantage of the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].  So that's how I went to school so in 1971 I graduated from Wayne State with a, with a degree.
Story_ID: 303375
Speaker 1: Nineteen-seventy [1970], you went to Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan], right? You started attending Wayne State now did you have a career goal in mind when you started going to college?
Speaker 2: Yes I was a journalist major, majored in journalism, radio and TV.
Speaker 1: All right now that's, were you said you were always interested in English?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Did you have like a, a role model as a journalist that you wanted, that you were looking at then?
Speaker 2: No, because back then there weren't any for us.  There was very few African Americans that was anchors on TV but that just, I just felt that maybe the opportunity would be forth coming.
Speaker 1: No did you have any local TV anchors in Detroit [Michigan] in those days, black ones?
Speaker 2: Not, not that I can recall, very, I just can't recall any back then.  But I always had an interest in you know the writing aspect was more of what I was looking at as opposed to you know being on TV or radio.
Speaker 1: Did you know of any black journalist at all (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes there was, well the, the predominant paper was the Michigan Chronicle, which is a black weekly.
Speaker 1: That's the local Detroit black newspaper?
Speaker 2: And that was the publisher was a Mr. Quinn [Longworth Quinn], so he was the publisher of that newspaper.  So I was kind of of intrigued by some of the reporters that they had there.  But I didn't know any that just stood out.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you have anybody that, did you have anybody in the journalist world that you could get advice from and so on?
Speaker 2: Only just when I applied to Wayne State.  You know just said that that could be a interesting field to get into.  But also I kind of got a little negativism from them because they kind of of felt that I could have been wasting my time because there was no African Americans at that time that was, that was visible on TV or was in radio.  But I just kind of discounted that and just focused on what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Were there any black columnist for the free press, press of the Detroit News, in those days?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah I think Max Robinson started at ABC maybe '72 [1972], '73 [1973] I think [sic.], I'm thinking (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and that one and he was probably the most recognizable African American that was in television at that time.
Speaker 1: Without a doubt, I think that  [HistoryMaker] Chuck Stone and [HistoryMaker] William Raspberry were writing columns for some you know papers that were outside of you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean you had some local people that were writing newspaper, but they weren't in TV.
Story_ID: 303376
Speaker 1: So how did it go, I mean you were in journalism, you're not a journalist now, so what happened along the way?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I did do some radio at the Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] radio station and I also worked a while at the, at the Michigan Chronicle, so.
Speaker 1: Now did you do news on the radio?
Speaker 2: I did news, right and I think it was WDET [WDET Radio, Detroit, Michigan], I think whatever Wayne's local stations call letters were.  And I did, did some news reporting for the Michigan Chronicle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And along the way as, as I indicated as I was going to school I was also working at Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan].  And some opportunity prevailed for me there.  And so that's sort of how I got involved in automobile business.  And kind of shied away from the journalism piece of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was the, is it--what happened first did you, did you decide to go into business first or did the opportunities present themselves at Ford first?
Speaker 2: Well it simultaneously I was working at Ford while I was going to school, I was part-time.  And so I got married [to Angelina Caldwell] 1971 and they had kept asking me did I want to go full time when positions became available.  And I kept saying no but and then we I got married in '71 [1971] I said I gotta get something a little more stable.  And at that time that's when I decided to go full-time and be a full-time employee with Ford Motor Company.  And I was hired by the Dealer Computer Services Division, which at the time they sold computer systems to Ford-Lincoln-Mercury dealers throughout the United States.  So I was sort of like worked in the administrative office analyzing data that would come over the--this system.  So that I was a system analyst at the time, computer I analyzed data.  So I stayed in that position with Ford until 1979.
Speaker 1: Now you were systems analyst for?
Speaker 2: Basically for dealer computer services, I, I analyzed data that came from the computer system that was that were in the Ford-Lincoln-Mercury dealerships.  It was not like a typical system analyst that you would recognize a system analyst.  But that was sort, sort of what I did, and I stayed with them 'til '79 [1979].
Story_ID: 303377
Speaker 1: Okay and what happened in '79 [1979]?
Speaker 2: In '79 [1979] I got a promotion, I was given a job as Chicago [Illinois] south market manager and that's when we relocated here in 1979.  And so that's how I got my connection to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And basically for the next five years I called on Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealers south of Chicago.  I went as far south as Indianapolis [Indiana] had dealers east to Benton Harbor [Michigan] and then I would also cover dealership in the area above the Kankakee [Illinois] area.  And basically what I did I would sell and service the computer systems in these Ford-Lincoln-Mercury dealerships.  And they would have their account parts and payroll systems and I was like their computer consultant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I did that for five years, normally what I would do I would wake up on Monday morning go on the road come back Friday, so I sort of lived in a hotel.  Most of it was driving you know my territory.  I was my own boss, didn't see my boss, my checks were sent to me.  And so it was almost like being my own, you know like having my own company.  And that's how because one of the dreams I had growing up, I always wanted to be a manager and I always wanted to own my own business.  I didn't know what I wanted to manage and I didn't know what kind of business but I knew I wanted to obtain both of those goals.  And how I found out about the car business as I was in this job one day at the Ford general office in Indianapolis I went in the office and the guy said Ford has a dealership training program [Ford Minority Dealer Training Program].  You should apply.  And so I did and there was twenty-five applicants but there was only ten position.  And so I had to go through a series of interviews, regionally here in Chicago.  Then we had to have a meeting with the finalist candidates, had to interview in Detroit [Michigan].  And I was one of the ten finalists.  And at that particular time if I was selected to the program, which was for eighteen months.  I would have to quit my job at Ford with no promise that I would get a dealership.  And I had to have a minimum investment of fifty thousand dollars.  So in January of 1983, I resigned from Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan] and I was started the dealership training program which was for eighteen months.
Speaker 1: And now this was, was your wife [Angelina Caldwell Brown] working at the time?
Speaker 2: Yes my wife at the time was working she was a, was working for J.L. Hudson [The J.L. Hudson Company, Detroit, Michigan] and when we moved here she was working for Carson Pirie Scott [Carson's, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] she was a buyer.  So she was working during, during the period when I was going through the training program.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was still kind of risky, did you have children at that time?
Speaker 2: No, no we didn't children, we don't have children today, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you have to, was it hard to come up with fifty thousand dollars?
Speaker 2: Well one of the things that we always did, when we got married, when we both worked we always would focus on only living off of what I made, and save what my wife made.  As so that's how we able to accumulate the, the investment to go into the dealership program.  And then also I always felt that you should own something, you should own land.  And so my mother [Mattie Lewis Brown] had a three family flat that we all kind of lived in.  But she moved and none of my other brothers and sisters wanted this property.  And when I got out of the [U.S.] Air Force I wanted it so I bought it re- you know kind of refurbished it, rented it out.  And when I went into the dealership--my first dealership I needed sixty-five thousand dollars well I only had fifty so I was fifteen thousand dollars short.  So I sold that property and that gave me the rest of the money for my investment and I had like seven thousand dollars left you know so that's kind of how, how we did it.  And then we moved to Ottawa [Illinois], so that's kind of how we got to Ottawa.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is really a story of like you know managing your money in a way that will help you in the future, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, so that's how we did it, that's how we got the investment and that's how I got in the program.
Story_ID: 303378
Speaker 1: Was there in any interest on the part of Ford [Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan] in bringing black dealers into the Ford (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, at that time, that's, that's why the training program it was called the Ford Minority Dealer Training Program.  So yes there were (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay so they were all minority?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right okay I lost that part of it.  Now was this was this, this the same program the Mel Farr [HistoryMaker Mel Farr, Sr.] went through?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you all go through at the same time?
Speaker 2: No, Mel was before me, Mel was sort of like a mentor to me, yeah because he had been through that, so.  So we kind of looked up to Mel you know, 'cause he was very successful, plus being, plus being a football player, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah Detroit Lions we, we interviewed him in Detroit [Michigan] at one time he owned what fifteen dealerships (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yeah, Mel was a role model for all of us.
Speaker 1: Okay, so well how was it, was had the training been refined to the point where you really I mean what was it like for you?
Speaker 2: I, I thought I was very good I mean I learned a lot and, and I think the difference would, would help me more probably than some of the other candidates, would I had worked for Ford.  So I knew the inner workings of the company.  And I knew some of the people that I could pick up the phone and call if I had some concerns.  So that was a huge advantage.  And plus by understand the Ford financial statement, it also helped me with I got my first dealership as well.  'Cause I was familiar with how, how they operated I was familiar with their accounting systems and their parts system, so that was a huge advantage.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I sounds like it would be you know that now.  So when did you start your first dealership?
Speaker 2: October 7th, 1985.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Matter a fact as we sit today in a couple months I'll be celebrating my twentieth year anniversary, which will be October 7th, 2005.
Story_ID: 303379
Speaker 1: Now had you completed your master's degree by, by this time?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes, I completed my master's degree in 1973.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went to Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] you went directly from Wayne State to Central Michigan [Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Central Michigan University, that is correct.
Speaker 1: All right and focused on business?
Speaker 2: Business management, management and super, supervision.
Speaker 1: So you were prepared pretty much prepared (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Now did you continue to write any you know (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I, I would dabble once I sort of established my footprints in the automotive business, I, I kind of focused on that.
Story_ID: 303380
Speaker 1: What was the name of your dealership in 1985?
Speaker 2: Ottawa-Ford-Lincoln-Mercury Inc. or Ottawa Fo- yeah, so it would be O-T-T-A-W-A, Ford, L.M., Inc. [Ottawa Ford L.M., Inc., Ottawa, Illinois], that was the, my registered name of the company.
Speaker 1: Okay and how was Ottawa [Illinois] chosen, and I ask it because you know black people you just wouldn't guess that be that many black folks in Ottawa or, or did it matter I mean you know (unclear)?
Speaker 2: That, that's a good question I mean I didn't just choose Ottawa because I wanted to go to Ottawa.  Number one I knew I had limited funds and also I also recognized very early that I did not have the experience to go into a major metro market.  I just didn't have that experience.  But I looked at a lot of dealerships I mean looked at Maumee, Ohio, I looked at Monmouth, Illinois.  And I felt that if I looked at all these different op, opportunities I think I looked at six different dealerships before I finally selected Ottawa.  That when I did get close to a dealership that I was going to invest in I would know the, the positive and the negative of that dealership operation.  So that's where I always looked.  I almost ended up in a dealership in New Orleans [Louisiana] was going to be a Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC, Auburn Hills, Michigan] dealership.  The day, two days before I was going to go, there was a storm.  They had one of the you know those storms that they have almost every (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hurricanes.
Speaker 2: The hurricanes and Chrysler division told me not to come that day, the next day because they were preparing for the storm.  In the interim I got a call from Chicago [Illinois] region of Ford [Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan], saying that there's an opportunity in Ottawa, Illinois.  It looks like a good opportunity and the first thing that I said was "Ottawa," you know, I'm thinking Ottawa, Canada.  And so they told me the statistical information about it as much as they could.  And I told Angie [Angelina Caldwell Brown] about it.  And so but the dealer or the owner didn't want his employees to know that he was selling the business.  So we couldn't just go there, so what we did we sort of did class nine operation we went up there on the weekend when the place was closed.  We walk around the lot peaked in the building, drove around the town.  And I remember Angie as she's, who's my wife, sitting next to me, she's not that enthused and she saying how this is not a good part of town.  I said if there's bad part of town there's got to be a good part of town you know I said to, you know there's always, that's just the way it always is.  And so eventually I did my homework, did my due diligence and we decided to invest in the Ottawa dealership.  And at the time Ottawa had less that than half percent minority population period.
Speaker 1: And it's all different kinds of minorities.
Speaker 2: Right, that, that includes everybody, cats, dogs everybody, period.  And so that was sort of a challenge going into Ottawa when I went into Ottawa all my managers quit.  Because they have never worked for an African American.  The pop, the townspeople thought I got my money from selling drugs, that I was that I was an athlete that I was fronting for Ford, and I wouldn't last for two years.  But that's how I leaned the business.  When all my managers quit I was forced to bring Angie in the business and it was just me and her.  And that's where I learned the business 'cause I was determined that if I only sold five cars a month I was going to make money.  And I had to let them know this was my business and this is the way it's gonna be.  And twenty years later here I am today.
Speaker 1: So all of the white managers quit?
Speaker 2: All my white managers quit, yes.
Speaker 1: They didn't see any prospect, I mean, you know to quit a job's a big deal (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know.
Speaker 1: And they would.
Speaker 2: So therefore I was never able focus on marketing the business and concentrated on sales, because I had to focus on just trying to staff.  So I remember my parts manager quit and I ended up closing the parts manager.  And I have to go out and buy a parts shirt and I said I don't want the computer system to get messed up so I delivered parts.  But what that showed those people there that I was not going to be deterred by any negative activity that, that they brought to the table.  And I was going to continue forward and I did.
Speaker 1: So I mean who did you, where did the additional managers come from did they did, did they--?
Speaker 2: I just had some people I hired that was second you know in line in their department.  And then some people I just had to put out a ad and just hire new people, and that's what I did.
Story_ID: 303381
Speaker 1: Now did you end up with an integrated group or--?
Speaker 2: Even still to this day probably over the twenty year period, I probably maybe only have had two or three minority employees besides my wife [Angelina Caldwell Brown] and myself.
Speaker 1: And out of a staff of how many?
Speaker 2: About thirty-five, about a staff of thirty-five, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of people, (unclear) people.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so the area around Ottawa [Illinois] can sustain a decent size dealership apparently right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Do the people who live in, where do they live when they come to Ottawa to buy a car?
Speaker 2: Surrounding areas, I as responsible Ottawa is in LaSalle County [Illinois] and LaSalle County includes Marseilles [Illinois].  Includes Marseilles you also have that's the biggest area, Ottawa you know is in LaSalle that was my biggest sales territory.  Marseilles, Seneca [Illinois], Wedron [Illinois] and a couple of small towns around that area and then we also got people from LaSalle-Peru [Illinois] area and we would get people from maybe Morris [Illinois] not many.  But the, but the bulk of my customer base came from Ottawa and the Marseilles-Seneca area.  And Ottawa is a population of about little under nineteen thousand people.  And LaSalle is a population base of about a hundred thousand people, so that's where we got most of our business from.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that's a part of Illinois that you know I don't know if people in Chicago [Illinois] know a lot about.
Speaker 2: And, and it's famous for again I talk to my staff Starved Rock Park [Starved Rock State Park] also they used to have a--they used to do, they used to have watch factory there where they would do the dials they would paint the dials on the watches.  And at one point in time it was very toxic stuff so they had to like dig up a lot the, how they would dispose of you know the waste from that.  And I think a lot of people kind of of came up with some cancer or things of that nature.  So that's one of the significance about Ottawa and, and also it's a county seat.  And also its and it's also one of the places where they had the famous the Lincoln-Douglas [President Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas] debate as well.  So, so that's, the history of Ottawa.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Starved Rock has a history I don't (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Starved Rock has a history as well.  Starved Rock is probably about it's in Utica, Illinois [sic.], which is probably about eight or nine miles from Ottawa.  But normally when I say Ottawa, to people that's from Chicago they don't identify with Ottawa, but they've heard of Starved Rock Park.  So that's the connection.
Story_ID: 303382
Speaker 1: Now you, you own three dealerships right (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I, I did at one point in time, after, after Ottawa [Ottawa Ford L.M., Inc., Ottawa, Illinois], 1990 around 1991, late '90 [1990], I bought Landmark Ford which is in Niles, Illinois.  Kept that for ten years, sold that in 2000, I think the year 2000 or 2001.  And then in 1999 I had Star Toyota which in Merrillville, Indiana.  And I kept that for about four, four years and I sold that in 2003.  So right now I'm, I just have the one dealership and I also since then which was in 1999, I added the Kia [Kia Motor Corporation] franchise to it.  So right now I have Ford [Ford Motor Company], Lincoln-Mercury and Kia.  And I'm hopefully looking at some other different franchises that I hope to add probably within the next maybe year or two.
Story_ID: 303383
Speaker 1: What's been the toughest part of doing this?
Speaker 2: Relying on people, it's difficult to get experienced people who are loyal to you.  Because in our business and especially in a smaller town you're always are enticed by the larger dealerships in a metro environment.  That can afford to pay more than you can afford to pay.  That's probably been the biggest challenge, it's when you have the turnover in people.  'Cause when you have the turnover in people especially in your management position it just makes it that much more stressful for you.  Because you gotta start all over again and it can be a key person in your operation.  But other than that it's, it's been a very challenging, enjoyable, exciting business to be in.  I, I really love the business.
Speaker 1: Now what's the most exciting thing about it?
Speaker 2: There's certain challenges that you will face every day.  Is not like having a nine to five job where you know you do one thing and it's repetitive.  I mean you deal with marketing issues, you deal with advertising.  You deal with negotiating union contracts, you deal with negotiating healthcare plans.  And your part of hiring people, you deal with consultants.  You deal with the manufacturer in ordering the product, how you get the product.  You deal with coming up with your own computer system.  You deal with enhancing and redoing your dealership facility.  So you're dealing with your city, your involved in politics.  So all of those things that you get a chance to do, you don't become bored.  And then also the most exciting thing while you're in it you get a chance to make a lot of money.  You get a chance to travel.  So and, and you get a chance to really be a community role model, give back to the community, provide jobs for people.  And also provide college scholarships.  So you really are involved in a lot of things that really makes this, this world what we live in tick.  And you're, you're part of it you're a part of it, that's, that's what I think that's exciting about it.  And most importantly it's a family business, it's a family business.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you're part of the, I think you were president at one time of the national the, the--?
Speaker 2: Well it was Ford-Lincoln-Mercury Dealers Association [Ford Motor Minority Dealers Association], yeah I was its, its chairman, president for two years and chairman for a year.  Which, which that organization is the Ford-Lincoln-Mercury Minority Dealers Association and I served on that board for seven years.  And I'm for have been associated with that board.  Because it thinks it's, it's our history.  You had mentioned Mel Farr [HistoryMaker Mel Farr, Sr.] earlier, Mel was one of the founders of the association.  He's currently a emeritus member today, and he was its president.  So I'm just very fortunate to follow his footsteps and been able to have made a contribution.  To keep going what was started to, to support the African American dealers of Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan].
Story_ID: 302959
Speaker 1: Tell us about NAMAD [National Association of Minority Auto Dealers] first of all?
Speaker 2: Well NAMAD was a group that was formed by the three minority dealer associations. Ford-Lincoln-Mercury [Ford-Lincoln-Mercury Dealers Association; Ford Motor Minority Dealers Association], Chrysler [Chrysler Minority Dealers Association, Inc.] and General Motors [General Motors Minority Dealers Association] minority dealers.  It was formed so we could have representation as a broad base.  As opposed to an individual issue that may impact that particular manufacturer.  So it was formed matter of fact we just had our twenty-fifth anniversary this past year in Baltimore, Maryland.  And again Mel Farr [HistoryMaker Mel Farr, Sr.] and guys like [HistoryMaker] Nathan Conyers and William Shack [William E. Shack, Jr.] were founders of that organization as well.  And also an individual by the name of Jesse Jones [Jesse J. Jones], he was a Chrysler dealer, Dodge dealer outside of Detroit [Michigan].  Nathan Conyers and William Shack are also emeritus members along with Mel Farr that serves on the Ford-Lincoln-Mercury Dealers Association.  And I was its chairman and president sometime during the early--previous chairman and president--it was, it was during the, during the '90s [1990s].  And during that time we did not have any representation on the NADA [National Automobile Dealers Association] board.  And I think we had a series of meetings with NADA, said you know we have no minority representation on the national board and the national board is NADA. So after having a series of meetings with their, with, with their management team, they changed their by-laws.  And they came up with four positions and those four positions were at large director seats.  There will be two minorities and two females.  And you would have a minority director that would be responsible for all the minority dealers east of the Mississippi and all the minority dealers west of Mississippi.  So at the time we had to have an election to see who would be those directors.  And I was one of three dealers that showed interest in becoming a director.  And ultimately I was elected and I'm serving my third three-year term as we sit today.
Story_ID: 302960
Speaker 1: Are there any other like mentors in your, in your story that, that haven't been mentioned in the auto industry?
Speaker 2: Yes, there's a couple of mentors as I indicated I always looked up to Mel Farr [HistoryMaker Mel Farr, Sr.], you know, you know Bill Shack [William E. Shack Jr.], [HistoryMaker] Nathan Conyers, I mean those guys they were the pioneers.  Also as you know you know Ed Davis [Edward Davis] was a pioneer.  Yeah, I think he was the first African American to have, to, to own a car dealership.  And it happened to be in my in my hometown of Detroit [Michigan].  It was called Ed Davis Chrysler [Ed Davis Chrysler-Plymouth] and I think it was located on Dexter [Avenue] and Elmhurst [Street].  So, so he was always he was a role model.  Also from the automobile side, you know there were people that I was particularly fond, of that I had worked with while with Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan].  And they had given me you know words of wisdom you know, things to sort of chart my career and things that I wanted to do.  And there was people along the way that I, that you know, that I looked up to.  But outside of that you know I didn't mention but, but being from a family of thirteen, my two oldest, brothers, my three oldest brothers were really role models to me as well.  My oldest brother Nander [Nander Brown, Jr.], he made a career out of the [U.S.] military, so he traveled extensively aboard.  And my second oldest brother Charles [Charles Brown] who was a CPA [certified public accountant], and my other brother Henry [Henry Brown] who, who was sort of into acting.  And I always said that if they could do it I could do it, you know.  And I didn't feel that they were the best students in school but they, they persis- persisted in what they wanted to do.  And so that was my role model, that if they could do it then certainly I had the capability of doing it as well.  And, and that was one of my goals and one of the things that I kind of held on to as I was pursuing what I wanted to do in my life.
Story_ID: 302961
Speaker 1: What are the prospects for young people that want to--young black people especially--who want to own a car dealership today?  Are they better or they worse than when you started?
Speaker 2: Well it, it's kind of of, it's kind of of a yes and no.  Yes it's better, but no in a way because from a financial standpoint.  It cost more money to invest today, (cough) excuse me.  Just like in buying a house, you know what's, what's going on in the real-estate market today.  It costs more for a newlywed couple to have home ownership as it did when I was buying a house almost thirty-something years ago.  And that's the same thing that applies in the automobile business, for a young African American that wants to obtain ownership.  But I think it's better today that he can go into a dealership, work in a management position, some sales management position, get the experience.  And then raise his hand for the opportunity to go into one of the automotive career schools.  Like Norwood Institute [ph.] out of out of Detroit [Michigan], the NADA Academy, the Ford [Ford Motor Company], the Chrysler [Chrysler LLC; FCA US LLC], the General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] dealers minority program.  It is open for that today more so than it was twenty years ago.  And if he can be able to have some mentors, come up with some financial partners then I think he can be able to, he or she can be able to, to invest in a dealership today.
Story_ID: 302962
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns about today's African American community?
Speaker 2: There seem to be--I think as I was waiting this morning to partake this interview--there's segments of the, the city [Detroit, Michigan] that feels that they're being taxed out.  And what they mean by that is, all these very expensive homes are being built in their neighborhood, which increases their overall property tax base for these people.  And I vividly recall this one lady who had said this home had been in her family for thirty-one years.  And she indicated that she don't know for how long because she can't afford the tax.  So when that happens then there's the potential of losing that home because you can't afford the tax.  So therefore once you lose the home where you going to be able to afford another house?  Just around here outside of The HistoryMakers office here, homes are going up 250, $500,000, a million and more which a lot of African Americans, to be quite frankly and other minorities just cannot afford.  That's the big concern that I have.  It's like they're being pushed out of the city.  Pushed out into areas that are not maybe or is not the environment where they would really want to raise a family.  I have big concerns about that.  And it's not just happening in, in Chicago [Illinois].  It's happening throughout the entire United States.
Speaker 1: Okay, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Particularly for senior citizens as well.
Story_ID: 302963
Speaker 1: When you look at back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: One of the things that I think I would do different, I would really focus in the school system, to get a very good education.  Because competition is becoming very, very competitive, not just within the country but throughout the entire world.  And so we have to be the best to be able to compete, so that we can at least have a place.  That we can be a, an applicant for a career in this city and in this country.  I would also focus on having a skill, a skill whether it's in computers, having a trade whether you can be a electrician, or a plumber or a millwright.  But have something that you know you will always be in command of, of someone buying or paying for your services.  I think that is significant and also you gotta have discipline.  You gotta have discipline that you're gonna accomplish the goals and dreams that you set out.  I see too many young African American and minority kids today who don't have hope.  They don't have hope that the opportunity for them, do not prevail like it does for kids from outside of their community.  I think that their school system have to change that mindset.  They have to change the mindset that you can become a manager you can own your company you can have homeownership. And you can you all the things that everybody else can have, but it's gonna that hard work.  You can't give up, take no out of your vocabulary and just focus on achieving that goal.  And the school systems have to be able to set the examples and today many school systems I think have fallen, it's fallen some of our kids.
Story_ID: 302964
Speaker 1: When you look back over the years, and you still young by the standards that we have here (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: We interview a lot of much older people but what would you consider at this juncture in your, in your life could be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy that I want to leave is to say that [HistoryMaker] Larry Brown you know came from a large family.  They weren't wealthy by no means.  But he set about some goals, and some, and had some dreams that he was going to accomplish even though he ran into barriers.  One of the things that I always try to say is take away the nos.  If you tell me that I can't get this position because I don't have experience, I go out to get the experience.  Where you can say take away that no.  I don't have the money. I go out and get the money, so you don't say, "You don't have the money."  "Well you don't have the education," I go out and get the education, so you can't say that "You don't have that education."  "Well you need a partner."  I go get a partner, so you can't say, "You don't have the experience."  So I think the most significant thing, is to be able to take the barriers away that we all face every day in life.  Every day you're gonna face a barrier, but it's how we look at that barrier so we can get around that barrier, that's significant.  Also I want to be able to leave my legacy that Larry gave back to the community.  He tried to instill within all the people that he touched, that with hard work and working together as a family, working together with his wife [Angelina Caldwell Brown] that you can still accomplish the things the things that you want to accomplish.  And I'm doing that by having foundations set up.  It's what they call the Charitable Foundation which is through NADA [National Automobile Dealers Association].  Which means that every three years, every three years in perpetuity forever there will be a contribution made in my name and in my wife's name.  And I'm also leaving these a foundations in my mother-in-law's name, my mother [Mattie Lewis Brown] and my father [Nander Brown] name and all they names of my businesses.  And I'm working them with several of the schools in this area and, and with some of the other schools that I have attended.
Story_ID: 302965
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your family?
Speaker 2: Well I met my beautiful wife, Angelina Delores Brown [Angelina Caldwell Brown], probably when I moved into our neighborhood back on Webb Street [Detroit, Michigan].  Back in probably around 1962, she was a young lady that I spoke about earlier that I took her to the prom.  We got married in 1971, matter fact August 28th, of this year will be our thirty-fifth anniversary.  Angie works with me in the business, she is my con, comptroller.  She is a graduate of Ford's [Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan] secretary treasury program [Treasury Leadership Program].  She is a graduate of their Dealership Training Program [Ford Minority Dealer Training Program].  And she just recently graduated from the NADA [National Automobile Dealers Association] Dealer Academy.  So she I quite experienced, skill and knowledgeable of the automotive business.  She's a graduate of Elmhurst College [Elmhurst, Illinois] here in Illinois and.
Speaker 1: Elmhurst?
Speaker 2: Elmhurst, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah right okay.
Speaker 2: And as I indicated she was a buyer for Carson Pirie Scott [Carson's, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and when we moved out to Ottawa [Illinois] she left the retail business and she joined me in the automotive business in 1985.  I indicated that I come from a large family, thirteen. I have seven sisters and five brothers.  I'm the fourth from the youngest, the fourth the, the last three boys did not have any kids.  For whatever reason my mother [Mattie Lewis Brown] always said one of kids will probably have as many as she.  Some will have maybe one or two and some will have none.  Well my third oldest sister to meritus has as many as my mother.  So she sort of planneded [sic. planned] it out she kind of knew exactly what, what she was talking about.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there anything we haven't mentioned that we, and you don't have any children right?
Speaker 2: As I indicated I have a very large family, my mother has a lot of grandkids and I have a lot of nieces and nephews.  I think the last count including nieces, great nieces and great-great nieces is about 154.  So it's a huge family and we have family reunions every, every year.  So even though I don't have any kids but I got a lot of kids (laughter).

Speaker 1: Is there anything that we haven't mentioned that we should have mentioned before we ask our final question?
Speaker 2: I don't--probably one of the things is we hadn't mention is my involvement with NADA [National Automobile Dealers Association].  I've serviced on several committees, key committees and presently I'm running for vice chairman.  And the election will be held in October of this year.  And if I'm successful on my second attempt I will represent minority dealers.  And I will be the first minority candidate ever to, to be chairman of NADA in its history.  Which represents over twenty thousand dealers throughout the United States and Canada.
Speaker 1: Okay are there more black dealerships now that when you started a few years ago?
Speaker 2: I think our numbers are probably about the same.  Because you know we add some and then unfortunately lose some for whatever reason.  But there are more minority dealerships overall than when I first started.  There's more opportunities for minority dealers beyond Ford-Lincoln-Mercury and being a Chrysler [Chrysler LLC; FCA US LLC] or a Ford [Ford Motor Company] dealer.  You have more opportunities with the Asian brands like Toyota [Toyota Motor Corporation], Honda [Honda Motor Company], Nissan [Nissan Motor Company], with the Korean brands like Hyundai [Hyundai Motor Company], and Kia [Kia Motor Corporation].  And then with the European brands like Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz], Volkswagen [Volkswagen Group], Volvo [Volvo Group] and those brands.  But, but overall in the industries there are more opportunities for minorities and, and women then, then ever before. And I'm proud to be involved in, and have been involved with the process to, to make some change to, to open the doors for more opportunities for minorities.

Speaker 1: Now our last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's a interesting question, but I would like to be remembered as a person who was very positive, very disciplined, very organized, very caring, very open, and a hard worker.  And was determined to succeed when there was a lot of barriers that said no.  As you related to education, as you related to my career, as you related to my overall life.  And I also want to be remembered as person truly enjoyed his life, had balance, had religion.  Understood the aspect of family and truly enjoyed and travelled.  And tried to learn other cultures other way of living.  And also giving and just being understanding about life as a whole.  But most of all I want to be remembered as being a working family with your wife.  My wife [Angelina Caldwell Brown] has been a huge inspiration to me.  Because without her understanding and involvement it would not have allowed me to grow as I have grown without restrictions.  And being an African American man and having that trust and say you go guy, I think is significant and I love her for it.
