Speaker 1: My favorite foods, we'll make it plural, my favorite dishes have to do with I guess my southern origin.  I like turnip greens, black eye peas.  I love cabbage.  I, I like country ham.  I mean real country ham smoked in somebody's smokehouse in the back yard near a bar or some where.  I don't go too much for fancy cuisines.  I eat a lot of Chinese food.  I guess that's Chinese soul food. I can eat Italian food.  But my basic dishes that I really love have to do with, a --a Southern breakfast, bacon and eggs and country ham when I can find it, grits, brains and eggs.  A lot of people don't like that but I, I, I really go for it.  And I go to restaurants where they serve these foods.  I'm a frequent diner at Izola's on the South Side of Chicago,  Army and Lou's.  I used to go to Gladys's much more than I do now.  But that's the story of my eating.  I eat out a lot.  So do other members of my family.
Speaker 2: Okay, now just these are gonna be just quick.  What about--What is your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 1: I don't have one.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What is your favorite phrase or word?
Speaker 1: Phrase?  I really hadn't thought of it.  That's a little difficult for me to--I used the word "profound" quite a bit.  I noticed when I look back at tapes and, you know, speeches that I made.  Because I think we ought to be profound.
Speaker 2: (Down low) Hmm.
Speaker 1: I don't know if I have too many favorite words.
Speaker 2: What about your favorite time of year?
Speaker 1: Well, I like autumn.  I really love autumn and I like spring.  I always did welcome spring when I was a kid even down South.  When things began to come green.  I used to like the sunsets in autumn when I was a kid in Tennessee, the sky's different colors.  And,  in Chicago you don't have too much time to think about seasons.  I don't object too much to cold weather.  I don't particularly care for California.  And I don't think I could stand Florida year round.  So I'm stuck with Chicago.

Speaker 1: I'd like you to start talking about, about your parents and what you know about them.
Speaker 2: You know, I'll, I'll have to admit, despite the fact that I do a lot of protesting about the treatment that this country has dished on African-Americans, but I had a truly wonderful childhood.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Even in the Jim Crow South.  I had some great parents.  My brother and I both consider ourselves very lucky to have had our parents.  I, I had all together five brothers.  Three were by my father's first marriage.  And I didn't get a chance to know them too well when I was growing up because they were adults when I was a little boy.  As a matter of fact, my only whole brother Dr. Thomas Jarrett was a few years older than I and was my high school football coach and English teacher. And when I went to college.  I ended up having him as a teacher.  As a matter of fact, he gave me such a low grade in one of my,  English classes that I got put off the football team, (chuckle).  But we, we sit back now and then and talk about how wonderful our childhood was.  And, and the community.  We had a beautiful community.  And I look back with great sentiment with my childhood.
Story_ID: 8930
Speaker 1: I came up during the era of story telling.  They didn't have TV when I was a boy.  Not too many people had radios, black people.  Until Joe Louis began to fight, (chuckle).  Then when his last big, big fight that is when he fought Max Schmeling the second time, that's when all of us had radios.  We're talking about in the late 1930's.  I think it was '38, [1938] '37 [1937], somewhere in there [June 22, 1938] .  To hear Joe Louis.  It may seem phenomenal to people to day.  But Joe Louis was, our Martin Luther King, our DuBois, our Fred Douglass, our everything wrapped into one living physical bit of black supremacy.  If you want to call it that.  Or black equality.  He was our symbol.  And so consequently as the heavyweight champion of the world particularly during those years when he was about to become that, we became Joe Louis-conscious.  I think that one of my friends was correct when he said that the two saddest nights or days in the history of modern black people was the night Joe Louis was defeated by Max Schmeling [1936].  And the second was the night Martin Luther King was assassinated--the evening, rather.  The two saddest events in black history. He was half joking, but there's a lot of truth in that.  The--the Joe Louis phenomenon would tell you how far behind we were.  The fact that the symbol of our hopes was with a prize fighter.  A prize fighter who had hardly any education to amount to anything.  But he became our symbol.  But one thing, he was a handsome young man, physically a survivor.  You look at his beautiful body.  And the fact that he had the techniques to survive and defeat enemies.  I--When you try to sum up the Joe Louis phenomenon you had to look at it in that fashion.  This is when we began to buy radios and to listen.  And so we'd listen into New York.  We'd listen into the Grand Terrace in Chicago, [Earl] 'Fatha' Hines.  We could wait for that late at night, with strong powered, highly--I mean superior watt radio stations.  Duke Ellington coming out of the Cotton Club in New York.  All of us people tucked away down South in small towns.  You know, we were as a population racially, we were considered a semi-rural people.  A rural if not semi-rural until the [U.S.] census of 1950.  That was the census that recorded us as being an urban people.  This is post World War Two.  But before that we were tucked away in smaller communities.  Many of us didn't have telephones, but we had the black newspapers--a great source of cementing black people.  We had the big church conventions and,  we had the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] that we heard about and read about.  If you got in trouble, you could sneak off somewhere and Chi-, and call the "Chicago Defender" [newspaper].  Or else try to reach New York where they would come and maybe look into our plight down South.  We were a largely Southern population.
Story_ID: 8931
Speaker 1: We also had something else that I think ought to be remember in any kind of historical accounting of black people.  We did, indeed have each other.  You see, this is a myth that black people have gone around most of their lives despairing being black. Black people loved each other, felt for each other.  And we became very sentimental, sentimentally attached group of people.  I have some wonderful little vignettes that may amount to nothing to modern day people.  But I can recall folks dying and somebody might knock on your window at 2 o'clock in the morning, and say, "Sister so and so just died down the street."  And your parents would get up and dress and go down to accompany them.  If someone would lose a daughter or, a son and we didn't have telephones so somebody would go by and knock on people's windows, at least the people in the church's, or the doors, and say, "We think you ought to know that so and so died today."  I remember particularly one of the good friends of my father's.  And I was a little boy.  And I think his daughter's name was Odella.  And he was crying and he came by and tapped on my father's door and window.  And he said, "My daughter just died."  And the people would come and comfort each other.  We really did have each other.  we were each other's keepers.  And this I think has always been ignored.  We did not look at each other with distrust that we learned to do in the big city.  No, no iron gates, no bars on the windows to keep each other out.  the love that I experienced as a little boy would be very difficult to duplicate it, replicate it in the big city today.

Speaker 1: My father [William Robert Jarrett] was an easy gentleman to remember.  He was a rather short man.  He and my mother [Annie Sybil Jarrett] were both the same height.  When you look back on them, we looked up.  But now I recognize that my parents were much shorter than I or my brother [Dr. Thomas D. Jarrett].  And he was a gentleman of great poise.  It seemed as though all the time he was (pause) maybe aware of a TV camera, or a movie camera.  But he wasn't.  It was just his personality.  He was a, a very calm person even when he was angry.  And we had some rules in our house--you, you never got out of control.  You never used language that would invite or indicate that you're about to get out of control.  I can truthfully say, despite my mouth today, I never heard a foul word in my house, in all my years.  My father was opposed to calling somebody a lie if you meant it to his face.  Because that meant you were ready to go to war.  You had to increase your vocabulary to, to remember words like "prevaricate."  "Misrepresenting the truth."  It was quite interesting.  No cigarettes were ever permitted in the house.  No alcohol and yet my Dad was a popular man with other men in the community.  And everybody just knew that you don't drink around him.  He didn't tolerate it.  We couldn't even serve wine for Christmas.  My mother used to sneak and take grape juice and let it ferment a little just to give it a little twang or something to eat with the Christmas cake.  And people would come by to visit you.  And in a small town setting, we're talking about a--I'll be specific--Paris, Tennessee.  Population around 9,000, maybe three and a half thousand black people.  He would walk--We never owned a car.  My dad was the principal of the local elementary school but we walked.  He never made enough money.  My mother was a teacher. Together they put in a combined I think about a hundred and ten or something years together collectively in the classrooms of various little schools in the South.  But--people visited. You had people to come by and drop in on you during the holidays or on Sundays that you didn't invite.  But they were someone you knew.  People just went walking and went visiting--dressed up, went by the railroad station to see who was coming in town new.  You just went walking.  Well they did that in Harlem too, you know, the Sunday afternoon walks during the, the early days of the century, the past century.  People dressed up and went walking.  As if to say, I am here, black people in particular. " I have survived.  Look at me."  I used to--My dad was a nice dresser even though he never had too much money.  My mother dressed as well as her economic outlook on life--she grew up in the rural South too, where you had to pinch and save and redo your clothes and you made a lot of your own clothes and occasionally you would spurge--splurge as they say, by going down town to get a dress.  But,  they were both very dignified people.  You wonder where they got it.  Well they just made it up.  They said, "I'm going to be dignified."  Both had a high regard for learning.  There were--my house was loaded with a lot of books with speeches in them.  'The Great Greek Orations', in my house.  And my dad used to quote with his, short- changed education.  He didn't quite get a college degree, but he did get a degree that would give him the opportunity, the license to teach.  He got a--he graduated in his type of college class in 1896.  I wish I had been aware of what that year meant when I was in high school, or elementary school.  I could have quizzed him more.  Because,  he graduated on April 11.  And Plessy versus Ferguson came down I think on April 18 of 1896.  Just a few days after he graduated, the Supreme Court approved of "separate but equal" education in the South, and then everywhere.  This gave him a degree where he could teach.  My mother went to another little black college.  Maxwell College is where my Dad went in Knoxville Tennessee. My mother graduated from Lane College.  But she didn't do it immediately.  She-- I think she was around the class of 1911.  Somewhere in there.  Alex Haley and I used to talk about this because his mother and father knew my mother and father.  They were both rural and semirural school teachers.  He grew up in Henning, Tennessee, which is right out of Memphis, meaning you're around a big city.  But all those semirural school teachers were some remarkable people.  And when I look at some of the pictures of them and how they had their, their students to dress and to speak--. You know, I was really a lucky kid.  My brother and I both are very, very lucky.  They insisted that if you're gonna live anywhere, you learn the language of the country.  Wherever you are.  If you go to Africa, you oughta learn the language of the tribe and master it.  And they believed in, in learning to speak well and to read speeches of other people.  So I grew up conversing with the names like Frederick Douglass and [W.E.B.] DuBois, James Weldon Johnson.  Short-changed on one side, but you had a wealth of information and inspiration from your parents.  The communities.  There were several little black communities not divided--when I say communities, I mean neighborhoods, rather, that blacks lived in.  They didn't live in big blocks like the South Side and the West Side and the far Southwest Side.  You were scattered all over the little towns.  But they were still black communities, but you might be living next door to a white person.
Story_ID: 8933
Speaker 1: I gotta talk a little more about the dedication--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --of those small town school teachers, and what the community did.  See I was in the oratorical contest as a little boy.  So I had respect for writing way back.  Negro History Week had a tremendous impact on the South.  When you're get--talking about Negro History Week, you're talking about learning though the Negro newspapers.
Speaker 2: (unclear, discussion between interviewer and videographer)
Speaker 1: Can I ask you what was Negro History Week?  When was that started?
Speaker 2: Well let's go back to history.  The Association for the Study of Negro Life and History was created right here in Chicago in September, I think September 11, [1915] at the old Wabash YMCA, Carter G. Woodson , Ph.D history.  Dr. George Cleveland Hall and I think another gentleman a graduate of Yale named Alexander Williams [sic, Alexander Jackson] who might have been the secretary of the YMCA at the time.  And there was a Mr. E-- I forgot, James [E.] Stamps, an accountant.  I think he had been to Harvard or Yale or one of those Eastern schools.  They started the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History in order to fill in some of the gaps that left out, that we black people were suffering from.  And in 1926 the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History--in 1926 they launched Negro History Week, an annual event in February.  Because that was the birth month, month of Abraham Lincoln, February 12, and also the birth month of Frederick Douglass.  You didn't know the date he was born because they didn't keep those kinds of records about slaves.  But he thought that he had been born in 1817 in February.  So you had that month set aside.  One week out of the month black people began to review their past in Africa and in all, various arenas that they had been left out, of as soldiers in all the great wars, as poets, as writers and particularly as scientists.  This is when I learned about Benjamin Banneker. This is when I learned about all of the great scientists.  We were introduced to Carver--again.  Now in our textbooks in the South, only two black names were mentioned, Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver.  Because they were considered accommodationists.  You--you could read a history textbook and never hear a word about anything blacks ever did in any war, but we were the heroes of all the great wars--we learned later, but it wasn't mentioned.  So this is when you read the poetry from the Harlem Renaissance period that was handed down to you.  I can remember the day that I first heard someone read Langston Hughes's great poem 'The Negro Speaks of Rivers.'  And that was one of the most moving poems, poems that I had ever heard anybody do.  And then we learned about Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Ida B. Wells, all crammed into one week.  Now the white administrators of the public school systems didn't know that this was what we were doing.  When we exposed what we were doing, I was in an oratorical contest in high school.  But they didn't know what the real contests were about.
Story_ID: 8934
Speaker 1: I can truthfully say that--maybe my journalism career began in the first grade, subconsciously I had a first grade teacher and another town we lived in called Trenton, Tennessee.  It didn't have over two or three thousand people, white or black.  And we had a first grade teacher named Miss Jennie Booker.  I'll never forget her.  Because in her house she had a flush toilet and I'd never seen one of those things before, (chuckle).  And when she had a lemonade party or a cookie party for the kids, (chuckle) in her yard in the summer--see the teachers communicated with the kids in the community during the summer, at least through the church.  And so we used to have a big party in her yard.  And I used to go in there and flush that toilet.  What, what confused me was what made the water whirl, (chuckle).  I ran up her water bill.  But Miss Jennie Booker did something else that I think represented what the black teachers were about.  Every Friday we black kids in the first grade were given a name that we had been introduced to earlier in the week.  And she would tell us what those names represented.  Fred [Frederick] Douglass, Booker T. Washington, [W.E.B.] DuBois, the whole works.  Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Ida B. Wells, go down the list.  Crispus Attucks, what he did.  Now you're in the first grade.  And on Friday you were to get out in the afternoon.  You knew what you were gonna do, everybody in the afternoon.  And make a speech to your class and try to persuade them to join you or to buy whatever you were selling.  Madame C. J. Walker [Sarah Breedlove], a little girl would have to get out and tell people about her (chuckling) comb and her hair and stuff, and her hairdressing.  one day she told me I was a man named Robert S. [Robert Sengstacke] Abbott.  I'd never heard of him.  And she said, "He is a man, the publisher and the editor of the newspaper that your mother and father buy every Saturday."  And that was all right.  And then you'd get before the class and tell them why they should buy "The Chicago Defender".  Now I think it interesting that the first professional job I ever had in my life when I became a man was with "The Chicago Defender".  I had almost forgotten that little incident.
Story_ID: 8935
Speaker 1: I also began to think I could write when I read an essay in the seventh or eighth grade on Toussaint L'Ouverture.  Now I had heard about Toussaint L'ouverture during Black History Month.  I mean Negro History Week, that one week.  And I didn't know where Haiti was but I was told that he led a slave revolt on the island of Haiti.  And they took over the city and the plantations and everything, and he amassed an army.  And that the French owned the island.  And that Napoleon Bonaparte , Napoleon himself came down to this island to defeat the slaves, ex-slaves and that Toussaint defeated Napoleon.  But I didn't know who Napoleon was really.  I didn't know where France was hardly on the map.  But I had heard Napoleon this, Napoleon that.  He must have been a heavy, heavyweight in history and the brother defeated him.  So (chuckling) I wrote me an essay.  I made up half the stuff, but the audience stood up and cheered.  I mean they just got carried away.  And I remember hearing this woman, I can't think of her name, come up to my mother [Annie Sybil Jarrett] and said, "You know, your little boy, the youngest one, may not be as smart as his brother [Thomas D. Jarrett], but he can write and speak can't he?"  And from then on I was a writer.  I think that was the, maybe the second notch in the genesis that made me become a journalist.  And I just assumed from then on that I could write. I became the editor of my college newspaper.  Even though I had to drop out of the journalism class to take a job.  I just assumed that there was no question about me being a writer.  Just like Michael Jordan probably after he started shooting some baskets never doubted that he was a hell of a basketball player, (chuckle).
Story_ID: 8936
Speaker 1: From an early age the older people enjoyed seeing young black kids get up and speak well, speak better than they.  And this happened long before my generation came along. In 1975, I interviewed Benjamin E. [Elijah] Mays the famous educator, theologian, Ph.D, the mentor of Martin Luther King.  I interviewed him in his home pretty much like we're doing now, only it was just with my tape recorder.  And, and I asked him about his beginning as an intellectual.  And he told me it started when he was maybe seven or eight years old in Epworth, South Carolina--he called it a little mud cell, a little mud hole on the side of the road in South Carolina.  And he said one day the circuit preacher was late.  They couldn't afford a single full-time minister.  So many of the smaller communities used a circuit preacher.  He would preach a sermon here, make everybody shout, and make everybody happy, take up collection and get, get in his buggy or ride, get on his horse and go preach another sermon.  He served several churches.  But this Sunday morning he didn't make it.  And someone said, " Well, we got a little boy here, a little colored boy who could read from the Bible."  We're talking about prior to the turning of the past century.  Which meant that you were hardly 30 years or more out of slavery.  And so little bitty Mays was put on a box and he stood up in that pulpit and read from the fifth chapter of Matthew.  He remembered that.  And the people made him read it over and over  and the old ex-slaves were shouting and waving handkerchiefs and applauding him each time he read from the Bible.  They were so happy to see one of them gaining an intellectual  emancipation as well as a biological and physical one.  And he said from then on, he was off and running.  He didn't even go to one of the Southern colleges in South Carolina.  Some people raised some money and sent him to Bates College in Maine. And his degree was in mathematics.  See there's so many little things that they did that have been overlooked and I recall my own brother...  My brother [Dr. Thomas D. Jarrett] retired in the 1970s as President of Atlanta University.  Yet he came out of a city where when he was in high school, they didn't even have a high school.  And yet he got a Ph.D degree in the English language, in American literature.  They called it, they called it humanities at the University of Chicago which is certainly nobody's slouch school.  He got a master's degree in literature at Fisk [University], graduated from Knoxville College.  Now what is he doing being inspired to do all that?  And in 1954 my brother was a visiting professor and lecturer on literature at Oxford [University], in England.  I have to say England because people get it confused with the University of Mississippi.  But that's a tremendous achievement.  Wouldn't you think?  To come out of a situation where you didn't even have a bona fide high school.  When I came along they had a new high school, but it was nothing to, you know, jump up and down about.  So what was the--what made the difference?  The community inspiration that immolated and flowed constantly from the unlettered, semi-lettered and the handful of educated black people in the communities.  They really worked on us.  The assumption was that I was going to college at some point.  I didn't go the first year out because we were a little short of money and I began to wonder whether it was really  necessary.  But I ended up having to go to college.  It was assumed.  I remember I worked as an apprentice for a plasterer, one of the most respected black men in the community.  And when I told him why I was staying out of school that year because he was making more money than my father earned as a principal of a little school, he fired me.  He said, "You're fired.  You're going to college.  I didn't know that's why you were taking off."  (laughing).  So, I, I was without a job.  Everywhere you turned there was something in the climate that was spoken either verbally or through insinuations that said, "You must always better yourself and improve yourself.  And above all, you're not inferior."  Now this may seem strange when people--most of the people I grew up with were older people in my community hadn't even finished anywhere near the eighth grade, but yet they kept turning out college graduates.  And we went anywhere we could.  The  local churches and the little civic, black civic organizations my dad was a member of, and it was made up of people from all walks of life. Many of them hardly lettered, but they were there together, but where else do you go?  You know, you didn't have enough Black people with money, or education to separate yourselves and still have your own thing.  So you joined with what you had and they made a big deal every spring to welcome home the black college students.  You had to appear before the civic league of Paris, Tennessee if you had gone to college.  as a matter of fact, they, they quite frequently expect too much out of an educated black person.  If you had enrolled in September in any of the colleges and you came home for Thanksgiving, you're supposed to be different (chuckle).  Those first few weeks.  As a matter of fact, your parents were going to see to it that you attended church on Sunday.  You were gonna be dressed properly so the pastor could introduce you.  "Well we have here today sister so and so and so and so's son.  He's over at Lane College.  And,  we see Brother Jarrett's son is here from Maxwell College. And we (unclear) somebody, some other kid from Tennessee State College, or Fisk.  And we're gonna ask our young people to say a few words."  Now you, you  better learn how to talk.  Because if you don't sound intelligent, your mother or your father or your guardian is gonna be embarrassed.  And they're sitting there waiting to here you get up and say something, (laughing) about how much you've enjoyed being in college.  And if you-- now if you sound a little out of it, somebody is gonna hunch your mother's neighbor and say, "She's wasting her time on him. He sounds like he might as well have been nowhere." (chuckling).  And they didn't want that!  So you went out of your way to look good for your parents.
Story_ID: 8937
Speaker 1: This is an interesting thing.  When, when you hear people today Black English--or mislabeled Black English.  so--we spoke better English than the white kids in the homes where we worked.  Well,  I'm gonna put some of this in a book that I'm working on.  There was a contest going on for example in one or two of the homes where I worked part time on weekends.  A contest between me and some of the white kids at the big white school.  You should have seen the white high school in my hometown [Paris, Tennessee]  It stood up on a hill like a castle.  And we have a hilly town but, E. W. Grove High School--way up high.  It was given to the city, to the white students by the gentleman who had a Chill Tonic.  E. W. Grove the Chill Tonic man.  I think it later became Bromo Quinine,  I'm not too sure.  But it was donated to them when we [African Americans] didn't even have a high school.  Well anyway, they finally got us a little high school.  And I remember this young girl who was the same grade as I.  I couldn't work for--I wanted to know what was going on in her high school, what we were learning.  And we had a contest.  And my brother [Thomas D. Jarrett] was working on his master's degree at that time and had come back to teach.  And he had a recording of how old English was spoken.  Not that old English was recorded (chuckle) but they--on how it might have en spoken by Chaucer and so forth.  And I was so happy he brought that thing.  And all the kids in the neighborhood were trying to sound like Chaucer (chuckle).  This is the spirit that we had among poor people.  We're talking about people who--with no inside plumbing.  Some didn't even have a radio.  So this girl and I in this home had started a little old weekly contest over [William] Shakespeare.  So I was reading Shakespeare, she was reading Shakespeare.  She was asking, "What are you-- what, who was Falstaff? so and so"  And I'd tell her, I'd say, "Well--". I'm working on the floors, polishing the floors.  And then I would just--and her mother would try to make her come out of that kitchen.  She'd say, "Missie would you please come out of that kitchen and let him finish his floors."  And she'd come back in there.  "Who said, 'To be or not to be?'"  And I'd say, "Everybody knows who said that."  Bang, bang, bang.  (Chuckle).  One time she--one Saturday she came up with a question and I couldn't remember.  I said, "I'm through with Shakespeare."  I said, "I go before Shakespeare."  She said, "What do you mean?"  And I said, "I go to Chaucer . You ever heard of Geoffrey Chaucer ?"  (Chuckle).  And guess what was going on.  This was some real drama that could be put into a play.  The cooks and the yard people--when I'd come to work on Saturday at this particular house would all be standing around in the back yard or coming by close to hear me take care of--represent them.  That's what it amounted to be.  You were a representative of your race.  And I remember when this girl asked me that question and I couldn't answer it.  When I came back.  She said, "Chaucer , we haven't got to that."  I said, "We've been over--We had Chaucer.  Everybody knows Chaucer."  (Laughing).  I said, "You want to hear something from Chaucer the way they spoke before Shakespeare ever got around?"  (Laughing).  She said, "Yeah, I bet you can't."  I said, "I bet you I can."  We were kids.  So I sat up in the floor and did a prologue to Chaucer's 'Canterbury Tales.' (laughing)  "Whan that Aprill, with his shoures soote the droghte of March hath perced to the roote--"  And then went on.  And some of the black servants began to applaud out in the yard, (laughing).

Speaker 1: We went around making each other feel good with what we had.  You don't have a whole lot, but take what you got and magnify it, and escalate it.  Well, that's what soul food is.  Soul food uses the throw-aways of what white people had.  Like you take chitlins and make a delightful dish out of 'em, pig feet, turnip greens.  These are the cheapest thing you can--sometimes you go out and pick some dandelion leaves and you take it.  When you take it back into your home and you cook it, it's a delightful dish.  I'm not ashamed to say that as a kid growing up, and my parents were a little better off than a lot of folks were, we never had a turkey.  Turkey was something I had after I went off to college.  We had a big hen.  That's what we could afford.  And I prefer hen over turkey today.  I mean a, a good chicken.  Some people like the rooster better.  What do they--they got another name for 'em, it sounds awful, but--. You learn to enjoy and take each other for what we had.

Speaker 1: The black folks used to turn out in large numbers to hear us kids speak.  And they raised money to send us off.  I was sent to Tennessee State College to be in an oratorical contest.  And here were kids from country towns from everywhere you could imagine.  Now the way we tricked the white people, we didn't get up sounding like [W.E.B.] DuBois.  We did that privately.  I did 'Spartacus to the Gladiators' (chuckle).  We even had some white judges out some times to raise some money to help pay for the trip, (smiling).  We were doing 'Spartacus to the Gladiators.'  We didn't do anything from DuBois' Niagara Movement or anything sounding radical.  But the teachers drenched us in African-American history.  I could see one of my old, my old principals now.  He'd get out and dramatize Hannibal crossing the Alps on an elephant.  And he made it sound so good, until we would do it too.  We had high school kids whose parents couldn't read and write playing vocabulary games with each other.  Spelling one another.  I can't spell today.  But I had a tremendous vocabulary when I graduated from high school.  We'd look up new words to say.  And sometimes they sounded ridiculous, but we did them.  Superfluous?  Yes.  But you don't have to sit there and just dry up and die because some white people said you're inferior.  I felt very strange in Chicago signing up in the library down town.  I'd never done it before.  I thought everybody in Chicago was looking at me when I got my library card, (chuckle) down at Michigan--Michigan Avenue and Randolph, you know, the old library, the Cultural Center now. When I went to [George Cleveland] Hall Branch [of the Chicago Public Library] it was the most delightful experience I ever had.  To go into Hall Branch Library (chuckle) and become a bona fide member of the library.  We couldn't even stand in front of the library back home [in Paris, Tennessee].  But yet my brother [Dr. Thomas D. Jarrett] gets a PhD degree in American literature!  You--See these type--The type of thing you're doing will not mean too much unless you get to the substance of how we black people survived.  What we did with what we had for each other.  And how we expected a lot out of each other.  And, and how we were willing to pay some dues.  I almost cracked up when I heard, when I came to Chicago, and heard that they would pass you whether you passed or not.  You know, because of age, you pass from one grade to another.  Now here I am two school teachers' son and a close friend to the French teacher at my high school, but she didn't hesitate to flunk me.  (Laughing), I had to take it over, and she told my parents.  And they told her that's what she should have done.  Because that's what they did to other kids. We, African Americans did so many little things that have been ignored or have disappeared slowly from our agendas.  That may be what's partly responsible for the, the low academic achievements that we have today.  If my brother could get a Ph.D in American literature at the University of Chicago, and then in 1954, before the Supreme Court decision of '54, end up at Oxford [University] on the faculty as a visiting professor of literature, it says something about the black community that produced him.  Now let me tell you a little more about what I remember, 'cause I'm a little boy, he's older, of what the black community did when he graduated from high school!  So-called high school.  He and his classmate Oliver Teague.  Oliver Teague was the valedictorian and my brother was the salutatorian.  These are two boys.  Now the various little women's clubs in our home town and in the churches came together and had a big night for them, at the church.  At the AME church, a big night, raised money for them and made both of them get out and deliver a speech.  They were supposed to have a contest.  But they had decided in front that they were gonna declare both of them the winners.  And different people came in and gave them gifts.  You'd have to question the origin of some of these gifts because guys-- who worked in certain stores came in with a lot of clothes.  And we knew he couldn't afford it underwear, socks, shoes.  Another guy working at the bank came in with jugs of ink.  This is before the ballpoint pen, incidentally.  Big jugs of ink!  Now I don't think he bought it. And boxes of, of pens that you could-- You used to could change the pens and write with them.  And the writing was a premium for most black communities back then.  My father wrote a beautiful hand, like script.  Also most of the teacher that I had if you left that class, your documents, that your--letters you wrote looked as though they were written by the people who wrote the Declaration of Independence if not better.  We were experts at cursive hand writing.  People pay attention to my handwriting today.  They say, "You have a beautiful handwriting."  Well, I've been doing that since the fourth grade, (chuckle).  we emphasized self respect.  And you can't have self respect if you're gonna be deliberately ignorant.  Now this is what I was taught as a little boy.  This is what the other people were taught.  And this is why when I used to go home, (chuckle), the old timers are dead now, I, I was a son of the community--not just my parents.  And some of the old timers who've seen me on TV, or who were around long enough to read some of the columns I wrote for the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun Times, they'd say, "This is our boy doing this."  You didn't have to have a genetic relationship.  "This is our son that did it."  And when I first got on "The Chicago Defender," I was invited back to give the commencement address at my grammar school, (chuckle).  And the place was jam-packed.  And this is the story. I'm not the only so-called hero coming out of my community.  But this feeling of 'us' and 'our', whether it was in suffering or in achievement was one of the most spectacular remembrances that I have of my, my youth.

Speaker 1: And she (unclear) denied it, (laughing).
Speaker 2: She denied it too?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughing).
Speaker 1: And yeah, I got a whipping.  And I, I was suspended from high school for a week for kissing a girl in the cloak room.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They had integrated cloakrooms.
Speaker 2: (laughing).
Speaker 1: The boys and girls used the same cloakroom.  They changed it after that.
Speaker 2: (Hardy laughter).  Is that true?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You were a trailblazer.
Speaker 1: I broke up the integrated--You know what was so funny?  The principal of the school never forgot that.  Every time I--I always went by to visit and would bring him a gift.  He was standing there and just watch me for a long time.  We had seen a movie or something, Clark Gable.  You know how you get, the oh you're going to (unclear).  And I had her all up in those clothes, those cloaks.  It was in the winter.  And he cleared his voice.  I think he was getting his kicks looking (laughing).  That's not on is it?
Speaker 2: (Laughing) Yeah.
Speaker 1: is that thing on!?
Speaker 2: (Laughing) Just part of it, we didn't get the first part.
Speaker 1: Anyway, he suspended me from school.  And I told him, then I began to play the hero.  I said,"Mr. Wilson, it was not her fault.  I did it.  I made her kiss me." (Chuckle).  He said,"Okay, then I'm--I may want to give you two weeks [suspension] instead of--and take hers away from her."  That was a cute funny little thing.  And guess what?  A year ago, I spoke out at upstate Westchester County, New York and I went by to visit her.  We hadn't seen each other in 50 years.  We talked about it.  And she said,"Boy you ought to be ashamed of yourself.  Almost got me expelled."  I used to--The town was so small we were always bumping into each other.  Her paren--I'd see her parents coming down one side of the street.  I'd run and get on the other--go the other way.  I didn't want to run into her mother or father, (laughing).  But, yeah, I got--I was suspended twice.  But for nothing really serious.  But I was a kind of a funny joking prankster, likeable kid.  I played football.  I was considered an excellent football player.  As a matter of fact, I was so good that they suspended the rules and let me play when I was in the eighth grade.

Speaker 1: I had a lot of emotion in, that I put into things.  I guess I picked that up from my Mom [Annie Sybil Jarrett] and Dad [William Robert Jarrett].  My mother was a frustrated writer.  I used to si-, eavesdrop on her in the afternoon after she'd got her dinner on.  She used to look out the window.  And I got right up under it one time to try to hear what--She would be mumbling things to herself.  She would be (long pause, crying). Oh, she would make up essays and poems and things (crying).  By herself, looking out the window at sunsets.  And, she wished she could have been a writer.
Story_ID: 8942
Speaker 1: She [Jarrett's mother, Annie Sybil Jarrett] was very pleased with my brother [Dr. Thomas Dunbar Jarrett] , in particular, got his degree in literature at Fisk.  We all drove out there.  They didn't have a car.  Some people took us over to Fisk.  And I wish you could have seen both of them, at the University of Chicago when my brother [Dr. Thomas Dunbar Jarrett] [Dr. Thomas Dunbar Jarrett] got his doctorate [in 1947]  I was there and I just looked at 'em, 'cause I knew what was going on in their minds.  Dr. Robert C. Hutchens presented the degree and he had something to say about my brother--I forgot what it was. Ph.D.  (Pause).  My Dad [William Robert Jarrett] was real funny.  We were standing out in front of, Rockefeller Chapel.  And he leaned over to me.  He says,"What kind of cameras do they have up North?"  I said,"Just regular cameras Daddy."  He said,"Well this, this man took my picture, but the camera was pointed somewhere else."  I said,"These people didn't come up here to take your picture, (chuckle).  They got their own kin, relatives and friends."  He said,"Oh I forgot."  He said--he thought everybody was there to take a picture of him and his son.  I got a picture that I'll show you if you have it in your file.  That's the picture of them in front.  He was standing out there and he was posing.  He always posed.  Like, "I'm somebody."  You know, "I'm somebody" was never said out loud, but it was implied.  And you were supposed to always act like you were somebody.  And he reminded me so much of some of the older people in the different churches, and the lodges and the little civic--Those men always wanted to be seen as"somebody".  And the women conducted themselves in that fashion too.  I've, I've got a photograph I hope you can use taken before I was born, of an eighth grade graduation [ca, 1900].  If you look at the teachers seated in front and the kids standing behind them--these are black kids--you would have never thought that they would have had a day of oppression in their lives.  But these were the sons and daughters of illiterate folk with their little eighth grade graduation picture, my mother [Annie Sybil Jarrett] is sitting there on the front with her satin dress on, (chuckle).  And my Dad acted like he owned--like he was superintendent of education for the whole state, (chuckle).  I hope that some of this will not be lost for ever, of how we survived.  Most of the people who came to our churches and schools to speak were from the black colleges and they just exploded with erudition and scholarship.  And you could become awestruck just sitting there watching them.  So if somebody ask you what you're gonna be, deep down in side, I just want to be like him, or her. And occasionally we'd visit the campuses.  I remember the first time I'd visited Fisk University's campus.  I must have been in sixth or seventh grade.  The eighth grade teacher took us there.  And just walking around that campus--the new library and seeing the new art work exposed and--you're never the same after that.  My introduction to Fredrrick Douglass's speeches, I was never the same after that.  I didn't know it then.  There was no way I could ever be the same.  And all I had to do was recall some of the little oral history excursions that the young kids could sit and listen but not participate in at the moment, when the old folks taught.
Story_ID: 8943
Speaker 1: Like when my ex-slave grandmother used to come and live with us when I was six or seven years old in the winter months.  When she and my grandfather on my Dad [William Robert Jarrett]'s side got together, just to hear them talk about slavery.  (Chuckle) They were children during slavery and they became teenagers, and grew up during the Civil War. Remarkable. Like, my grandmother on my mother [Annie Sybil Jarrett]'s side, learned to read by stealing it.  She had to steal an education.  obviously when you see her and her complexion, you'd, you'd know that she had some white ancestors somewhere and so I suspect that, John Ursery (ph.), her white father permitted her to hang around the big house.  But when the tutor came, she had to leave.  The tutor came to teach the little white children.  And so she decided to eavesdrop, to find out what was going on--this man and his buggy and big saddled horse--you know, they didn't have public education then--came to the big house.  She hid in the bushes (spoken conspiratorially).  They had the window cracked even if it was  in the winter, to see what was going on.  And that's how she learned to read and write.  And of course, the little white girl didn't know that you're not supposed to teach black people to read.  So she started making up little word games with her, increased her vocabulary.  I have a niece in Atlanta who still has some of my grandmother's letters.  Beautiful handwriting.  She went out with a stick in the dirt and imitated what she saw this man doing with a slate.  She made her own ink.  Down South they have a, a bush called an elderberry.  It has a deep dark blue dye and some people make wine from elderberry.  She made her ink out of that stuff.  She'd take her a chicken feather and cut the tip off and you got a pen, and played writing.  This desperation and this hunger for education in our people has been just monumental.  This is why I always loved, my association with the late Percy Julian.  You know his--All of his scientific achievements, it came from the community setting.  His dad was a frustrated mathematician even though he worked at the post office.  And when he left Montgomery Alabama, it must have been what?  Nineteen where, 20 [1920] or 11 or some where in there. [1916]  The towns--the black community came out to wish him good-bye.  This is a tremendous story when you listen to some of these older people.  And they were all waving as he got on the train.  His grandmother who had been a slave waved at him, when he went to DePauw University in, Depauw University in Greencastle, Indiana.  Going up North to get an education.  And his grandfather waved.  But he had two fingers missing.  And this is what I think gave him that determination.  Two fingers missing on his grandfather's hand.  Those were the two fingers that had been chopped off as punishment for having learned how to read.  Percy Julian went to Depauw University and had to go to the local high school at the same time.  Because there was no high school for blacks in Montgomery.  He was a college student going to college and high school at the same time.  But yet, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa, in four years.  And Dr. Julian told me over and over the source of his inspiration was family and community.  I think I'm gonna go back and interview my brother [Dr. Thomas Dunbar Jarrett] and ask him about the source of his inspiration to, to stick it out and get a Ph.D. in American literature, (chuckle).  It must have been great.
Story_ID: 8944
Speaker 1: This part of our heritage was every day.  Somebody was always stopping me on the street.  When I--they'd catch you using dirty language, you know how kids playing the dozens. "Boy what are you gonna make out of yourself?  You know that's a disgrace to talk--"  I used to play the dozens.  Are you familiar with that?  It's where kids talk about each other's mama.  We used to practice the dozens.  We didn't have a basketball court at the time.  So we'd pla--One part of the town, one community, black community would play the dozens (laughing) with another part.  And I remember one Saturday afternoon, we were practicing in an alley--back of this kid's house.  And there was a man, an old ex-slave.  Some people said he was 100 years old.  We don't know how old he was.  His name was Dumas (ph.)  He was sitting back there in the bushes and we didn't know it.  And he heard us talk about each other's mother in rhyme.  And I could rhy--I had a way with words.  And I--What I said about this little boy's mother, (chuckle) after he had said something about my mother [Annie Sybil Jarrett].  Mr. Dumas came out of the bushes.  I remember this kid said something awful about my mother [Annie Sybil Jarrett] and father.  And, it, it was directed at toward the fact that my brother [Dr. Thomas Dunbar Jarrett] had light skin and my father [William Robert Jarrett] was darker.  And I didn't like that.  I thought there ought to be some boundaries where (chuckle) they draw the line.  And I was trying to think of the worst thing I could say about this kid.  And I heard the train whistle.  The L and N railroad train, and I heard that whistle.  This is where Mr. Dumas was impressed but at the same time wanted to slap me.  I said,"Around the bend comes the L and N, loaded down with your mama's men," (laughing).  And everybody just cracked up and this little boy almost cried and Mr. Dumas came out and he said,"I've had enough of this.  And he gave us a little lecture on what slavery was like.  And on black women in slavery.  It was an interesting thing.  It's still with me.  He said,"I never thought I'd live to see the day that little black children could be out here talking about the black woman! --black mothers--the way you all are doing.  You'd think we just did all of this for nothing."  He said,"You all are just down here degrading and insulting black women!  And all that black women have done--"  he said,"Don't you know that when they were selling us, somebody would always come up and become our mother?  You always knew that there would be a black mother somewhere.  Somebody who had never heard of you--would make you her son.  That black woman kept us together."  And we stood at attention and listened.  Because we were ready to do anything to keep him from going down to our parents and telling them about the dirty language we were using.  And he said," I don't want to ever hear or suspect any of you little boys, all of you came from nice families, talk about black women, the way I've heard you talk about them this afternoon."  And then he turned to me.  Now this is interesting, very interesting.  And he says,"You, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.  Anybody that can put words together the way you do," he says, "you oughta be on 'The Chicago Defender.' instead of out here talking about somebody's mama," He said,"You ever read 'The Chicago  Defender'?"  And I said,"I'm gonna start. No sir, no sir."  We were ready to do anything.  But he stood there for a half an hour and gave us an oral account of what black women had contributed to the survival of our people in slavery.
Speaker 2: Hmm.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Isn't that something?
Speaker 2: It's really.  And well guess what.  Evidently he passed some of this on to his kids.  One of his sons was one of the first blacks to go North and graduate from Northwestern University's dental school.  You see.  That old man--And even--This was way before my time.  And I think his son was one of the first blacks to get a degree from Northwestern Dental School in the 1920'.  That's remarkable isn't it?
Story_ID: 8945
Speaker 1: When you consider the abject conditions that black people had to come out of--not only during Reconstruction, I mean just ignorant and illiterate--punished for learning how to read even.  And then to produce lawyers, doctors and not only that, spokesmen for civil rights?  The conditioning of all those two or three years of slavery (pause) and they overcame it in that period.  I think the whole business of blacks reviewing their history be renewed.  And not just from heroes--"We did--We fought in this war, we fought in that war, and we took, we took--We helped save Teddy Roosevelt at San Juan Hill."  We used to hear all of this. "We saved Andrew Jackson in the war of 1812 down at the Battle of New Orleans.  Andrew Jackson had to admit it himself."  That's not enough.  'Cause Andrew Jackson himself forgot it.  He was a slave owner (chuckle).  But the community [from Paris, Tennessee, where Jarrett grew up in the 1920s-1930s] used to take us to Andrew Jackson's plantation, out from Nashville [Tennessee].  You know, his home is still there, right off of Nashville, to let us see the slave quarters.  And to picture to us what it must have been like to have been a slave.  Technically, I guess, somebody could say I'm not supposed to be here in Chicago as a, a recognized journalist, coming from the background that I came out of.  So something must have happened right?  But we ought to try to find out what it was and, and give it some kind of replication.  This is part of what I do, you know, as a volunteer with some of the programs that I've initiated here in Chicago.  ACT-SO [(Afro-American Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics, later the Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics)] that's national now.  Five or six hundred cities must have it.  And we got a new program we're kicking off full speed with the cooperation of the [Chicago] school board called the Freedom Readers.  You know the Freedom Rders?  Well these--You can't ride unless you can read.  We, we read out loud to each other the great works by and about and for black people.  And we're gonna even spread it out to whites. White kids don't know enough about their history either.  We don't have enough, Hispanics who--(pause) especially for an example Mexicans.  How many of them can tell you the true story of, of Juarez just to pick out one person?  Or Mexican history or Mexican-American relationships historically?  I wonder how many Polish kids can talk about--the achievements of some of their ancestors when they came here, what they had to overcome.  The same thing with the Irish.  Not enough of self-appreciation based on ethnicity.  This is what I'm about really.
Story_ID: 8946
Speaker 1: Okay.  You went to the navy.  What time was--What was--What year are we talking about?
Speaker 2: forties, I came back here in '46.  I got out of the Navy in March of '46, 1946.
Speaker 1: Do you have any, any statements about that whole service time?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)n Oh yeah, oh yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: What?  What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Well, I must, I must plead guilty.  I volunteered.  But somebody could say patriotism may not have been the main or only motivating force, (chuckle). Oh, I, I was firm in my belief the United States was going to have to do something about Hitler despite the way we were being treated in the South.  His sort of racism and the, and the Holocaust type thing was just too much for me.  And, and I'm an emotional sort of person.  I think it's kind of obvious.  It gets in the way at times.  But when I heard that I could volunteer for the Navy and that I would be located right out from Chicago, (laughter), it made it much nicer.  So I volunteered.  I was a union plant representative at the Alcoa Aluminum Company.  I was pretty young for that.  But they were hiring, recruiting people for the war effort.  And they recruited a lot of black people.  And I learned that they were recruiting black people because we were supposed to be less likely to strike.  That's how they, I got in, almost as a strike breaker.  But I turned that around.  One of the first things I did after I got in the plant was join the union, (chuckle).  I became a shop steward over whites and that was too much.  So they waited for me to--I was exc--what is it that they give you when you are like 3A or a rating that they give you, when you're not um--You're gonna edit this of course.
Speaker 1: (Unidentified voice:) 4F, wasn't it?.
Speaker 2: It was almost like that.  Because I had a, a very essential job.  I was helping to manufacture the wings for airplanes.  But they got rid of me. Made one mistake.  I was three minutes late coming back from vacation.  And so they had me as "quit," I'd been quit.  So I said,"I know they're gonna get me anyway."  So I joined the Navy.  They shipped me to Nashville.  I was in Knoxville Tennessee.  From Knoxville to Nashville to Great Lakes [Naval Station].  The first time I had been to Chicago.  And, that's when it began.  No black people, had been other than sea--stewards, cooks, that sort of thing, waiting on white folks.  And they opened up the seaman division out at Great Lakes.  And I enjoyed being out there because I was in the camp of one of my heros that I had been reading about in black history, Robert Smalls.  Camp Robert Smalls, that's the black pilot of a Confederate boat during the Civil War, that soon as he got an opportunity, he, he got together with some of the other blacks on the boat and steered into the Confederate, I mean into the Federal lines, Union Army line, the 'Planter.' And I had read about t that. I enjoyed it there.  It was nice.  But we all had white officers over us.  Because you at that time it was understood that black people could not manage each other.  All of my officers were white men.  Camp Robert Smalls Great Lakes.  But here was Chicago!  Get on the train on the weekend and come into Chicago.
Story_ID: 8947
Speaker 1: And how did you find Chicago?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, it was fascinating.  It was disappointing in some instances, especially on the El when you ride to Great Lakes [Naval Station, north of Chicago, where Jarrett was stationed in World War Two].  You're looking at these back yards, all, some of these old ragged buildings, (chuckle).  I said,"Look this is not heaven that I had been hearing about."  But the fact that you were in Chicago--I remember the first time that I set foot at 47th and South Parkway.  Ah!  You know 47th Street was the street.  The Regal Theater, Savoy Ballroom on one side of the street, on the east side going south.  On 47th itself I went to Morris' Eat Shop, beautiful black dining room.  If you went west all those nice bars and clothing stores, Sikes Bar--Skyles--was it Skyles?  What was his name?  Anyway black-owned stores and then there was another black theater, the Met.  I remember going in there one weekend seeing Moms Mabley, (chuckle).  And Bacon's Casino is where the Charles Hayes Center is now.  And I'd been reading about that.  Joe Louis fought his first fight there, professional fight, at Bacon's Casino.  That was a big [USO] social center that they had set up.  You had pretty young Chicago girls there to greet us and just being downtown, looking up.  You'd sneak and look up at the skyscrapers.  You didn't want to look country, you know, (chuckle).  You didn't want to give yourself away, but you had to look up.  The skyscrapers were nothing like they got now.  You know, when they built the, the Prudential building, that was a big skyscraper later on after I got married.  But anyway, you were big time walking around downtown.  And the little shops you could eat anywhere--we found out later that they didn't want you in some of the other places--Chicago was Jim Crow too.  You'd go in the movies and sit anywhere.  All those lights flashing, Chicago Theater, the rest of them.  It was quite an experience.  The libraries. I couldn't wait every weekend to get back into Chicago.  And they had all of us black people out there.  And me--I was not the only one who had ulterior motives on wanting to join the Navy [to be stationed near Chicago] (chuckle).

Speaker 1: My name is Vernon Jarrett, V, as in Victor, V-e-r-n-o-n, J-a-r-r-e-t-t, and today is Tuesday, June the 27th, the year 2000.
Speaker 2: Yeah, just think, the year 2000.  Did you ever think about the year 2000 and when it was coming?  Because I used to do that.
Speaker 1: I used to go to dances where they said "Play it till 1952."  (Laughter.)  Remember that old recording with Count Basie?  Jimmy Rushing use to sing it "Play it till 1952."  I was a kid.
Story_ID: 8949
Speaker 1: How did you come to work for The Defender?
Speaker 2: Well, first, before I had my employment as a professional journalist, I had this image of myself as a writer, and that began almost in my childhood, the seventh and eighth grade.  I wrote an essay once when I was in maybe the seventh grade.  My brother was off to college and it was about Touissant L'Overture, and I made up the essay because I didn't know that much about Haiti where he became the black leader there after overthrowing the slave bureaucracy of Haiti.  And I was so impressed with what he had done, that I decided to write a story about him, a speech about him; especially when I heard that he had overthrown the great Napoleon.  I wasn't too sure of the significance of Napoleon at that age, but he was taunted as a big man, a great all time hero, and here is my black hero defeating Napoleon's army in Haiti.  And so I did this essay and I remember reading it to a group of people at Quinn Chapel AME [African Methodist Episcopal] church.  I didn't belong to that church, but in those days in small communities you have a sort of ecumenism that was outstanding.  We went from one church to another quite frequently.  For an example, my mother [Annie Sybil Jarrett] and father [William Robert Jarrett], their funerals were held in that church, and we were members of the CME church--in those days, a Colored Methodist Episcopal church in another part of town [Paris, Tennessee].  So I delivered my great speech and the people just stood up and cheered and they thought it was great.  And I remember this mother of a friend of mine's mother coming over to my mother and saying, "Now, your little son is-- may not be as smart as some of the others, but he sure can write."  And, you know, that had an impact on me and I started believing it.  So, I assumed that I was a writer all the way through high school even though I was thinking about becoming a lawyer.  So it was very easy for me to become a participant in a college newspaper at Knoxville College called 'The Aurora.'  And even though I had to quit the journalism class in order to do--to wait tables and clean up a gym while I was in college, I continued to write, and I shocked everybody when they had the essay contest for all juniors in college, who were interested in writing, and becoming editor of The Aurora, our campus paper.  I submitted one for sports, in sports.  I submitted another for editorial comment, and another one for just reporting, and I won all three.  I would have been the editor of everything on the paper.  And I know my journalism teacher, named Melvin P. Moorehouse (ph), he later went to Ohio State, and he used to brag about how he taught me journalism.  But he was very unhappy because I beat out all his journalism students.  And so I was editor of my campus paper.  You can see something building up there even though I was still interested in law.  So during World War Two, I decided that I was going to become a crusading journalist, and the first thing you think about is the Chicago Defender that you were brought up on.  And I came to Chicago specifically, to apply for a job at the Chicago Defender, which I did in March of 1946.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: Interestingly, the only journalism experience that I had was being the editor of a Navy paper, a little--in our black--remember, we were segregated, and I was at what you would call Ma- --it was supposed to be pronounced Mañana Barracks in Hawaii, but we called it Mananna Barracks.  And I was the editor of the Mananna newspaper, the "Manannan" overseas.  And I took my little newspapers with me and I had a few samples of my college newspaper and I went to The Chicago Defender and I met Dr. Metz T. P. Lochard, who became a life long friend of mine.  And he looked it over and he said, "But you haven't had any experience professionally.  We want some professionals down here."  So I kept coming back and coming back.  And in June of 1946, he finally gave me a job, and he and I both became very good friends.  He was the one who gave me my first real introduction to DuBois at his home.
Story_ID: 8950
Speaker 1: And you say that you spent an evening with W.E.B. [William Edward Burghardt] DuBois.  Talk us about that evening.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, that was in the home of Dr. Metz T. P. Lochard [Associate Editor of the Chicago Defender] when I spent a social evening.  He was in the city [Chicago, Illinois].  If I'm not mistaken, that could have easily have been 1948, either '48 or 1950.  I get them mixed up a bit.  But I and two other journalists were permitted to bring our little girlfriends in, which meant it must have been '48 because in '50 I was married.  (Chuckles.)  And we sat and he--and DuBois shocked us all.  You know, he was a very rigid appearing man and she said, "Well, you young people, if you'd like, you can sit on the floor.  We're going to listen to some classical music."  So Dr. Lochard had some big pillows and we sat there and he said, "Why not turn down the lights, Doctor."  He was talking to his friend.  "Turn the lights down a little low."  And I was just stunned.  And he smiled and he loosened his collar up.  Now he was not so loose that you'd say, "Hey, Doc" or anything.  You didn't call him 'Doc' and you didn't call him 'Doobie,' or you didn't go around slapping him on the back and all of that stuff.  But well despite all of this formality, he came through so well with us sitting on the floor that we were anxious to get out.  We just wanted the honor of being with DuBois and we wanted to go out and try to get in a nightclub.  Well, I think one of us might not have been old enough to go to a nightclub, but the majority, we were going to try to get into the Club DeLisa and the Rhumboogie, which was about four blocks from where we were on 55th Street.  But, you know, we did not want to leave when he got through talking.  We listened to him as he put on Antonin Dvorak's 'New World Symphony' and, and he said, "Just listen for a while.  I want you to just observe and see if you hear any familiar music."  And then when they got to that--I forgot which section of it.  It's a largo section of 'New World Symphony.'  I said, "I've been hearing that all my life."  He said, "That's what I thought."  And he was--and he began to talk all through the symphony as to where Dvorak had gotten sections of his composition.  Then he introduced to us for the first time the name of the, we learned later, Harry T. Burleigh.  We said Burleigh studied under Dvorak, you know, this was shortly after the turn of the century.  And when he played the largo section, I said, "I--I used to hear that at our funerals and it was called 'Going Home'," and people would sing, (singing:) "I'm just going home--da..da..da, da, da, da. Friends I knew so--" And I said, "Yeah."  Well, he said, "That's precisely where you he got it.  This is African-Americans' contribution to classical music."  And, of course Harry T. Burleigh later became a very famous orchestra composer and writer and director.  But that was one of the most enjoyable non-youthful meetings I've had with anybody.  We just chatted and he was so loose, and we were looking at him with degrees of respect, and we talked about his philosophy of life and just--I still look back at this and I can't believe he was eighty years old.  So this is how I can tabulate about when this was.  I think he was eighty years old and we would--had the impression he might have been sixty-five or something.  The man was phenomenally healthy for a person that age.  I had seen him before.  But part of my pay for being on The Chicago Defender was just writing for the same paper as W. E. B. DuBois, who wrote a column every week in The Chicago Defender, and so did Langston Hughes at that time.  And this was a very instructive period in my life, and this is why I deal so much with young people today.  These older people really had an impact on me.
Story_ID: 8951
Speaker 1: I mean this division of age just annoys me because there's so much you can learn.  One other great friend I had, they now have a section of the Carter G. Woodson Library named in her memory.  The Vivian G. Harsh Collection of Books on African-American History.  Well, Miss Harsh [first black librarian in the Chicago Public Library system] was one of the librarians at the George Cleveland Hall Library.  I think it was around, what?  48th and Michigan.  And I used to sneak there every afternoon.  I'd sneak right up to that library because I felt very self-conscious being from the South and assuming that everybody in Chicago knew more than I did.  And ever-, someone referred to me as one of those little young punks that's come up here from Mississippi and they're messing up our town.  You know, this is part of the Great Migration.  It wasn't over.  We were still pouring into the big cities.  As a matter of fact, the first census after I got here was in 1950 and the black population then had grown tremendously to four hundred and ninety-two thousand, and we all were jam-packed in these little tight confined areas called the ghetto, South Side ghetto and pockets of the West Side ghetto.  But this woman saw me coming in there every day, every night and she said, "I hope you're not self-conscious, young man, about trying to be a scholar."  I'll never forget it.  You said, "Nobody should ever apologize for being a scholar and I hope that doesn't get in you--she was kind of a rigid--she walked with a--an attractive woman, but she was a spinster and she just walked all through that library with her little head down, and she would always come back and talk to me when I was in there poring over books trying to make up for what I had missed and to be a real Chicagoan, you know.  I ended up knowing more than the people who grew up here.  (Laughter.)  But, well, one event intrigued me, too.  I had never met, I don't think, Langston Hughes in person, and she came in and got me when I was in one of those side rooms, and she says, "I want you to see somebody, meet somebody, Vernon, and come with me."  She just ordered people around.  And I went and got up and there was this gentleman sitting there with books stacked all around him.  I mean just taking notes like mad.  And she said, "Does that face look familiar to you?"  I said, "Somewhat."  I didn't know it was Langston Hughes.  And I got closer and she said, "I know you know who that is, don't you?"  And I said, "Yes.  It looks like Langston Hughes."  And she took me over there and introduced me to him.  And on the way out she said, "Now, if he visits Chicago, he lives in New York and he hardly ever visits Chicago that he does not come to the library.  So, young man, I just want you to know that if he needs to read a lot, what does that make for you?  Now, you've been reading his poetry, haven't you, ever since you was a little boy, and he still needs a library."  And she just took me under her wing, and she put me on the Chicago Hall Branch Library Committee, which is sort of a prestigious area.  I'm a nobody, you know, and I'm sitting there with all the wheels sponsoring forums and so forth.  I remember they had a woman from Ebony named Era Bell Thompson, who became a highly respected writer for her books and essays.  She was on the staff of Ebony.  And this woman made me feel very proud.  So, I spent every afternoon and evening from work that I could in that library reading and it became a habit.  I'm almost like that now.  I keep books at home.  But I'll never forget her.  She kept saying, "Don't ever apologize for being a scholar, or at least trying to be one."  She said, "We're going to need more scholars.  And if you are a writer, you got to be well versed in what you're writing about."  And when she died, I was out of the city, but it was a tremendous loss.  Then I discovered she lived in the same apartment building where I lived.  I caught her once or twice going up and down the steps at the old Rosenwald Building.  That's where I lived after I got married.  She's one of a series of great people that took time.
Story_ID: 8952
Speaker 1: You know Like Paul Robeson during that same period, a little later, I had--I spent an hour and a half at least with him.  And I wasn't exactly terrified, but you can see the awe after having read about him as a child.  Paul Robeson, you grow up--that was ABC's.  DuBois and Langston Hughes and, of course, there were later some great people.  But the fact that the older successful people took a little time with us.  I try to do that today.  The ACT-SO [Afro-American Cultural, Technological and  Scientific Olympics] Program and The Freedom Readers Program that I started here.  It's about older people, accomplished people, sponsoring academic activity and respect for scholarship.  We are supposed to be the role models and the leaders in this.  And the article that, I hope you have read, in the Crisis Magazine, I try to state that.  You just can't write off people as beyond hope because I don't know what kind of scores I would have made or SAT and ACT if I had to take that to become a journalist.  I probably would have been wiped out.
Story_ID: 8953
Speaker 1: I just didn't want to be a journalist.  I wanted to be a, a journalist that black people respected.  Are you taping this?\
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  (Yes.)
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, my goal in coming to The Chicago Defender--
Speaker 2: (unclear)
Speaker 1: I think it's important to understand that when I came to Chicago, specifically almost, to work on a black newspaper, and even more specifically to be a writer with The Chicago Defender, I just didn't come as people might do today to enter a field of journalism because I had a special talent.  I did always think from grammar school on up, as I told you, that I had a special talent for words and being able to summarize and to succinctly put thoughts and descriptions in acceptable language.  But I came here to help change the world.  You see, we'd just fought a war, President [Franklin D.] Roosevelt's 'Four Freedoms.'  That's all you were hearing about, this new world.  A writer from New York, another journalist, a black journalist named Roi Ottley had written this book called 'New World A-Coming'.  It was about, of course, New York, Harlem, et cetera.  But the title, 'New World A-Coming,' we were all new world oriented; meaning we were not going to accept what we had been accepting before.  And I had this bitter experience, I may have told you earlier about when I took my mother to the movie and someone thought that night we were walking home from the movie and I had my arm around her and a car full of white kids drove by and one of them said, "Does that nigger got his arms around a white woman?"  And two or three--the young lady, she was an older teenager, said, "No.  That nigger wouldn't be doing that.  He ain't that crazy."  And I was so upset at this kind of statement.  This was right after the war [World War Two].  And I began to chase them.  Fortunately, they didn't see me.  There was enough in there to have killed me if they wanted to.  And I had been feeling good, taking my mom to see a movie.  My dad opposed it because we had to sit in the balcony, but I just felt like taking my mother out.  We went to see the Marx Brothers, which was real funny at that time, and here this incident.  So that week, I made arrangements to leave [Paris, Tennessee] and come to Chicago.  Just kind of speeded up my journalism career and I came here and went down to The [Chicago] Defender.  I went also to The Chicago Bee and the Defender finally decided to hire me.
Story_ID: 8954
Speaker 1: Now, those early days, what would you--what was The Defender like at that point?
Speaker 2: Oh, The Defender was Mr. Big.  Had always been.  You see, The Chicago Defender has specific appeal to those, what you would call the Illinois Central crowd where you go right down the middle of the South.  Now, the Pittsburgh Courier was popular in my hometown [Paris, Tennessee], and now and then you would see the [Baltimore] Afro-American, but they appealed mostly to the Eastern crowd--South Carolina and some parts of Georgia, the coast.  Those people migrated to Harlem; Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, all along the way.  But for all of us Illinois Central people whether we had ever ridden a train or not, we came right up--even we thought Cairo was a big deal, Cairo, Illinois.  (Laughter.)  We came on up till we go to Detroit and we'd drop off in St. Louis.  And the ultimate heaven, of course, was Chicago.  The maximum heaven.  People would come to Chicago, go to Chicago and come back in two weeks and then change their voice.  They'd sound differently. (doing exaggerated nasal Chicago accent) "I was in Chicago.  In Chicago, we did this."  And I remember a guy, "I didn't know I was a Negro in Chicago."  (Laughter.)  I had a relative one time who put her finger to her nose when she'd answer the phone, "Hello," like this is the way you're supposed to sound when you're in Chicago.  (Laughter.)
Story_ID: 8955
Speaker 1: I used to hear from the radio, which had a great impact, the Grand Terrace, [Earl] 'Fatha' Hines.--all those little kids used to sneak and turn the radios on after Joe Louis made it possible for us to get a radio.  I presume you know a little about Joe Louis and the radio, don't you?  Before Joe Louis - most of us didn't have a radio.  I can remember in Paris, Tennessee when only two black people owned a radio.  And when Joe started knocking white people out and it looked as though he was going to be the next World Heavyweight Champion, people would just happen to be drifting by these two homes on those hot summer nights in June to hear how Joe was going to--I can see Mr. Wayne Palmer (ph.) now coming out on the front porch saying, "Well, Joe just almost got him in the first round.  Hit him with a left hook and with a left jab.  It looks like it won't last so, so long."  And the people out in the streets were applauding.  And there was another man who had a radio, named Mr. Loving (ph.).  He was the one who, I think, who made most of us decide we were going to buy our own radios regardless because he'd put people out of his front yard--(laughter)--trying to hear the fight.  So in 1938, I think it was the date, you know, in '37, [sic, 1936] prior to that, Max Schmeling had been the first one to defeat Joe Louis and it just broke our hearts.  And in the South, you must remember, when Joe Louis fought, there would be prayer meetings in most black homes.  And my father thought, out of principle, that prize fighting was a sin and all that because you shouldn't brutalize each other but on the nights that Joe Louis fought, at the dinner table, we all bowed our heads for Joe.  (Laughter.)  And, ah, this is a thing that I think deserves some real special analysis.  It's not like Muhammad Ali or Sugar Ray Robinson, or any fighters that came along later.  Joe Louis--let me summarize it this way.  When Martin Luther King died, I was--in the final word that had come to me that he was actually dead, I was at 71st and Halsted.  My wife and I were getting ready to take our kids into a little animal store, shop.  They wanted to get some fish or something.  And this man on the street corner said, "Joe--the word is out now.  Joe is dead."  I don't mean Joe.  "Martin Luther King is dead."  And I remember this old lady saying, "This is the saddest moment in black history since Joe Louis was defeated by Max Schmeling."  That's what Joe meant to us.  On the evenings before the fight, there was this crowd, or absence of crowd.  It was just clear, like everybody was pausing, waiting.  A few kids were celebrating, going around punching like, "I'm Joe Louis and you're Maxie Baer, and you Primo Carnera." --a lot of us kids, but the older people were very solemn before the fight.  And one instance, my dad walked out when Graham McNamee, I think was the announcer's name, wasn't calling the fight right.  After, after Max Schmeling, when somebody started punching Joe too much, my dad would leave the room, wouldn't listen to the radio.  And the radio had a tremendous impact on music, you know, we'd hear the big bands.  One night after Joe won, maybe it was the Max Schmeling fight.  I got to tell you this.  This is some great stuff.
Speaker 2: (Background talking.)
Speaker 1: I'll just try to tell you in front.  After Joe Louis had vindicated, you know he knocked him out in one round.
Speaker 2: I don't' think I knew that The second.  You're talking about--
Speaker 1: The second fight.  Max Schmeling got him in the twelfth.  But--in the next fight, all of us had our own radio.  (Laughter.)  Philco made a fortune over these little table sets.  My brother [Thomas D. Jarrett] had come home from college and we had our own radio, and he bought us one and he was teaching school-- (Laughter.) And--are you on now?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know.  Okay.  What was so funny--
Speaker 2: (unclear) sit back (unclear) You know, what was so funny about this.  Everybody was going to make sure that they had their own radio, and they went in debt--most people did, and bought a little table top.  I think we had a Philco.  Later on, we worked up to a Majestic.  But when Joe Louis punched out Max Schmeling in that fight, I think it was 1938, the kid next door, it could have been Barney Palmer (ph.), ran out.  We all ran out into the streets.  You know, this was heaven.  In Chicago, it was worse, I understand when it comes to explosions.  And this kid said, "Joe Louis got him in one minute and fifteen seconds on our radio.  What did he do on you all's?"  (Laughter.)  And another kid down the street said, "He got him a minute and ten seconds on our radio."  (Laughter.)  And we were hugging each other, and I remember I ordered me a set of Charles Atlas Body Builders.  Can you imagine all us little skinny kids?  We ordered--we had these sets in our garage and when you screw in the thing, it'd strengthen your neck.  And we had the springs you pull out.  Everybody was going to be Joe Louis.  And I got the hell beat out of me twenty years later at a carnival fighting thinking I was going to be Joe Louis.  (Laughter.)  The lights went out.  The generator went off and this kid kept punching me.  He had a white shirt on.  I mean a dark shirt on and I had on a real white one, and he could see me better.  (Laughter.)  And I--I'd never been beaten up quite like that.
Story_ID: 8956
Speaker 1: You know, when you think about that particular period [1930s], there's something that we have lost since then and that was this feeling of universal family-hood.  I know we talked about each other and we would cut each other up, and we gossiped about each other, but there was a sense of family.  That every time I go back home and walk the streets, I  kind of choke up a little.  You know, like when we died, even if we didn't have a telephone, we'd go and tap on somebody's window and say, "My daughter just died." or "My--"  I remember that twice with us.  And the people would get up and dress and go back and try to comfort the family.  And we wreaked it to a great degree of sentimentality.  And this is why I'm in love--this is why I love songs from the South and the Blues form had such an impact.
Story_ID: 8957
Speaker 1: You know, I don't think a proper estimate has been made yet of the significance of radio.  The sounds from up North and from the big cities that seeped into smaller communities.  When I was a, a small child, I know we used to go visit people who had a radio, and we began to see the significance of that very early.  But as time grew on us, we began to rely heavily on the radio for inspiration.  Just hearing Earl ['Fatha'] Hines from The Grand Terrace [Chicago, Illinois]--there was this other place where you had a semblance of freedom.  It may have been overrated, but you had a feeling that, don't give up.  Things can be better.  There are other places.  And I remember after one of Joe Louis's fights where he won, everybody the next day at school and everywhere was talking about and right after Joe Louis you heard Earl Hines from the Grand Terrace.  And you'd turn your radio on another notch, and there was Duke Ellington from the Cotton Club in New York.  It was either Duke or Cab Calloway.  And the kids imitated what they heard and, consequently, some of your best jazz musicians could be found in black colleges as you begin to grow older.  I remember this kid, Jimmy Blanton that was discovered by Duke Ellington, who was with the Tennessee State College Collegians, the kid who be-, became famous playing the bass fiddle.  He played at my high school dance with the Tennessee State College Collegians.  The Alabama State Collegians.  You had the Tuxedo Junction.  Erskine Hawkins.  People, a lot of them had their roots in the South and you were kicked off of your lackadaisical pedestal by saying, "If I get real good, I can get me a band and I can go North."  Sometimes you stayed down there.  I heard dances and chorus lines.  Some of them used to be at the Cotton Club when I first came to Chicago.  They heard about all of this over on the radio.  And now and then you could hear something with a degree of militance in it--over the radio.
Story_ID: 8958
Speaker 1: Understand that at this period in life, we were really fighting in a deep struggle for our own reason to continue living.  I mean black people.  This was right before the war [World War Two]  This was a-- everybody was talking about freedom and being against tyranny except in your case.  The Four Freedoms.  Does that apply to us? You're still in a Jim Crow outfit.  You--you're against Hitler?  Well, what about Hitler here?  The lynchings were still going on and you couldn't even get Congress to pass an anti-lynching bill.  For example this is the twentieth anniversary year right now of "Lift Every Voice and Sing" by James Weldon Johnson.  But when James Weldon Johnson was the executive secretary of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] during the 1920s, in particular, he was unsuccessful in his crusade to have a simple anti-lynching bill passed.  And when I say lynching, for the benefit of the young people, we're not talking about somebody getting strung up stealing a horse like in a cowboy picture.  I mean some brutal, sick, nasty neurotic crap, and maybe erotic, too.  Stuff that they would do when they would lynch a black person; like cutting off your toes for souvenirs, the digits on your fingers.  And I've hear in some instances where your genitals were preserved just to show off in some white barber shop or pool hall.  Then dressing up in your best clothes to go to the lynching.  Lynching became synonymous with pure Americanism.  When you would go back and put on your World War One uniform to participate in the lynching, you were saying, "This is a patriotic symbolism of how I feel about our country."  And I understand from my parents that folk used to go back and get their Spanish-American War uniforms at the turn of the century to wear at a lynching.  Sometimes they'd take you to the County Fairground to lynch you, they'd have a flag.  You see, the Ku Klux Klan symbol, don't forget, was a cross.  Jesus Christ.  Being oppressive against black people was a part of your religious responsibility as a Christian.  You had to listen to this on the radio, too, on Sunday mornings to hear all of these nonsensical sermons about your inferiority on the radio.  And you were fighting for your own existence.  My father didn't want us going to the movies.  He knew we would sneak and go to see the cowboy pictures and the serials.  They used to have a serial every week, and Tarzan was introduced.  I have a bad wrist now playing Tarzan, leaping from one limb to another and I missed the rope and fell and almost killed myself. We were just being brainwashed everyway you turned; even some of the Disney cartoons showed the black person in there being the ridiculous fool.  And you saw Step'n Fetchit.  Amos and Andy was on the radio.  Don't forget that the first technological advancements in the theater were wreaked with racism.  In fact, it was before most of us were born.  In 1915, the first movie of any consequence when it comes to technological scope, D. W. Griffith's, "Birth of a Nation," was a racist film praising the Ku Klux Klan.  'Birth of a Nation.'  Literature, everywhere you turned, the theater.  We were out here fighting for our very spiritual and psychological existence.  So, you can see what the phenomenon of Joe Louis in his own little self-same way beating the hell out of white people saying, "You need to straighten up."
Story_ID: 8959
Speaker 1: Would you say that radio has been the most predominant influence, you know, I mean given the different times, on black people--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The most predominant--I can cut you off right now.  The most predominant media influence on black people was the black newspapers.  We can't give them enough credit.  They were--our Internet.  They were our cement that helped keep us together, the bricks.  And here we are in many ways motionless.  We were bricks, but they were the cement that kept us unified.  They were the medium for us knowing that black people were going to college and graduating.  You'd see their pictures in the paper.  "And, don't get a Ph.D. degree or a masters degree and you're in The Chicago Defender?  Outstanding."  Somebody got an appointment.  When you see any appointment that a black person got, they called it a 'post'.  (Laughter.)  "So and so elevated to high governmental post."  And you'd be up there and you might not be making over five or ten thousand dollars a year, but you're being sworn in and you got your wife and your children there.  Anything suggesting an upward movement, you read about it in the black newspaper.  And, oh, when Joe Louis was fighting, we couldn't wait.  We heard it on the air.  We saw the movie, but we couldn't wait for The Chicago Defender and The Pittsburgh Courier to come out with those full pages of fight pictures of Joe Louis and his mother, Joe Louis and his new girlfriend.  Marva [Trotter] getting ready to get married with Joe, you know.  And Joe with his cool hat walking down the street in Chicago and Joe passing out little things to the kids.  And there we could see it, the whole story.  Oh, it was just beautiful.  It kept us alive spiritually. Though--. Then you would see the great black entertainers in the black press.  You know, we used to wear stocking caps.  I used to wear a stocking cap to keep my hair slicked down.  And people would say, "Why are you going around imitating white people?"  We weren't imitating white people.  We were imitating the entertainers.  If Duke Ellington's hair is slick, I'd slick mine.  Cab Calloway was more of a white type, but we accepted Cab.  Anyway, we loved him.  We thought Cab was rubbing it in.  You know, he used to shake his hair when he would sing Minnie the Moocher, and his hair would fall all down in his face.  And we liked that, too, because he was rubbing it in on white folks, showing off.  You know, we got good hair.  He got good hair.  And despite, you know, we've come through a whole lot of self abnegation without it doing too much damage.  You know, we can call each other the worse names.  You know, our kids go and call somebody "Liver Lips" and we'd make a joke out of it.  And here's a guy with a long head, you'd call him Watermelon Head.  But it didn't get us down.  This is a beautiful thing that I think I'm trying to explain some of this in the book I'm doing.  Despite all of this self denigration, you know, we came up in playing the dozens, talking about somebody's mother.  (Laughter.)  And I didn't realize how awful that was until an ex-slave, this man could have been a hundred years old.  I think they said his name was--
Speaker 1: You already told that story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean that was the story I alluded to.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 8960
Speaker 1: When I was a little boy, my brother [Thomas D. Jarrett ] used to have to, every year, take a gift over to the superintendent of schools, Mr. Tatum.  He was a white man.  My dad [William Robert Jarrett] was the principal of the elementary school.  And I presume this was dad's way of showing little favors, in order for Mr. Tatum to do-- make certain concessions to the black kids.  It was a great big basket.  Everybody had a garden when I was a kid, and so we gave him the biggest head of cabbage, the biggest radishes, the best leafy greens that we had, and the nice onions, the biggest, and the biggest tomatoes, and it was a huge basket.  And my brother would take this thing over to the superintendent's house and deliver them as a gift from my dad.  My brother goes off to college and one summer he wasn't there and I'm becoming a big boy now.  I'm what?  I'm in seventh or eighth grade, and I recall I'd bought me a little bike for five dollars, a second-hand bicycle that I saved and saved, and saved money.  And I was getting ready-- I was actually unhappy about having to take this present over to this white man and I asked Dad, I said, "Why do we have to give him a present?  He never gives us anything."  He said, "Don't ask any questions.  Just take this gift over to Mr. Tatum."  So I reluctantly put the basket up in front of my bike and I'm getting ready to pedal off, and my dad called me back.  He knew I was unhappy about this.  And he said, "Go to the back door.  Even if you hear or see them in the front yard or wherever they are, go to the back door.  Don't go running around out there with this basket.  You ring the bell and you knock on the door.  And I have a little note in here where it's from.  And if they don't come, just leave it there in the screen door."  And so I said, "Okay."  And I started to pedal off again, then he called me back again and he says, "All of your life down here, son, you are going to have to go to the back door."  He said, "But one thing I want you to promise me right now that you will never get used to it."  When I look back on that, it chokes me up.  (Laughter.)  He said, "I don't want you ever getting used to going to the back door.  So you go and take it over there and drop it down.  If you leave mad or angry, you make me happy."  And this has been our history.  This is why I think so many of your pretty tough and durable leaders have come out of the South.
Speaker 2: (Inaudible.)
Speaker 1: We never have got used to it.

Speaker 1: You came in really to wanting to use journalism-- to change the world.  And here you're working for your favorite newspaper [the Chicago Defender].  What were-- what were you assigned to do after you joined them.
Speaker 2: Well, one advantage that you had in working for the Negro press, you did some of everything.  I did obituaries.  (Laughter.)  I covered weddings.  I covered sports and, occasionally, after they thought you were going to make it, you could go back in to the back and help lay out, put the paper together, or in the front, you could help design it when some of the guys took vacation.  You could actually lay out and design a newspaper, and then you could go back with the hard type and set it up.  You'd learn how to read backwards.  You have to stand there--it was an interesting experience.  I covered racial riots more than anything else in the first-- because I volunteered.  A lot of the guys who grew up around here were not too anxious to tangle with this because they knew how bad it was. I did not.
Story_ID: 8962
Speaker 1: When they [The Chicago Defender] asked for somebody to cover Airport Homes [in Chicago, December 1946], I couldn't wait to volunteer.  I'd cover it.  This is when the two [African American] veterans moved into the Airport Homes--this is some wartime projects that the federal government had built to accommodate war workers.  You know, this country was doing such a high key mobilization during the--to become the "arsenal of democracy."  That's what [President Franklin D.] Roosevelt said we were--that they built up housing and did everything they could  to make us--we were the arsenal of democracy.  So out here at 63rd and Keeler and Karlov, and along that little area near Midway.  Midway. That was O'Hare then.  This was Midway Airport.  They built these houses for war workers.  After it was over, the war, the government owned them.  And so the government assigned these houses to the governmental agency that you had here in existence, the Chicago Housing Authority.  And we had a gallant, great woman, white, but it didn't make any difference, named Elizabeth Wood.  She decided that the people who were going to have access to these homes would be, number one, veterans of the war, and, number two, first come, first served.  Now this was in a lily white neighborhood.  So she assigned some black veterans when the opportunity was presented.  And I volunteered to cover them moving in.  (Laughter.)  And I couldn't believe it, what I had moved into up North.  The first time anybody had ever spit on me.  Nobody in the South ever actually spat upon me.  So--
Speaker 2: So was there--
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: We still on?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're on.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And you had the mob on one hand.  You had the reticence on the part of the police department to protect you.  You had your life in your hands.  I will say this--the police did keep me from getting killed, on two occasions.  I'm almost certain I would have been battered to a pulp.  But, you know, I mean it's funny--I guess you have more guts than you have now.  I kept going back, covering these stories.  And I must tell you that when I go to Carter G. Woodson Library and look at some of those little minitapes that the government collected of black media of yesteryear and I see where I described certain events there--sometimes you were not permitted to use your name so they wouldn't come to your house, the mobs.  But it's frightening to me today.  In one or two instances, I just wrote it off.  I said, "They got us now."  The cab that took us out there, ran off and left us because they were chasing the cab.  And, fortunately, a police patrol car--one guy got out when he saw us and left the back door open, and they were chasing us out of this area, around 63rd and Keeler, and we were running.  Scott Tyler (ph.) and I with his camera.  And we opened the door and got in--the patrol car and then they sped off.  (Chuckles.)  Took a drive.  It was awful out here.  And Lorenzo Johnson, the first black man to move into the--the seventy--seventy-first block on St. Lawrence.  I remember when he moved in, and I spent a night with him.  So some of this stuff that my dad [William Robert Jarrett] told me about "never get used to it" rubbed off.  I was out there all the time.  We spent a night with him because he was a very humble man.  He had a master's degree and his wife was a registered nurse, and he swallowed this malarkey about "if black people conduct themselves properly, white people will welcome them into their neighborhoods."  So his first night out there, he had these two big white dogs and he was walking them down the street and about three hundred people gathered and said, "Nigger, go--they started chanting,"Nigger, go home.  Nigger, go home."  And then they said, the dogs can--" The white dogs can stay, but you got to go."  And he was so hurt and heartbroken.  And one Sunday his wife went to Saint Columbanus Church, which is right across from Rayners on 71st Street. And a woman who had been taking the Holy Eucharist with her was out there in the mob--about forty-five minutes later, and she threw her purse up on--at her, she was so angry. Up on the porch.  And I remember another black person who was volunteering like some of us was--were to protect Mr. Johnson.  I don't--I won't say what he told the woman.  He said, "You don't, don't you come up here anywhere near to get this purse because I'm not Mr. Johnson.  I know what to do with you."  (Laughter.)  And the purse was just danglingout there on the front porch.  And the cops would be drinking pop, smoking--might even have been having a beer with the mob.
Speaker 1: Now what happened, you know, in the '60s with the riots, that spawned a reaction?  What happened when these riots were occurring?
Speaker 2: You mean when Martin Luther King was marching?
Speaker 1: No.  I mean not when he was marching, but I'm talking about these race riots that were occurring.  You know, we had the 1919--you're talking about the riots that were at Airport Homes.  So what--
Speaker 2: In some parts of Englewood they had riots.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was the response of the white community?  Were they, you know, were they, let's--were they to beat up everyone?  Were they to--
Speaker 2: Well, they would gather out there and threaten the--the first--the real courageous people, and I have to just doff my hat to them.  were the people who became the first to move into a block even if the block ahead of you, just to the north of you was filled or getting filled were black, but you were the first to move into the next block? It took a lot of guts to do that here in this city.  One of the youngsters, young men that I remember writing about, and I'm going to do some research to try to find out what happened to him.  I was particularly sympathetic toward him because he came out of Memphis and he'd gone to LeMoyne College.  I think it's called LeMoyne Evans [sic, LeMoyne-Owen] now in Memphis,Tennessee.  And his wife was a college graduate here.  A sharp couple.  They were out at Airport Homes.  I think they were the last family to leave.  And they waited until he left to go to work at night and they shot through the window, and his wife had to have been standing right over the baby's crib, and glass scattered all in that baby's crib,and two of the bullets--if she had been turning over in her bed, it would have struck her.  Fortunately, she was laying flat on her back.  You could see the holes.  When I wrote about that, it just tore me up.  And it had made all of us want to go out again.  I was also out there with the celebrated photographer named Wayne Miller.  He was with Life Magazine.  He was going to do a free-lance piece on it.  And he and I went outone night and they had--now listen to this.  they had ten thousand people out there, because all the men and the young sons had come home from work.  In the daytime, it wasmostly women who were there at home.  But at night, you had men and women.  This was thefirst time I ever saw Thurgood Marshall.  The NAACP had sent him out.  And a mob was out there that day in the afternoon.  But this night, I went out--and Wayne Miller he told me, he thinks--he said, "Jarrett, I think you better stay in this car."  We were parked right up on them, but they had their backs turned to us because they were going to--they were chanting and making threats.  They burned a cross and they attacked the mayor of the city, Edward Kelly.  They referred to him as a "communist Jew."  This is real crazy stuff.  There's a sign, "Mayor Kelly is a communist Jew and niggers stay where you belong."  And the police estimated ten thousand.  And I'm going to say this for Ed Kelly.  Ed Kelly ordered them to make some arrests and not take any more stuff off of this mob, and they began to arrest people after that. But it was only after one woman took a big piece of jagged rock, concrete from the broken sidewalk and hit the police commander of the district.  I remember seeing him bleeding like, like--I thought he was going to pass out. This is a day we ran and were almost trapped and the cab run off from us. (Laughter.)  But the whole climate of hatred in Chicago affected me profoundly.  This was why when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] came here I could not march with him in Marquette Park under the pledge of non-violence.There's no way in the world I could deal with these people and say, "If you throw a rock at me, you hit a woman, even a nun--they were saying awful things to nuns out there--that I am just going to curl up and defend myself and protect myself.  Because I almost took off on a little guy the last--I think it was the last occasion that I was out there when they tried to burn down the building that we news people ran into.  They went berserk.  They went against white people, too.  Anybody who didn't live in the neighborhood, they would assume that you were against them.  They attacked white news people, and they had us all jammed up in a, in a frame building.  These were wooden buildings, incidentally, that the government owned.  And they tried to set fire to it and the rain kept putting it out.
Speaker 1: So now--this--what's the--you worked for The Defender how long?
Speaker 2: Oh, that--I worked for them only two years.
Speaker 1: Oh!  And then, then why did you--then you went with the Associated Negro Press?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 8963
Speaker 1: You see, one, one thing that I gained, too, about the urban experience was that everything wrong wasn't white.  It was also black and white.  The black politicians made deals for their establishment.  The black leaders made deals.  They (unclear) theirtheories about people that it was not created just for white people.  They had the cooperation of the black people, black politicians.
Speaker 2: We're rolling.
Speaker 1: You see, one of the great revelations of working as a young adult in the big city, you learned that all of our ills could not be attributed strictly to a white animosity--that much of what was going on had the concurrence, if not direct participation--or maybe including the strategizing from black political leaders.  For example--one of the most powerful black political leaders in this city [Chicago, Illinois] faulted Mayor [Edward] Kelly--was too lenient on the people who insisted that the black people move into Airport Homes.  He was critical, privately, of Mayor Kelly ordering a crack-down on the mob.  And he was not pro-mobs.  He was just dealing and wheeling.  And they thought that some of the blacks who were insisting moving out therewere stirring up unnecessary trouble.  And there were times when I thought that maybe some of this type of attitude was at the--among side the people at The Chicago Defender. Remember, I'm pretty strong and committed at that particular time in my life.  And I developed a clear lack of understanding of black people who were wrong, the least bit. We had one black judge in the whole Cook County, Wendell P. Green.  And I used to run around black people doing take a stand against it, and so I did and I was with them while working on The Defender.  I worked the precinct against the Democratic Party machine.(Laughter.)  I'd get home from work, sometimes instead of going to the library, I hit the precinct.  I went all over the--I was the second--I was in the 24th Precinct of the Second Ward.  And I remember the regular Democratic ward precinct complained about me all the time.
Story_ID: 8964
Speaker 1: I'll have to economize on words by saying that I grew up in Chicago [as a young man]  with the decision in my mind that quite frequently you just have to take sides.  You see, I didn't come here to make money in the first place.  I didn't come here to one day become a member of the white press.  Getting on the [Chicago] Tribune or the Chicago Sun-Times and all that stuff was the least in my mind.  What I wanted to do was be like some of the black citizens I had been reading about in the Pittsburgh Courier.  Remember, we had some tremendous columnists, and some of them compromised a little, but they stood their ground.  Benjamin E. Mays, who later became Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s mentor, was a columnist.  It wasn't just [W.E.B.] DuBois.  He wrote for the Pittsburgh Courier.  A.J.[sic, J.A.] Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers], the self-taught historian was with the Pittsburgh Courier and the Murphys--the Murphy family leadership of the 'Afro-American', the Baltimore 'Afro-American' and all of its satellite publications.  Those are some people who took stands.  Despite all the criticism you may have of old man Abbott, Robert S. [Sengstacke] Abbott [Chicago Defender publisher], in his day.  Of course, he was dead when I got here.  But they took some stands, they took risks.  Remember, The Chicago Defender had to be distributed by Pullman porters in some instances because if you put it in the mail, the postmaster illegally would just dump them in the garbage.  You didn't get your newspapers.  Now, that wasn't in every city.  There were people out to kill folks who distributed The Chicago Defender at one time.  So we've always had this tradition on people taking stands, and this is what I admired about most of them.
Story_ID: 8965
Speaker 1: NAACP's [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] greatest years was when it took visible stands, and we are probably living off the momentum of that now.  I don't know how long it's going to last, but we are enjoying the momentum the NAACP has from past victories.  I mean courageous victories.  I shudder to think of what some of the people--not in my time--we couldn't have a NAACP locally.  This was way after the war.  After the '50s [1950s].  For example.  I was told that in Paris, Tennessee that in 1955 when Emmett Till, the Chicago teenager was killed--in Money, Mississippi was lynched--as horrible as it was, and people were sending money from everywhere to the NAACP--the people in my hometown had to drive over into Kentucky to mail their contributions because they didn't want the postmaster or anybody locally to see that we were sending money to that radical, communist, left wing organization known as the NAACP.  Just being a member.  So you go to Paducah, Kentucky, sixty miles away or if you wanna take a chance, go over to Murray, Kentucky, which was only thirty miles away, or Mayfield or somewhere like that.  Isn't that tragic?  Couldn't even have a local organization.  When I was a kid, we read about, in The [Chicago] Defender and we heard about it, of course, close up, that in Brownsville, Tennessee two organizers of the NAACP came in and conducted a voter's registration drive [in June, 1940].  Now, they weren't asking for integration.  They were not trying to enter any restaurant or any school, or any hospital.  They were simply trying to mobilize people to vote in Brownsville, Tennessee, which had a majority black population.  Two days later, those two men were found in the Hatchie River.  They had been killed and dumped into the river.  And I think you should read 'The Crisis' magazine's article on one who escaped, Mildred [Bond] Roxborough's father [Ollie S. Bond] was one of those school teachers and also a mortician who had to leave town.  They burned his home down because he was conducting a meeting, and ordered to leave.  This was what we were up against.  And there was some of us who came to the North--were dismayed when we saw politicians playing footsie with downtown.  And I struck out against them, too.  (Laughter.)
Story_ID: 8966
Speaker 1: Was there anything memorable about going with the Associated Negro Press or anything that you would--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: -- talk about in terms of--
Speaker 2: Sure.  That was the first column I ever wrote.  A lot of people thought the first column that I ever wrote was with the Chicago Tribune in 1969 or '70.  No. I wrote a column for Claude Barnett's Associated Negro Press, it went out to all the newspapers.  This was right after Jackie Robinson, the Jackie Robinson era, and other teams were considering black players and they had them out on their farm teams.  I remember my column was titled 'Echoes From The Stadium'.  (Laughter.)  And it went out to all the black newspapers, and I gave it--I would give the reports on what blacks were doing in farm teams.  I remember writing about [Harry] 'Suitcase' Simpson in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  You know, he became a rather famous player.  And I remember when this phenomenal player named Willie Mays was being tried out by a Milwaukee farm team.  I think it was the [New York] Giants.  And a bunch of us, the first day he came to Chicago after he had been made a major leaguer, we went over to see him play.  And this was a tremendous period.  It would keep you hopped up.  Like the first night [Leroy] 'Satchel' Paige pitched here in Chicago against the [Chicago] White Sox, two to nothing, shut them out.  You should have seen the crowd.  Four blocks, they blocked traffic around Comiskey Park, four blocks.  And I think the [Chicago] Herald American newspaper had an aerial picture of the crowd.  You couldn't get anywhere near there.  I was lucky.  I got there two hours early and got a ticket and saw Satchel Paige.  Every time he would hold his head up, the crowd went, "Boo-boo!"  And when he'd look over and wave the sign off from the catcher, and, you know, he had a way of winding up and never stopping.  He just kept winding.  (Laughter.)  And then he'd throw the ball, and the crowd flipped.  See, we were so hungry.  We were so hungry for any kind of individuality and success that the Satchel Paiges and the Monte Irvin s and the Roy Campanellas.  When my mother visited Chicago, one of the great delights of her whole life was when I took her to see Jackie and Don Newcombe pitch.  Jackie on first base and Roy Campanella catching.  This was one of the great moments of my mother's life.  It was to sit out there at Wrigley Field and see this.  And this is still a carry-over.  (Pause.)  This is still a carry-over from the old days.  You know, when you had to grab at everything.
Story_ID: 8967
Speaker 1: We didn't have any black congressmen.  You had one.  When I came to Chicago [Illinois], the whole Congress had one, William L. Dawson.  But the unique thing about that is I interviewed him.  (Laughter.)  And that was the funniest interview in the world.  What did you think of him?  Well, the reason that I was sent to interview him was this was an off year election, meaning--what year is this?  An off year election.  It's the first election right after you've had a presidential election.  And the Democrats took a beating, which was not uncommon in an off year election.  The Democrats got the hell beat out of them.  Everywhere in Chicago, but in Congressman Dawson's second ward and other districts where he had influence in other wards.  So, I went out to interview him to get a story about him, you know what was so unique?  About him.  And here's a man I had been looking at with awe when I was a child.  Bill Dawson.  'The Man' they called him.  William, quote "The Man", Dawson.  (Laughter.)  And then Bill, "The Man", Dawson.  He had more clout, they said, than any individual black person since Frederick Douglass.  (unclear) with presidents.  You know, he had a--he--go right in to see Truman.  Truman.  They were on a one on one conversation basis.  And he was a big man.  Responsible really for Mayor [Richard J.] Daley becoming the Boss that he was because you had Ed--you had Mayor Kennelly, Martin H. Kennelly to succeed Ed [Edward Joseph] Kelly because people thought he was besmudging the image of the Democratic Party.  This was prior to 1955.  So in 1955, they replaced him with an innocuous gentlemen who never did anybody any harm.  Real honest, he was easy to control and his name was Richard Daley.  (Laughter.)  Who became the Boss.  And I thought it interesting that when I walked in Mr. Dawson's door, I said to myself, "This is the man that I've been hearing about since I was a little boy, and here he is.  I am walking into the office of a Congressman of the United States of America.  You know, this was part of getting paid.  You didn't have to make. I think The Defender was paying me forty dollars a week.  I didn't care.  I was subsisting on it.  And I remember, I came in and I said, "Congressman Dawson, I have one question to ask you, and this is what they told me to ask you.  What was the secret to your success while all of the other areas of Chicago failed, or the machine failed?"  And he looked at me and he said, "Boy, how long have you been here from Mississippi?"  (Laughter.)  I said, "Mr. Dawson, I'm not from Mississippi.  I'm from Tennessee."  He said, "Well, that's almost as bad."  He said, "You just got here, didn't you?"  And he wasn't too happy about some of the editors at The Defender at that time either.  He said, "Who sent you out here to ask me such a silly question?"  I said, "Nobody sent me.  They told me to interview you after your great victory."  And he said, "You go back and tell all of them what they already knew.  That the Dawson machine wins again.  (Laughter.)  He said, "You should know, in fact, that I am different."  Well, we were going to--he finally broke it down because he had gone to Fisk.  He had been down South, but he had a lot of fun out of me.  And he also learned later that I was one of his antagonists because I thought he was too footsie with the machine when I got a little older.
Speaker 2: Didn't that machine--didn't he end up just being - sort of stripped of all his power.
Speaker 1: Well, he was getting old.  His memory was going AWOL.  And that's when they decided to put Ralph Metcalfe in.  He was suffering something.  Not exactly Alzheimer's, but certainly close to it.
Story_ID: 8968
Speaker 1: You definitely had a voice, as you know, as a reporter.  But you were--your voice--you wanted your voice to come out more  you got that chance when you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Airport Homes was not the only thing.  I was--anywhere there was a racial conflict, I'd show up.  And I used to do some stuff, when you look back on it, it was pretty courageous. I, I hid in some bushes around a meeting of the white racists in Gary, Indiana one night.  When I thought back at that, I said, "I must be a fool."  I mean here I am in a town that I don't know anything about.  I got a friend of mine to drive me over there, and I heard that they were having this meeting.  You know, there, the high schools there were the focal points of a lot of violence. You remember Frankie Sinatra came over and protested [sang at a pro-integration event].  Froebel High School.  I think that's R-F-O-E-B-E-L [sic].  They didn't want the blacks in that high school.  And I think Roosevelt High.  The closest town is practically all black now, but they had a lot of racial conflict.  And I went over there one night to eavesdrop on white, a super white meeting, and I can't believe I did it.  As soon as it got dark a little bit, just enough for me to get out of that car and sneak in the shrubbery.  I sat on the ground out there afraid to cough while they were having their meeting in the basement.  (Laughter.)  You know, just--(Laughter.)  And I wrote this up.  I remember the guy at the Pittsburgh Courier wrote me a special letter behind that.  He said, "Man, you're on the ball.  I wish I could do that, but I can't anymore."  We later found our--formed our own newspaper, those of us who had had problems at The Defender, called The Chicago Globe, and we tried to do the same thing then.  This was when I spent a few nights out at the Lorenzo--I think his name was Lorenzo Johnson, family, the first black family to do--to cross the 'Mason and Dixon Line.' [slang for boundary between black and white neighborhoods in Chicago]  And 71st Street now is the Mason and Dixon Line.  (Laughter.)  Can you believe that?  I took--I walked out here one night, one Sunday afternoon with a college friend of mine just to see what it was like on South Shore, and people started looking at us very strangely.  Not too far from where I am--where I'm living now.  And we'd decided we better get out of there.
Story_ID: 8969
Speaker 1: I'm going back to the Associated Negro Press.  You, you found your voice there.  That's when you first became a columnist, right?
Speaker 2: As a columnist.  I wrote sports columns.  Now you have to understand with the Nat-, what the Negro--what the Associated Negro Press did.  They did a lot of clippings from publications all over the country, all over the world.  They had one or two African correspondents, and some of us wrote individual stuff.  But we clipped and we condensed it and sent it out every week, maybe twice a week.  We had a bunch of people down there just clipping, clipping, clipping.  Everything that was going on anywhere that had to do with black people.  Most black publications didn't have that kind of money, so we rendered a real service.
Story_ID: 8970
Speaker 1: I did the same thing in 1948.  Oscar Brown, Jr. and I made another historic move.  There was a young man here who wasn't old enough to vote named Oscar Brown, Jr., who was a composer and an actor with Richard Durham.  Richard Durham had broken ground with the first black radio soap opera.  And he did another show called 'Destination Freedom' and another show--he was a brilliant man--named, titled 'Here Comes Tomorrow'.  And one of my girlfriends was the primary actress with him named Janice Kingslow.  She was brilliant.  She was playing downtown in 'Anna Lucasta,' and she was getting a lot of press, and we had a group out here.  We had the DuBois Theater Guild.  All of us who kind of felt strongly about the way things were.  We used to meet in Washington Park.  The writers.  There were other theatrical groups here, of course; Skyloft Players and the Center Aisle Players, and several others.  We did a lot of plays.  This is something you miss today.  We always had a play going around here.  Sid McCoy, who you see now and then on a lot of commercials--still going from California.  He was one of our actors in it.  A great voice.  He was a radio disc jockey.  Another tremendous talent died named Art [Arthur] McCoo.  Fred Pinkard did a lot of Broadway plays.  He's still out in California.  They came out of our little group.  I wasn't an actor, but I was president of the DuBois Theater Guild.  And we would review each other's writings and poetry.  For example.  When [Lorraine] Hansberry wrote 'Raisin In The Sun', we went as a group to critique her play, to see how she did it, how she got away with really making it big.  This is a Chicago girl.  You know, the Hansberry family was famous around here.
Story_ID: 8971
Speaker 1: Tell me because I just saw that [the play 'A Raisin in the Sun' by Chicago playwright Lorraine Hansberry] again, and that was the first play I ever acted in.  And I saw it just recently at the Goodman Theater and it was amazing how it still has withstood the test of time.  I mean it almost seems brilliant.  It is--it seems like a brilliant piece.
Speaker 2: Well, when it was showing--when we saw it, it was a very timely thing.  Black people moving into white neighborhoods.  That alone.  But then the other crisis, the human stuff that went into it, the family and the matriarch.  You could have almost changed the characters except moving into the other neighborhood.  But remember, the restrictive covenant was raging.  The Supreme Court did not outlaw the restrictive covenant.  But in May, I think it was May 2nd or 3rd of 1948, the Supreme Court said that these covenants that people had been signing since World War One, that's when they began, to prohibit people from--of different racial backgrounds or religions from moving into certain areas could no longer be enforced in court.  And that's when the mess really started.  It opened up everything out here.  And for a long time, you were going to have a conflict, even in recent years of some black person moving into "the wrong neighborhood."  But that was common back then because we had to get out of this ghetto.  You have no idea how suffocating it was.  And especially in the fall when it--when I first came here, every time you turned, there was a fire.  People jammed into these chopped up apartments.  For example.  The six-flat made into a twelve-flat.  And there were other apartments cut up worse than that where there was no exit for you to get out.  And the so-called 'kitchenette' became en vogue, which means you had a bedroom, a kitchen and a bathroom, and that was it.  In some instances, one bathroom down the hall.  People just made money off of us and they depraved condition in which we had to live because of the restrictive convenant.  So when they built--the skyscrapers down there off State Street, the Robert Taylor Homes and all those places.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.  You had started--.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The Robert Taylor Homes, the way I'm looking in retrospect, and I could feel it even then.  The Robert Taylor Homes, let us not forget, had the cooperation of Congressman [William L.] Dawson and the chief aldermen of the area.  They got a lot out of this.  This, in my judgement, was a ghetto in the sky.  In other words.  They don't want you moving out, so let them go up.  (Laughter.)  Where it's limitless.  And they had a big to do out of this.  Big fanfare.  Bunting around the stand, a band playing, kids, ribbon cutting.  We celebrated our own confinement.  (Laughter.)  And this was one of the worse sins that you could commit, and they had the endorsement of the political machine--including the black leaders.  Because what did it do? It gave them more power.  One building could be a precinct.
Speaker 1: Right.  But don't you think at the time that the housing that you had it replaced that it was much better and people thought they were actually doing better--?
Speaker 2: You know what?  The biggest thing, that I used interview people down there--and I remembered before Robert Taylor Homes.  Yeah, it was better.  The thing about it was it was new and it was fire-proof, we thought.  That, that was one of the biggest advantages that people saw in, in public housing of that nature because they--you had so many fires.  My God, the way people were living.  And I remember one cut--one incident that I covered that I almost decided that maybe journalism is not for me.  The housing market was so tight that a woman who had six children living in the--in an abandoned caboose on the Illinois Central Railroad tracks.  Six kids in a little caboose, and the thing caught on fire.  She had to go to the store or something and everyone of them burned up beyond recognition.  And I was over there covering that situation and the photographer who was with me--I can't think of his name--was in the police office.  They had us over there in peeking in the window of the police station, and they started shooting pictures of her and I made him stop.  I said, "This woman just had every one of her children not just burn up, but burnt up beyond any recognition and don't start--and I stopped some of the other reporters, one or two white guys.  I said, "Leave this woman alone.  Don't ask her another god-damn question."  I was angry.  I almost cried.  She was sitting there not knowing what to say.  And then here comes a black reporter who wanted to quiz her.  "How now, what did you think?  What is your reaction? Or what do you think the city--?", you know, the hell with all that.  I said, "Just leave this woman alone."  She was in a traumatic fit.  And I said, "Maybe this is not my thing if I got to go around here quizzing people."

Speaker 1: What do you think was the difference in the Chicago of the 40s [1940s] in the Chicago of the '50s [1950s] and Chicago in the '60s? Now I--you--was it--was one long, you know, fight against, you know, segregated places for politicians?  I mean was there a change that you saw?  Was it changing for the better?  Was it changing for the worse?  You know, with the fighting, did you see, you know, at least you were making some progress?
Speaker 2: Well, something was always happening.  To give you a semblance of progress.  Distractions in many ways, but they were good distractions.  I remember, shortly after I got here, the major leagues decided to integrate.  Jackie Robinson, Wrigley Field.  We had--we had this great innovation of the famous Satchel Paige in his old age.  I just can't explain what that meant.  In his first Chicago appearance in Comiskey Park where he wasn't playing in a segregated game.  This was how we--we went out two hours early to make sure we would not miss this.  He--for a split moment, he was our new Joe Louis.  That was a great innovation.  Then people were always fighting back--in, in one way or another.  1948.  What, what happened?  The black lawyers decided they had enough of this one black judge business.  And I remember a big meeting in the lower level of the Cosmopolitan--no, Metropolitan Community Church, then pastored by the Reverend Joseph Evans, who was considered always an independent.  That's at 41st and King Drive.  I was at that meeting called by a group of civic leaders and the Cook County Bar Association, it's the black bar.  And they decided that they were going to run some black candidates for judge, and I never felt so better--as better--any better than that in my life.  I became a precinct captain, all right?  (Laughter.)  I was supposed to be on The Chicago Defender newspaper and be neutral, I became a precinct captain, and almost won a big victory in my precinct.  They decided to run the distinguished Earl B. Dickerson.  He was a black man that had been appointed to President [Franklin D.] Roosevelt's Fair Employment Practices Commission during World War Two.  Sidney P. Jones, a young upcoming lawyer and a stand-up guy.  He was the other candidate.  And the other one was Richard Westbrooks, one of the most underrated today, one of the most underrated transportation and railroad lawyers in this country.  You see, I became a little boy running around with these guys.  Richard Westbrooks used to call me over, when I was a reporter, just to sit out and talk.  He wanted to talk to somebody and he knew I was interested in history and stuff.  And you know what I recall about him.  He knew I wasn't making much money, and I had to stop him when he'd hang--he had asked me to hang my coat up even if it wasn't all that cold and chilly in his apartment.  And when I'd get home, if I'd reach in to get a handkerchief, there would be a five dollar bill.  He used to want to help out.  And one time he offered me some money--not to write anything about him, he had too much pride for that.  He just figured,  here was this young guy up here from down South.  (Laughter.)  And I would take his money back and that just--and he, he really adored me for not taking money.  But we ran three candidates against the machine.  So this was the beginning of what became, became the Harold Washington Movement, only a few decades early.  And they didn't do too badly.  Then later on, you ran a mayor.  Dick Gregory ran on a write-in.  And then one time, Newhouse, Richard Newhouse, a [Illinois] state representative, ran from here.  And we kept chipping away and chipping away until you built up some momentum.  See, something was always going on to give you hope.  We were never out of hope despite what the mobs did and what the cops did.  And the cops were a total payoff when I came here.  If a policeman stopped you for a traffic violation, you had to pay it right on the spot and think nothing of it.  That was routine.  I know I didn't have any money one time and I told the guy, I said, "Look.  I don't--you caught me at the wrong time.  I have to go home."  I lived in the Rosenwald--this was in the early '50s.  It could have been 1950.  And so they followed me on over to where I lived.  (Laughter.)  I went upstairs and couldn't find anything but a half-dollar.  And I came down to apologize and I said, "This is the best that I can do.  I looked through everything I have and I got fifty cents."  And they took that.  I mean--(Laughter.)  You learn about the city.  And the jitneys ran up and down the street.  Of course, they're legal.  But all this adds is a little flavor it seems to our part of town.  The Club DeLisa in those days you couldn't get in on the weekends because of the white people.  They didn't have any fear about going past 50th, 55th Street or 63rd Street.  The Rhumboogie had tremendous shows.  You could see the top black talent in the world in your own neighborhood.  The Regal.  That's the first place I saw Sammy Davis play, Count Basie.  45th and King Drive used to be an insurance company.  Metropolitan Mutual Assurance Association.  That was the distinction between the other Met.

Speaker 1: I left town--I couldn't make it around here [Chicago, Illinois].  I left town and went to Kansas City.  (Laughter.)
Speaker 2: You went to Kansas City--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I went to Kansas City to live.
Speaker 2: From 19 what?
Speaker 1: '54.
Speaker 2: Not '54? Oh, you went from 1954 to when?
Speaker 1: I came, I came back here around '60.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Videographer:) Roll.
Speaker 2: But in 1960 is when you were working with the black lawyers, right?  Is that--were you working with--oh, you were working with all of them before.
Speaker 1: No, not black lawyers. Real estate people.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Remember, you were saying you ran some judges [for election in Chicago, Illinosi]?
Speaker 1: Oh, that was in the '40s.  In 1948.
Speaker 2: Oh, my God!  Yeah, we ran a--When we ran candidates for judges was 1948.  And we kept hammering away until eventually decided that the organization itself started putting black people on the ballot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So let's just talk about real quickly because there are other--I have to get to Harold Washington, I've got--.  But you left here for a period of time.
Speaker 2: That's right.  I gave up on journalism and I established my own public relations firm. I did pretty good on that, and I was always a ghostwriter, speeches.  But Oscar Brown, Jr. and I, before that, he had established a benchmark in radio.  We did the Negro News Front beginning in 1948, it may have stayed on the air for about two years.  Not only that, we were on a major fifty thousand watt station, WJJD, owned by Marshall Field's.  And I think him being a liberal was one thing that might have helped us get on that station.  Every morning, we did fifteen minutes of news about what was happening to black people all over the world, and that was one of the best experiences I had.  It was sponsored by a black company.  Oscar's father was in real estate and had a school out here, and he also had a wholesaling company called 'The Good Food Products', and they paid for advertising.
Speaker 1: You know, that's sort of interesting when you think about it.  We don't have that today.
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.
Speaker 1: Hm-nn.
Speaker 2: Anyway, I would go downtown to that all night newsstand at right in front of the downtown--the main [Chicago Public] Library at Michigan [Avenue] and Randolph [Street], and at twelve o'clock I'd grab as many of the key cities, newspapers from key cities every night.  And right across the street was a Triangle Restaurant.  They used to have a chain of restaurants in downtown, serve yourself, called Triangle.  I would get me an empty table and sit there and stack all these newspapers up and I learned to read fast, and I would just go through zinging, zinging.  I mean, clip out, rip out everything having to do with black people, and especially the sports pages.  This is how I used to keep up with--I'd get a paper that had clips of Wilkesboro, Pennsylvania, and other, Milwaukee because of Willie Mays, and all of them.  Every elevated move in terms of progress.  Africa.  We kept on top of Africa, and I had to go through the New York Times, and I'd sit there and condense these clippings, take them home with my little portable typewriter and write Oscar's show, and he would--and condense it into fifteen minutes.  Now, that was a tremendous experience.  To be able to condense all this stuff and pick out what you wanted, leave in what you want to use later.  And he'd go on the air at seven-fifteen in the morning down at the [Union] Carbide Building.  And sometimes I would pinch-hit with him, but always he did the editorials.  That went on for about two years.  We got put off the air--(Laughter.) --because we got a little too strong and so we decided, we didn't care, we're going to a black station.  That's when we discovered that the black station was white owned.  (Laughter.)  We went on the same station, I think, that most of the black disc jockeys including Herb [Kent] and all of them that you was talking about went on.  We didn't last too long there.  Then I got me another show of my own from, I think, it was WSBC that Jackie [Jack] L. Cooper, a black man, owned, and I did a radio show called "Minority Report'.  I thought that was a clever term back then.  (Laughter.)  And I did the news out of that and finally a brewery needed somebody, and I was out of desperation.  I had been working with the National Association of Real Estate Brokers, the Dearborn Real Estate Board [Dearborn Realtist Board].  I did a lot of expose of blacks moving into white neighborhoods in Georgia, in Atlanta, Georgia.  Take pictures, run out with a, with a camera any time there was a new neighborhood was opening up, and I would send it out to the, the black press, and I--I got--I was having a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 8974
Speaker 1: In Kansas City, I finally got a job with the M. K. Goetz Brewery Company.  I ran out of gas.  And they hired me to be a, a marketing specialist.  Actually, it was just a salesperson.  And they gave you a car, which was a marvel to me because I had a hard time paying for that Chevrolet that I had.  And I travelled all down through Kansas, all those old cowboy towns, and I went to Des Moines, Iowa.  I went to Kansas City and from there I--finally, I moved to Kansas City, Missouri.  That's where my youngest son, Tommy [Thomas S. Jarrett] was born.  And I drove all through Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Sand Springs, and all the little black towns.  And then I come back up through Lawrence, Kansas.  And on the side, I never stopped being a journalist, incidentally.
Speaker 2: Did that experience change you at all?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Did it change you?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Here's the funny thing.  I got a good close look up of the so-called lower class of black people, the people who didn't have a private club, but they had their own clubs--taverns that they hung out in.  I listened to all the discussions of what they talked about.  And I could see their hunger to hang on to their own humanity.  I used to see some awful fights.  I used to talk to prostitutes and they would--when they found out I wasn't trying to use them, they'd trust me.  Tell me how they got started and the tricks they used on people-- (Laughter.) --to get money.  And I know there was one little team of shoplifters that had me come down there to watch them one time when they went through a department store.  It was unbelievable.  These guys trusted me, and I took a lot of notes from them, and some of them I'm putting in my book.  But I lived on the nightclub circuit in Kansas City.  The famous Orchid Room.  And I'd sit up half the night sometimes.  It was part of my job.  Listening to old musicians who reminisced about--just like we're talking now--about their predecessors.  I remember--I'm trying to think of the guy, the saxophone player with Duke, who was sitting up at the Street's Hotel Restaurant one night.  He was drunk--talking about the first time he saw Charlie Parker, heard Charlie Parker play his saxophone.  And I wished that I had a tape recorder.  It was one of the most beautiful poetic presentations I had ever heard.  He would sit in the back of this nightclub.  He'd been hearing about this young phenom, Charlie Parker from Kansas City, and he went out to hear him.  And over hear him, as he heard this boy come up with all this, these tones and these different off-beat notes, and how he brought it all together.  I just wish I had had a tape recorder that night.  I'll think of the musician's name.  He was a great saxophonist with Duke at one time.  But I had to come back to Chicago.  Now, --  A group of friends of mine insisted that I come back to Chicago, and that's how I got back here.
Story_ID: 8975
Speaker 1: When I came back to Chicago [he spent the years from 1954-1960 out of town], I--thanks to--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: You know, another friend who insisted that I come back--I got letters all the time saying, "You're wasting your time, Vernon."  You're very flattered when you think about it.  Many of them are dead, one guy named Robert N. Landrum (ph.) a very prominent real estate broker said, "Vernon, you ought to be back here with us.  We need you."  Because I had worked with them for a while when I was unemployed, they gave me a job as research director, and I went all over the country for them doing research on what was happening to black people in housing.  And I made enough to keep my, my family, barely making it.  My wife [Fernetta Hobbs Jarrett] was working.  And I finally came back here and there was another man named Wilbur Slaughter (ph.).  I didn't have a place to stay.  He let me sleep on his couch.  And they found me a job with the Community Conservation Board, which was part city and part federal government, and Mayor [Richard J.] Daley didn't know who he was hiring.  (Chuckles.)  I took a job doing research with them.  And I did a history of Woodlawn [neighborhood].  It was a political appointment.  He was doing a favor for Robert Landrum.  Until I made a speech one night out in Englewood at a community meeting, and that's when I decided I couldn't take it there much longer.  I did--what you don't do.  I took the floor and gave a history of the restrictive covenant in Chicago.  (Laughter.)  And it got back to the man who headed the Community Conservation Board that I was out here stirring up the people.  That I attacked the real estate industry and the insurance industry and accused them of being the authors of a gov-, the use of government to keep black people out of white communities.  The man asked me if I said that--his name was D.E. Mackelmann, the head of the Community Conservation Board.  I said, "Sure.  I said that.  I was just telling the truth.  It was history."  He said, "But don't you realize, and the Mayor has heard about it,  don't you realize that any time you go out and make a speech and you're employed by the City of Chicago that you are speaking for the Mayor."  I said, "No. I don't--I wasn't speaking for the Mayor.  The Mayor doesn't know what I know."  I said, "I was speaking for me and just telling the truth.  What's wrong with letting people know about what happened yesterday?"  I said, "I didn't attack anybody in the Mayor's office."  And it went on like this, and I think I was making twenty-some thousand a year. And was up for a big promotion.  I was in Englewood.  I was in charge of the Englewood office.  They loved me over there.  I mean the white people down there in City Hall liked me because I ran a pretty orderly office.  And I started looking for another job, and this is when I went with a black insurance company.  I said, "I am going to be with a black company where I can say what the hell I please and not having to worry about it."  I said, "The next thing they'll do, they'll want me to carry a precinct."  (Laughter.)  Because they didn't know who they were hiring in the first place.  And I told Mr. Landrum that I appreciated him getting me the job.  But while I was there, I wrote a history of the Woodlawn neighborhood--community, a structural history of Woodlawn.  The Chicago World's Fair coming there, the whole thing, when this was a suburb.  I did some good stuff.
Story_ID: 8976
Speaker 1: How did you come to work for The Tribune?
Speaker 2: Well, we'll make a shortcut.  Thanks to Mr. [Holmes] Daddy-O Daylie, while I was at the black insurance company and I was writing on my own, I was working on essays and stuff and ghost writing.  Everybody in town wanted me to write their speeches.  A young man named Martin Luther King [Jr.] was assassinated, and so the TV stations down south--downtown were called in.  I think the Mayor's Office had something to do with this.  And they were asked--and all of the media were asked to do something to keep down a riot.  Chicago was supposed to explode and, particularly, on the day of his funeral.  A gentleman by the name of Richard O'Leary, who was then head of WLS TV, channel seven, ABC, went out and hurriedly and tried to get some people to go on the air during the funeral.  Maybe you are too young to remember, but the funeral went on and on and on that day.  I'm going to have to stop for a moment because I've been sitting here so rigid.  Okay.  I'm getting a catch in my back.  Okay.  Do you want to stand?  Maybe that will--you know, I was an lecturer in black history thanks to Miss [Vivian G.] Harsh .  I had more knowledge than an average Ph.D. when it comes to African-American just from excessive reading.  And I was one of those historians and I was known as a person who didn't mince words.  (Wipes forehead.) I don't mind this being shown, but, you know, it shows me being natural sitting up here talking all this stuff.  Anyway,--(Laughter.)  Richard--Dick O'Leary went out and got Daddy-O Daylie.  He had to get him a name who was the most popular of what you'd call black musicologists on the radio then, jazz specialists.
Story_ID: 8977
Speaker 1: Everyone was expecting a truly explosive racial outburst because of the hurt and anguish over the assassination of Martin Luther King [Jr.].  And on the day of his funeral, people all over the country, the city fathers were trying to design some way of at least a media rating, the impact.  In Chicago [Illinois], Richard O'Leary at Channel 7, ABC, WLS [TV] got a hold of [Holmes] Daddy-O Daylie.  He had to give some names of some people; the disc jockey, musicologists, famous for his community work as well as for his knowledge of jazz and jazz entertainers.  He knew a lot of them.  And we also got Warner Saunders, who was head of the Boy's Club on the west side.  The better--I can't think of the name right now.
Speaker 2: Better Boy's Foundation?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And he put them together, and I think he was supposed to get another gentleman that you have interviewed.  You just called--Herb Kent.  He was supposed to do the show.  Anyway, it ended up with just Daddy-O Daylie and Warner Saunders.  That was Saunders, the anchorman today at Channel 5, his first introduction to TV.  And they sat there all day long.  And it's hard to believe but the name of the show was 'Stop'.  In between, when they would have commercials, a big 'Stop' would flash on the screen, meaning, I guess, reconsider.  And they had a variety of guests, mostly people I think that Daddy-O had been responsible for getting.  I remember seeing, I think, let's see-- Billy Eckstein, Joe Taylor.  And I'm trying to think if not two or three local guys, who happened to be in town.  And they all said the same thing about what Dr. King meant and that he would not want violence, and we heard over and over and over and over that Dr. King was nonviolent.
Story_ID: 8978
Speaker 1: But they also decided [after Martin Luther King, Jr's assassination] that something was going to have to be done in Chicago with TV, which was so Jim Crow that it wasn't even funny.  And so what did they decide to do was to have some regular TV shows with black people.  O'Leary had Daddy-O Daylie, Warner Saunders, and Herb Kent was supposed to show.  Herb didn't show because I understand that there was some antipathy between his station and the one that was sponsoring Daddy-O Daylie .  It could be all rumor.  I don't know.  But they had a meeting and Daddy-O Daylie , God bless him, told me in front that I'm not going to be on any show unless they have a black producer.  And he invited me down there himself.  He also had a black lawyer with him named--a lawyer who's right here in the building with me.  I can't think of his name right now--Bob Tucker--was down there representing Daddy-O.  And at the end of the meeting, when they decided that they were going to have this show, it had the oddest name in the world.  Some of this is almost comical when you look back at it.  They were going to do a show called 'For Blacks Only'.  It would feature Daddy-O Daylie, Warner Saunders.  And that's when Daddy-O said, "What about a black producer?"  Richard O'Leary said, "I don't know of any black producers.  Where you going to find any?"  And Daddy-O said, "Where did you find producers for your TV station?  Television is not all that old."  He said, "We went to radio."  And Daddy-O said, "That's what I thought so I brought a man here who's an expert on radio."  (Laughter.)  And they hired me.  I think my pay eventually was one hundred dollars a week to do that show.  I was willing to do it just to get on.  And we did 'For Blacks Only'.  Warner Saunders, Daddy-O Daylie and it was an hour long.  They had a receptionist in a gorgeous evening gown meeting the guests and giving out little flowers and coffee and this.  All this stuff was abandoned after the tension eased.  And we did an hour long show, and I'm very proud of it.  We had a full band in there on occasions, a full band, meaning a full team of fifteen people.  Some of the best known entertainers to come into the Chicago area was on that show.  I know that because I produced the show.  We had some of the most pronounced, distinguished authors of books.  It was a good magazine show, and I was very proud of it.  Eventually, it siphoned down to one-half hour.  Warner Saunders got a chance at Channel 5 [television], and he started doing a show over there.  I think Channel 5 had a show, too, called 'Common Ground' that went on and on, and on and on.  And that was--this was a general agreement that you had to do something about the racial situation.  Well, I had already been considered a student of African-American history and highly regarded, speaking at colleges around here and churches and public institutions.  Later on, I got a job at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] teaching history.  And then they decided to turn my show into a news show.  Daddy-O decided to leave, and I did it for a while while I was at Northwestern and during the early days at the Chicago Tribune when they heard about my work.
Story_ID: 8979
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I had been elected president of the revered fifty year old Watch Dog Citizens Schools Committee, which was at one time predominantly white.  I'm on the faculty at Northwestern [University].  I'm on the Citizens School Committee, and later on became president.  And I had also done some historical stuff called "The City's Colleges of Chicago' on African-American history.  And I was a lecturing professor, just lectures now at Roosevelt University.  So the rumor was out that the Chicago newspapers were going to have some black columnists on the editorial pages.  I thought at first of going to the [Chicago] Sun-Times, which, presumably, was the more liberal.  And a friend of mine named Walls, Fred Walls, who was a black editor, and a man I had known since I came here because he was once Congressman [William L.] Dawson's secretary.  He was then the editor of the Chicago edition of the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper.  And he said, "No.  Don't go to the Sun-Times because you're not going to get along because they think they know more about black people than you do."  He says, "Try The Tribune.  They are going to have to get some black people."  And I happened to mention this at one of the Chicago Schools Committee's meetings and a woman said, "Well, I know the man who runs the Chicago Tribune.  I think he would be very amenable to hiring a black columnist."  So I go on a lark and, and apply.  I'm at Northwestern teaching now.  So they decided right off the bat to give me a trial.  And I wrote a column on Labor Day once.  I didn't have any idea of what to charge them.  And they liked it.  And I said, "If they like this, well, they haven't seen my best."  Because I wrote this in a hurry.  I almost forgot I had a deadline.  I sat down and knocked out that thing on blacks on Labor Day.  And then they decided to hire me to write--what is it?  Once a month.  I said, "Okay.  My foot's in the door."  And before a month was out hardly, they wanted me to write every week.  And in 1970, I became--it was just like that.  No problem at all.  And I took off from there.
Speaker 2: Now, let's talk about you being an op-ed columnist.  What did you--I mean you got this job relatively easily.
Speaker 1: Because they were ready.  Because they were ready.  (Inaudible.)  But if you could just voice your opinion --
Speaker 2: It was a lot of fun and I was an established writer, thinker and so forth in the black community.  Writing a column never a problem with me with the exception of I could--I could have written every day.  I've always been bubbling over with feelings and attitudes, and that's what a columnist does.  And I enjoyed it and it didn't hurt them.  We got comments.  They sent it out all over the country wherever they would tie it in with other publications.  But I enjoyed it and I became nationally known.
Story_ID: 8980
Speaker 1: Is there any column that you ever regret that you wrote?
Speaker 2: Well, I think one that I could have researched better, one or two, which taught me never to get too cocky.  I know I wrote one on jazz one time and I was in a hurry and I shouldn't have done it because of a death of somebody, and I didn't do the research and I got some names mixed up.  I got an education very early.  Don't get too cocky.  Don't think you know everything.  And always proofread yourself.  I wrote a column that I really regretted where it was just loaded with errors on a football game that was to take place between two black colleges at Soldier's Field.  And I went down the list of who the guys are in professional football who were going to black colleges, and I think two or three of them I just messed up on.  You know, you can't get too self-assured.  But then I took--I discovered something else, too.  That even your best friends can betray you without realizing it.  I took the word of some people that I knew would not mislead me about a certain political meeting that took place, and it was strictly their self-centered interpretation.  And I printed it.  I said, "Now, you're telling me the truth.  Don't mess me up" when they gave me that.  I said, "Did this happen?"  "Oh, yes."  The whole background and about a third of it was a figment of their imagination.

Speaker 1: I'm very happy that I had the chance to attend the big political conventions that took place, and to observe from close hand through the power of the Chicago Tribune, the passes that I got.  I can remember back to the old Associated Negro Press days, all the trickery I had to use even to get on the floor of the political convention.  And now that I had my big powerful Chicago Tribune badges and I'm registered, I was a "bona fide" --quote-end quote--correspondent or reporter.  And to be right in the middle of some of the big decisions that were being made on the floor.  And I was kind of happy that the Tribune had me with my background and my orientation to interpret what I saw, and it reflected itself, I think, in the opinions of a lot of black people and, in particular, it developed toward me one of trustworthiness and accuracy because I was really representing them.
Story_ID: 8982
Speaker 1: But I think one of the most significant contributions that I made was to the election of the first black mayor [of Chicago, Illinois].  It may sound self-serving, but I definitely had an impact.  And I think there's one other person who must be put right at the top and that's Lu [Lutrelle] Palmer [Jr.].  He was on the radio show in three different stations, with what he called 'Lu's Notebook'.  Meanwhile, long before they were anywhere close to getting a candidate, I wrote a column begging people to please start if you're going to have a black mayor to run, to start early.  I gave the dates of the forthcoming [1983] mayoral election.  I think this was two years ahead of time and, intermittently, I urged the public to please get going on the choice of a black mayoral candidate so you wouldn't have 90 running out there muddying up the waters and plants and so forth.  Lu Palmer took it up and agreed, and he started beating the drums on his radio program three times a day on three different radio stations.  It was a powerful weapon.  And it became the talk of the town.  I give myself a little credit for keeping that idea out there alive.  And I was writing during all prior mayoral campaigns for a black mayor.  I was there, and I think I did my part in bringing clarity and analysis and, above all, inspiration and not letting the public go to sleep on the idea.  Our Harold Washington gave me the supreme compliment.  He told one of his, some of his friends that I was his truth squad.  And they did have a campaign of pure lies on him, and I would come back and correct them.  I was quite flattered one night when I was attending an art show I think at the--what was once the library--the Cultural Center downtown.  And Governor [Dan] Walker was there and he said, "I want you to know that your columns had an impact on whites as well as blacks."  He gave one example of how I corrected a mistruth that Harold Washington had been behind in his water tax and water bill, and I came back in my column and showed that he had sold the building.  It was the current owners, the owners that followed him that didn't pay the taxes, didn't pay the water bill.  I used to do that all the time.  And I guess I'm one of the few people who could go into Harold's office without a prior engagement--a--yes, a prior appointment.  We used to say that.  There's one--I wish you could have listened to it a little closer.  Two weeks before he died, I saw Harold on TV sitting in my office at the [Chicago] Sun-Times and when I finished my column, I said, "Geez!  I got to go over and see him."  He looked bloated and swollen up, you know, like he put on too much weight.  And I went over there as though I had something very important for him (chuckles)-- to tell me before I could finish my column.  And I told him, I said, "Harold, lose some weight in a hurry--you're going into bad health, man.  It's not good for your heart."  And I won't tell you the name he called me, but he told me to get the hell out of his office, said I didn't look like a beach boy myself.  (Laughter.)  And that if I wanted to work on somebody, to work on somebody else and don't come barging in here ahead of other people if that's all you got to say.  That was one of the last conversations we had.  But I was committed to what Harold was all about, and that's [Washington's death of a massive heart attack] one of the great tragedies I wish I could have helped to avoid.
Story_ID: 8983
Speaker 1: You moved from the Sun-Times to-- I mean from the [Chicago] Tribune to the [Chicago] Sun-Times around?
Speaker 2: September of 1983.
Speaker 1: Shortly after--
Speaker 2: Shortly after Harold [Washington] was elected.
Speaker 1: And why was that?
Speaker 2: Well, let's face it.  I didn't get along too well with one of the editors over there.  He wasn't too happy about me staying on TV.  You know, I kept my TV show all the time, and he wasn't too happy about that.  I learned something, too, in that relation.  You don't let people antagonize you to make key decisions.  Well, I understand he had it in for a lot of people and shortly after that he was gone.  But the Sun-Times was closer to channel seven than The Tribune, and I would knock out my column and get out of the Sun-Times and be there walking if I didn't have a cab.  I know that sounds silly, but it was much closer.  And then the Sun-Times, thanks to people like Kup, wanted me over there.  It was nice to be wanted sometimes.  When I left Channel Seven [WLS-TV, ABC7], I got the impression that there were people there who didn't want my kind of people around.  I'm being very honest with you.  I kept getting hints that they thought that my type of program should be on public broadcasting, you know, too serious.  But I'm proud of what I did over there.
Story_ID: 8984
Speaker 1: There are young people that I used to pick up in the streets and in schools that I let them co-host my show and it changed their lives.  I could think of one that I just helped celebrate his getting a masters degree at Princeton University.  And--I started with him when he was in the seventh grade.  He was co-host of my show, Lamar McMorris (ph.) is his name.  He's working with Jesse Jackson now.  And when I heard that he was getting his degree from Princeton, after grammar school, high school, college and etc., I got on a plane and went out there and kind of surprised him.  When he saw me sitting there in the audience there close to his parents and he got his masters degree in theology.  And he has told many, many people that I had an impact on him.  And that happens really a lot with young people.  I don't regret any of that.  I just wished that the studio had realized the significance of it and had used it more because we got to save the kids out here.  The same thing with ACTSO [Afro-American Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics, later the NAACP Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics].  I run into somebody it seems every other month.  They introduce me to the kid, and they say, "I was in ACTSO with this man when I was in high school."  (Laughter.)  And all the youngsters would say, "I remember when you gave my eighth grade graduation speech", and here they are introducing me to a kid who was almost ready for the eighth grade.  That's a good feeling.  I mean a really good feeling.
Speaker 2: So you started ACTSO [in 1978]  because of what?
Speaker 1: Well, I saw a need.  For the same reason that I'm starting the Freedom Readers here.  One day, my brother [Dr. Thomas Dunbar Jarrett] and I sat up and talked--and starting recognizing that we had made some exceptional achievements.  We didn't never got to finish the conversation.  My brother was a tremendous person.  I began to ask myself, "How did he come out of a little country town like Paris, Tennessee"--when he came along, they didn't even have a high school [for African Americans].  Not a bona fide separate high school.  One little reception room about the size of a reception room in a dentist office.  And yet, he ends up with a college degree from Knoxville College, a masters degree from Fisk [University] in literature, and a Ph.D. degree in American literature, in Humanities at the University of Chicago.  How the heck did that happen?  And it hit me again in 1954 when I realized that my brother is now in England as a lecturing professor on literature at Oxford University.  And one year, it was late timing as they were telling me, he was chairman of the committee to select Rhodes Scholars.  A black guy being chairman of a committee that selects the Rhodes Scholars in the southeastern part of the country, down South.  Well, something must have taken place.  And then I looked at me.  I said, "What am I doing sitting up here?" One year, it was 1975-- I mean '75 and '76. [1976]  "What am I doing being a genre to help choose the winners of the Pulitzer Prize?"  I'm sitting here deciding on who's going to be the Pulitzer Prize winner of '76 in certain categories.  In '75.  And we started putting it together.  And certainly, anybody who's seen my scores in high school would have to know that I was not one of the prize students except in some courses that I liked.  And my brother was brilliant, but he wasn't a genius.  And I concluded that the thing that is missing today in our community is adult support and adult promotion, adult respect for education among our youth.  I sat there and put it together all the way back--of what made me feel like I could be somebody.  What made me think I could write.  I remember that incident in AME Church when this woman heard my--read my essay, or heard me deliver it and walked over and said, "Your son may not be all that smart in school, but he sure can write.  He's a writer, isn't he?"  And I believed it.  I heard that two or three times and I kept on believing it.  We don't have enough acclaim out here for our kids.  That's to summarize it.  And then I put together all of the interviews that I had with famous black people.  I mean real achievers.  And every one of them came out of dire circumstances, but they had the support and encouragement of other people who were in that same dire situation.  And it seems to me that you got to have somebody with you.  And I think of the progress of black people period.  There was a time when it appeared as though the whole white world was against us with the exception of a few real nice do-good people here and there.  But we had each other.  We were strong on each other.  I mean that group of people, community people who were at the railroad station when my brother went off to college.  I remember because I was a boy.  They were there to send him off to make something out of his life.  And his friend was with him, Oliver Teague from down the street.  As a matter of fact, the community organizations had already given them a big party at a church because one was a valedictorian, Oliver Teague, and my brother was the salutatorian.  They made a big deal out of that.  And I remember when I was writing editorials on my college newspaper, when the people in the community say, "Young man, you--" --the alumni would read the editorials from the [Knoxville College] 'Aurora', my college newspaper--and they would say, "You know what?  You're a very fine writer."  And I got to the place, I just took that for granted--that I was a writer.  I didn't have to guess.  But it didn't come from white people.  If you're going to wait for the outside society to determine whether you were qualified or not, you may wait a long time.  And so I just decided that we needed an organization that celebrated achievement at an early age and made them heroes. So in ACTSO, if you make something of your science project that's sensible and is outstanding, we're going to celebrate you like you're just won the national championship in high school basketball.  The same thing with the dancers and the singers.  Some great kids that come out of our show.  And we got one this year, in the year 2000.  A young man out of New York who was born with a deformed arm, but he has already, I think, today he is ten years ahead of where George Washington Carver was at that age.  This kid has already manufactured a paper plate made from the husk of the wheat, the stuff that you throw away.  He has put it together the way it is now a paper plate and he has a patent on it, and he's a freshman in college.  He did that in high school.  So when we take these kids out to, say, lift-offs we got with NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].  I've been to about three lift-offs myself down in Florida at Cape Canaveral.  Or was it [Cape] Kennedy?  One of them.  We saw [Dr.] Mae Jemison go up.  We had fourteen kids--thirteen--fifteen kids down there and their parents as guests of NASA.  We saw-- I'm trying to think.  Dr.-- was his name Clark?  [Dr. Bernard] Harris [Jr.].  We saw Dr. Harris go up.  He was the first [African American] man to walk in space, and we saw--I forgot the schoolteacher.  There was a schoolteacher that went up, and we've seen about two or three others.  And we visit space centers every year.  And my pay is the enjoyment out of knowing that I'm doing something to help some kids.  You don't have to live long enough to see it.  I just know it because I, I've seen other people live long enough to enjoy it.  And I know that one day some of these kids are going to remember me.
Story_ID: 8985
Speaker 1: Let me ask about Freedom Readers.  Your slogan is you can ride to anywhere--you can't ride to anywhere if you can't read.
Speaker 2: No.  You can't ride to anywhere if you can't read.
Speaker 1: That's what I just said.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: That's one slogan.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: What we are trying to do with Freedom Readers is to not wait too long to fill this gap that young blacks are going to have to have filled soon.  This chasm that separates them from the world of technology.  This society is so technology oriented today, computer oriented that you're going to have to do something to bridge it in a hurry, and you can't go anywhere if you can't read, you know.  Adults who can read have difficulty getting together with computers.  So I'm trying to speed up this reading process, and I think the best way to do that is, once again, to go back to our roots.  I didn't like to read at one time, but thanks to a thing that Carter G. Woodson started called 'Negro History Week', all of us grew up enjoying the poetry of black people.  This was why I was so happy to have seen--Langston Hughes for the first time.  I remember I almost wept in high school when our teacher read 'The Negro Speaks Of Rivers'.  "I've known rivers."  Boy, that knocked me out.  And I had another history teacher that wasn't even a historian, but he would get up and act out Hannibal crossing the Alps on a herd of elephants.  It just made you want to go read about it.  And little by little, I became a reader and we started running around with kids who enjoyed reading and liked to show off what they had read.  And this is what we're doing in Freedom Readers.  In the Freedom Readers, before you can become a member, you got to take a vow that once a month you're going to read aloud.  You don't have to memorize anything.  That will help it.  You have to read aloud once a month to the members of your family, in your church or in your neighborhood, or people next door passages from the great works by or about black people.  So what are they going to do is expand it to all the ethnic groups in Chicago to do the same thing.  Because you got a lot of ignorant Hispanics who don't know a darn thing about the Hispanic history.  And the same thing could apply to white kids. They don't appreciate being white-- enough. They don't have a respect for what--the travails and triumphs of what their own little white society or ancestors went through.  So, consequently, you're going to take the anguish out on black people if you're insecure about yourself.  So what we're doing is making reading enjoyable, especially this facet of the program that I can't wait to get off on when school starts again, and that is where we're going to introduce senior citizens who still have clear minds to just sit down and tell their stories, and let the kids pick out some facets of their lives and write some plays about them.  Use your imagination, write some poems about them, write some essays.  And then we maybe can discover some more writers.  Most of the great people that I have run into who achieved anything have started way back when somebody picked their imagination.  If we can just get kids to imagine things, to fantasize more--you got to be able to fantasize.  When I was a little boy, I used to fantasize conversations with God.  I straightened God out one time when I was a little boy--about what he did wrong.  [laughter]  How can he do this to us?  How do you make-- how do you let somebody be killed in a car wreck?  Or why did you let my little friend die so young?  One of my little buddies died when he was seven years old, I think.  People didn't have enough money to give him a coffin.  The folks in the neighborhood had to make him a coffin, and I talked to God about that.  You know, it was in my mind.  (Laughter.)  But it helps you become creative.  And above all, won a fantasized victory.  You see, you got to fantasize winning.  You watch the basketball player shooting free-throws.  You see how they stand up there and look?  They imagine the ball's going in.  And I have forgotten the guy's name.  I think it's Cornwell-- [Cedric] 'Cornbread' Maxwell, a basketball great.  He used to play in pros with-- maybe the Celtics.  He used to get up there with no ball in his hand and just do this and do that, imagining the ball going in.  I, I think we have too many youngsters today who don't imagine winning, don't imagine overcoming.  And you can do all the hip-hop music you want to and pantomime being bad and being tough.  All it is pantomime--unless you imagining yourself winning and also gaining the tools and the equipment to win.  That's what the Freedom Readers is going to do.  We already are working on it.  We had a show the other day over at the University of Illinois where I'm a senior fellow, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and the chairman of the meeting was 'Dr. W.E.B. DuBois.'  You shoulda seen him!  He sounded just like DuBois, and 'Ida B. Wells' was there, and she's only ten years old, and she had her hair just like Ida B. Wells and dress, and she stood up there and she became Ida B. Wells.  We had another young man to deliver Paul Robeson's college graduation speech.  And before it was over with, he got into it.  My first grade teacher [Jenny Booker] had me imagining that I was Frederick Douglass when I couldn't even read.  And she also had me imagining, believe it or not, that I was a publisher at The Chicago Defender, Robert S. Abbott, and I couldn't even read the paper.  But they started young.  I suspect that that's my interest in journalism right there, first grade, and didn't know it.
Story_ID: 8986
Speaker 1: You were one of the founders of NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists].  What is the importance of that organization?
Speaker 2: Well, we started it in order to have some means of communication between us, those few of us who were in journalism, and also to protect us.  And to protest, if necessary.  And to communicate.  All of the victories that black people have scored were collective victories.  How are you going to have a victory if you don't communicate?  The doctors get together, don't they?  The dentists have associations.  Everybody had an association but the black journalists.  So twenty-five years ago, we decided to have us a black journalist organization in Washington.  My neck is giving me a fit now.  You just messed with me so bad it's pitiful
Speaker 1: Okay.  Go quickly.  Then--Why have the journalists not joined force with the newspaper owners to really have more (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Well, they are two sets of people.  Why--? You got--that's like saying why haven't they joined force with us.  Nobody's deliberately trying to keep away from somebody else.  Nobody has ever asked them to join forces.  That big-- the biggest grievance I think that you might have against the black journalists is we have gotten so big.  And it's hard to handle bigness. We got three thousand members.  It's hard to keep track of three thousand members.  And--if you just do your part with those three thousand, you've done marvelously well.  That's like saying why, why aren't the doctors and the dentists all on one team.
Story_ID: 8987
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I'm--I just want my legacy to be that I was very good at what I tried to do, and that I always was amenable to whatever action is required to advance my people, meaning black people.  I didn't ask for this situation.  Ordinarily, I would say the human race, but also the human race--and civilization.  But I can't ever eliminate the feeling that I have obligation to do what I can wherever I can to advance the cause of African-Americans.
Speaker 1: And why do you--
Speaker 2: And, and--let me add this.  That is not the thought of being pro-civilization, pro-humanization, pro-black.  They're not mutually exclusive.  You can be all three at the same time.
Story_ID: 8988
Speaker 1: Why do you think you were so effective as a journalist, as a columnist?
Speaker 2: Because I put my commitment into it.  I don't ever want to do anything I'm not committed to anymore in life. Unless--you know, I used to take jobs and I'd say, "This is temporary.  I'm not going to be here long."  But that's over.  Anything that I go into, I do it with emotion, too, and commitment, and even a willingness to gamble on losing.  But somebody's got to do it.
Story_ID: 8989
Speaker 1: I started out by asking you what values are most important to you.
Speaker 2: Well, I believe everybody is supposed to sit down and think of values.  But to establish your hierarchy of values, let's say that whatever I do has got to be pro-humanity.  I think you have to, at some point, not necessarily forget race and gender, and country and all like that.  You try to make some sort of assessment of where you fit in as a human being in this world.  You know, if all of these other attributes or conditions disappeared, you would still be a person.  What is expected of you as a human being?  Because you don't go on instincts like animals and lower creations are.  Their thing is instinctively to perpetuate the human-- the race of the species and to die for it.  There's some insects that begin to die for their young as soon as they're born.  I got a little play I'm writing called 'The Mother Spider'.  That spider, the mother spider's whole life is devoted to the little baby spiders feeding off her back as though that's all you're here to do is reproduce and to protect.  The most vicious dog on earth is a female dog protecting another dog.  I'm speaking of German Shepherds now, they--this business of the perpetuation of species is central.  But mine is not just the perpetuation of the species, but the enhancement of the human species.  Because we are limited.  You can add all the spiritual stuff that you want to, and that's good.  I think we should use every bit of our--every ounce of our imagination to communicate with whomever and whatever we think is God or God-given.  But we shouldn't ever use what we have created as a cop-out.  We invent gods instead of gods inventing us.  We invent gods if we're not careful.  And sometimes we order those gods around to do damage to each other. So I just can't swallow that but so much, I believe that every in-, creative and inventive force in our being should be dedicated... (End of tape.).
Story_ID: 8990
Speaker 1: You know, I think at some point in everybody's life there should be an assessment of what is the most significant thing that they can do.  And sometimes you can arrive at a conclusion with the enhancement of your religious concepts.  But if you don't have a clear-cut religious concept, there are still--there are still high points of what you have already observed in the human animal experience that can give you some kind of key or cue as to what we are about.  We are animals.  And there's one thing basic about all animal life is they insist on the perpetuation of the species.  They do everything they can to keep the species going and alive, their particular species.  We are the human species.  For example.  They play the numbers game, animals, all life.  A fish will expel what?  Millions of eggs in order for just a few -- a handful to survive.  Some mothers of some species indicate a willingness to die immediately in order to protect or enhance the young.  Is it necessary for me to repeat the mother spider thing?  You got that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I have made some assessments of my life and I know that there are some things that I can't know.  When I was a kid, maybe not old enough to be quite in school, I asked my Sunday School teacher who was God's father.  And I didn't realize I was making a profound statement then.  She became angry at me and she said, "It's God, the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost.  That's all you need to know", and reported me to my parents.  Then I made a mistake and asked her, "Okay.  Well, who was God's grandfather?"  And even today, if science discovered by some impossible-- (Laughter.)  -- by some impossible research that there is a God--"We found God." --you haven't found the answer.  The question still arises, Who made God?  Who's God's grandfather?  So we'll never, ever, ever be able to know.  If science today discovered the boundaries of the universe, then the quintessential question must arise.  You found the boundaries.  What's on the other side?  There are some things human beings simply cannot ever yet get at in terms of an eternal truth and make it stick.  So what do we do?  We use our inherent capacity to create and to understand, and we envision our gods.  Sometimes we make gods in our image rather than God making us in his or her image.  We're human and so, consequently, we have the capacity to always want to ask questions and to research, and to investigate, but we will never know all of the ultimate answers.  So that's why we create faith, and we die for faiths.  We kill for faiths.  The faiths that we think have been ordained for us, and we do it with conviction, and this is how we keep going.  I am never going to know the ultimate answers and be sure about it.  So what do I do?  I have to copy much from what I see and make myself one of those people dedicated to the advancement of the human species.  Not only to just advance, but to become enhanced and improved continually.
Story_ID: 8991
Speaker 1: Then there is another imposition forced upon me that I didn't ask for, and that is to do something about the racial question which I am a part of, a victim of and certainly an extension of.  So this is where I make race very primary in my outlook on life. Despite all else, race is still primary, and this is what I and this generation, maybe in generations to come, it will be eliminated.  But I have to work on that, and that's the conclusion I reached when I became a newspaper person.  That I was committed to the advancement of people.  I'm not going to do something in the name of race or anything else that's not going to be--that's going to be anti-human.  But race is here and right now I am being forced to make it primary.
Speaker 2: Let me ask you one last question, and that is what are your hopes for the black race?
Speaker 1: I could become wallowed in despair.  When I look at something that didn't even enter the picture when I came to Chicago to be a journalist, I never thought that AIDS would come in and take more lives than imperialism has taken.  I never thought of that.  Another factor that I should have given more credence to that is evident now, that the tendency to oppress other people for your own benefit is not a chief characteristic of just white people.  That all of us are susceptible to selfishness and exploitation, and it's evident today in Africa.  It's evident today in Chicago where we have hundreds of African-Americans who do not hesitate to sell narcotics to other African-Americans including little children.  And we are the biggest suckers in the world if we assume that liberation means liberation only from white oppression.  The dictators you see in some parts of South Africa, we should have seen it long before --South, I don't mean South Africa--I'm sorry--in Africa.  It was evident during the fight against apartheid.  The propagators of apartheid bought off black leaders in South Africa, and had them violently fighting--the avant guard of South African racism.  People turned against each other.  When you look at what South Africa did in Angola--they gave the money and the equipment and the armaments to the blacks who were left on the outside to fight.  Because they, they knew Angolan government.  All you have to do today is look at Rwanda --it ought to change your mind about oppression being strictly a white thing.  You can use all the rationalizations you want to, but we are, or should be at total war against just oppression, period and exploitation, period.  And look at the way some religions treat women.  I'm still unsettled about the way-- the caste system in India.  You throw off the British and yet you have some Untouchables.  So the battle never ends.  And as we grow with more sophistication and knowledge, and understanding, we'll be closer to--well, what?  One day the millennium, huh?  (Laughter.)  But we should never stop.
