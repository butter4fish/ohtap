Story_ID: 482669
Speaker 1: All right, let's talk about your, your family. Tell me your mother's name.
Speaker 2: My [adoptive] mother's name was Eliza Stone [Eliza Stone Weaver].
Speaker 1: Eliza, spell it for me.
Speaker 2: E-L-I-Z-A, Stone, S-T-O-N-E, Weaver, W-E-A-V-E-R.
Speaker 1: And do you know when she was born?
Speaker 2: My mother was born March the 4th. She was born 19- '95 [sic.] because my [adoptive] father [Chalmers Weaver] was born in 1985 [sic.], okay.
Speaker 1: In, in 1895 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eighteen.
Speaker 1: Eighteen?
Speaker 2: Eight- 1895, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born I think at Webster Groves, Missouri.
Speaker 1: In Missouri, okay. Do you remember your grandparents, her parents?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember them. But there was a little remark that my mother told me about. She said when I was one, she said I jumped up and was running to my grandfather who at that time would've been eighty-one. Unfortunately, he had died. And she said it sort of frightened her to death because she said I actually thought I saw him. But I--evidently I didn't or I thought I saw him, but it was just strange.
Speaker 1: Do you remember their names? Do you know their names?
Speaker 2: Yes, his name was Frank Stone and her name was Martha Stone, my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Did your mother share any stories about, about them or their ancestors, where they came from?
Speaker 2: I really--it's a little hard for me to remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She probably did. But there is a book here that I have that's from Webster Groves and it has some of the information in it about my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that is where my relatives, a lot of my aunts lived when I was growing up. And I used to go out there. It was like the suburbs of St. Louis [Missouri] and I used to go out there for summer vacations. In fact, we used to have our family reunions out there because they had like over an acre of land. And my cousin, the last one in my family, she's almost a hundred, she still lives on the property now in Webster Groves.
Speaker 1: In Webster Groves?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you--do you know how they acquired the land?
Speaker 2: No, I really don't.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: No. It might be in the book that I have.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: But I really don't know how.
Speaker 1: And do you know anything about their heritage whether there were marriages with Indians [Native Americans] or, or whites?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know, but there is a lot of mixture within my family 'cause my mother looked like she was a Jew. She was very, very fair and had gray eyes and very long beautiful hair. And then they, they went on down. All of my, my, my--there was eleven girls and one boy in the family and all of my aunts were fair, most of them. So I think my mother said there was something like some Indian blood, there was some Caucasian blood and different things within the family, but whether or not because, well everybody said I came out too, so whatever (laughter), one of those things.
Story_ID: 482670
Speaker 1: And so tell me about your [adoptive] father. What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Chalmers, C-H-A-L-M-E-R-S, Chalmers Lamarr Weaver [Chalmers Weaver], L-A-M-A-R-R, Weaver.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm not certain but I think he was born in Tennessee. I, I, I really think that's where he's--where he was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Memphis [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I'm pretty certain of it.
Speaker 1: And you said he was born when? In 18- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was born in 19--
Speaker 1: Eighteen--
Speaker 2: What'd I say my, my, my mother [Jordan's adoptive mother, Eliza Stone Weaver] was '95 [1895]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: He was born in '85 [1885].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Eighteen eighty-five [1885].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I know it was ten years. One was--one was '85 [1885] and one was '95 [1895].
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. And what about your grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: I know nothing about them.
Speaker 1: Nothing, okay.
Speaker 2: I know he had a brother [Lewis Weaver] and a sister [Helena Weaver] that I met, but I don't know--very little do I know about either one of them or the grandparents at all.
Story_ID: 482671
Speaker 1: Tell me more about your mother [Jordan's adoptive mother, Eliza Stone Weaver]. Tell me what type of mother she was and, and about your relationship.
Speaker 2: She was stout and heavy and my father [Jordan's adoptive father, Chalmers Weaver] said when they married said she wore five and a half shoe and she was 118 pounds, but she was a very stout lady. And I--she was a--the typical mother type, mother, mother type. 'Cause I used to--as a kid, we lived upstairs and we had a, a big window and I--she used to sit at that window all the time and look out. And I used to come in from school and sit on her lap. That was my favorite spot and we used to talk. And she was, really she was a, a, a very, very loving person, just--I don't know how to explain my mother. I'll, I'll put it like this, too. She was strictly the mother type because she would spank you. At that time, they did spankings (laughter) with the children which they need to do now, but my last spanking was when I was seven years old, but I was out and I can understand right now today why my mother spanked me. I was out late playing school out and I was the only child, so when I came in, she gave me a nice little whipping because she used to use the switches from our backyard that she used to--one of those things that she would, switch them. But outside of that, that was it. She didn't whip--she didn't whip me anymore. But she was just a charming--she was a charming lady. In fact, when my father, when my father died, I was in show business at the time, and I came home and then I felt that I should start taking care of her and, and have her live with me, so she moved out to California. I was living in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] at the time 'cause I wasn't married but she did stay there during the time that Louis [Louis Jordan] and I married, that I did get married 'cause she was at my wedding and, in fact, that was her last time, she did see me married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause we took her to Hawaii for a trip and, boy, that was the icing on the cake for her 'cause she--oh, she loved it. She said it was just thrilling for her. Actually, my mother and I, too, became closer after my father died because my father and I were very, very close 'cause we'd do a lot of things together, like bowl together and all this. And he was a dentist around St. Louis [Missouri] and we would hang out together. In fact, he bought my first cigarettes. He bought me--would take me out nightclubbing with my girlfriends when I was a teenager. He--and they, neither one of them drank or smoked, my parents, but I don't know, we just sort of hung out together, daddy and I. 'Cause, you know, anybody wanted to go out, we would say, "Okay, let's go out," said--I--so, I said, "Okay, I'll get Doc to take us out," because he was watching over us but yet and still he'd pick up the bill, so we--this was when we were teenagers (laughter), of course, so it was really nice. So my mother and I became much closer after she--after my father passed, you know, and it's really like good friends, too, after that.
Speaker 1: How much education did your mother and father have?
Speaker 2: Well, my father went through college and he--as I said, he was a dentist and my mother, I think she finished high school, yeah. That's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother and father met?
Speaker 2: You know, I think they told me once but I have forgotten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I'm up there in age. I just had my (laughter) birthday this year, so, please, I--my memory, I think my memory's pretty good to be eighty years old, but (laughter), but I really, I really--they--I'm sure she told me because she used to tell me a lot of stories when I was growing up as a kid. But I, I, I probably just didn't, 'cause I know she used to say they used to dance a lot and they were--they were both members of like bridge clubs and things 'cause I used to go to some of the meetings as a kid; my mother used to take me. But they never--my mother had one drink and, boy, she used to play the cards. You could tell, uh-oh, that one drink went to her head 'cause she hit those cards down on the table like crazy. But my father never--he never drank anything.
Story_ID: 482672
Speaker 1: Tell me about where you grew, grew up, about the community in which you lived.
Speaker 2: St. Louis [Missouri] was very prejudice at the time. But, in our community, we had--anything or any place to go, we had the biggest black nightclub in the world. We had movies that were absolutely fantastic. These were all black owned for blacks. In fact, sometimes I wonder about with the discrimination [sic. desegregation], I can understand I'm very happy about it, but sometimes I think it broke--it sort of took away from what the blacks at that time owned. And I hate that word and I'm saying it myself. Because growing up, anytime a Negro would say or was, was called black especially by a Caucasian, we were ready to fight. Then all of the sudden after a few years, I come out of high school [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri] and I said, my gracious, black is beautiful. I said that's a lie. I said we are very hypocritical to do all of this. And everybody now is talking about black is beautiful and that's been a word that I don't know I have--too, I have disliked for a long time, although I'm saying it also. And it's really--I'm going against my grain, really.
Speaker 1: Say--well, African American is fine.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I'll have to start saying. But, see, I grew up with the Negro, colored--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --fact at the time and I always thought that it was not a bad saying to say Negro and why they wanted to change it every time you turn around, we were being called something else. And why are we being called something--I've been to Africa twice. They don't really want us to be called Afro-Americans. I mean, let's face it. We're (laughter), we're--the majority of us are not from Africa and I think the country is fabulous, you know. But, for--this is just opinions. So it's just that--I just don't like the word black and I'm not--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm gonna try not to use it again. It's just--it--a habit now of saying it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, about the community, you were--
Speaker 2: The community, as I said, it was very prejudice. But coming up, like, they really--and the stores downtown, they didn't mind you trying on the clothes. It wasn't quite that prejudice. You could not go to the theaters, to the movies or this, that, and the other. My mother [Jordan's adoptive mother, Eliza Stone Weaver] went to a theater one time. The--they had legit shows because she's very fair and all this, well she could pass. But she only went once 'cause she wanted to see this play. I went once just for the fun of it, my girlfriend and I 'cause we, we could--you know, at the time we could pass, but not often. But we had everything we needed ourselves in our own community, so we really didn't need to go to the theaters. And that's why I was saying about discrimination I think put a lot of our, our families out of business because of it. I'm very happy that it happened, but yet, and still because I've been to a lot of cities that had such great hotels and things that, that are--Negroes, Afro-Americans owned that were just absolutely fabulous, but as soon as discrimination came in, they stopped and they lost all--the, the--our--you know, our race lost all of this because everybody decided to go to the Caucasian hotels and the Cauca- the white hotels now, which was more expensive and all this. They should've stayed with their own race. That's what the Jews did. We couldn't go on Miami Beach [Florida]. The Jews couldn't go on Miami Beach. The Jews got together and said, "Okay, we'll buy the beach." That's why Afro-Americans could start going on the beach in Miami Beach. They could go to the hotels and things because the Jews got together and said, "We'll buy it." So--and that was the way they got--we have never gone in with each other and said we'll buy something. We need to. We got enough of us that are multimillionaires and things. We just don't trust each other. That is the facts of life and it's just too bad, it really is because we have so much going for us. That's just in my opinion (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've gotta get out of the way. But our community really--because I was a professional person's [Jordan's adoptive father, Chalmers Weaver] daughter, our community was--it was very prejudiced, but I had--I was able to have an education.
Story_ID: 482673
Speaker 1: I could've gone to any college that I wanted to go to. Unfortunately, I wanted to be in show business.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was in a dancing group in high school [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri] and I don't know--we used to do--it started with the Y Circus; that was what it was called. Every year, we had a show called the Y Circus. It came from the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] and this gentleman, Mr. Cook [James E. Cook], he was Reverend--well, mister--well, he was Reverend Cook, too, 'cause he had a, a church, but he was the head of the YMCA in St. Louis [Pine Street YMCA, St. Louis, Missouri]. And this--his daughter and I grew up together, Marietta [Marietta Mitchell]. She and I were very, very close. But they used to have a show called the Y Circus. Every year in St. Louis [Missouri]--while I was in high school--for the four years I was in high school, I know it was going on 'cause I was in it for the four years. Because I was in a dance group called the Rhythmic Club for the four years of the Y Circus. And we used to have--the first half of the show, it was a regular show at their--at the auditorium [Municipal Auditorium, St. Louis, Missouri], the big auditorium in St. Louis, downtown, the first half, whole half of the show, was nothing but kids. It was like the kids from the Y, the kids from the high- from the grade schools up until the kids from the high schools. I happened to be in the high school, with the high school kids, so we either closed the first section or opened the second. The second half was always whoever was the biggest Afro-American performer at the time of the age at that time, they were the closing act. They were the acts for the whole half of section after the intermission, so it was the big stars.
Speaker 2: Like who?
Speaker 1: Well, let's put it like--the first one I did was with Fats Waller. Nobody remembers Fats Waller, but he was fabulous. Then, the next year they had Jimmie Lunceford. Then, they had--I know I worked with Nat Cole [Nat King Cole], my late husband, Louis Jordan, and a lot of other smaller acts at the time like the Miller Brothers and Lois. They were a tap group who were absolutely fantastic. The- they would have--like Hortense Allen [Hortense Allen Jordan] at the time had this show, she had the chorus girls at the Plantation [Plantation Club; Palladium, St. Louis, Missouri] 'cause I was--finally when I got in, my [adoptive] parents [Eliza Stone Weaver and Chalmers Weaver] finally agreed, then I worked with her at the Plantation. But during this time, it was at the Y Circus, but she would have the chorus girls from the club, Plantation. That was a white owned club, but they had a whole black show, a whole Afro-American show. In fact, that's where Na- I first met Nat Cole. He had the, the King Cole Trio. And I'm trying to think, who else--oh, there was a number 'cause I still have all of my--most of my programs.
Story_ID: 482674
Speaker 1: I wanna go back because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.
Speaker 1: --we haven't talked about elementary school yet. (Cough) Excuse me. The people and the professions of the people that lived in the--in the community, you said your father [Jordan's adoptive father, Chalmers Weaver] was a professional person, who were the other people in the communities?
Speaker 2: Doctors, mostly doctors and attorneys, and all those were my friends. The kids were my friends.
Speaker 1: Okay. Tell me where you went to elementary school.
Speaker 2: Simmons [Edward J. Simmons School, St. Louis, Missouri]. That was my last elementary school. My first one was Marshall [John Marshall Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri], when I first went into elementary school.
Speaker 1: Do you remember anything about the teachers or about the school? With--
Speaker 2: Well, I remember an incident when I was in Marshall. I was a kid--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That this little boy used to pull my hair so much, my parents [Jordan's adoptive parents, Eliza Stone Weaver and Chalmers Weaver] had to go talk to his parents about it, but that, that just lasted a while and then that was over with.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But then when I went to Simmons, I remember that we did--we were into maypole dancing at that time, and they don't have that I don't think anymore. In fact, I have some pictures in my book that--when I wear--the, the maypole dancing around which I, I don't even remember hardly how to do it. And I have never seen it done after, since that. I really haven't.
Speaker 1: What about the teachers?
Speaker 2: The teachers, I, I, I was--really, I was a excellent student if I had opened a book. Because the teachers--I--let's put it like this. I skipped a grade 'cause I graduated from grade school when I was twelve and I went into high school--my parents weren't too happy but they said, okay, it was all right. I went into high school, so I finished high school when I was sixteen. But in grade school, I'm trying to think if Miss- there was one teacher that I was really crazy about in grade school and high school. I'm trying to think, Judy Davis [ph.] I think was her name in high- in grade school. But Miss Dixon [ph.]--no, that was grade school, too, was Miss, Miss Dixon, so it was two teachers that I liked, Miss Davis and Miss Dixon, in grade school, that's who it was.
Speaker 1: And did they inspire you, encourage you? Why did you like them?
Speaker 2: Because I learned from them (laughter). I don't know, it was just the way they taught I guess that I learned more. 'Cause, like I said, I would not study and I--everybody--I--they said I was very smart but I wouldn't study. Had I been--I could've graduated, what is it, cumma [sic. cum laude], if I had opened a book, let's put it like this (laughter). But I--especially in high school. I would've made A's and--well, I, I, I had good grades, but I just didn't make the honor roll and all this that I should have made.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was a good student.
Speaker 1: Was the school integrated or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --all, all African Americans?
Speaker 2: It's all, all Afro-Americans. We only had two schools, two high schools at that time for us in St. Louis [Missouri]. That was Vashon [Vashon High School, St. Louis, Missouri] which was like in the downtown area and that was like--let's put it like this. The downtown area at that time was like Watts would be in Los Angeles [California] in comparison. Okay and then where I went, Sumner [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri], they called it The Ville [St. Louis, Missouri]. It was--it was, in comparison, it was like you're going--well, let's say in Los, Los Angeles, and I guess I'm saying Los Angeles because I know it better, it would be like Watts would be downtown for Vashon and Los- Los Angeles High School [Los Angeles, California] would be like what Sumner represented in St. Louis. So they were just, you know, opposite schools.
Speaker 1: So which high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I went to Sumner, which we, we call, in The Ville. And we would have our football and basketball games and all this would be between the two schools. So, Thanksgiving games and all of that would be, you know, the thing, the rival between Sumner and Vashon. That was the big rival times.
Story_ID: 482675
Speaker 1: Did you take music or dance lessons when you were in elementary (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In high school [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: No, I take that back.
Speaker 1: In elementary--
Speaker 2: When I was a kid, pardon me, I took dancing lessons when I grew up--when I was like growing up, like, three, four, five, about four or five years old from a lady. She had a school called Miss Franklin [ph.]. She had a dancing school that most of us went to and I'm not gonna say--Afro-Americans went (laughter). And we took tap and ballet from her.
Speaker 1: Was she African American?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Everybody was Afro-American. I take that back. I did have a, a Caucasian lady, Miss Schott [ph.]. She was my piano teacher. She would come to the house. She was German. I guess I didn't think about that. Oh, you're making me remember, yeah. And I took piano lessons for a certain time and then when I was in high school, I told my mother [Jordan's adoptive mother, Eliza Stone Weaver], what is the point? What was wrong with me--I wouldn't concentrate enough to read music. I'd learn a song and I memorize it so my teacher would come, I would--I was playing it for everybody, but I would not read music. So finally, they said, "You know what, that's a waste of money." I said, "You're right." Today, of course, I regret it (laughter) 'cause I wished I did. I do know notes, though. I can play--I--to this day because of that. I do--I can read notes. I know notes that--enough that I can sort of tinkle it, you know, but I'm--I kind of wish today that I had gone on it, really did it right.
Story_ID: 482676
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, this was right at the time of the Depression [Great Depression]. Did your family feel the effects of the oppression--the Depression?
Speaker 2: If they did, I never did, let's put it like that. Because as a child and the only child, I guess all I had to do was ask and I think I was--they told me I was spoiled but I don't feel like I did. But they said my father [Jordan's adoptive father, Chalmers Weaver] spoiled me 'cause I was the first kid on the block to have skates. I was the first one on the block to have a bicycle. Because most of the kids on my block, I lived--we lived on one block. It was just nothing but kids. And we had a park in the center, so everybody knew each other and I had some very, very close friends there that actually we grew up together. It was three other girls. They were older than I, I, but now--well, they were. We still--in fact, one's living and we're friends today. The others, other two have passed. But we stayed friends for all that time all through the years until they passed. And this last one, Connie [ph.], is in St. Louis [Missouri], and unfortunately, she has Alzheimer's, too, so I'm really the only one in the way of speaking left. But we have always remained good friends, are best friends.
Story_ID: 482677
Speaker 1: So, now, besides piano lessons and, and dancing lessons, did you attend the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] for other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't, okay.
Speaker 2: No, that was in the downtown area and I just--we didn't live that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That--down that way.
Speaker 1: Were there any other extracurricular activities?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in the Girl Reserves [Girl Reserves of the Young Women's Christian Association]. And what did we do really (laughter)? I can't remember what we did.
Speaker 1: Was that like the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America]?
Speaker 2: Almost, yeah. It was similar to the Girl Scouts, but it wasn't really the Girl Scouts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I'm just trying to think what else. There was a community center that they had in St. Louis [Missouri] that they finally built for swimming 'cause nobody never could--knew how to--learned how to swim. Vashon [Vashon High School, St. Louis, Missouri] had a swimming pool, Sumner [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri] didn't. So, therefore, very few, few people that went to Sumner learned how to swim. But they had activities, like they had the different clubs that you join in school like the tennis club, the glee club, different things that you would learn these activities at school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they finally built a community center out they call in The Ville [St. Louis, Missouri] where you could swim, so we were taking swimming lessons there, although I never became a very good swimmer, but at least we, we were able to swim there, you know (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 482678
Speaker 1: So, tell me about family life. You were an only child. Tell me about being an only child.
Speaker 2: Family life was absolutely lovely with me. When I was in--at Simmons [Edward J. Simmons School, St. Louis, Missouri], in grade school, a couple of the girls there, I don't know if I could say they were jealous or something, but they kept kidding me about being adopted, which I never felt any different whatsoever in my home. So one day I was sitting on my mother's [Jordan's adoptive mother, Eliza Stone Weaver] lap, as I said, by the window. So I mentioned it to her and she wanted to know who told me. They--she explained it and I don't know--when I found this out, I felt no different and I almost ignored it. And then growing up as a teenager in high school [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri], I noticed there was a lady that would always come to visit us. She was from out of town, but I would call her aunt, like Aunt Canary, that was what I--not aunt, Cousin Canary [ph.]. My mother always had me put a handle on people's names when I, you know, talked to them which my friends do right to this day, which is very good for the kids and they need to learn that, to always put, you know, until they get grown and I--they grow up. So I would call her and whenever she was in town, she would visit us. Well, she was always dressed sharp. Well, that was my thing. I must've been a fanatic, clothes fanatic, because growing up, I did. I--my mother and I would go to the store and I'd get--I did have everything that I wanted as a child, I really did. I cannot say that I didn't, and I guess I was just really blessed. And I'm thankful to this day and I thank God to this day of the family that I had. But when she would come, it was like, "Oh, this is a holiday and Canary is here," this, that, and the other. "Oh, she looks so sharp. She has furs on, she has this." I was just--admired her. As I grew up and as I got in show business, this is a little ahead of my time, but I found out later in life that--and I was at her house one time in, in, in Plainsfield, in New Jersey [sic. Plainfield, New Jersey], and she told me that she was my mother. That was it. For some reason, 'cause I had never wanted to meet--I never asked who she was. I never asked who my mother was. All my mother--my mother that raised me, all she told me when she--when I finally asked is she said, "Yes, Canary is your mother, your bio- biological mother," said, "we do not know who your father was." Now, what I found out that he was a white band leader. I said maybe this was why my entree to show business because I wanted to be a dancer so bad or I wanted to be in show business so bad. I never asked her, which I am very sorry now, when she told me because I didn't think to ask her because my whole feeling, at least I liked her as a friend, but my whole feeling for her changed. I was very sorry about that and I asked God, wonder--I wonder why that happened, but unfortunately, she died so I could not make any kind of remands or anything, but I felt no feeling at all, no love, no feeling, no like, no anything for her after that. We could not be friends. We could not be anything after that. And it was really too bad because it was--she--you know, she was a friend and I'm sorry that I didn't ask her. Well, actually, speaking, and not really, I guess, deep down in my heart (laughter), I'm not really sorry, although it would've been nice to know. But that was the thing, but I never--I never told anyone. Very few people in my life growing up ever knew that I was adopted, so I decided to put it in my book because--when I wrote my book ['The Debutante that Went Astray: An Autobiography of Martha, Mrs. Louis Jordan,' Martha Jordan and Edith A. Coleman]. It was about show business--
Story_ID: 482679
Speaker 1: How did the girls in high school [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri] know that you were adopted?
Speaker 2: That, I have never understood. I have never, and I never knew. But--well, this one girl said that her family knew, so I don't know if Canary [ph.] was a friend of her family's. That would be the only way that I would know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Have known, 'cause she did know a lot of people in St. Louis [Missouri]. She was originally from St. Louis, so she did know a lot of people, so that could've been, that she knew people, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause she came to the Riviera [Club Riviera, St. Louis, Missouri] once to see me when I danced. That was a big club in St. Louis and she came with friends, and they knew, and that's when I told her, don't ever come and see me again, when she said--when this woman that was with her, said, "Well after all, she's your mother." I said, "No she isn't," and I walked away, and that was the last time I saw her.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, let's go back to high school.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now, outside of that little incident and that life--part of my life, it was over with and that was it. And this was my mother [Jordan's adoptive mother, Eliza Stone Weaver] that I was talking to, that sat at the window all the time. She was the one that raised me, she was the one that I loved, and she was the one that loved me. And that was the only mother that I knew.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And father [Jordan's adoptive father, Chalmers Weaver].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And they both were marvelous, marvelous people, and I loved them dearly and they loved me. I was their child. And my whole family, like I said, the loving--her, her family, the sisters [Mauddell Stone and Beulah Stone] and her one brother [Hugh Stone, Sr.]--in fact, my mother and father raised her brother's child. He lived with us when he was a teenager and he was like a brother to me. And my only uncle who, he was crazy about me and he was an alcoholic (laughter), bless his heart, but he was crazy about me. He lived in Chicago [Illinois] with his wife and he was crazy about me 'cause we were--really, Hugh [Hugh Stone, Jr.] and I, his son and I were like--raised like brothers and sisters and--until he finally got out and married, but it was a long time. But we were--we were--in fact, his kids now, his one son and I, we still keep in touch with each other. He's in California.
Story_ID: 482680
Speaker 1: So, now we are back in high school [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you, you told me that you went to high school at age twelve.
Speaker 2: I did. And I graduated at sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay. Tell me about your high school years. Was--what was significant about high school?
Speaker 2: Fabulous. I had a ball. I have a ball all the time (laughter). I had a very good time and I had a lot of friends. In fact, we got a fad in high school, it was a bunch of us, and at that time--during that time, they were wearing these short dresses and everything, so we had a fad that we decided one day we were gonna come to high school in pants. So it was about--I have a picture in that book, in my--in my album now of us. It was in the paper. That's where it was taken out of. I think it was about six or eight of us and we all decided to come to school in pants. So we came and we were all on the steps, so when the counselor--she's not the vice principal 'cause the principal was Mr. Brantley [George Brantley] and the vice principal, Miss Woods [ph.], she was like the counselor, girls counselor. She called us all in the office. So me and my big mouth, I said, "Well, wouldn't you prefer seeing us in pants instead of the very short, short skirts?" She honestly said, "Yes I would," so we had no problems. We didn't get in any trouble. So from that day on, it was a fad. The kids started wearing pants in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we did start a fad in high school (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Wearing slacks.
Speaker 1: So that was something, that girls always wore dresses to school.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, always.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dresses and short skirts, yeah, they were dresses and short--and we always wore dresses. But that was--that, that was what we started was the, the, wearing the slacks in high school.
Story_ID: 482681
Speaker 1: Your family at home, because you had such a love for, for music, what were you listening to on the radio?
Speaker 2: I was--I don't know. We used--oh, well, during that time of year, Glenn Miller was popular.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sinatra [Frank Sinatra]. I think Sinatra's always been popular, I don't know. Who else was coming up? Oh, as I said, because of the Y Circus, Nat King Cole, Louis Jordan, my late husband. He was popular during that time 'cause we used to come--he used to come to the dances. We used to have the dances in the school when everybody used to play Louis. In fact, I went to school with Chuck Berry who is now very popular, I mean rock and roll. And Louis used to come there and Chuck--he--Chuck got--he started because of Louis Jordan coming to high school to play dance music and we used to listen to music, Louis' music a lot, you know. 'Cause when--in, in St. Louis [Missouri] with the--we had the Riviera Club [Club Riviera, St. Louis, Missouri]. That's why a lot of the black entertainers would come 'cause that was the biggest nightclub in the world and it was owned by a black man. And they--he would have the, the biggest--big audi- audie- the big entertainers to come to the Riviera 'cause it was huge, and that was one of our big let outs. Well, I was sixteen but when some of the big artists came, I sort of talked--like I said, talked to my father [Jordan's adoptive father, Chalmers Weaver] into taking some of us which he would. Because at that time, they really didn't--it was not a strict thing, you know, especially if you came with a parent. It was not that strict that they would not let you in. Now, you wasn't drinking much, you know, all that during those days, but yet still, you could get in at the time. They weren't as strict as they are now, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As long as you came with a parent. But all the big entertainers, like a lot of black entertainers were playing at that time and we used to go catch them and go see them, so all their records were out. And when I had parties, I used to have their records and all that.
Story_ID: 482682
Speaker 1: Tell me about your parties, at your house?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I'd have parties at the house, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about one of them.
Speaker 2: God, I can't remember (laughter). It's been so long ago. Oh, boy.
Speaker 1: Did you like to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'd just have all of my friends over and we'd have punch, you know, ice cream and cake. I think that's why I despise ice cream and cake. I live in a fifty-five thing community and every time they have a party over here, they want ice cream and cake. I said, I'm not a kid anymore. So--but, my mother [Jordan's adoptive mother, Eliza Stone Weaver] and father [Jordan's adoptive father, Chalmers Weaver] were very--they were very easy people, very--
Speaker 1: Did they entertain a lot?
Speaker 2: They entertained their--they were in--both in, in bridge clubs and they'd have their bridge clubs over.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that would be the only time that they really entertained because, like I said, we had reunions that we would go out in Webster [Webster Groves, Missouri] for our big reunions, family reunions like on holidays, (cough) pardon me, especially Memorial Day. That was our--one of our big reunions. Because out there, they had all this acreage and the family could cook, boy (laughter). Because I didn't cook too well but when I got in show business, I used to ask my mother to send me recipes, so I learned how to cook 'cause I'd got an apartment and stuff that I had to cook, and I finally said--when I got married, so I cooked a little bit more. But, my whole family could cook, even the one son that they had. But all the ladies could cook, so we would have a ball. And all the--all the families--I'd take all my friends, a lot of my girlfriends, especially my four--my other three friends that was on the block, Kitty [ph.], Connie [ph.], and Alfonse [ph.], and they used to always go with--they would like family 'cause they would spend--now, Connie had a big family. In fact, all of her family now, and we're all still friends, she's the one that lives in St. Louis [Missouri] with Alzheimer's, but her whole family, all of her--the kids that they--it was--must've been about nine of them, everybody was still friends, all the families, all the mothers--I mean, all the mothers and what's the name, their--her parents and everybody. Growing up in those days, they all--we were all friends and when one said do something, you did it 'cause otherwise they would--your parents wouldn't listen to it. That's what's too wrong with the kids now. They--I don't know how this whole thing changed, but they need to be chastised, but the kids can't be chastised now, but they need to be. That's what's happening with the world. It's too bad because we were at--we listened to every adult, although when I was--they would tell parents and I didn't need any more of the little spankings that I got. But they, they would (laughter). So we, we minded all--everybody's parents. It was like anybody on the block that told us to do something, you know, we minded. But my parents, they were very--they, they were lenient to a certain way, a certain extent. They--you know, you, you wouldn't go too way out of the--well, I knew what to do and knew, knew not to do it and I didn't. Although, I had a--I had a fabulous childhood. And, like I said, I really got--I was fortunate because I was able to get most of the things that I wanted out of life and I still am, thank God, for the way I guess I have lived or whatever 'cause there's nothing in life really now that I want that I don't have or haven't had, that I do appreciate very much. But sometimes you have to sacrifice and you gotta think of others, and I do think of others, I really do 'cause I've seen a lot and--traveling, definitely.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from high school [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-three [1943].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was 208 in the class, the biggest in high school, yeah. And I've been back to--for several reunions.
Story_ID: 482683
Speaker 1: Tell me about the war [World War II, WWII] years. Were--what--were you involved in any--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to go down and entertain the soldiers. We used to have a thing called, down to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. It was like--they used to have bus trips and take girls and we were chaperoned, and they would take them--take like a busload of girls down to entertain the soldiers there on the weekends. In other words, you'd go down--you just dance, you know. And it was like--well, they had like a big cafeteria where they had cots for us to sleep, you know, on, and that's where they would have the part- the dances and the parties and things like that. But this was out of high school. This was just on the weekends for kids out of high school. And we were very much chaperoned. And we had our picture in Life magazine. I had my picture in Life magazine at the time. They took--they had a, a soldier that I was--had been talking to, you know, and all that. But, in fact, another soldier that I met that was in the band there, he ended up--he was married to Carmen McRae, the singer, at one time 'cause I--Charles [Ike Isaacs], I knew him. And I--he--we--I was surprised when I saw him after I was in show business that I ran into him. You know, we remembered each other from Fort Leonard Wood.
Story_ID: 482684
Speaker 1: In high school [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri], had you had any aspirations to go to college?
Speaker 2: In a way, but once I was in the Rhythmic Club, I wanted to dance. And then once--I had a friend of mine that was in class with me, Sadie [ph.], who was an excellent dancer and she was working at the Plantation Club [Palladium, St. Louis, Missouri]. So--
Speaker 1: In high school?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was working at the Plantation and that's when I said, oh, and I met Hortense Allen [Hortense Allen Jordan]. This was the producer of the show at the Plantation. And that's when I decided I wanted to be a dancer. I wanted to go into show business. And after doing the Y Circus, that was what I was talking about, doing it for four years and meeting all these celebrities, that encouraged me more that I wanted to be in show business.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A little, you know, sixteen year old girl, just flighty wanting to be and meeting all these celebrities, which they were all very nice, really, and that was what made me wanted to be in show business. I did not want to go--at first, I was going to college bec- and I'll tell you what. My father [Jordan's adoptive father, Chalmers Weaver]--we had Stowes Teachers College [Stowe Teachers College; Harris-Stowe State University, St. Louis, Missouri] right across the street from, from, from--S-T-O-W-E, Teachers College at the time. In fact, I still think they have it but they changed their name. It's downtown. It was right across the street from our high school and where most of my friends went. A lot of friends went there. But I wanted to go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]. No, I wanted to go to University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]. Daddy wanted me to go to Howard. So we could not come to any conclusion. Now, I was in Washington [D.C.] once on a vacation and I went to Howard and it was--it was fabulous. I really enjoyed it, but I wanted to go to the University of Michigan.
Speaker 1: Is, is Howard where your father went?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Where did he go to school?
Speaker 2: He went down to--he went to--he went to school in Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He--I think he went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] or something. But anyhow, he wanted me to go to Howard. So, I could have talked my father into letting me--into--and I wanted to go to University of Michigan, but it all stopped. I just decided I wanted to dance. So, I just gave--I said, I don't wanna go to school right now. I told him--I'll tell you what happened. I said give me a year, when I talked to him, and my mother [Jordan's adoptive mother, Eliza Stone Weaver] 'cause they were definitely against it, give me a year in show business and I'll go back to college. That's how I got in show business.
Story_ID: 482685
Speaker 1: Who gave you your first job?
Speaker 2: My first job was--didn't I--I worked the Rhumboogie [Rhumboogie Cafe, Chicago, Illinois], not the Rhumboogie, I worked Plantation [Plantation Club; Palladium, St. Louis, Missouri], the first one--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in, in St. Louis [Missouri] for the summer. Hortense [Hortense Allen Jordan]--a guy came in from Chicago [Illinois]. Now, that was another thing that I had to talk to them about, going to Chicago (laughter) during that year. This guy, he's a black guy. The Rhumboogie in Chicago is black owned. Charlie Glenn owned it and Joe Louis had a--supposed to have had a piece of it, but he really didn't. So, we went to--Hortense came over, everybody came over to talk to my parents [Jordan's adoptive parents, Eliza Stone Weaver and Chalmers Weaver] about me going to Chicago. So, they finally said, okay. Hortense said, "I will look out for her," which she did. She took all the girls 'cause I was sixteen, she took all the girls up there and we had a house that we all stayed in and she was like a mother hen over us. We were like in a dormitory, really we were. And I mean, she looked out--she looked out after us. She was very, very--you know, particular about it. But when my mother and father finally came to Chicago one weekend, they saw me dancing and all this, they, they ended up being--they were proud of me, my father. They, they--I never--I felt guilty in a way about not going to college 'cause I never went that year. I, I came back. I did go to Saint Louis University [St. Louis, Missouri] for two years after I, I left Chicago, pardon me, but I did not graduate. And it was because going to Saint Louis University, it was--my father really worked hard to get me in because at that time, it was so prejudice and it's a Catholic college, and since I was--I was born--you know, raised a Catholic, we finally got me in, so I did go for two years but I did not get a degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So then I left and went back into show business, so I just stayed in the show business after that.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, and tell me about your, your dance.
Speaker 2: Well, I worked with a lot of producers at that time. There were a lot of black producers around. And--
Speaker 1: Like who?
Speaker 2: I travel--well, there was Joe "Ziggy" Johnson who was--also did the Y Circus. He was like an emcee and producer. He's dead now. In fact, all of them are dead now mostly. I worked with Larry Steele; he's gone. He worked in--I worked in Atlantic City [New Jersey] with him and I worked in--well, he worked in St. Louis, too. And I worked in, oh, all around. He'd had a show called 'Smart Affairs' that traveled and it traveled. In fact, it came here. First time I came to Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] was with 'Smart Affairs' at the Dunes [Dunes Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada]. Before the Dunes, they took it down. We worked there. And then there was Leonard Reed, all these people have passed, who was a great producer. We worked Apollo Theater [New York, New York]. I worked with Pearl Bailey before she died. She was a very good friend of mine. In fact, her husband [Louis Bellson] and I are still friends and he's remarried and his wife [Francine Wright] now is a good friend of mine.
Speaker 1: When did you meet Pearl Bailey?
Speaker 2: We worked--I met Pearl in 19- 'cause we worked together here at the Flamingo [The Fabulous Flamingo; Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada]. Let me see, it was in the--was it '50s [1950s]? No. I was married to my first husband. It was before Louis [Louis Jordan] and I. I was living in Los Angeles [California]. It was in the--'63 [1963] we came to Los Angeles, so it was in the late '50s [1950s], around '55 [1955].
Story_ID: 482686
Speaker 1: Give me a picture of what it's like to be a dancer on the road. I mean, tell me--just tell me a, a, a day or a week on the road. What is it like? Especially you were--you were young and--
Speaker 2: Well, let's put it like this, and I have to admit, and I'm gonna say this 'cause I do tell a lot in my book ['The Debutante that Went Astray: An Autobiography of Martha, Mrs. Louis Jordan,' Martha Jordan and Edith A. Coleman]. I was young, I was wild. Well, let's put it like this. Say that I'm looking at--of today's kids like Britney Spears and what's that child, Lindey Lohan [sic. Lindsay Lohan], okay, put my age at that time, I was almost like them but we didn't have any place that you could go and what, what, what have they both been in?
Speaker 1: Rehab.
Speaker 2: Rehabs. We had no rehab. There was no rehab back then that you could go. 'Cause I almost became an alcoholic. I was becoming a young alcoholic. But there was a lot of opportunities and that--well, that's the--that's the only way I could say it to--about me. Now, I changed myself and finally put it down. But we had no place where you could go like they have gone. But I can understand their wildness and their--I guess I can understand it because I guess I went through it in a way of speaking when I was growing up. 'Cause I was sixteen, I was--just got into it and I was meeting all these fabulous people. And I was doing things that I probably wouldn't ordinarily have done, and drinking, definitely drinking. Now, one thing that I got--couldn't take and that was getting on dope. I will say that I did smoke pot once, what, what is it? Reefer is what they--at that, that time they were saying. I was in the--I was working at the--at the El Grotto [El Grotto Cafe, Chicago, Illinois] and that was during the curfew, during the war [World War II, WWII]. Because we stayed in the hotel, in the Pershing Hotel [Chicago, Illinois]. The El Grotto was in, in the basement of the Pershing, this club, so we lived there. All we had to do was come down the elevator to go to work. They actually had (laughter) everything on the fourth floor, they actually had an afterhours spot on the fourth floor, so you could go get booze and everything after twelve o'clock because, like I said, everything was closing at twelve. They had some pot there that they were--I tried it. I walked around to my room and I could not reach for the--you know how you're walking down the hall and you can't find the, the hall, I got to my room and got to bed, laid in my bed, so help me I said, dear Lord, if I am not dying, don't worry about it. I will never smoke any more pot as long as I live and I haven't. So, therefore, not only did I not smoke pot, I didn't want any--anything to do with dope, no kind. And believe me, I was around a lot of it. I was around it so much that I had to move out of the dressing rooms with the chorus girls and dress with the principal sometimes because the--all the chorus girls were doing it and I was getting contact high and it was making me sick. So I moved in with the principals a lot. But then I didn't like any--anything that they did. I didn't like--I couldn't get with the cocaine and, and, and, and I was around it. I was around cocaine. I was around it all. But I never wanted to touch it. And then I found--was with friends that were on it, that--it was just disgusting. Now, drinking was a different thing. I would drink and sometimes I would drink and not realize how much I was drinking. And like I said, I was becoming an alcoholic and not realizing that either. Nowadays, I do. I realize everything that I did in the past 'cause I went from scotch until drinking wine. I was in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] once and drove my car, my--I had just gotten this car--that's when I was with Pearl [Pearl Bailey] 'cause we went to a party that Mercer Ellington had for Duke [Duke Ellington]. It was Duke's birthday. We were on the Westside [West Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] 'cause we couldn't stay on the strip. Mercer--now, I lived on this one street, the party was on this next street. Okay, there was a driveway I could've walked through to go to my house. No, I'm sitting up there with Swee' Pea. You don't--you wouldn't remember Swee' Pea, but Billy Strayhorn who wrote most of Ellington's music, he and I sat up and drank a whole bottle of scotch and I was absolutely ossified. I drove my car on the sidewalk going around the corner to my house. Like I said, I could've walked, crawled through the--that was when I woke up the next day and that was it. I said no more scotch for me and I haven't had scotch since then. That was in the late '50s [1950s]. Because that time I realized all of a sudden, you know what? You're becoming an alcoholic. And I started drinking wine, then I reverted to champagne, which all I drink now is champ- I'm doing good if I can get two glasses of champagne down now.
Story_ID: 482687
Speaker 1: Now, tell me what it's like to, to be a chorus girl.
Speaker 2: To be a chorus girl. Well, you know, at sixteen, it's altogether different than it would be now. But then, it was very, very exciting because you get the chance at the time--I got a chance to travel around the world. I got--well not actually around the world, around the United States. I got a chance--well, I'm a flighty sixteen and I got a chance to meet people, you know. You get to be flighty and, like I said, and I got to meet celebrities and that was my big thing. So when I first went, I went with Hortense [Hortense Allen Jordan] and she--and we worked the Plantation [Plantation Club; Palladium] in St. Louis [Missouri]. From there, we went to Chicago [Illinois]. Well, Charlie Glenn owned the Rhumboogie [Rhumboogie Cafe] in Chicago, which is a black owned club. The Plantation was really all white. Nat Cole [Nat King Cole] was one that we worked with at the Plantation in St. Louis. It was owned--really owned by the mafia 'cause all the guys, Tony [Tony Scarpelli] and all of them, all the bosses were mafia, but you knew this and nobody bothered you and you did not socialize at all, thank goodness. I mean, you were not--you know, you--it was not permitted and all this, which was good because we didn't want to anyhow because they were all Caucasians and we, you know, couldn't go out and--well, you couldn't go out and socialize for the simple reason you didn't have anybody because it was a white club. It was in St. Louis. But when I left there, we rehearsed--in the Plantation, we did three shows a night and, and when we left there and we went to the Rhumboogie which we only did two shows a night, so a much easier job. As a chorus girl, usually if you're in a club and if you're gonna stay in a club for a while just like, say the Rhumboogie and you're gonna be there for like--he hired the whole chorus line so that meant--the chorus line is the backbone of a show. Like, you have celebrities that come in, but you change your celebrities. Your chorus line, you usually do a show a good month without changing, so that means that we have, okay, we're doing three numbers. While we're doing those three numbers before the month is out, we will have to rehearse. And we were working at night, so we will rehearse during the day to learn the new show which you're doing three numbers in the new show, so it is not an easy--it's not--it's not all what it is cut out to be that you don't work. You're working very hard. You're working at night and you're tired and you're facing--you got to be on that stage and you have to be perppy [ph.] and looking good and frisky and smiling and all this. Now, we have nothing to do with the costumes. We have a costumer. Most of the shows have costumers that they get. Any show that you're on, they usually have a costume person. And they come in and they--the producer that you're working for does the show, they'll teach you the routines if--okay, say for instance, we had Larry Steele who was not a dancer, he had Hortense Allen who took us into the Plantation and also the Rhumboogie. Hortense was a dancer and a producer, but she worked with Larry and Ziggy [Joe "Ziggy" Johnson] in the Rhumboogie when we first went in the Rhumboogie. Ziggy was the producer and an emcee, but Hortense was a predominant dancer, but they worked together as a team to teach us the routines for the show. It might be Ziggy's idea that he wanted to do a Christmas show. Okay, Hortense might put some of the steps and things to the different numbers. He has a designer in Chicago at the Rhumboogie who does the costumes. They'll do costumes for these--we have three--a set of three costumes for this show. While we're rehearsing for the new show, she's making costumes for that new show. So when the new show comes in, we--we'll rehearse--okay, say for, for instance, to make it kind of easy, we rehearse about--all of us our professionals, so we rehearse about two weeks for the new show. So, we're learning three numbers in two weeks. That's just about it. So, you're rehearsing two weeks out of that month plus you're doing your show at night. That's the hardest time really is when you're working at night and rehearsing in the day. And we'll rehearse like about--usually you rehearse at least two to three hours a day. You do not rehearse on weekends. They finally said no weekends, thank goodness. But you do--so you have that, that free. But most of the shows, you do rehearse especially when you're in a club.

Speaker 1: Okay, if you're in, doing a theater, say for instance, we did a show with Louis Jordan. Louis took a show on the road. He took it to the theaters. Okay, Hortense [Hortense Allen Jordan] produced his show, so he has a line of eight girls that he took say on the circuit of the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York], the Royal [Royal Theatre] in Baltimore [Maryland], the Pearl [Pearl Theatre] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], the Regal [Regal Theater] in Chicago [Illinois], he had--okay, say about five theaters that he just worked. You learn one routine 'cause on the--on--in the theaters, you don't do--you might do an opening--it all depends on your producer. 'Cause I worked with Cab [Cab Calloway] and we did three numbers (laughter). We had a middle number. But with Louis, you only did an opening and a finale. Most shows in the theaters, you do an opening and a finale. Most shows in the clubs, you do an opening, a middle number, and a finale. And your middle number might be that you're introducing an act, maybe a singing act or maybe a dancing act. So if you're doing--say for instance, we have done it and introduced an adagio act. Okay, so the middle number might be a number that we do which is considered something like a certain type of working with adagio that we can bring this adagio act on, if you understand what I mean, what I'm trying to say. Let me make it simpler. Say for instance if there's a jitterbug act coming on, we have done a number called 'Jukebox Saturday Night' like a jukebox. Okay, we'll get out there and do a thing like a, a jitterbug number to bring this jitterbug act on, something like that. That would be in the--or if we're gonna do an Indian number, we'll do something to bring this exotic dancer on. That would be your middle number. Usually you open and it's fast, up-tempo and fast and this, that, and the other, and your finale is usually bringing the whole show on. That's what the different, the three numbers are. But with Louis, you did an opening and finale. I'm just saying between the theater and your nightclub, there is a different story. And when you're working with a producer in the theaters, it's much easier for the simple reason that going into the theaters, you're doing a lot of theater, so you, you don't have to rehearse as much because you're not doing like a new show. You're only doing it if you're with a new producer. Say if you were--okay, say I went--okay, I go from Louis Jordan's band to go into the Apollo to Cab Calloway, like I worked with Cab. Okay, we did a awful- we did a lot of shows with Cab in the Apollo, so you're doing things but you only learn two nu- we did three numbers with Cab 'cause we did 'St. James Infirmary' which he did. He comes out and does 'Minnie the Moocher.' But we're introducing him but he sings 'St. James Infirmary.' So he comes and sings it with us doing this number, so we built the number around him singing 'St. James Infirmary.' That's the way the producers do a number if the--if they're gonna do--you know, if they're gonna sing. Just like with Pearl [Pearl Bailey], she had a middle number but she had a exotic dancer girl that worked with us and we did 'Stranger in the Night' but we did 'Stranger in the Night' that they taught us, then we brought Moana [ph.] on with this. But this is the way that the chorus does. The chorus is your backbone of your show actually, the chorus girls. They're the backbone. And you really should have chorus girls in all your shows. It really makes a much better show, although a lot of people don't understand that. And today, you don't see it. You see it here in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] but you don't see it with a lot of people. The only person has a show that's close to it here now is Toni, Toni Braxton 'cause I caught her show. She has a show which she has the dancers and she has the dancers to open with her. In fact, she's in a lot of the numbers that the dancers do which is called a, a--what the chorus girls were doing years ago, and that is the way a lot of people want to be in choruses.
Story_ID: 482689
Speaker 1: You see it on television with a lot of shows where they have the chorus girls. Unfortunately, we never--I never got in the television business 'cause at the time I was working, nobody was really hiring a lot of blacks at that time because it was still prejudiced. New York [New York] was fine. We worked the, the theaters in New York. They were all fine. They were not prejudice because you worked the circuits of where the blacks, really the theaters that blacks socialized in and that was the main places that you worked as far as the theater circuit--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at that time. And then the nightclub circuit, you had the nightclubs. Like I said, the Rhumboogie [Rhumboogie Cafe, Chicago, Illinois] was black owned. Detroit [Michigan], you worked, that was owned. I take that back, that wasn't. It was--it was blacks came where, where you have a black, black nightclub but it was owned by Caucasians, but the blacks came. And St. Louis [Missouri] is strictly a black owned club, so most of the clubs at that--during that era were owned, where we played, were owned by blacks or had whites owning it but blacks could go. That was the way it was during that time. So it was a little different. Taking ballet--I took ballet. But taking ballet at that time, it was hard to get any jobs where now, it's very lucrative with the television, is doing ballet because you do have a lot of ballet. You have a lot of theater, too, that you could participate in now where years ago you could not get into Broadway stage because of, of the performance. I'm trying to get a show here that my husband [Louis Jordan] did. It was most of his music and it was done in London [England]. It ran for five years, 'Five Guys Named Moe' [Clarke Peters]. And then it ran two--almost two years on Broadway and it was two black shows on Broadway. You found no publicity about them unfortunately. You know, this is why I have to say this because it's the idea of press. Your press help--helps you and your press helps Broadway. Here is--Johnson publications [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois], they had nothing in their publications. No Jet, no Ebony, no nothing about 'Five Guys Named Moe' and it ran over a year on Broadway. Now, at the time, Gregory Hines was on Broadway with his show ['Jelly's Last Jam,' George C. Wolfe], all right. It's publicity to have two show--it's a miracle to have one show on--black show on Broadway, but to have two black shows on Broadway at the same time, that's a--that is completely unheard of. This is why I wrote--no, no pub- Johnson publication had no kind of publications about 'Five Guys Named Moe.' So we don't help ourselves. We don't help us. That's what I'm saying between us and the Jews.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's what I was speaking about earlier.
Story_ID: 482690
Speaker 1: When do you come to Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I came (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Well, you get married.
Speaker 2: Oh, I got married later.
Speaker 1: Okay, later. Oh, so you came here first (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Louis [Louis Jordan] and I had been (laughter)--Louis and I had been going--Louis and I--Louis had been--we'd been dating off and on. In the interim, he marries, I'm married, then we both get divorces and we--but we still see each other when we run into each other on the road.
Speaker 1: The first time you met him, when was the first time you met Louis?
Speaker 2: In St. Louis [Missouri] at the Y Circus.
Speaker 1: At the Y Circus.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Was he older than--a lot older than you?
Speaker 2: Twenty years.
Speaker 1: Twenty years older than you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He'll celebrate his--they--well, like I said, they might have something this next year for his hundredth birthday.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So, tell me about coming to Vegas. Is that your next big step in--
Speaker 2: Well, I tell you.
Speaker 1: As far as--
Speaker 2: Well, that's true because when I came to Vegas, I came to visit my girlfriend and I ended up, Larry [Larry Steele] was here with 'Smart Affairs.'
Speaker 1: Larry who?
Speaker 2: Steele.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And since I had worked with him so much, he had a vacancy, he said, "Martha [HistoryMaker Martha Jordan], why don't you stay and work with us," which I did at the Dunes [Dunes Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada]. That was years ago because the Dunes was in the red and Larry with the black show. That was the first time an all-black show had appeared on, on--in, in Vegas. And it got the Dunes Hotel out of the red. So I worked here with him. In fact, I worked with--Anna [Anna Bailey] worked here. You just interviewed she and her husband because Anna and Bob were here. 'Cause Anna and I had been working together in New York [New York] and all around as chorus girls for years and we knew each other. And then we finally came here and then that's when we--she and I both got with Pearl [Pearl Bailey]. And then Bob worked with Pearl 'cause he was the road manager when we were with Pearl. He worked with her.
Speaker 1: Bob Bailey [HistoryMaker William "Bob" Bailey]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He worked with Pearl. Bob used to sing. Well, I guess he told you all that 'cause he was with Basie [Count Basie]. He emceed too. Ann and--oh, my Lord, oh, God, 'cause I was on the show with them with Louis. They did backup, supposingly [sic. supposedly] did backup singing with Louis when he and I were going together 'cause I told him, I said, "Well, hell, you could've taken me on the road," I said, because they were just--they were not singers. They were just backup to look good 'cause he bought their clothes and all that. Bob emceed the show for Louis at that time, too. That's what I was trying to say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's when he and I were still going together and I told him, I said, "Well, you got them, you could've put me." But, anyhow, he didn't, so--
Speaker 1: So, so you come to the Dunes.
Speaker 2: We came to the Dunes. I can't think of the year, but it was early. And we worked the Dunes at--I'm trying to think. I know what happened. When I left the Dunes, I went to Los Angeles [California]. That's when I went to L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. The second time that we worked--we stayed here and worked the Dunes. The second time, we were making money but, but some kind of way, we lost money or something at the Dunes because we didn't get paid the last three weeks, so I said, okay, I'm going out to L.A. because the union came in and said, "Okay, we'll pay you and you will not--you know," then we didn't have to work 'cause our contract ran out, something happened, so we didn't get--so I went on to L.A. because I was getting paid anyhow 'cause I could get my salary, pick it up at the union in L.A.
Story_ID: 482691
Speaker 1: And I decided I had not been to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], so I decided I would go to L.A., and that's when I really went to L.A. and stayed. And that's when Louis [Louis Jordan] found me in L.A. again later (laughter), so that was when we got together. But I came down here and saw Pearl [Pearl Bailey] and then I got with Pearl and--you know, and traveled with her for a while.
Speaker 2: Do you remember the--and, and you said that was in the, the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: That was in the '60s [1960s] here because they broke discrimination [sic. segregation] down in 1960 here 'cause I came down right as they broke it down and ran--and went to see Pearl's show. That's when I first met her. And then she said she needed some, you know, some girls to work. That's when I came back and worked with her.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were in L.A. working and then--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was in real estate. I took a real estate course.
Speaker 2: Okay. When did you take that?
Speaker 1: When I was in--went to L.A. I took a real--
Speaker 2: I know, but do you know what year it was?
Speaker 1: It was around--I was thinking that--let me see, when Louis and I--Louis and I got married in nine- in '66 [1966] and I was going for my broker's license. Sixty-three [1963] was when I came with Pearl, around 1963 or something like that when I was with Pearl.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you get your real estate license. What makes you decide to leave the chorus line and go to real estate school?
Speaker 1: 'Cause there was not too many jobs coming up at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I met my girlfriend--when I went to L.A., I met a girlfriend of mine and she was in real estate and I said, oh, this sounds good, you make money and not have to work so hard.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I always knew how to do something. I always knew how to type 'cause I worked for the government one time. I got--went, went to St. Louis [Missouri], I went home and stayed for a while with--because I was going with a guy there that was--I was very much in love with an I stayed home for a while and I danced. In fact, we're still good friends.
Speaker 2: So, how did the real estate turn out?
Speaker 1: It was fine. I got my license, but I never really worked. By that time, I met Louis and Louis wanted me to travel with him, so I couldn't really work real estate. I had a license here. I, I had a broker's license here when I first came to Las Vegas [Nevada]. I mean, when I first moved back to Las Vegas--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --which was twenty-seven years ago.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, you get your real estate license. Louis finds you in--
Speaker 1: In L.A (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In L.A.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay. And then you come back and work with Pearl or do you just--
Speaker 1: No, I went with Pearl before Louis and I got together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause after I left Pearl, then I came back and that's when Louis and I got together. 'Cause I came up here--during the time when I was studying for my license and I came up here to see, he called me and I said, oh, that's funny 'cause I'm fixing to drive down to Vegas and he was in Vegas and he was trying to get me to meet him here. I said that's funny 'cause my girlfriend and I are driving and which we did. We--I drove down and met him and that was when he--we got back together and that's when he came into L.A. a little after that and asked me to marry him.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, before we, we--before we go forward (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, before th- that 'cause that was in '62 [1962] when he and I got back together.
Story_ID: 482692
Speaker 1: So, I wanted to ask about--you talk about discrimination, was there discrimination among the dancers?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were no Caucasian dancers in our group.
Speaker 1: No, what I mean, when you see most chorus lines, most of the women are very fair. Were there dark-skinned chorus girls at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Nods head) Definitely. Actually, at one time, that's the only people that could get in the movies were the dark ones. Then at one time, the only ones that get in the movies were the light ones. They couldn't make up their mind what they wanted (laughter), I mean, really, I'm not lying. And then--and I said--they tell me, you're too light. Then somebody would tell me, you're not light enough. And, you know, I mean, it was--they, they could not make up their minds what they wanted in the movies. And I said, you know what? They're crazy. The movies couldn't--really couldn't--it was--it was utterly ridiculous.
Speaker 1: Did you ever work in any clubs, white clubs and the entertainment was black but the, the clubs were white--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Plantation [Plantation Club; Palladium, St. Louis, Missouri] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or the audience was white? Oh, that was--
Speaker 2: That was the first club.
Speaker 1: That was the first club, so that was not only white owned but blacks did not--
Speaker 2: You could not--no.
Speaker 1: They were not patrons.
Speaker 2: You could not come.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You could not come. St. Louis [Missouri], no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: St. Louis was very prejudice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And like I said, it was owned by the mafia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they treated us royally because nobody bothered us. Believe me, they--nobody was gonna bother you.
Story_ID: 482693
Speaker 1: So tell me about your life with Louis [Louis Jordan]. You say he asked you to go on the road. Y'all got married first or after you were on the road?
Speaker 2: No, we got--we--no, we, we were on the--we--he came back, he asked me to marry him, but we were together from '62 [1962] until '66 [1966]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --before we got married. We got married in '66 [1966], but we were together in '62 [1962] 'cause we got the house in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], oh, it's upstairs, the picture, 'cause it was funny with me telling (laughter), telling my mother [Jordan's adoptive mother, Eliza Stone Weaver]. My mother was living with me and like I said, at that time, the way--I go back to the way we were raised. For me to tell her a man bought me a house, bought--I told her a man bought us a house, we were going to get married, but we were not married, so to live with a man, it was a little difficult, but I had explained to her about him buying this house for us, for me to move in with a man and live with him and not be married. You just--when, when I was raised, you didn't do that and it was difficult. Another thing that happened with my mother and I, we were sitting in the living room--this was after we got married 'cause, like I said, she was there, bless her heart. She died, that was strange, too. She died two months after we got married. But we were in the living room at the house, our house, my house, and we're at the table, and she said something to me and I said, "Yeah, oh damn," so--and I almost bit my tongue 'cause you never cursed in--I never cursed in front of my parents. My mother used to curse and everybody used to curse. I didn't. So when I said da- I said, my God, here I am, I'm forty-seven years old in my own house, and she had to laugh herself. I said, "I'm sorry," and she actually laughed. I--that was the first curse word I ever said in front of my mother. And she really--you know, that was how we were raised at the time, you know. You just didn't curse. And you did not live out of wedlock with a man. So when I explained to her that Louis was buying a house, you know, everything was all right, she lived with us and all, everything was fine. And, like I said, she did live long enough to see us marry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was very good.
Speaker 1: Well, now tell me about Louis.
Speaker 2: Louis Jordan was somebody that I had to learn to--and like I said, we had to learn each other. I was his whole life, I'll put it like this. He had been with other people that, I don't know what it was. And I had not been with anybody, too. I had to learn not to always say me. And we both had to learn a great deal. But I did learn, and I told him finally, I said--he was marvelous to live with. He was possessive with me because I was his whole life when I finally found it out and realized this, then I accepted it. But he didn't want me to move without him and that was something that I really had to get used to because I had been living by myself for years, been doing what I wanted to do when I wanted to do it. Well, I had to change that. But being--because being with somebody in show business, I thought he would be a little different than--and not--he was not jealous, what I might say, but like I said, I was used to going--okay, say for instance, going to lunch with friends of mine, going to a fashion show or something, he would want to go which was odd for a man to want to do this. Louis wanted to do everything I wanted to do. Well, it was something that I had to get used to. And, you know, it took me some--you know, a while and it took me a while to get used to all this. Outside of that, he was marvelous and anything I wanted was nothing. In fact, he--I'd rather for him to buy my, my things than me because he didn't look at prices and I did (laughter). I always looked at prices and he didn't. Well, when I started--well, especially when I started working. I started getting on stage because I told him, I said all I'm doing is getting fat. So I started singing with the band because I said if Lena Horne can do it, so can I 'cause at first, she couldn't sing. Now, she learned and she was excellent, fantastic. But because I knew time and this, I wouldn't--he would get--well, we would get, get some songs together that I would start singing, but I would like--I could sell them. Let's put it like this. I was not a singer, I was an entertainer 'cause I could sell the songs like a, a number that's fast which a number I'd do now, 'Lady is a Tramp' ['The Lady Is a Tramp']. I don't particularly sing it, I sell it and that is more of a entertainer than a singer. But I said, what the hell, I'm staying here and I'm getting fat in these hotel rooms, I said, so put me on stage. At least you won't have to have a singer. So we went to the Far East, we went, you know, a lot of places where I substituted so I got my way paid, too, a lot 'cause I handled all the books and all this.
Speaker 1: You, you handled the books for him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh. I handled all the books, all the thing--all the taxes, all the th-, everything like that, yeah, 'cause I was good with figures and I was--well, I was very--'cause I had done this, you know.
Story_ID: 482694
Speaker 1: Tell me about--a little about Louis' [Louis Jordan] career and some of the, the music and some of the things that, that he did (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know what? I have a biography on him. But Louis Jordan, he was the father of R&B. He started everything. In fact, it wouldn't been--they wouldn't have had rock and roll, they wouldn't have had hip-hop, they wouldn't have anything had it not been for Louis Jordan. He--you'd have to listen to him, really, and if you haven't heard him, I don't know why because--well, maybe because most places play his records and now not here too much. Jazz plays them. They play them on the jazz stations. I know mostly---
Speaker 1: Well, tell me--tell me what some of his songs were.
Speaker 2: 'Caldonia,' 'Let the Good Times Roll,' 'Saturday Night Fish Fry,' 'Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby.' Did you know that?
Speaker 1: No, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Oh, you, you looked like you did. I, I thought you did. Some of them he wrote and some of them he didn't, but these are the numbers that--but most people like, I'll tell you who followed behind him and, and always wrote about him was--he just died, though, what's his name? James Brown, James Brown. Ray, Ray Charles copied that man. He did all his arrangements. Oh, Ray Charles took every arrangement Louis had and did it, and then invited Louis over to join his Tangerine [Tangerine Records] and Louis made a beautiful album and Ray Charles wrote, the cover, 'Hallelujah...Louis Jordan is Back!,' you never heard about it. He begged Louis to come to Tangerine. Louis signed for Tangerine record company, never heard another word. And that made me really dislike Ray Charles a very lot and, unfortunately, when he died, I did not go 'cause he knew me and I knew him but I did not--well, especially--and then Joe Adams, too, his manager because of this. Because here's--if he hadn't have begged Louis so much to come and sign with him, I think I would've taken it. But the way he did and, such a great album and keep him out of Ray Charles' way, and everything Ray Charles did was Louis' arrangements, 'Let the Good Times Roll,' everything he did, damn near was Louis' arrangements. But I was very, very upset about that. But Louis was--he was just a all-around entertainer. He was funny, he did--well, I could say--now, I won't say he started 'cause he really didn't, but he talked to a lot of his songs. That's where they say that rap started from, but he didn't--he was not a rapper. He would--okay, he would say, sing a song and then he would talk to the audience about it, like 'Caldonia' was one of his big ones that he talked about, he would talk. This one, what is it, this one that I just said? 'Let the Good Times Roll,' he'd talk about it. And I understand that's very popular, and that's a very popular statement that a lot of people make, is 'Let the Good Times Roll.' And he wrote that although it's in his first wife's [Fleecie Moore] name so I don't get a quarter from it and which I'm mad about that. But anyhow (laughter), he wrote that. And Johnny Mathis did it I think, too, on something he did when he was honored not too long ago 'cause I'm in the Society of Singers with him. But, oh, he's done so many fabulous--he--well, he was really a hit. He had not been recording when he died for the simple reason that, like I said, he had gotten with Ray and Ray kept him--was keeping him out of his way. That's all I could say, so he hadn't recorded as much as before.
Story_ID: 482695
Speaker 1: So, tell me about travel as far as how did you travel? Did you travel on trains? What, what were some of the hardships being in the entertainment business and--
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you how we traveled. Most of the time, we traveled in cars and we traveled on trains and planes. I'll tell you one thing back when I was in--when I was a chorus girl that we did, flying--I never travel and never flew without wearing a hat. That was the thing back in those years. You always dressed when you traveled. You always dressed. I knew the time when we came out of the dressing room with Pearl [Pearl Bailey] and we had a plane to catch, we had our makeup on. We took the makeup off, new makeup, everything to make that plane. We were all dressed including hats. But you never did anything--well, especially with like a train or a plane, anything without being fully dressed, I mean, like with suit, hat--I mean, really dressed at that time. And right now to this day when I travel and I'm flying, I always have some kind of a hat on now. It might be a cap now, but it's just from that era because everybody was always dressed. We didn't wear--now, the only time I ever wore pants on a plane after that years ago, if we were going a great distance, I would wear a suit, go to the restroom, put my pants on to sit on the plane, but before I landed, I'd go back to the restroom, put my skirt on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was just what's installed with us, to dress. Especially--and, and Pearl had a habit of telling and especially because she had a, a mixed group and she said--and she--well, she would say, "One thing, my girls," and she would emphasize this, "they're always dressed. But some of you all," and she was talking about the Caucasian girls, "look like hags," which they did 'cause they would look like bums. And Pearl would always say, "I might look like a bum but I'm a rich bum," 'cause she'd have (laughter) a, a, a long ermine cloak on and everything and she didn't care, with her pants. But I'm just saying, this was just a thing with us, that we had been inaugurated or something in our heads to always dress. The only time we weren't dressed is if we were traveling in a car and we did and on buses. We did 'Atlantic City Follies' all down south and we did it on a bus. That was a trip we made with Marva Louis [Marva Trotter Louis] at the time she was married to Joe [Joe Louis], and she was traveling and she was singing, and we did a southern tour. And that was the first time--now, that was a little worse than St. Louis [Missouri]. I had been around St. Louis and it was very prejudice, but when I went down south, I had nev- that was the first time I'd ever seen white and black fountains, drinking fountains, like a black one and a white one, and that was the first time I had seen signs on restrooms, colored and white. And that was another time that I knew that, like, we got to Texas and you couldn't, you weren't supposed to try on things where in St. Louis, it wasn't quite that bad. It was bad, but we could--we could try on things in the stores like that. But when you're coming from a prejudice town, when you're living in a prejudice town, like I was saying, you wonder why. And then when you go someplace else and you can go every place, you know, it's hard to get away from that prejudice in a way because I had, had it installed in me with so many, so many years between Caucasians and blacks--I mean, and us. But I never cared for them, I really didn't. It's very--I, I can't say with a Caucasian now who I--is really a friend of mine 'cause I have never--I have some friends and, and I, I guess they're friends, I don't know. But I cannot say true, true, true friends. And you needed help from every--them, every place you went because of what they have done, but yet and still it's just installed in you so much of the things that they had done to us through life that it's, it's hard to look at one and not say, now, well he called me a nigger, you know, or even have one as a date 'cause I did in New York [New York] and I said, now, you know, the first time--and I--and, and I can get ignorant. I said, if they get out of line, they're gonna be in trouble with me 'cause I have held a, a prejudice that I have tried very hard to get out of, but it's a little hard for me to get out of it.

Speaker 1: Tell me about some of your show business friends. Who are you friends with?
Speaker 2: I'll tell you what, it's a surprising thing, Anna, Carrie [Carrie Adams], Betty [ph.], Jerry [ph.], I have about six very close friends right here in Las Vegas [Nevada] that I danced with years ago. We danced together, so amazing that we are all here today. We're all still friends after fifty-some years, you know, that we are very good. Like the one that you introduced, Anna Bailey, she and I have been friends before Bob [HistoryMaker William "Bob" Bailey] and she got married and they've been married almost fifty-five years. And then there's some, some others gradually had moved here that really it's amazing that we are--we are--you know, we are very, very close friends. And before they came, they--we all, we were friends and all this and now they're all here, that we've been--we've been friends for years and years. That's the group of people, that's a club. That's not show business.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the renegade club.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine. Tell me, did you know Peg Leg Bates?
Speaker 2: Very well, very well.
Speaker 1: And tell me about him (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That goes back a long time ago. He had a place [Peg Leg Bates Country Club; Mountain Valley Resort and Country Club, Kerhonkson, New York] up in--at, at--in Coha- Cohasset [sic.], well, up- Upstate New York, I'll put it like that. And he, he really worked to pay for this. He and his wife stayed up there. In fact, Alice [Alice E. Bates] went up there before he did. He would--he would go up there on weekends because he was always working. Louis [Louis Jordan] and I went up one year. In fact, I got a picture upstairs of it and he had--he had--it was like a--it was a beautiful place. It was like a summer, what you call it, resort. And he had cabins and things and have, have--you could have--you know, you, you, you ate, you stayed the weekends and that. We went up for the weekend and he was really elated that we came up. He was a very good friend of mine and really a hell of a worker, an amazing dancer on that peg. In fact, he just died. What, he was ninety-something. Yeah, he died a few years ago, but--
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) he was a good friend.
Speaker 1: Tell me who else you worked with.
Speaker 2: Well, I worked with Nat Cole [Nat King Cole] when he was with the trio [King Cole Trio] and then I worked with him when he got--was by his self and he became the great Nat King Cole and who was a very good friend of mine. His wife [Maria Cole] and I are still friends, although I don't see her. She's in--I think she lives in Florida now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her sister [Charlotte Cole] and I became very good friends and I talk to her quite often. But--and then the kids. I used to take the kids before--well, they're grown now 'cause they wouldn't know me at all, but the kids, I used to call the kids up and, and Maria used to let me take them to dinner. And I used to call Kelly [Nat Kelly Cole], one of the, the triplets, because I used to take the twins [Timolin Cole and Casey Cole Hooker] to dinner and then I always take Kelly and Kelly looked like--they looked like triplets before Kelly died. He was the boy. But the two twins I used to take when they were kids. And Maria and I, we were--like I said, I haven't seen her in years. I haven't seen her since right after Nat died.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Actually since Louis, because I did hear from her when Louis died.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And, and Sammy and I were good friends, Sammy Davis [Sammy Davis, Jr.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sammy Davis?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. We were--
Speaker 1: You were good friends?
Speaker 2: --very good friends. In fact, he asked me to marry him and I said, "No, darling."  I said, "I like you too much. I do not love you," and that's why we didn't get married. Now, he changed and I might've would've married him if I'd have gone to Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] when he needed a wife. He had to get married 'cause he's gonna get his butt killed for messing around with (laughter)--he was messing around with somebody he had no business messing around with, so the mafia was going to kill him. But anyhow, he got the one eye. But, Sammy was--Sammy was all right. He just, bless his heart, he wanted to be white so bad. But he was--
Speaker 1: Well, he, he got the one eye from--
Speaker 2: An automobile accident, but it was helped.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Let's put it like this. It was helped because of Kim Novak. But he did marry May [May Britt] and had some kids and he, he just--he was so flustrated [sic. frustrated] that--I used to always tell him, I said, "You know what? I think you're gonna die young," because he had to have a crowd around him all the time. That was another thing I couldn't take. Sammy had to be around a crowd. He had to be on stage constantly. He had two great parents, too. I was crazy about Senior [Sammy Davis, Sr.] and his--and his mother [Elvera Sanchez Davis], 'cause his mother and I went on a--on a cruise together before she died. In fact, she died way after Sammy did because--his grandmother [Luisa Aguiar Sanchez] died after he did. She was 104 [sic.]. And then Baby died, his mother, after he did. But, Sam, Sr. was--he was--he was a sweetie pie, too, and he was married to a, a friend of mine after. But Sammy was--he was okay. I had to get over with 'cause one time, the last time I saw him, he was going into a--we were going to this night club in Los Angeles [California]. I was with Esther Rolle 'cause she was a very good friend of mine, and he was saying--well, we started talking, he said, "Yeah, they tell me that I've never been with a black woman." I said, "But you have." I said, "We were on the beach in Atlantic City [New Jersey]." I said, "I have some pictures." He said, "Boy," he said, "I sure would like to see them." I said, "Shut up, Sammy." I said, "One of these days maybe I'll send them to you," which I put it in the book ['The Debutante that Went Astray: An Autobiography of Martha, Mrs. Louis Jordan,' Martha Jordan and Edith A. Coleman], but I never did send it to him 'cause he died after that. But I--he did--he did go with--well, we did go together for a little while, but he was a sweetie pie in a way of speaking, a talent, oh. The man had so much talent. He was one of the greatest talents in the world, he really was.
Story_ID: 482697
Speaker 1: And what about--you worked with Louis Armstrong or Ethel Waters?
Speaker 2: I worked with Ethel in the Club Baron, one--a club I worked in New York [New York] when I first got in. And, boy, she was--she was--Ethel was--she was a singer, but you couldn't do too much around her to distract anything. That's--really, she would go off on you if you did. But we'd be in the line, if you're putting your feet, messing your feet too much, she would--we'd sway and, but if you mess your feet too much, Ethel would wanna come down and lay you out and all, but she was nice people to work with. She was okay, she really was.
Speaker 1: And what about Louis Armstrong?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was my bud. We had an affair and he was really great people, he really was. He's one of the nicest men in the world, really. Pops was just great. He was--he never changed. Now, he married women that changed and I used to say, "Pops, you got women that--you got some wives that they, they, they--your talent went to their heads," which they did 'cause he was very down to earth, very regular, and would treat everybody equal. But he had some--a couple of wives that though they were better than everybody, which was not true 'cause they were all ex-chorus girls and they were ridiculous. But, Pops was great. I know my mother [Jordan's adoptive mother, Eliza Stone Weaver] was very sick once and he sent her a, a dozen of the prettiest red roses I had ever seen in my life. And the pe- the women at the, at, at the hospital flipped because they knew it was from Louis Armstrong, you know. 'Cause they kept asking about, "Is that your son?"  "No, hell no (laughter)," unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Well, you, you talked about Sammy Davis [Sammy Davis, Jr.], but did you know much about the, the Rat Pack, about--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) None, so you didn't know--
Speaker 2: No. I was around Sammy--
Speaker 1: --Jerry Lewis?
Speaker 2: I was around Sammy, but--I met Sinatra [Frank Sinatra] once, but I never--I never was around them, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: What about Jerry Lewis?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Jerry Lewis.
Speaker 2: Jerry Lewis, I, I met him once.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just met him with Louis [Louis Jordan] once and I had a picture made with him, but that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, I mean, you worked with so many wonderful talents, Sarah Vaughan?
Speaker 2: One of my greatest friends, one of my greatest friends. I adored her and we adored each other. Sassy was just--she's beautiful people. We met years ago before she got to be the great Miss Vaughan and we remained friends until she died, actually. I mean, she was just--she was a sweetheart. And so many people didn't realize, the woman had a heart of gold. And they used to say, "Oh, she's so ugly," but she wasn't. To me, she was beautiful 'cause she was just that sweet. But, you know, a lot of people--you'd be--you have to see through it and, well her voice. Let's not even discuss that (laughter). I won't even go into that, so, really 'cause she had a voice and a range that I don't think anybody can copy. But Sassy was so down, it was just something else.

Speaker 1: Now, Sugar Ray Robinson owned a, a, a club?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had a bar in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Sugar Ray's [New York, New York]. And he wanted to be in show business. I said, "You need to stick to boxing." 'Cause we were all--we were very good friends and his wife, Edna Mae [Edna Mae Robinson], was in show business, but then when she married Ray, she got out of it. She--now, I'll tell you something about her. To me, they talk about Lena Horne, but to me, Edna Mae Robinson was one of the prettiest black women, and I will say black this time, but she was one of the prettiest black women that I have ever seen. In comparison, she topped Lena. For one thing, Edna had everything a woman would want. She had color, figure, facial looks, hair, personality where Lena had the, the face, you know, and all this, but Edna had everything put in one frame and that's why I said to me, she was one of the prettiest black women I had ever met, and sweet as she can be. She and I were very close. She used to call me--I used to call them aunt and uncle, really, when they were married and living together, but they divorced and all that.
Speaker 1: And, and what about Cab Calloway? What about those days (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was my first job in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I worked with Cab. He met--I met him in Chicago [Illinois]. In fact, another girl and I who went for, Sister Jean [ph.], she's not in there, but we went to New York and that was my first job at the Strand Theatre [New York, New York] with Cab Calloway. And we got to the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York]. We did--we did all the different theaters, but when we got to the Apollo, we did nine shows. We would come off in the Apollo and they would say all on. I mean, really, we worked like crazy, but he was a good boss. But, Cab, he could get loaded, too, boy. And we, one time thought he was gonna fall off the stage but he didn't. But he was a very good boss to work for. He was somebody--he was a lot of fun. He was a very good boss, yeah. And it was interesting because it was my--like I said, my first time going to New York. And then we did all the circuit--as we call it, the circuit, working with Cab, yeah. It was very good.
Speaker 1: Was Redd Foxx one of your friends?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's from St. Louis [Missouri].
Speaker 1: That's why--that's why I asked.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. We were really--we went back a long ways from St. Louis, the West End Waiters Club in St. Louis.
Speaker 1: The West End Waiters Club?
Speaker 2: We used to do--I'll tell you what, the West End Waiters Club was where blacks went when we worked the Plantation [Plantation Club; Palladium, St. Louis, Missouri], which was all white. On the weekends, we would double. They would call it doubling. Between shows at the Plantation, we did two shows at the West End Waiters because this is where blacks could go, so they would have cars, so we'd just keep our costumes on and they would take us down--after our show at the Plantation, we'd go down and do a show at the Waiters. Then, they'd bring us back to the Plantation, we'd do a show, then go back to the wa- in other words, we'd do five shows on the weekends, two for the--there and three at the Plantation. That, that, that went because it was--it was the only black club, you know, that was around for them, you know, to do that until we got--until Mr. Chambers [Jordan Chambers] had the Riviera [Club Riviera, St. Louis, Missouri] and then that's when he used to book shows. He used to book the chorus and the big shows in the Riviera.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But this is when they just had the, the Waiters and the Plantation when we first got into show business, yes.

Speaker 2: We got married--we got back together in 1962, so we lived together and we got married in 1966.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We took my mother [Jordan's adoptive mother, Eliza Stone Weaver] that Christmas, that was our last Christmas together, we took my mother to Hawaii--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and that was our--Louis' first gig in Hawaii. 'Cause we--it was just a beautiful trip, thank God. We didn't know what was gonna happen and we got married that June. We had a big wedding reception. We got married at our house in Los Angeles [California]. It's up--the picture's upstairs of our house. And we got married June the 16th. We had a wedding reception at the Cocoanut Grove [Los Angeles, California]. At that time, the Ambassador Hotel [Los Angeles, California] and the Cocoanut Grove was very big at that time 'cause I had worked there with Pearl [Pearl Bailey]. But we got--we had our wedding reception there in July, 16th. My mother died August 16th, two months exactly from when we got married, so I was very elated that she was at the wedding and all this. So, it was just one of those things and beautiful life.
Speaker 1: So, what happens with your career after you, you marry? And you all go on the road. I, I know you say that you become a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We went on the road and then I started singing with Louis--
Speaker 1: Louis, okay.
Speaker 2: --and until he died. He died in--well, he's been dead thirty-two years. He died in 1975. I went--I'll tell you what I did. I went back to work. I--when--he said he was gonna semi-retire. I would travel with him because Louis wanted me to be with him all the time. But then in later years, I said, okay, let me get a job. So I started--I was at--in fact, when he died, I was working. I was at--office manager of an elementary school in Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Okay, at what school?
Speaker 2: Santa Monica [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had to think about where I worked in Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: So you, you--your home base was still in, in California then?
Speaker 2: I was--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Los Angeles. We were living there. We lived in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: And I started--I was working. When he died, I was working there.
Speaker 1: And when did you work for the police department [Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department]?
Speaker 2: When I came here [Las Vegas, Nevada].
Speaker 1: And, and, what year did you come here?
Speaker 2: I came here in 1980--January of '80 [1980] 'cause--I keep saying '79 [1979], but it was the beginning of '80 [1980]. It was January of '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I've been here twenty-seven years.
Speaker 1: So you worked for the--what did you do for the police department?
Speaker 2: I was the records technician.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Until 1990 and I retired because I was going to get fired because I had been in an auto- pardon me, an automobile accident and I had been off six months, so I said I better take an early retirement 'cause I was gonna try to stay there ten years.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, tell me about some of your social organizations.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a member of the Las Vegas [Nevada] chapter of Links, Incorporated. I'm a member of the Las Vegas chapter of Girl Friends [The Girl Friends, Inc.], that's a national organization.
Speaker 1: And what do they do?
Speaker 2: It's strictly a, a--it's more of a social.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they do a little charity work, but mostly social.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Where The Links does mostly charity. Then, I'm the founder and president of the Louis Jordan Commemorative Scholarship Foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which gives scholarships every year for high school seniors that I founded in Louis' [Louis Jordan] name. And we have given about sixty thousand dollars since '94 [1994] to about fifty-five kids. So--and I hope to have another fundraiser next year. My last one, we had [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory, was here, so he did our thing. He said, "Anything for Louis Jordan." I was trying to get [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes here and he said he would come and now he's coming for another (unclear) company next year--I mean, next month--this month, he's coming (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simunltaneous) When did--
Story_ID: 482701
Speaker 1: When did you write your book?
Speaker 2: I wrote my book--when did I write it? Year before last. Well, I'm having a problem right now with the lady that transcribed it. She did--she--ghostwriter, Edith [Edith A. Coleman]. In fact, that's Big's [ph.] husband's cousin, Edith, and I'm having a problem with her. She did something and she had no business doing it. She put this number instead of putting me, she put this in the name of her company and she would--and she did not publish it, so I'm trying to get it out of her name and into my name because I published it.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In fact, I did everything. I just went there and she wrote it, that's all.
Speaker 1: What's the name of your book?
Speaker 2: 'The Debutante That Went Astray' ['The Debutante That Went Astray: An Autobiography of Martha, Mrs. Louis Jordan,' Martha Jordan and Edith A. Coleman].
Speaker 1: And what--why do you name it that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Because as a professional person's [Jordan's adoptive father, Chalmers Weaver] daughter, I went astray and got in show business.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was why I named--in fact, Louis [Louis Jordan] called me that once and I thought about it and I said, oh, that's a good name for my book. 'Cause he was talking--we were talking about show business one time and he said, "You know," he said, "you really have been lucky," he said, "because a lot of girls had gotten in it when they were teenagers, you know, like you and they got messed up into a lot of things," because a lot of people would like put--fix their drinks and do this, that, and the other and get them on dope and a whole lot of stuff. He said, "You were just lucky." He said, "You were around the, the best people all the time. You just the damn debutante that went astray." I mean, he just said it out of, you know, just was talking one time. So, I said, hm, that's a good, good name.
Story_ID: 482702
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, is there anything that you regret or you would change?
Speaker 2: You know, not really. There's nothing. The only thing I might, think I might have done, although he died happy, my father [Jordan's adoptive father, Chalmers Weaver] and mother [Jordan's adoptive mother, Eliza Stone Weaver]. The only thing I might--I might've gone on to college and finished and given my father--but that would've been a thing about giving my father that diploma that he wanted me to have, which I think I ended up getting more out of life than that piece of paper, to me, got a better education in a way of speaking than what I would've gotten from college and then maybe not if my life had have been different. Because I feel like I've had a very, very good life and I got a very liberal education about a lot of things (laughter), believe me. I've been through a lot of things and can, you know, talk about a lot of things. And we had--in our--when I was president of The Links [The Links, Incorporated] here, we had a mentoring program with kids that I really enjoyed doing, you know, with young kids. And we, we--all of us had a, you know, group of kids and I had a couple of them that I would take out and all this and tell them a lot about that. I will tell, most, most of the kids if I've--when I have--I talked to them always, tell them to make sure to get a good education, this I do say. It's just that that's the only thing that I regret and I don't really regret it. I really don't by rights, I don't. But that would've been the only thing. Because when my father and mother saw me dancing, they appreciated it so much and they liked me and they--well, they forgave me for being in show business because they said I did a good job and all this. So, that--I--I'm still--I, I still, you know, if they were--if they had ever been really hurt about it--and I never disrespected them I think because of my teaching from my parents was why in a way that I turned out like I am because I don't think I've ever embarrassed them in any way at all, like friends of mine that I had seen on dope and friends of mine that I had seen do different things that I have never embarrassed my parents, and that was because of my upbringing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I owe them everything.

Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, everybody says, the lady in the orchid and the purple and all, she always had a good time. I said, yes I have. Every place I have been, I have enjoyed life and had a very good time, so I just wanna be remembered about enjoying my life, enjoying my family, and enjoying my whole eighty-some years. I hope to be ninety before I die. But I just want people to remember me as being a good person, living a good life, and trying to do the best that I can for people and trying to treat everybody equal and treat them right to--and when I am a friend, I am a diehard, true friend. And if I don't like you, you know it too, believe me.
