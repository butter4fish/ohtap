Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm a producer/interviewer with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns, and you, sir, are?

Speaker 2: Okay, I wear a lot of different hats, you know.
Story_ID: 11091
Speaker 1: What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I thought about that when you mentioned it earlier.  One of my favorite type of cuisines is the type of cooking that they do in Martinique and Guadalupe, cause it's a really nice mix of the island specialties with Continental flavoring too.  I thought it was a funny thing when we slated Jamaica several times to do some extensive recording, and we were always wishing that the French had colonized Jamaica instead of England, cause the mixture of the Jamaican traditional food and the French food was-- (laughter)--but, anyway, that's happening in Martinique and Guadalupe.  So, that's--that's one of the--when I can find those types of restaurants, the Caribbean Antilles restaurants--that's one of my all-time favorites.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Purple.  And all the different shades and hues and everything.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Right here.  Because I'm always traveling, so, vacation for me implies not doing anything.  So, I'd rather be home chillin' out instead of going somewhere and being involved in the vacation changes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Spring, actually.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Damned if you do and damned if you do.
Story_ID: 11092
Speaker 1: You were born in Rochester, New York, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: 1946?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: And, can you tell us something about your parents, their names and when they were born?
Speaker 2: My father is Donald Singer (ph.).  He was born in, let's see, 1924 in Rochester.  My mother, Ernestine, was born in Richmond, Virginia in 1927.
Speaker 1: Do you have a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I know she came to Rochester to go to school and to work, as a part of the northern migration type thing, so I imagine--.  But I think they met at the Elk's club, actually.  Because that was like a social situation that--.  You familiar with the Elk's club?  Benevolent and Paternal Order of the Elks?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Tell--.
Speaker 2: Well, the Elk's club, in our community, for black people, that was a really functional thing for socializing.  And they had their whole agenda that they did--I would hesitate to say similar to the Masons, because I was never really involved.  But that's the closest example that I can think of.  But I know they're not the same as the Masons, but it's along that order.  But anyway, they had bands and had social occasions.  They had educational funds and a lot of things for people to be involved in.  So, I would think--because his mother was a major person inside of the Elks, she did a lot of things, and also her sons and everything--I could imagine that they had met there, although I don't know for sure.
Story_ID: 11093
Speaker 1: Do you know much about your parents' background, their ancestry, and where they came from?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Ernestine], like I said, she's from Richmond.  And, her great-grandmother, she was Cherokee Indian.  And then her--no, her grandmother was Cherokee Indian and then her mother--but she didn't really--.  Her father died at an early age, so I don't really know too much about my maternal--what--grandparents beyond--you know, like that.  My grandmother was from Virginia also. And my grandfather was from Pensacola, Florida.  So, they all ended up in Rochester at various times.
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your father [Donald].
Speaker 2: Well, he died when I was three years--three days old.  So I have memories of stories of his buddies and everything and a few things that my mother told me, but I don't have any, you know, obviously personal memories or anything like that.
Speaker 1: What did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was--he was actually--he was a student, and then, he just--I don't really know.  Because I know the war snatched him when he was pretty young, you know.  So, as far as having a full-time occupation, or whatever, at that time, you know, everybody was getting drafted, you know, so, at his age I would imagine that he was--whatever he was into, he didn't get very far in it because he died when he was like twenty-two.
Speaker 1: Was he involved in the arts in any kind of way?
Speaker 2: He played in some of those bands with the [Benevolent and Paternal Order of the] Elks.  Like you asked me about those pictures--I don't have--I had some photos of the Flower City Lodge Elks Band and he was one of the drummers, and, you know, part of the drum section.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what about your mother.  What did she do?
Speaker 2: My mother, actually, she was pretty--she was a beautician for a while, then she got a job just basically working at Kodak, you know, so she wasn't really into that professional kind.  She just worked her ass off all her life, that's all, trying to raise me and my sister [Furaha], you know, so, pretty much.
Story_ID: 11094
Speaker 1: Can you remember some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in Rochester [New York]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I mean there was a lot of mu--well, I always look back to those days because the music--the variety of music--was much more than it is now, you know, cause I mean you had the jazz--they had a place called the Pythod Lounge and my mother--my grandmother [Lelia] had an apartment above there--it was really next door to the Elk's club--so, there were always bands coming through there all the time.  And she used to cook down there sometimes, too, she was in charge of all of that.  And then we had the--my mother [Ernestine] would take us to concerts and take us to the opera.  They had a whole thing--the opera under the stars.  We used to go there all the time to gospel concerts and we'd go to Eastman Theatre--they got the Eastman School of Music there--they had all kind of stuff coming through.  So, I mean, we had a variety because my mother was really a lover of music, you know.  And, additionally, the amount of variety just on the airwaves at that time was much more than it is now.  Now, it's extremely limited, you know.  So, I was subjected to a lot of different musical influences.  Then the neighborhood I lived in, like some of my buddies, there was a Puerto Rican family lived down here.  That's where I got my first set of bongos.  Cause they were dealing with their music and then they had a--it was kind of a mixed multi-ethnic community, you know.  So, there was all kind of sound in the area.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the neighborhood that you lived in in Rochester?  Did it have a name?
Speaker 2: Hanover Houses.  It was one of those public housing developments that they built up in the '50s [1950s], so we got in there--my mother got a nice place there, you know--.  So, that's where--pretty much let me see--yeah, I stayed there pretty much until I was fifteen, sixteen years old.  Right up until the time I went on to college.  I would say I lived there, let's see, maybe fourteen, fifteen years.
Story_ID: 11095
Speaker 1: Where'd you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to Holy Redeemer Catholic School.  Then I went to McQuaid Jesuit Prep School for awhile then I went to public school for the last couple of years.
Speaker 1: Why did your mother [Ernestine] send you to Catholic school?
Speaker 2: Because they had a better program.  I mean she was committed to the, you know, the old--and discipline.  And they definitely had that (laughter).  So, I mean, I felt that--yeah, that was beneficial.  So, she had to find some money to do that but she made sure we got our book learning in properly.
Speaker 1: So, did you respond pretty well to Catholic school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't have no problem with it.  I mean it was all--.  You know, you respond or they knock you over the head (laughter).  I always had an interest in education and everything--.  One good thing about that experience which I think back on now, inside the composition of the class--the students--they were like Italian kids, black kids, Ukranian, Polish.  It was a very mixed multi-culti type thing.  And, that neighborhood I grew up in, that was like a lot of different cultures mingled in together, so I look at that as sort of an aid in my being out here dealing with people, you know.  Because it was people--all kinds of people--so that was good.
Speaker 1: So, did you learn anything from--?  Like, you know--what specific things did you learn?  Did you have any specific things you can tell us that you learned from the different groups?
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean, just--.  Well, like we had a choir that I sang in the choir and we sang Christmas songs and different songs and all--Latin, Italian, French, German.  So that gave me--.  I can speak several languages, so that was kind of an early influence for me to go on to be--you know--to study that.  And then, you know, like I said, visiting different friends, like some people, the parents still spoke the language they came over here with.  It's just the information that's available, you know.  I look at that as a direct influence on me going on to study languages and everything.  Because, like I said, inside of that choir situation, Latin, French, German, Italian--and then people in the classroom, they all in different families had different languages.  Plus there was a Jewish community around the corner there, they had their stuff happening, you know, so--.  That was a pretty interesting mix, you know.
Story_ID: 11096
Speaker 1: Were you an artistic kid, or did you--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, I wasn't conscious of--I had a need to express myself artistically as opposed to be artistic, whatever that means.  But I mean the drums saved me cause I--you know--that was a channeling for me to be able to stay out of trouble (laughter).  You know, cause at that age I know I had a lot of--you know--things built up inside of me.  Drums were definitely a challenge for that, just being involved in organized musical programs.  But, being artistic, per se, I would never think of it like that.  It was like it was that, or I don't know what would've happened (laughter) if I didn't have that as an outlet, you know.
Speaker 1: So, did you--you played in the school band?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played all kind of different--I played in a lot of different--I mean I sang in the choir and then I played in the marching band and then I was in the drum and bugle corps and then like little groups.  I used to go around the jam sessions at all these college campus, at the Rochester Institute of Technology, there was a professor there that used to have--he played drums and he would have jam sessions and I used to go over there whenever I could get over there.  They started real late, sometimes I couldn't get out, you know.  So I was--you know--it was a lot of different musical experiences.  Then, just seeing a lot of different people, plus the musicians that came through that club, the Pythod [Club], like Johnny Lytle, Grant Green, Wes Montgomery, Jimmy McGriff, Jack McDuff, people like that, I was seeing them around, too.  So, it was a nice mixture.
Speaker 1: Did you always play the drums?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I took a--I played a--took a little piano, studied a little violin, but drums was my major--was the thing that captivated me early, you know.  Cause I would hear the drums (laughter).  It was funny because when I was coming up, we lived just in this--it was the projects, you know, but the sounds--the radiator that we had that had the sounds like the tone and I used--(laughter)--the neighbors used to always complain because I would practice on the radiator with my mallets but it had a really full sound (laughter)--.  So, yeah, I would be beating on the radiator all the time.  So, anyway, yeah, that was drums were always the major influence--main influence.
Speaker 1: Now, let me go back to something you said a minute ago.  You said that drums were the release of a lot of tensions--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah, just tensions of growing up.  Tensions of being--not having, you know, not a lot of money and stuff, you know.  I mean I just had to get a little extra job, or something.  I never had no problem working and everything, but, I mean, you know, the wants compared to the needs and whatever in between that, drums were a vehicle just to, you know, elevate beyond that.  And, you know, just the pressure of growing up.  Beside from not being--like we weren't poor, but I mean we didn't have, you know, my mother [Ernestine] would, you know, she did everything she could--.  So I couldn't say that we weren't provided for.  But I mean drums were just a vehicle, just an outlet, I mean, like just the normal pressure of youth, you know, being a teenager and everything, all that.  Drums elevated me above the level of a lot of the stuff that was going on, you know, like gangs weren't really a factor, but hoodlum-ism (laughter)--.  You know what I mean though, just the little things cats get into like vandalism, you know, like little, you know juvenile delinquency-type--.  Like I was removed from all that by being involved in organized musical programs and the discipline of playing in instrument.  I think that gave me the necessary focus that I needed, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you envision that one day you would grow up to become a drummer--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, I was like--once I got beyond the initial phase of the technical aspect of it, I was on my way.  I mean I haven't looked back since.  I mean I had a vision of that.  That was my vision to play drums professionally.
Speaker 1: Now we didn't mention your siblings and do you have any--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, I have a sister.
Speaker 1: You've got a sister?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what's her name?
Speaker 2: Furaha.  F-U-R-A-H-A.
Speaker 1: She's right here?  Is she still in Rochester?
Speaker 2: She's in New York.  Actually, she's a dancer, singer and aspiring actress.  Then she does--she had a gallery in Atlanta for a while that was working out pretty good.  But she wanted to be in New York just to pursue her career.  So I had to tip my hat to her.  She went on up there at an age when a lot of people, you know, they would probably be set in their ways--she jumped on into the fire, you know, after, you know, really in the middle of her adult life.  That's pretty good, you know.  I wish her well.
Speaker 1: So, would you say your mother sort of inspired you all to get involved in artistic--?
Speaker 2: She made sure that we stayed in line, but then she tried to provide a choice--a range of things--you know, like a major variety of activities.  She did a lot, cause we went to see all kind of stuff, you know, we never lacked for any kind of stimulation, you know, intellectual, you know, emotional, you know, cultural, whatever, you know.
Story_ID: 11097
Speaker 1: What were you like in high school?  Were you like popular in high school, or were you--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)--Naw, I was like--I tell you I changed schools in the middle of the race, so by--in high school, I hung out with the people that I knew from the drum and bugle corps.  That was like--that was our little set, you know.  Cause it was some friends of mine, they were all--they got me involved in that--then I was in the band, and stuff.  So I wasn't involved in the student body activities, per se, I was really focused more on music.  Sports, I tried that out for a while, I said "Naw (laughter), might mess up my hands, or something."  So I really hung out with the musicians and people that--of similar aspirations, cause we had a little scene like the art students and the musicians like that, you know.  So, I think we were kinda like--not outsiders--cause I didn't think--I didn't feel like, you know, it was an intentional thing like that.  We just didn't hang out with the right--we didn't--like we never went to none of the proms and stuff.  I went to one prom, I think, sophomore, or something.  Then I said later for all that.  So we had our own little scene going, but it wasn't anything going just you know, being counter, you know, against anything, we had our own group, you know.
Speaker 1: Do any mentors come to mind?  Did anybody emerge either in grade school or high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, several.  I had--well one of my cousins, Bernard Mitchell.  He played vibes, tenor saxophone, drums.  So he was kinda always around for a musical influence and everything, I would say.  And then I had another cousin, Albert, that--he was a professional singer, he played semi-pro ball and stuff.  I used to go around checking him out at some of his gigs and everything.  So they were--that was the musical influence. You were referring specifically to that?
Speaker 1: Well, any kind--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) But I would say those were the two people that influenced me, you know, just in terms of checking out music and stuff.  And my having grown up without a father, I had several people that functioned, not as mentors, per se, but they kind of provided me a role model, and so, but I wouldn't really call them mentors, per se.  My cousin was not--he was just a good influence about the potential of music, you know.  And then Albert, he was pretty wild, you know, so I got to see the other side of that.  Cause he was like an R & B singer, you know, relatively successful, going around doing stuff, so I used to tag behind him whenever I could, you know.
Speaker 1: His name is Albert?
Speaker 2: Albert Hartzog. H-A-R-T-Z-O-G.  So as far as the musical directions or potential of something happening, I think they ignited the spark.  If not consciously, I perceived that I wanted to be involved in that, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you have any public interests in high school that, you know, would be significant, you think?
Speaker 2: Hum.  Not really.  Cause I--I mean I did a lot of different debate societies, this society, and that stuff, but the musical thing was really--that's what kept me centered, you know.  Cause the other stuff, I was really, like, I was problematic.  I mean it'd be all A's one semester, and C's or less the next, but, I mean the music program kind of brought all of it into focus.  Cause if I said in my mind that old stuff I was taking--.  Like I said, it was literally all A's one semester, you know, not flunking, but, you know, C's and D's the next (laughter).  But the music was pretty--gave an element of consistency to my searchings and what I thought I was looking for, you know.  That was the single element that I would say saved me.  My attempts to learn to play and pursuit of music gave me a focus that otherwise I would've--I can't predict what would've happened, cause I remember that as a single point from as early as--you know--early teens on.  Once I'd figured out that I could get past the rudiments of playing, just learning the techniques of the drums, that was my singular focus.  I mean, that kept me going every day pretty much.
Speaker 1: So you never really thought about anything--any other kind of career, you know, or any other kind of path?
Speaker 2: Naw, not really.  I mean I went to college, I didn't go on a musical scholarship, I think I got a psychology, or something.  It was not related but I got in school so I took--you know, I did that.
Story_ID: 11098
Speaker 1: You went to Central State [University]--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.  But I was a psychology major.  I mean he said pick something--the band wasn't really--I mean, I said (laughter).  So, I said, okay, I like the psychology professor, Dr. Lane (ph.).  I liked some kind of maternal twitch, or something happened, I guess, so I decided to be a psychology major.
Speaker 1: Dr. Lane?  What was her full name?
Speaker 2: Dr. Lane.  I can't remember her first name, but I remember Dr. Lane.  Sap Lane (ph.) was her husband.  You remember Sap Lane?  He was like--he was like kind of a legend around the campus.  I don't know the whole story, but somebody down--somebody (laughter).  I know I always heard about "That's Sap Lane, that's Sap--"  I think he was one of the coaches and then he was like a very well liked teacher, professor, too, you know.  I can't remember her first name, though.  She had a good influence on me, though, cause she didn't press me.  But she always said "You're not reaching your full potential, you can do this and that."  I said, "I just want to play music, you know,  this is a pit stop for me."  So I got out of that.  I went to Detroit after that.
Speaker 1: So the program at Central State wasn't really--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well it was a non-existent program.  I mean they had a marching band but they didn't have a performers' band or a concert band or anything like that or any kind of jazz ensemble.  What happened, we used to rehearse in the--at the--ROTC [Reserve Officer's Training Corps] building.  They had one of the sergeants--master sergeant--colonel, whatever.  He was the saxophone player, so he would let us use one of the rooms there to play and have jam sessions and everything.  And that was the extent of it. Except when we used to go in town to play.  They had a couple of joints in town, I used to go in there on the weekends.  But, other than that--that changed when [Makanda] Ken McIntyre came there--I think I had mentioned that earlier.  When he came in there they had actually had somebody qualified to direct the jazz program.
Speaker 1: Ken McIntyre was--
Speaker 2: He's a reed multi-instrumentalist--plays reeds and, sax and everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what year are we now?
Speaker 2: This is like mid-sixties [1960s]-'64 [1964], '65 [1965], around in there.
Story_ID: 11099
Speaker 1: You went to Detroit--you transferred to Wayne State [University]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went up there to visit one time.  I said, this is, you know, I checked out all the scenes, the clubs and all, and man, I said "This is it." (laughter).  Coming from Rochester going to New York a few times and then ending up in Ohio, when I got to Detroit, I was like, boom (laughter), you know.  So I really got--I got hooked up very quickly there and got into a lot of, you know, things I was looking for, for my direct--to further formulate my direction and goals musically.  Detroit was on fire, man, whew.
Speaker 1: A lot of good musicians in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Oh, man, it was all kind of stuff.  I mean just the number of groups coming through, cause Rochester, I mean, you know, they didn't have major acts.  They had mostly like organ trios and occasionally might be a concert, but Detroit got, you could see Freddie (unclear), you know (unclear)--.  I mean it was like they had the place called the Drome [Lounge] and Bakers Keyboard Lounge.  So they had several national rooms that booked national groups besides this organ trio.  That was like expansive.  And then the whole, you know, just that urban setting, it was a lot of stuff going on in Detroit, for what I was looking for, based on my previous, you know, my past experience, coming from a small town, that was like, you know, big, big.  I was happy, I got out, you know, Central State [University] was okay, but I could see I'm not gonna make it four years here (laughter).  So, I went on up there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you were in Ohio you had some contacts with musicians that some of the other colleges around--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we used to go over to Antioch [College]--I mean it was a whole scene over there where they--that the commons used to go over there--we'd play over there, play and jam--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Antioch College?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In Yellow Springs.  That was like the liberal--ultra-liberal school.  You know they had a--it was really kind of an open environment.  But the main reason I was there cause we used to go over there--we used to go over there and spend the whole weekend and just play all, you know, play all day, all night long if we wanted to and there weren't any restrictions on that.  We had that group called Afro American Percussion Ensemble.  I can't remember, I finally got so--but I remember one guy in that band, [Sydney] Sid Smart, he was involved in that.  He was big time from Cleveland cause him and his brother played drums, but he actually had been playing drums--set drums--like semi-professionally, much longer than me, so I kinda looked up to him for that.  And his brother was like a full time full fledged jazz musician, Chuck [Smart], he was like touring around doing all kinds of stuff, so that was a good influence.
Speaker 1: Let's go back, so we're back in Detroit and you're--did you get involved with a group in Detroit--did you--?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I was with the--one of my--well this was I consider as a mentor, his name was Charles Moore, he plays trumpet, he lives in L. A. [Los Angeles] now, but he lived in the same building as I did and I would go up to his place every day and we would go over, play songs, play tunes, and go over changes and everything.  And then, through hanging out with him, I met all of the people he played with, cause he was like full professional out on the scene doing stuff, so I met all the drummers and all the various musicians that he dealt with.  And, so that was a perfect fit there, cause I was on the campus but I was living--I was going to school--but I was living off-campus and in the building there were a couple of musicians there, so I got a chance to be, and just see, you know, hanging out with them.  And Charles Moore was like a major influence--direction-directional, like, you know.  And then, there was a transitional time--that's when--cause I was involved in a collective called the [Detroit] Artists' Workshop.  They used to bring in painters, artists, dancers and all kind of sculptors and everything, writers, poets.  But they brought in different people, performers, at the cooperative, and they would come and they would do a little--it was like a storefront--a double storefront scene--they had the little performances and everything--I don't know what they categorized that as, but it was our space.  So it was constant activity going on there all the time.  And additionally, a lot of the musicians, the local musicians, they would come there from--they'd rehearse there and everything.  So, that was another good--.  I mean, Detroit--well I hit the mark when I went there right away, boom, I was into the thing, so, that was a good move.
Story_ID: 11100
Speaker 1: At this time when you were in Detroit--you were--I know you were playing the trap set.  It's the regular drum set most people are familiar with.  What else did--were you playing and when did you start playing other drums?
Speaker 2: Somewhere along the line between leaving Rochester and going through Central State [University] and moving on or even a little bit before that I got started checking out the hand percussion--like I said that friend of mine--I'm trying to remember, Ralph Pedro, or Raphael?  I can't remember the last name.  The father gave me some bongos and they were always playing their music down there so I got kinda--got involved in that spectrum and then somewhere along the line I got a conga from somewhere.  I don't remember.  I can't even remember when I got my first set of drums really.  It was relatively late though, cause I didn't have anywhere to practice at so I--my outlet was the Drum and Bugle Corps and one of my friends Jackie Cotman (ph.) in the Drum and Bugle Corps--he had a whole set of drums.  He had a--he had a single family house so he could play his drums when he wanted to so I use to go by there to play--to drum--that's where I really came in contact first with the drum set and that was probably like--I guess I must have been around thirteen or fourteen--like that--say around in there and then--.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to play a set in high school--when--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I mean this--I'm just saying my initial encounter with a drum set--because I didn't have any--a set of my own with--at that place but then in high school they--I was in the marching band not as opposed to being in the--they didn't have a concert band or band that used drum set per se.  My--my vehicle at that time was Drum and Bugle Corps, and then like I said my cousin would take me around--my exposure is from grandmother [Lelia]--the club scene that was at the Pythod [Club] and that scene at the--like at the time I was fifteen or sixteen I use to go over to the coffee house on the campus to like--they had like a jam session there--so I and that professor that played drums there--so that was my earliest contact with the drum set.  Percussion--I'm trying--I got a set of--I always had those bongos cause I had those--I remember I had them all through high school and everything.
Speaker 1: Can we stop for the door?
Speaker 2: (Unclear.)
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, we were discussing the kinds of drums that you play and the--when you got introduced to certain drums and you were beginning to talk about how you got--you started playing congas I think?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, like I said earlier I got some--I had been given a set of bongos then some point along the line I believe my cousin might have given me an old tack head conga drum or something.  I can't remember exactly.  I do remember the transition--my hands getting tore up (laughter) cause I'd be playing--playing hand percussion you have to really--it's an evolution of pain you know (laughter), cause anybody that plays, you have to go through blisters and hand splitting and then finally you get your calluses you know, so whatever that process I'd be--I remember that but I don't remember the exact dates.  Then I do--I also--by the time I got to Central State I was involved enough to become a member of that African American Percussion Ensemble and then like Chuck Smart, he had been to Africa and Sydney [Smart] he was--they were all pretty much current on a lot of things so that was--that was a big--great source of information.  It was one guy--I'm trying to remember his name, cause he had spent like--he was older than all of us and he spent like two or three years like in traveling around Africa and everything.  Now he was--as I recall he was the one that came there and kind of formulated the group initially and kept it going you know, but he was like--well you--at that age if somebody's like twenty-five, twenty-six, that--that's significantly older--I just remember he was already out there in the world and everything, but he came back to school, but anyway--I can't remember that cat's name, cause I was thinking about that the other day.  Anyway, that was a major influence being with those people and then in terms of just stories about going to Africa and all the different, you know, musicians they had seen and then it was--there was a guy there from Philadelphia.  Maceo.  This cat was--he was--he was extremely gifted on--on congas, man, he was like--he was really like--we use to call him the son of Mongo.  Mongo Santa Maria cause he was--at his age he was extremely advanced so he was a big influence.  Like there were a lot of people from New York and New Jersey there that came in with me and they had all--and coincidently they were all into like Latin music and Latin jazz and everything--just that was--the timing was good so I really got a lot of information about that from them.  They had records, you know Cal Tjader and all the people like that and Eddie Palmieri and then it was another guy from--played piano from California.  He was an older student too.  They had--there was like a size--well a sizeable number of like students--maybe there were GIs playing or something, but they were all like twenty--they were mature adults in school--like they were older than us but they were like, you know they were already committed to what--the ones I knew playing music--they were--so that was a big influence on me cause they were actually doing it but this guy, he had a great collection of Latin music and also Brazilian music and stuff--stuff like--so that was a major exposure and then--I mean there was another guy that stayed down the hall that had all of [John] Coltrane's records and stuff.  So that was, you know, that was a good source.  The major one was at America--African American Percussion Ensemble.
Story_ID: 11101
Speaker 1: Tell us about the Detroit Free Jazz Ensemble.
Speaker 2: That situation evolved out of the--that [Detroit] Artists' Workshop collective I was telling you about.  I met a guy there that came there--the person that actually formed that group, his name was Art Fletcher, he was a saxophone player, flutist and he played percussion.  Our connection was more percussion, and he was like one of the cats just kind of working around gigs around the campus.  He had come from California and he had been out there at Berkeley--the Free Speech Movement and they played all out there and everything and we got into it cause he was like a rhumba specialist.  This cat would--played the shit out of rhumba, man.  So we had our rhumba sessions all the time and that sort--then they formulated a group that was--that was just like--they were doing gigs around the college campuses--they already had a drummer and I think that band was called the Seventh Seal or something like that--that was more pop-band oriented and then the drummer cut out and they asked me to do something with them, but then my focus was more jazz oriented so that kind of--you change the drummer, you change the band, you know that's an old saying.  So that--that whole--the Detroit Free Jazz situation evolved out of that because they--they said--gave you the ticket said, you wanna go to Europe?  I said, (laughter), yeah, you know, okay.  So that--and then when we were leaving to go to Europe we just came up with Detroit Free Jazz, cause the Seventh Seal was actually the drummer.  It was has his band, but he cut out so the other band members, some of them continued on and we added a couple of more people and we formed that group.
Speaker 1: How did you--how you get an invitation to go to Europe?  I mean how does the band--
Speaker 2: I mean they--they had--they were going.  They was just--we just packed our bags and went on over there.  I wasn't like going to tour or anything.  It was just like going--let's go to Europe and see what's going on, cause by that time I had already pretty much--I was beyond the thing of the school situation, cause I was--I was at Wayne State [University] in the--I can't--Monteith College.  That was like a special college they had like--it was an open program thing so I didn't really--I wasn't going to classes--I--that much.  I was just hanging on to get that scholarship money, you know, and so when that chance came up--I was working a lot anyway, moving on into that, cause I played with a couple of little blues bands and was doing stuff at the Artists' Workshop and different around--playing congas whenever I could.  So, they needed a drummer and they was--they was ready to go to Europe. I said, well I'm ready to roll.  So I sold all my stuff and we went out jumped--stepped--jumped on over the pond and went--went to Europe.
Speaker 1: Now what year is this?
Speaker 2: '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember it specifically because we left the week after [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] got assassinated, and we were--at that time I was living in Ann Arbor.  There was a lot of work going on in Ann Arbor--around the University of Michigan.  You know, it was like a whole little circuit around Michigan, Michigan State [University], Wayne State, it was like, you know, then we go down to Ohio or so far as Cleveland and everything, and I do remember now we were--we were out playing one week after King got assassinated and I was gone.  I--I was in Europe.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, how did you feel the King assassination?
Speaker 2: I said, I'm outta here (laughter), cause I think the States was getting ready to go into some anarchy--if they--if they assassinated King, this is really getting ready to get heavy, you know, so I mean had I not been given a choice to go to Europe, I'd probably wouldn't have gone on my own by myself.  That was just good--once again good timing, cause they--they said, I mean--and the way I was thinking then cause the riots had been going on and I was there for those riots the year before that, cause they were rioting all over.  I saw the riots in Rochester, New York, New York, and Detroit, and--.
Speaker 1: There was a big riot in Detroit right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I was there with the curfews and everything so, you know, just the whole political climate at that time.  They were--they were cracking heads left and right.  I said, man, I'm outta here.  So that was an opportunity to leave--connected with the music.  Had that not come up, I'm--I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have went out and bought a ticket to Europe, I--you know, just to go to Europe (laughter).  I would have got, you know, well, it's no telling what I--I'm sure I wouldn't have done that.  So that was good timing.  They needed a fellow.  I was ready to roll.  The political climate was incendiary (laughter), you know, so we cut on out and ended up in Paris, in the middle of the student riots in '68 anyway (laughter).  That was--(simultaneously) like going from the frying pan to the fire or something (laughter).  As soon as we got to Europe, they was--oh, they was tearing up the whole Latin Quarter. I said, (laughter), oh, man.  (Laughter), you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: So there were like riots in Paris?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, the students and the workers consolidated against anybody that you know represented any--I mean they had issues, but it was really like tear gas in the street.  It was basically the same situation that I had just experienced in (laughter) Detroit.  That was like, well--so we left.  We went on, we--I jumped a head of myself a little bit, but I mean I went on to Europe and we bought a truck and just started going around getting gigs you know, it was the summertime so we had a piano, we had everything in there--in the house.  We had--we had a whole acoustic piano.  We bought an old Mercedes delivery truck--had the piano in there--had the a bass, a couple of mattresses, you know (laughter) and all the saxophones and my drums and congas and so we just went around Europe playing at all the--like flea markets, outdoor fairs, you know festivals and everything.  That was the summer of '68.
Speaker 1: Now, had anybody in your band ever been to Europe before?  Or were you just going there kind of cold?
Speaker 2: I think a couple--the piano--either the piano player or the bass player had been over there--like student exchange type thing or something, but that never--it never occurred to me.  I don't know. I know I was ready to roll.  I said, Europe, yeah, cause somehow several years before that I said, I probably want--I want to go to Europe.  I had that idea in my mind, that I was looking for a means to get to do that and be playing too.  I wasn't going to be going to Europe as a--you know a vacation (laughter) or as a student, but I--I've always--when I was in high school I was kind of toying with that idea seriously, and it came up you know.  I don't know where I got that--where that came from.  I think about that sometimes, but I was all--I was committed to go there--to go to Europe.  I probably picked up some information at one of those sessions over at the university or something--they was talking about the European scene and all of that stuff.
Speaker 1: Now, you were about twenty-one--I guess--years old?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Yeah, twenty-one, twenty, twenty-one, right around in that yeah.
Speaker 1: So--so what did you think of Paris beyond the riots?  I mean what--what did you think?
Speaker 2: I had to get--I had reserved my opinion about Paris til later, because that was--that was a lasting impression--but I mean they was blowing up--if you come outside the whole--I mean it was--it was to the point that we--we got out--we went on to Switzerland to Lucerne, Switzerland.  It was time to get--Paris, it was too volatile, you know.  I mean it was like the area that we wanted--that where all the clubs and everything they was beating up, you know, knocking heads and it was a--I said I don't need this, man (laughter).  I just left that, you know.  So we went to Lucerne, Switzerland, and I remember that was the summer when they had--[John] Carlos and those cats they were at the summer Olympics.  I saw the summer Olympics sitting up in Lucerne, and you know we were getting some jobs around there--some gigs.  See, the advantage I had--two things.  Going to Europe with a band that was already--an established--an existing entity, so you are not just--you land there and then you got to find work with the musicians there, and secondly, the drummer--the drummers and all were good drummers and good bass players could always find work.  So a lot of times I would--if the band wasn't working, I would be getting--you know make money and buying food and do different things and make contacts, cause I would always--would always people would be looking for a drummer.  That was the situation in Europe.  They always needed drummers and bass players.  So that was a good thing for me.  So we did that--we did that off Switzerland for a while, then we went to Morocco.  That's where I met Randy Weston.  He was like the mentor--major influence.
Story_ID: 11102
Speaker 1: Tell us about Randy Weston.
Speaker 2: Oh, he was like--this cat was--the mystique--he was big, man, I'll tell you he's like 6' 9'' all dressed in white, jalaba, turbans, and we'd go by the house and the whole house was like a villa with all white interior, a white grand piano.  I mean this (laughter), white leather couches, man, it was (laughter)--it was beautiful, you know, and he's there--you know this cat, he's like black--you know, like dark, and then I'd say, aw man, I said, aw man (laughter).  King Weston, King Randy or something, but I mean I met him on the street because I was having a problem at the post office getting money.  They sent us--somebody sent us some money. There's this artist, actually Sophie Fordon was an artist.  She kind of adopted us--the band I--the Detroit Free Jazz Band and she--she did drawings of us.  She would come by rehearsals and draw and everything and she sold quite a few of these original prints and everything and etchings.  So we--we got--we got--we got low on cash so we called her back.  She actually sent us some money, you know, like a couple of grand or something and in that time that was like a nice taste.  So she was like kind of like a sponsor you know.  So we were having this problem with getting it released at the post office and I was in there going through the changes and Randy showed up and kind of you know, he--the one thing that--he's like our--I always think of him as like an ambassador of music--world ambassador, cause he knows the right people.  He knew all the people at the post office.  He knew the people at Cultural Affairs, he knew people here.  He knew--diplomacy at its highest level, you know, and combined with charm, you know, (laughter).
Speaker 1: Where is Randy Weston from?
Speaker 2: He's from Brooklyn.  So that was like when I saw him there--that's how I actually initially got the chance to meet him and then he has a son Azzedin Niles [Weston].  We were the same age, so I think we--we kind of hung out a little bit together.  This was in Tangiers, but that's when I first met Randy.  He had a club there and he was drawing a lot of musicians over from New York to actually stay there and live there and work together with the--he's still doing the project on--going of his--of the merge--the meeting between the North African--Gnaoua music tradition and jazz and that's how I've seen him play quite a few times, cause I use to play with Gnaouans every day when I was there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, can you spell that?
Speaker 2: G-N-A-O-U-A-H [sic].  It's one of the--it's a Berber tribe that they specialize in drums and in percussion and everything in Mor--I guess, I don't know if they are centralized in Morocco--well I mean that's where I saw them at. I haven't been to Algeria or anywhere else so--in the Maghreb, so--that's where I met him, but he--he has a working group of Gnaoua musicians that travel with him all--even now--thirty years--more than thirty years later so he evolved that whole formula up to--updated now and--so I met all the Gnaouans and then playing--hanging out with his son and checking out--that was the first time I met Randy--got a chance, you know, to see him, you know in the behind-the-scenes life, you know (laughter).  Real life, not just on the stage or something.
Story_ID: 11103
Speaker 1: You didn't stay with Detroit Free Jazz, I think, very long?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  Right, we left Morocco and went to Copenhagen.  That's where the band broke up, cause Art got sick.  Art Fletcher, the leader and we had--we made arrangements to send him home, which he died shortly--not too long afterwards--like Parkinson's.  He had some kind of like--one of those debilitating diseases type thing.  So that was it.  I mean, cause he was like the player that kind of held it together, you know his personality and everything.  Cause I was working.  I said, man, I'm outta here (laughter).  I had work--I started working in Copenhagen for a while then I moved to Rome--I went to Rome.  I got a call to go--I met some dancers that I had worked with.  See, when playing percussion when on the road anytime I needed some work, I'd just go play dance classes.  That was like money, you know, contacts, everything, a place to stay, wherever.  Get to a town, stuff get funny, you could always find a dance studio somewhere that needs you know, rhythm--rhythm accompaniment or something--well at least at that time anyway.  So, I met this Janice Miller, whose name is Halifu (ph.) now.  She moved to California.  She had a dance company in Copenhagen.  So I started playing classes with her and then I met some other dancers that came--T.V--that worked for the T.V. shows.  They were doing shows around in Europe and they said there was some--there was an opening down there for musicians--there was a lot going on in Rome and they needed drummers.  So, I was--I didn't look forward to spending the whole winter in Copenhagen (laughter), I mean you know, but I was working and everything so at that point I met those ladies there and I went to Rome and got it, and started working at the radio television Italian with a guy named Norman Davis and Bob Curtis.  They were two brothers from the States that went over there and they had like--they would do specials--they were like the artists--you know they did all the dance choreography for the T.V. stations--well, Italian television so that was a nice piece of work, but that's how I went from Morocco--we went to Copenhagen cause it was--the--so I had an extended visa, but some--a couple of people in the band visas expired, and in that time in Morocco, they were into this--Timothy Leary was down there talking about having some kind of free community on the beach (laughter), we were--(laughter)--you know so they were kind of leery of all young Americans, you know, then it was the hippie thing was going on and a couple of cats in the band had that look.  So, it was funny.  We tried to leave because there--there our visa had expired and usually if they'd find you without--with an expired visa they--and they--one of the guys I think his parents had some money--they were of adequate means to where they--had they fouled up with the government they would have been wanting them to pay a lot of money to get him out of the country.  So we were in the process of trying to leave.  We couldn't get out the country.  We drove up to the boat one day (laughter), they wouldn't let us leave.  We went back three days in a row.  So I called Randy [Weston] and he called somebody from--from the customs department and they--I think they was like, you know, and don't come back (laughter), you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, this is from what country--from--from--?
Speaker 2: This is going from Morocco to take the ferry from Morocco across the Strait of Gibraltar to southern Spain and then get back into mainland Europe.  Well, like I said they had some kind of--something was happening. I don't know. It was a combination of all of the stuff about people--like they had a whole lot of stuff for people going down there trying to smuggle hash and all that stuff and then they had the hippie thing and Leary was running around and it was a whole--the Moroccans were freaking out because of this whole influx of these American kids that were just you know, (laughter), so they were like--they were pretty much panicking about everything.  If we didn't look right, and I don't know what--what type we fit, but it was like they refused to let us get out of the country two days.
Speaker 1: Were there a lot of black Americans that were over there then cause I--I--cause we have other stories over there, some poets I know (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it was--there was some cats around.  It was a couple of painters--Ted Joans.  Ted Joans, I see him every (laughter)--he's an amazing cat, man.  Whew!  Just for like the mystique of the whole thing of going on--he really--he went from Timbuktu to--to Tahiti (laughter) and everywhere in between, you know, cause I would see him, man, we'd see him--we'd see him in Japan, in Africa, in Europe, the states, all over, and--so that was one of the cats--I think I saw him--the reason why I think we went to Morocco, cause we ran into Ted Joans in Paris and he was talking about--he's the one that told me about Randy Weston's whole scene in North Africa and everything, so we went down--.
Speaker 1: Ted Joans was a poet?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, excuse me.  So on the basis of that we were hanging out in Paris and he said, yeah, man, I just came back from Tangiers and Ed Blackwell the drummer is there, and he got different musicians in clubs.  It was a whole scene happening in Tangiers, so I went on you know, that was what--what made us decide to go to check that out cause we had an open agenda.  We could go anywhere, you know.
Speaker 1: Just for the record, can you spell Ted Joans' name?
Speaker 2: Ted.  T-E-D- J-O-A-N-S.
Speaker 1: It's an odd spelling.  Okay, so it was jumping then in North Africa, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Paris was--I mean--Europe was jumping--this was like late '60s [1960s].  It was a lot of stuff going on, cause Paris, Guy Griffin was in Paris, Slide Hampton, trombone player--Archie Shepp was around.  There were a whole lot of musicians from like the jazz and the so-called avant-garde type of thing.  They came right out of straight from New York, and see Paris, you could go--our ensemble when they left here they went to Paris, because in order to get in--they wouldn't let you get into England without a work permit.  If you carried a horn or anything that looked like a musical instrument, which that's rather odd considering that all the money that the Beatles and all the groups came over here and made, but anyway a lot of the musicians ended up going to France, because of the restrictions on immigration and all the work laws in England, which that was--that was a direct detriment to the development of the English jazz scene, because the French jazz scene--well, this is kind of--this is not controversial, but it's debatable.  The French musicians to me were more sophisticated--advanced, because they had more content on a regular basis with Americans living there and playing with them.  Like England, by them limiting who come in, they were--they were not--they were--they were not giving themselves an opportunity to play with the cats that could show--that--that frontline musicians and everything, cause all the top cats went to Paris--[Donald] Byrd, Miles [Davis], everybody and the French welcomed them in.  They stayed over there a year and played with French bands, musicians and everything.  So, it was an educational exchange--an artistic exchange.  By them restricting the cats like that in England, they--there was a limitation to their own development for all the jazz cats, which is not to say they weren't good players, but the French cats were more frontline current, like the Germans too.  I mean cause music is music, but some people--you know, you have--you have to be around the people that really created the stuff to really excel at their form or any kind of music like that it's better to be you, know.  So that's why a lot of people ended up in France instead of going to England, because England would have been much easier just because of the language barrier, but I mean France--there was no problem with that, but a lot of people would have opted to go to England first just because it was English.  So, the Art Ensemble and a lot of other people ended up in Paris cause they had a liberal policy towards coming in and staying there, working, doing concerts and everything.
Story_ID: 11104
Speaker 1: How did your mother [Ernestine] feel about you being in Europe, you know all this time?
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, I--I just let her know.  I was--she didn't like the idea of me having left school without finishing.  That was the major issue which I mean, in a certain way, for how hard she worked and everything.  In later years I really came to regret having done that, but I had to do what I had to do.  It was time to roll, you know.  So, I mean I kept in touch.  I sent cards and called all the time.  It wasn't like I was ex patre, I'm never coming back (laughter).  No, I kept in touch with all of my people and everything--so they got a whole big book, stacks of everything I ever did in Europe they got all of the documents, you know, so I wouldn't--I wouldn't never get involved in a scenario like that, just  completely estranged, you know--you know.
Speaker 1: And so were they excited about all the travel that you were doing and--?
Speaker 2: I mean I never--I--later on when it was clear that I would be able to support myself playing music--I wouldn't say their attitude changed, but they were more accept--receptive of that, but I never got--my mother always use to say, have you thought about finishing your education more so than what are you gonna do, or what are you doing?  I never felt any kind of negativity or any kind of thing like that was going to happen--happening you know, and like I was remaining in communication so that kind of pressure wasn't on me.  Her main concern was like really you went to school all that time, you should get your--you know for your own benefit and everything.  So, I never had any--any kind of static about that at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they were, you know, like I said--like any other parent they wanna see you be--do something substantive.  You know, it was like, what are you doing  running around in Europe playing in this band?  You know, what are you gonna do with your life?  So, there was little hints to that, but it wasn't like really any big pressure or anything.  I'm thankful, cause then I would have just spaced.  You know, I--would--I really didn't get beat over the head too much.  It was more concern than really about you just, you know, having a good life, getting an education, having to avail yourself of a good job and all that and I was appreciative of that, but I was definitely committed to the music.
Story_ID: 11105
Speaker 1: You're in your early twenties and in you're in Europe, and North Africa and you're--you're really making your way pretty easy?  I guess?  You don't seem to have a lot of difficulties or--or--?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have a lot of responsibility--I mean, but I mean we had a--it was like that's the difference between being out there by yourself.  We--I mean the team--I've always been committed to a team effort.  If one person gets something everybody shares and then you know--and then--so things happen when you function cooperatively as a team sharing like that.  The potential of things happening is multiplied by you know that the number of people involved to me, the rewards are that much greater you know?  So I've always been committed to that and it always proves to be true.
Speaker 1: So, so how long did you stay in Europe on this first trip to Europe?  How--how long--?
Speaker 2: Two months, eleven--two years, eleven months and nine days (laughter).  Two to that, and we came back--I--in--in the interim, you know, I--I joined--I went to Paris--went back to Paris and joined up with the Art Ensemble [of Chicago]--but that was two years, eleven months and nine days (laughter).
Speaker 1: You joined the Art Ensemble in Paris?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the Art Ensemble is a major part of your life so like when you first year about the Art Ensemble and what--how did this--how did your membership in the Art Ensemble take place?
Speaker 2: Well, I first heard of the Art Ensemble which at that time was the Roscoe Mitchell Trio or Quartet--whatever the composition of the band happened to be, but they came--they were part of this ongoing--this exchange between Chicago and Detroit--that [Detroit] Artists' Workshop scene I had mentioned earlier, and they came there to play and they actually stayed there for like--they came several times while I was going to school there, and I said, damn, that's what I want--I wanna learn to play music like that, cause it was extremely advanced, you know.  Tech--technically, musically, you know, like creatively and everything.  So that kind of--that was a big motivational thing and then Philip Wilson the drummer was there but he was like world-class drummer--he had Philip Wilson there.  He was--came from St. Louis.  He had been playing professionally since he was like a teenager playing in little organ bands and gigging around, you know, all kinds of stuff.  So he was like full--full-scale pro, you know (laughter), and--so I saw him, that was like highly motivation--inspirational to see just music on that level.  So, that's when I first ever heard of the Art Ensemble, with--from having seen them in Detroit several times and then when I got to Europe they were like--Art Davis was doing very well in Paris by the time I got there.  That's why the scene in Paris was like really--in the late '60s [1960s] from my experience was really--it was a lot going on and then having--from my conversations with some older musicians that Paris was always--they said ever since after the war, it was always a scene going on in Paris, so, we kind of caught the tail end of that and--not the tail end, but we caught it when it was peaking and then leveling off.  So that was good.  It was a lot of people there doing--from all over.  It was really an international music scene, you know.  There were a lot of people from New York--a lot of clubs.
Story_ID: 11106
Speaker 1: What was Paris like?  What does it look like?  What does it smell like?  What is--what is-- would you say--?
Speaker 2: I mean Paris is really congested, gray, you know, dirty, you know, but I mean it's an excitement there.  It's romance--it's a romantic city, you know it's the myth of all this stuff combined with the reality of like, you know like of an over-populated urban sprawl, you know?  But I mean, inside of that myth is that you get--it's a little New York like.  I would say little New York cause New York has everything and more you know, and then Tokyo is like that too.  There is a lot of--it's truly an international city.  London is not as much that cutting edge like that.  For my--me--well it goes back to the music thing.  Japan I got that feeling too.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: That isolation?
Speaker 2: I got that feeling in Japan although they are extremely isolated.  I mean you (laughter), you have--you take English, but it feels more like that potential of happy, creative, explosion thing.  I kinda felt little tinges of that in Tokyo, but Paris is like really traditionally for black artists and all kind of artists and everything from all over.  They--that's where, you know Paris has always been a hotbed, you know, or a place for that, and then they always had a receptive--like just the whole intellectual, cultural openness that I experienced there compared to the rest of Europe--that's just on a European basis cause like once you leave Europe, it goes into another zone.  I'll take Rio de Janeiro any day, and that's the height of urban sprawl, confusion, but I mean, the excitement of the people.  You know it's a whole--you been to Brazil?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Aw, man! Whew, the music is in the air.  France is not so much music, in fact it's a whole another kind of aesthetic.  Brazil, parts of Africa, Haiti and stuff, it's like--it's raw, you know, you can really feel it.  But getting back to Paris--Paris was really exciting cause then you got every kind of restaurant from everywhere in the world--you meet all kind of people, and then the whole--the whole--like I said the aesthetic of the people are more receptive to all kinds of new things happening and everything.  That's just the French.  That's part of the myth of the French cultivating mind and everything--that's got a dark side to it too, but I mean it was good--it's been good enough for a lot of people to over there and do their--do what they wanted--needed to do or which they maybe weren't capable of doing as well somewhere else, and that was the hook for Paris.  I mean, whew, man!

Speaker 1: Is there a difference in the way you were treated in--now you just left the United States on the eve of Martin Luther King's assassination--a lot of racial tension and violence.  Was there a difference in the way you were treated in Paris as to--as opposed to Detroit, or Rochester or--?
Speaker 2: That's a--that's a multi-level question, cause see like the treatment like--like their respect for artists and people being creative is one thing, then when you get separated from that--this--I--I--they--there's not that much great, oh, I'm going to Europe, cause they were dogging the shit out the Africans there, man, and see--I--and see they just killed--they just had the battle of Algiers.  This is '68 [1968].  Eight years earlier they killed a million Algerians.  Every day you pick--reading the paper, about, you know, Algerians getting mugged, kidnapped, you know beat up and their bodies floating in the river, so I've always had, take that with a grain of salt, you know, I mean Paris ain't that great, you know, and then as far as direct face-to-face examples of like racism--however you want to call it, I mean it's like, it's a white country and they have their same kind of tensions just like the rest--it's like the percentage of--of non-whites there isn't as great--wasn't as great as the same percentage as it was in the States, because I've picked--I've always felt the reaction would have been the same--possibly worse, and then when you examine their record just from the way they treated the Africans--I mean whew--I mean okay, for example, people of color, the Antiguans, the Martiniquians, you know from Guadalupe and the Caribbean, they were French citizens, but like the job--job opportunities in France for black people of color or people of color were non-existent.  Like you didn't see--compared to now, like just how you see black customs agents, waiters, you know like the pretty much in the mainstream of the working force--at that--in the late'60s [1960s], I mean it was, you know, you never--they were--there was all like domestic, type construction stuff like that, cheap labor, unskilled-labor type things, which it--over the course of the last twenty or thirty years hasn't changed dramatically, but at that time it was--I mean it was no upward mobility, and they had--it was almost like a migrant, indentured slavery-type scene they had with the Africans cause they would bring them in with illegal papers and then they stuff them into these little dormitories--twenty or thirty cats in a room, and the cat would hold their papers, and the work permit--and if they got out of line they would, you know, they would send them back out--pay them cheap and everything.  So that was life--that was one side of my experience about Paris cause I mean we really weren't oh--.  Everybody was talking about how great musicians--great Europe was--that was the white artists talking about that (laughter), cause the black artists that really were--that were perceptive enough to understand who they were--never bought into that, and plus, James Baldwin, when all these cats were around, James Baldwin comes to all the concerts and everything, and he was always like, you know, he was a good source of information about different things, cause he knew the whole scene over there, and just after hearing him talk about something--cause he was like one of the cats.  He'd come out and sit around, talk and everything, hang out do every--so I--my perspective was correct, cause I wasn't--I had no illusions about--and then just--I could give you a lot of examples of direct, you know, like racism or whatever, I mean, see the Europeans are slick cause they always--they always try to put Americans on a guilt trip.  I said wait a minute. That's white America's--you got--you know--(laughter) plus I'm here, you know, I'm here.  I'm--I'm performing, I'm bringing something over here.  I'm not on vacation and everything.  We are over here, we're making an artistic exchange, so we had to create another category for this stuff, but see, I mean you can--on any given day of any--any time on any given day, an incident could happen that would feel like you were no different from being in the States.  So this is really bullshit where they talk about--I just got tired of hearing about how Europe was supposed to be so wonderful, cause they dogged the shit out of the Africans, man.  Whew, and the way the English dogged the Indians--the Indian people from India, you know the Pakistanis they are--aw, man!  Cause, I mean we would always be conscious of who we were in this--in this world--in this environment, you know.  I met--I met some black people over there.  They was always talking that shit.  I said, man, but you know that's just like they don't know what's happening.  You know, I never got involved, cause that's--that's a discussion that could never--that would be ongoing, but I mean I read all--I read all their stuff, Negritude and [Léopold Sédar] Senghor and you know, whew, okay, I read--I read--I went through all of this cause I was reading--studying French--and reading French so I read a lot of their stuff in French, the whole Negritude poets--all that whole movement and so--and then we were right there in Paris and they had a great bookstore there, Presence Africain.  They had all the stuff--they had like French-Bambra, French-Wolof--you know and all the language studies and then they had the spiritual studies and stuff, a lot of information about the Dogon and then they had the whole--the radical corner and all of the political stuff.  So it was like--Paris was a good scene for that--just to have--depending on where your brain was at, you know (laughter).  It was a spot there for everybody (laughter), you know.  It was really, definitely unique.
Story_ID: 11108
Speaker 1: What about the other countries in Europe?  What--what was Italy like you know?  Was it any different--was there any difference than say Italy or say Scandinavia--you said you were in Copenhagen?
Speaker 2: Oh, hell yeah.  See, the Italians--the further south you go, the more soulful it is--the closer the people the warmer it is.  This is the United--I apply this universally, cause like Spain, Italy, Portugal, the spirit of the--the people is more--is more--I can relate to more cause then I'm like I'm tight in colder environments the people--they got another kind of rhythm, you know?  The Italians, now you could be sitting outside in Italy--other than the language difference you can just feel like it's somebody over there arguing across the street (laughter), cause they sound just like us.  It's the same--they--their the way they express--cause like the French, the French got one kind of thing, the Scandinavians are really cold, you know--like all of these clichés you hear are basically true.  The Germans are stiff, the Swiss got this thing happening--you got other--so I never generalize, but I will say the further south I go even including Greece--although they got a problem--identity problem because they think they are the founders of Western civilization, when Turkey is right across the street.  They've--they've got the Abyssinians, the Babylonians, you know? (laughter).  I mean when you go to Istanbul it's funny, cause they say, man, they're Greeks those kids, man (laughter).  I mean they got like ten different examples of architectural developments that--that you know, (laughter), so it's another one of those lies that became you know, well, I don't want to go into that, but the Greeks, they don't like the Romans, and the Turks laughing at all of them, cause like--you know Africans, the whole myth about Africans and all that stuff, you know, and--but anyway I know--I just know if Italy--plus they--the--some of the best food in the world really, but definitely in Europe.  They got the best food in Italy--hands down, cause of the Mediterranean diet, you know, a lot of salads--fresh--everything is fresh.  You know you could really get--and like nine times out ten you go into any restaurant--just pick--random pick, you can you know, nine times out of ten it's decent, you know, cause German food--French food--I got tired of French food because they put so much sauce on it.  That goes back to the whole thing of like the war experience--the cold weather, you know, they gotta preserve meat you know all--everything--the warmer environments they got everything, it's much fresher.  That--that's a kind of a generalization, but that was definitely I always approach that thing--and then just the whole--like I said the feeling of the people, the weather, you know, it's just like the Italians got a certain like--just got a feeling.  Spain is like that too, but then they got the Moors--direct influence from North Africa which you can see that.  When you go to southern Spain, I mean, they just said, okay (laughter), we just--cause they got--you got the Gypsies down there and all those people, so that's another how to hold--it's just the soul of a people.  The German soul expresses itself a lot differently which I don't relate to as well, and the Italians, they got--plus their--they like Sicily and Sardinia--some of those islands, they got influences from all over the Mediterranean basin--not just from the north you know, so you got--you got--and then a lot of Africans--direct African influence which is acknowledged.  Like the Europeans, the French and everything, they embrace Africa, but they don't want it--it's certain things they never--they want--they don't to acknowledge them having--having you know, the equality, culturally you know?  It's kind of a warped thing.  Like Spain, they don't have no problem with the connection between the Moorish influence.  All you gotta do is look at the Al-Hambra, so you know--and the Italians, they got that little thing with the Roman Empire...
Story_ID: 11109
Speaker 1: You had mentioned that you were--you felt that by being a musician you were insulated, you know, the celebrity I guess of being a musician kind of insulated you from the regular treatment you would get if you weren't a musician?
Speaker 2: But I don't even know--I mean cause the normal people--see at that time you didn't even see that many black people traveling.  So, they--I mean I got use to either you are a musician or an athlete.  So that's already a given, you know.  But my attitude was like "Yes, and we are entitled to certain considerations," you know, I expected certain things to happen.  I mean--you know what, this is not over like just hanging around and stuff--plus we got a band that is a working band, you know so--you know--that's like the thing that I've always--that's an attitude you always carry around--that--that like I didn't--I'm not in Europe because I am protesting leaving the States.  I'm in Europe because it was a good idea to come here and see some of the world and everything.  So it's like I would not hesitate in a second to go back home.  So, I'm not in no bag about America is not happening and Europe is so wonderful.  You know, (laughter), cause this is the kind of mentality--you'd run into some--some black people--black man who like ex-pats in the Marines and the Navy, you know, soldiers--cause it was like--it was a whole thing where they had just put all the Army cats out of France--[Charles] De Gaulle like in '65 [1965], I think they got--ran all of the troops out of there, and then even in Germany you see a lot of career--professional soldiers that stayed over there, but see, they stayed over there and became involved in the day-to-day German life, like maybe they were married to a German woman or they were living a town--see our perspective was always different because we came there to perform and after a certain imposed amount of time or when it was time to get out of there, you know, it was always looking beyond--I wasn't going anywhere with the intention of staying there and becoming a citizen (laughter) you know.  So that always get--that could give you a different perspective about any place.  You know what I mean?
Story_ID: 11110
Speaker 1: Did Europe change you musically, at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean every--every situation is a growth.  So I can fortunately say--is that--like the people I played with the--the--one major element of change was the level of professionalism--like I mean I probably--I wouldn't have been playing it with the T.V. spans and dance companies if I was in the States, you know cause that's like you know, it's just kind of politics--a different circuit.  So, my access to the type of places where I was playing at was like greater, I would say, cause I played at a lot of places.  I mean in subsequent years we played the same level of places all over, but I know one thing.  From my level where I considered myself at professionally, I was happy to be able to be in these circles of musicians or like places, like a distant level of places--Europe was good for that (laughter).  I mean you couldn't just go over there and not be performing--you know you had to be at a certain level, but for the level I was at I had great access to a lot of things that were like, you know, very important for my development as a professional musician or performer, you know artist and everything.
Speaker 1: So, were you impressed by any of the European musicians that you met over there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't have no problem--I mean good music, nobody has a monopoly on music.  If a cat wants to spend twenty years of his life learning how to play Duke Ellington, that ain't no different from my son spending twenty years of his life with the correct teaching and everything and learn how to play [Igor] Stravinsky or something.  Is--the issue is who created it, but I mean I'm impressed by anybody that's first of all--is has the discipline and the talent to be able to get paid and make a  living whatever kind of music it is, and then you know, to be professional performer and everything, it takes a certain kind of thing, you know, I mean even if I don't have any lines about--if I like some music, I don't--I don't make categorizations, but I mean it's a certain--there is certain kinds of music that require the same amount of input.  So if it's European, Japanese, Brazilian, whatever--when you play on that level, whatever it is, you become part of this society of accomplished individuals, you know, to be able to do something--cause it's a great ability to be able to perform or to be able to play or dance on a level like that.  You know, world-class level--that's--that's a unique type of thing--at any discipline, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned--.
Speaker 2: So you were--I would just say that Europeans--see I seen a lot--I saw a lot (laughter)--a lot of cats--they went over there, "Ah, the Europeans can't play any."  See, that's not true.  I mean I never bought into that, and see the very people that always talk about the Europeans--white people can't play and everything.  See that ain't the issue, plus it's a lie.  If you can't--I--I've seen cats--I've seen accomplished musicians playing--playing jazz blues or anything.  I mean it's just music, you know.  Like I said, they take twenty years to develop their craft--they--and they have talent--they gonna--they gonna--it's good enough, you know, now it's not like--like B.B. King or something, or Duke Ellington, or like [Luciano] Pavarotti, you know--it's no way--you can't deny a black person wanting to go study Italian opera and may--have the necessary training and talent, you know, just--just not the real--the original form, you know, but I mean, that's why I say music is--is--just ask anybody.  If you have access to the right training and right conditions and you have the right combination of talent and drive and all that, you can excel at most existing forms of world music.  It just takes twenty years--twenty-five years, you know, and any kind of like Indian music, Japanese, Koto--anything like that--twenty-five years under the right conditions--you'd be right there, you know, but you would not be at the level of the Japanese masters.  I mean--it's just to me--you see I vote for--I'd rather see the people--like if I run it--if I run it I see different people doing different things of all the kind of cultural music.  I want to see the people that have that in--inbred in their system from generations.  That--not somebody that went somewhere and learned how to do something well.  You want to feel the essence of a people of the creation--the evolvement of a musical form that might extend for three or four hundred years.  You know what I'm saying?  It's not just the notes, it's the whole thing about, you know--I--I'm at a loss of words for that, but it's nothing like seeing the real thing in the place where it came from, and the older the tradition it is, it is even better.  Then you could see a modern--you could go to a conservatory or something and they bring the guy in from Pakistan and he teaches how to play tiles,you know--that's--you know like they got a lot of--the world is small now.  But I'm just--I like to see these old forms played and performed by the people that created them with all of the--the intrinsic things and all the unspoken and all the nuances that come from that--from old traditional and old like that.
Story_ID: 11111
Speaker 1: You mentioned before that there were a number of black artists living there and celebrities that you ran across.  I mean who were some of the people that you--you mentioned James Baldwin, the author and--?
Speaker 2: I have to, that is so bad (laughter).  Hart Leroy Bibbs.  He was a writer and a photographer, aw, man, the painters, it's like a whole lot of--whew!  Oh, Bob, what's that cat's name out of Rome?  I can't remember, cause was kind of known--he died when he was young--when he was like--he hit real big all of a sudden, then he was gone, you know.  He did a couple of albums, cause I can't--yeah, I remember mostly musicians (laughter), I don't really remember, you know all--it was so many of them around.  It was just like part of the scene, you know, so--I--that's why I'm happy about in my experience coming up that there was still a meeting of the minds--all the different disciplines.  See, when I was--even at--it was kind of at the end of that cycle, but there were like--you--you would see musicians--you'd see painters at musicians--listening to music and they and then I made it my business to always meet painters and writers, so it was more of an exchange.  Now, it is like a separation of the disciplines.  I mean if I don't know any young painters to listen to us, you know, and I--I don't know any young painters that I'd go see.  So something happened where the gap came up.  I'm not only saying it's them not listening to music, I don't--somehow I lost access.  I got a lot of old friends from New York and from around the world.  We still keep in touch, but the music was the--was the thing that brought everybody together and then like a lot of musicians aren't interested in painting and everything, but the painters came to our--I was always interested in painting and stuff so I developed rela--friendships with a lot of--relationships with a lot of painters and writers and everything as a personal thing, but somehow I myself, have even lost that ability to--to be like in touch with that and we're not that busy you know.  I mean it's still time--I mean I would really like to be more in touch.  Like I can remember the '70s [1970's] and '60s [1960], even in New York, Europe, whatever.  If I see somebody stuff I'd like, I would go find them and like would go see the show and then if you meet them, something would always--would happen, you know.  Maybe they came to see the concert and it was exchange like that.  I was kind of--maybe got too--too involved with some other things to do that so--whenever I get a chance I try to--try to really to--to maintain that spirit, you know, questing for fresh things, just to be current, cause I like the--the whole painting thing, you know that visualization and the creative process.  You have to get outside of your own craft sometimes to be able to have a better perspective.  Just like musicians can be one dimensional.  I mean it's boring, you sit around--I mean they talk about the same thing all day. You go to painters they talk about--you know it's just--mix it up, have a little variety and then what's beautiful about it, everybody had music as the core--as the element that brought everybody together.  There was general agreement about that.
Speaker 1: Do you have any favorite painters?
Speaker 2: Whew!  Emilio Cruz.  He's like and what you call it--damn, I'm trying to remember that cat's name.  I mean these are favorite painters that are my friends.  I mean I go and see all different stuff, but Emilio Cruz, he's one of the most prolific, talented, you know, whew!  You know how--you know his work?
Speaker 1: I've seen it.
Speaker 2: I like Calvin too.  Calvin Jones?  Yeah, he's pretty tough.  I got--I know a lot of--there's another guy in New York, Amir Bey--just a sculptor and everything.  I mean, it's not so much that they're favorite painters, they're friends that are very talented.  So that's more than just being like, I prefer his paintings more than somebody else's.  You know, I mean it's a friendship thing too, cause--so I was just a pretty good listener of people, like photographers too.  Barbosa?  You know Anthony Barbosa?  He's--he's a great photographer, but he's into the music too.  He's into the spirit that created the spirit that we all had but back in the '70s [1970s] when the loft, jazz--all that stuff was happening.  Cruz and Barbosa and people like that were around with the same level of talent and other disciplines with commitment to come on out and seeing the music.  See that's always the hook.
Story_ID: 11112
Speaker 1: Were there a lot of Chicago artists in Paris when you were there and--and?
Speaker 2: See, I'd never been to Chicago, so I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well I just--know (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Well, I became Chicago when I left--when I left Paris and came here so.  There were always people between Lester Bowie, Joseph Jarman and Roscoe Mitchell and Malachi Favors--there was a constant flow of--of people coming back and forth that everybody knew, cause it was always a Chicago connection--same thing like in New York.  So, plus--we had a house out in the country.  So at any given weekend we--like somebody was always coming through from Chicago or somewhere that was doing something, and everybody kind of kept in touch so it was like--there were a lot of people, but by me not being--I don't know where--I was just there glad to be around (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now--now, let's talk about the Art Ensemble [of Chicago].  Did they recruit you or did you talk to them about becoming a member or--or getting in the band or--?
Speaker 2: Well, actually--.
Speaker 1: You said they already had a drummer that was--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Well see--okay.
Speaker 1: [Philip] Wilson who was like one of the best--.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, what happened this was when they were still touring around in the States--living in the States.  Philip got a call one day to go on the road with [Paul] Butterfield and--the rest after that--he never came back cause they went on and did Woodstock and you know, Paul Butter--Philip Wilson went to play with Butterfield Blues Band.
Speaker 1: Called Butterfield Blues Band?
Speaker 2: Right, and so he started making that long bread and making those long tours.  He just busy, you know.  He said, "I--I promise you I'll be back", (laughter).  You know that's cool--cats go on, you know (laughter), but--so then the Art Ensemble went to Europe without a drummer, that's how--that was part of the musical form evolved where everybody was playing more percussion, because at the time when they left--Philip had just left and like at the level they were playing at now, it was like, at that time it's like a drummer--just like we need a drummer, you don't just call up a drummer.
Story_ID: 11113
Speaker 1: Johnny Lytle was always--he was--he was hard core, straight ahead hip--I mean--that was really that essence of that feeling, you know, but I--I never heard anybody--they talk about Milt Jackson and all them--he was rated--he was really underrated.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Johnny--.
Speaker 1: Incredibly underrated, you know, cause that cat was bad man, he was like--
Speaker 2: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 1: L-Y-T-L-E J-O-H-N-N-Y, L-Y, L-Y-T-E-L.  Lytle, I--I think it was that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the Art Ensemble [of Chicago]--now, so you just said that the drummer went with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band--they're in Europe without a drummer and--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, you're a drummer and--.
Speaker 1: Well, see they had--well, there were several other people that they had in mind--cause I--when they got to Europe I wasn't even in Paris yet.  I was living in Rome--probably down in Rome at that time.  I think they went in early '69 [1969], in any case Steve--the late great Steve McCall from Chicago--they called him and--for--for whatever reason that wouldn't happen.  Then they tried to get Thurman Barker.  You know Thurman?  Thurman Barker.  Yeah, T-H-U-R-M-A-N.  They had--they had called all their boys back from Chicago.  See, Thurman was on the road working those Broadway shows.  So he said, you know, I can go to Europe.  I'll be in Europe next week anyway, but you know he was booked out for like a couple of years.  So then they went around--down the list of--of available--oh, in Paris--excuse me--of available drummers in Paris, cause it was one guy Jerome Cooper and there was Oliver Johnson, Noel McGee.  They were--oh man, Paris at that time was like really--there were a lot of people.  There were cats from California, St. Louis, New York, Chicago--all converged on the scene, cause it was like eight or nine different drummers on the scene in Paris--just that were my peers, not to mention Art Taylor, Philly Joe Jones was around--what's his name that played with Eric Dolphy?  I can't remember his name.  J.C. Moses--he was around.  Another guy--so it was like a--it was Art Taylor, Philly Joe Jones, J.C. Moses, Papa Jo Jones was living back and forth in Paris.  So it was like a whole city (laughter).  It was almost like being--cats would say, man, I see you more over here than I see you in New York, or some city (laughter), you know.  So that was good.  So somehow inside of the mix of that equation, my number came up, you know.  I think partially it was attributed to because I was playing--besides just drums, percussion too.  So, there is a story that goes along with, but I--I would leave that to Mr. Malachi Favors would have tell it, cause--cause my perspective on it is different than theirs was--the actual--how it actually happened the first day (simultaneously)--.
Speaker 2: That's what we--.
Speaker 1: Oh, I broke out on the stage (laughter), cause they were playing and I said--I just went up there and sat my congas up and started playing with them, and they said, hey, who is that cat?  They didn't know I could play drums too, and then I went over--I was working with Steve Lacy at the time.  Steve Lacy is the tenor--alto sax--I mean soprano saxophone player, and it was at the American Center for Students and Artists in Paris where they had--we had studios there and they had concerts going on.  I used to keep my equipment there and rehearse every day and all I saw, they would be sold out every time--that was the gig.  All the drummers were trying to get the gig with the Art Ensemble.  So I said I gotta do--what can I do to just get their attention, you know (laughter).  So they were playing and I couldn't very well bring a whole set of drums on the stage so I slid my congas up there and started hitting with them and that got their attention and then Favors could hire--like I said he would have to take it from there, cause they--I don't think my--my name would have came--they wouldn't have had an opportunity to see me--I mean you know just from--I was with Steve Lacy--actually after--after I came on the stage and brought my congas and played and they found out I played drums, they came to see me play with Lacy, but they might not have necessarily seen me with Lacy if I hadn't came on the stage and you know, just dove into it at that time, so that's--that was my take on that.
Speaker 2: So, you eventually become, you know, the drummer for the Art Ensemble?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean they hired me to do some--few things around you know, we just--like you know, we check you out a few gigs, you know, cause they were really looking for somebody--they were looking for a drummer to come in and be part of the band and then--but this here is more than a band. It's like a whole cooperative entity and everything.  So like the division of that is not--you could get drummers every now and then but you had to get somebody ready to commit to rehearsing all the time and you know doing, just--six, eight hour day rehearsals every day (laughter)--stuff like that.  A lot of cats they--they good musicians, but they might not be committed to your music.  They are committed to doing--playing what you give them well within the limitations of time and get paid and see you later.  So they were really looking for somebody to commit.
Speaker 2: What was the difference between the Art Ensemble and other groups?
Speaker 1: The work ethic, the diversity, cause I could--when I came in there man--see we use--when I came there, I said, damn, what if I--how am I gonna do this, cause they played all kind of music.  It wasn't just like whatever this avant-garde--I don't know where avant-garde thing came from, cause we don't know nothing about avant-garde, what does that mean (laughter)?  I mean we played all kind of--like Roscoe [Mitchell], Joe Jarman would play these minuets and flute exercises and then they had a thing--a hot twenties or the hot thirty--we'd pick thirty songs--just out of the air--anything you hear every day and try to play, you know and play them just to get to know--you know like warming up and everything--then we would play be-bop tunes--blues.  Fontella Bass, Lester's [Lester Bowie] wife.  She was like--in--when we went to Europe she was riding off the success of 'Rescue Me,' when she--she gave up a--successful career to--to raise help--to get with Lester, you know, raise their family--raise--raise their kids up and everything, but she was performing with us also.  So that was authentic, correct, high-level rhythm and blues--plus her roots go straight back to the gospel tradition and Favors knows all of that kind of stuff.  So we--whatever--.
Speaker 2: She plays the keyboards and--?
Speaker 1: She played keyboard things, you know, and--.
Speaker 2: This might be a good time--I don't want to interrupt your flow, but maybe to just name the members of the Art Ensemble and what their--?
Speaker 1: Okay, I--yeah, I had said that--touched on that briefly before.  Roscoe Mitchell, the original founder.  The three original members--it was originally Roscoe Mitchell--Roscoe Mitchell Art Ensemble--it was--that was even preceded by the Roscoe Mitchell Quartet.  Then--but the original members of the Art Ensemble--the three original members are Roscoe Mitchell, Lester Bowie and Malachi Favors, then Joseph Jarman joined shortly thereafter--then I joined the band in early 1970.  The instrumentation--are we back--were you asking about that also?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well okay--it's most like--it's been said that when we've played we have over two hundred instruments on the stage, but in any case--basically Roscoe plays reeds which is a soprano tenor, alto saxophone, flute, clarinet and then he has percussions--a whole percussion set up that he uses.  Joe was similar.  He played the bassoon, oboe, alto tenor saxophone, flute and he had his percussion set up too.  Lester was trumpet.  Trumpet and percussion.  He played bass drums, timbale, stuff like that, cow horn and everything and then Malachi was bass.  Bass, electric bass, banjo and the little instruments--we call them percussion instruments, and myself of course, percussionist.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--.
Speaker 1: But, see, inside of that format--the expansiveness of that format we had a traditional jazz quintet--if you will, without a piano player.  That was the only thing--that was the one--I mean it wasn't a standard rhythm section because it was three horns and a bass and drums, but it wasn't--it could be--we had the potential in that configuration to--to treat traditional jazz forms or you know contemporary--we could do anything, cause I mean the cats played so many different instruments and then we would just have--had hands on to so many different styles.  So that was the biggest challenge for me--getting in the band.  Everyday, you know, I never played this type of music at that what musicians of that caliber.  I mean I played what I played, but they was seriously studying all these different forms.  So every day was a study in process of at least--if not mastering a particular musical idiom--familiarizing yourself with it enough to where it's music.  Now, this was not with the intention of playing it on stage.  This was just part of the mix that we created to enable us to go further, because in order to extend forms you have to have a very good understanding of them.  You can't jump over a form and come up and expect--you--you have to go through that form.
Story_ID: 11114
Speaker 1: The Art Ensemble [of Chicago] studied, you know different forms of--of music, not with the intent necessarily of putting it on stage, but to understand more about music.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean--okay, we wanted to play--we--I studied reggae--I mean because we--yeah, we did reggae songs and everything when we did original music, but I mean we didn't try to make a jazz version of reggae.  I studied reggae from the perspective of trying--I went to Jamaica and hung out with the cats and everything--I mean I'll never be--I'm not committed to being a reggae drummer, but I--I took the time to understand the form and then I wanted to see it as it was performed in the original--where it came from.  So I went--that's part of my research for African music too.  You want to learn about a musical form, you go where it came from and you--and you, hopefully you--you have something to offer that will put you on a level to where you can actually make an exchange with musicians of the same caliber, cause the worst you wanna do--you don't wanna go somewhere and be a student with somebody, cause you'll never get to see the masters (laughter).  You have to go there bringing something to where--that the masters might come and check you out on the same level--not--that's not to say that I'm a master, but when I went to Africa, I--I had everything.  I was teaching and hiring people.  So I just hired all--all the music that I wanted to deal with--I hired the people that do that, and then by hiring them I had access--direct access to what they do and they by us performing together, that--that was the true exchange. I wasn't--I didn't go to Africa to study djembe in Africa, cause at the--if--I mean at the time when I--when 1970 I--you know Mor Thiam?  He from--he's master drummer from Senegal. The reason--we collaborated at--in St. Louis at the Black Artists Group in 1971. He was--he was the artist-in-residence for Katherine Dunham at Southern Illinois University.  So he would come to the Black Artists Group which was the equivalent--the St. Louis equivalent of the AACM--Association for Advancement of Creative Musicians.  He would come down there because the scene was happening, you know and all, but he wanted to study trap drums.  So, here's a Senegalese master wanting to study trap drums.  That means I got direct access, so I've--if--I mean, he would kick my ass on djembe, I could kick his ass on trap drums, so it's an equal--you know what I mean.  That's--that's the difference.  If you don't have anything that--of an equal thing to give to provide them or that they need, how do you become in a position to even be studying with somebody at that level?  You would be down there with the little kids (laughter).  I mean they are really strict in the old--in the traditional forms they are very strict about access to--to top levelers.  You just don't come like, you know, Western tradition is a quick fix.  You can buy it--you can just get a program (laughter), buy the thing.  I mean it's so--in traditional forms you have to--you have to--you have to have an apprenticeship--you might not play an instrument for--for some years before you know, before you actually play a note, you know, you might have to be listening or something.  That's a generalization or over-simplification, but my thing on that is--is the best way to go to anywhere to study is to have a program that you're going--that you're taking over there and then the idea is to have an equal exchange with hopefully a chance--if it's not both people on the same program, even more better would be both people on the same program and then a collaboration at the end of the day or something where you all get together and the two forms merge.  That's how you get to collaborate with the top people for--for advanced level of the music.  I--I got kind of off today (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, that's important.  You are talking about reciprocity and stuff like that--balance.
Speaker 2: Yeah, cause when I went to Africa I was ready to go.  I went to see Famoudou [Konate] I had a tape recorder for him, a fifth of cognac, some Marlboro cigarettes, some cash and you know, plus I was--I was performing on the same stage.  So this is like the cat--I'm named after Famoudou.  When I got there, that's the whole African--you had the masters like--they have--they have to have their props.  So when I--besides playing to the best of my ability of what I was doing, so I mean I was able to carry--he said, who is this guy Famoudou, you know (laughter)?  Well, I said, well while you're figuring that out, then why don't you try this--why don't you have a sip of this cognac (laughter), you know I was like--that's just the way it goes.  With the big boys you have to kind of like make them feel good, you know, the masters, you know.
Speaker 1: Now who is Famoudou (simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: Famoudou Konate, the master drummer from Guinea.  He's from--lives--I--I can't remember that town in Guinea.  Anyway, I went to Africa.  I went to Guinea specifically to--to meet him and to see him and everything,
Speaker 1: Guinea is the home of a particular style of drumming and--?
Speaker 2: Well, there's djembe drumming, it's Mandingo culture--tradition.  The Malinke-Mandingo tradition. Another half hour?
Speaker 1: No, no.  Can you spell his name for us please?
Speaker 2: Oh, F-A-M-O-U, well, actually, it's Konate family name.  K-O-N-A-T-E, F-A-M-O-U-D-O-U, and he's like the one--one of the most renowned practitioners or masters of the craft of Mandingo djembe drumming.  So I went there to see him since I had the audacity to (laughter)--to like think of how I was going to name myself that (laughter). So I got my name.  I was sanctioned to have the name but I--I went there--you know we were touring in Africa.  I played in Conakry and Sierra Leone and Liberia and different places, you know, but I have--like I said I was hired--I hired musicians.  My clause was an exchange clause.  I wanted to have, you know we each--we would both be involved in the same program.  It was an international musical exchange.  Like one guy was a--well it was an international music exchange, but then there'd be a valley of this thing or some kind of local renowned master or some instrument--then we would--we would be a double bill then at the end we would try to--you know we probably might have a rehearsal or something just to make something happen.  With musicians of a certain caliber--the music's good, something can happen.  So, that was--that was my way of having access to a lot--to Famoudou--to the Guinea Ballet.  He was playing there the same day we were playing in the same place and he was right there so.
Speaker 1: The Guinea Ballet is a traditional--?
Speaker 2: The Ballet Nationale of Guinea--of the Republic de la Guinea.
Speaker 1: The traditional dance of the country?
Speaker 2: Right.  I got some--you asked me about photographs.  I got the photographs for you for that, but that's the traditional dance and traditional drumming various--all the various tribal ethnic groupings inside of Guinea and then like there's a lot of--there's a lot of--but it's--it's a whole show.  You ever see the Guinea Ballet or the Sene--well, you know what I'm talking about (laughter)?
Speaker 1: People who don't--who--who (simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: Oh, so we have to--I have to expand on that, okay?  Well, if you don't know (laughter)--you have to get a video or go out or go out and see it, but it know they just deal with the whole Mandingo culture or tradition. I don't--don't get me too far into it because it's more to it than that, but I mean it's--it's the traditional music and dance and drumming and acrobats and all, etc. of the Guinea--that whole tradition in Guinea--then they got a ballet for Mali--they got one for Senegal too.  Guinea is like always--well, I--that's debatable too because the Ballet Nationale de Senegal--they are all world class performing ensembles though.
Story_ID: 11115
Speaker 1: Can you describe what the Art Ensemble [of Chicago] sounds like?  But I also want you to describe what the Art Ensemble looks like onstage and how is that different from, you know a whole lot of other, you know--and why?
Speaker 2: With the Art Ensemble it's just two things--it was a vehicle--the maximum, the heightened form of individual expression but then filtered through the maximum, heightened form of a group ideal or a group concept or something the group prescribed for.  So that means you know everybody is encouraged to be yourself inside of the group identity.  So that's--and then if you have any kind of conflicts with that, get your own--you can have--you can do what we're doing here in expression of the five-headed thing that this.  The five minds, and then you free to go and explore these other ideas which may and may not be able to be accomplished--have your own band too, you know, so that (laughter) did--you know--so that was--and then in that context the look, everybody in the group pretty much had their individual like characterization personality.  They--it could be generalized to say that me and--myself and Malachi Favors and Joseph Jarman--we had the face paint and everything, but I mean each one of our styles or the way we did that was uniquely different and then Roscoe [Mitchell] had his own way of dressing and Lester [Bowie], you know, had his own thing too.  He wore the lab coat and he had all kind of uniforms, like a chef uniform--clown.  He had a clown suit.  He had cowboys uniform (laughter), baseball uniform, high school and surgeon--the green surgeon guy.  This was like thirty years ago (laughter).  So, he had a whole thing set up--he had the railroad conductor's uniform (laughter)--all kind of stuff, and then he finally settled on the lab coat--that's what he, you know, and then we had--I think--well then we painted--painted our faces.  Some of us did it, because when I first joined the Art Ensemble everybody--Roscoe painted his face and Lester too, but eventually they kind of moved on away from that--using the make-up and everything.
Speaker 1: Now, why did you paint your face, I mean what--what was the idea behind that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I liked--I just felt the whole thing of like the whole personality rising about the--the level of just--I mean it made me feel like I was in contact with a greater spirit of the whole tradition that--see we don't have a specific tradition connected to that.  In my research of different cultures, like Native Americans and the African cultures--the Aborigines--all the places--cultures, the tattoos--Fiji, all these different places they have--there is a specific thing connected to that so I can't--I couldn't create a system that would be relative to that.  I just create--I just was dealing off of a feel like what--what I could express myself by using the colors--colors--color theory is another thing, but I mean the meaning of the symbols is something different.  We--that's not part of our culture.  So I wasn't--I never really took a symbol from another culture to try to recreate that, you know--that let them have that (laughter)--you know respect the other culture but I mean I--the combination of colors I had--I had certain things that I was trying to invoke just for what I was trying to express to get out of myself to play--to be better in position to play the music, you know.
Speaker 1: Would--would it be correct to say that you were extending the culture--I mean--extending culture by doing that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I felt like we were embracing--I mean I seriously studied--I studied all shamanism and different--I studied--I mean serious. For me it was serious that I went on--I went to see--I went to the Museum of Collections.  I was fortunate enough to go to the places to see perform and meet the people that actually were doing painting up and everything--went to the African villages, you know, I read my books and everything.  So I don't know where you draw the line on how much information can be amassed, but I did approach it seriously in the time of--time I had for what I wanted to do that I felt I had amassed enough information that I could start have--create--having a self-expression in the way I wanted to do that for myself--although we are not connected to any kind of system like that.  You know what I'm saying--we 're not connected to anything, we just started painting our face so I wanted to be more than that, you know.
Speaker 1: Did--did you feel connected to--to the--the--culture?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I could--I mean (simultaneously)--expressions, you know (simultaneously) for what they were trying to invoke and the reasons why they painted like they paint for war, they paint for different reasons--certain colors mean certain things.  I just created a system and decided what I was trying to do that would reflect that from what I doing.  Even though there is no system that is connected with that.  I wouldn't--I wouldn't like invoke--paint--I wouldn't go out painted up as a messiah warrior, you know what I mean, cause I'm not a messiah warrior, but I am a warrior.  So I got a certain thing when I--when we get ready to go out and do our stuff, sometimes you feel like you going to war, you know, so my mindset--and then--that the whole face painting and everything--certain colors do certain things, it takes me out of the immediacy of who I am--I'm getting ready to do my job here, you know, so that--it's kind of a mystical, spiritual thing, you know, and Favors was like in the simplicity of his approach to it, mine may be more complicated.  He accomplished the same thing and Jarman, you know--I mean I just had to look--we had a reaction, we're evolving our own system right there based on what we--out of our respect for those other cultures that actually have a ritual, formalized thing they connected to this than what we were doing, and after a while--after a few years, I started feeling like that became our formalized ritual and structure, you know, but I never really--really painted myself with another--I probably evolved the thing that made me satisfied that this was--that this facial--this form I'm dealing with, because this is helping me through what I'm getting ready to do to express myself.
Speaker 1: Now with the colors, now does the significance of the colors--?
Speaker 2: Well primary colors--certain colors do certain things and then I'm not going to even go into that too much, but I kind of got off into that a little bit, so I had common--then certain colors I liked--I mean we was free to do anything we wanted to.  I just didn't like--never wanted it to be like, this is African face painting, you know (laughter), cause it's--it's like, it's more than that, cause I'm not--I'm not dealing--I--if I wanted to be that, I'd be dealing with a system that I would be knowing what I'm doing, so I mean--we just--I felt like I was evolving my own system, just on a day-to-day basis.  As long as I didn't step on nobody else's toes, you know, then you'd be a fake face painter, you know (laughter), like it's a gimmick or something.  This wasn't no gimmick, you know.  That's why I don't paint for every occasion.  When the Art Ensemble--that's part of the mystique of the Art Ensemble, but I don't think a lot of bands want me to paint. I might say, what there's no mystique connected to that.  You just want to--you are going use me for my imagery--we're evolving with that just to stick it up in your thing (laughter), you know.  You can't even pay me for that--no paint.  You know it's like the vibes are not right, you know.  It's not--it's the spirituality connected to that.  We are serious about that.  You don't give a shit about face painting, you know (laughter).  You say, aw, man, why don't you--did you bring any of that paint with you?  Naw, I didn't bring it.  Hell naw, not for this situation.  I respect your music, but you don't get that cause your attitude ain't right, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is like both intellectual and spiritual on some level now, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's primal, cause I mean I could go out--it's just like giving us--the artist is getting ready to paint, we're getting ready to go out there--the mind gets focused.  I feel like the combinations of the colors and everything is putting me and my mind into a place where I want--I've in training for this moment, you know, and then there are--the whole act of doing it right--the attention to detail--it's real--it's a good--I can see where--how that could be with the level I'm doing on is an extension of like the formal ritual that--that goes along with these cultures and do--I--I got a feeling for what that is, but I don't use--I don't have to go there, but I do--I know what that feeling.  I have certain ways I do--when I do that I'm ready to go out and take care of business, you know, just for that particular--for the Art Ensemble thing.  I don't need--you know face paint.  They don't--I don't like to that for everybody, cause it's just like that's not for every occasion.  It's just for the Art Ensemble.  Maybe once in a while I might do it.
Speaker 1: When you go see the Art Ensemble though do you see a certain visual image--people see it and recognize this as the Art Ensemble?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they recognize it all over the world (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) form?
Speaker 2: And they recognize the whole, see like somebody equated--the way our instruments are set up, it's like--it's like a machine, a creative machine that was like getting ready to prime and to get ready to take it to almost like levitate it or something.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: I never thought about it like, I mean cause we had--the music--the instruments--it's a certain aura, it's a certain thing that haunts them and comes around them even before they get played, cause I--I went out and checked it out one time.  I said--cause I never looked at it from that perspective and it's almost like the instruments were ready to play themselves, cause they were finely tuned.  The area, see everybody really worked hard on--on the--like Roscoe really evolved a really particular thing--each valve placement, you know, it's a whole thing about mechanics and the instrument making and all that and then Jarman had his section.  So all of the--then it all fit together like the pieces of a puzzle.  It took years to evolve that thing, then when you are getting ready to play it too.  Like I said, sometimes you could--I could almost anticipate that the machine was getting ready to play itself.
Speaker 1: So the stage is covered with a range with over two hundred instruments?  You've got gongs--you've got gongs--?
Speaker 2: More than that even (laughter).  Gongs, triangles, all kinds of stuff, cause we were interested in sound research.  Well see, like having sound is one thing, but then when you get instruments up there--you know I'm not going to bring no instrument up there that I don't know what I'm doing with, just to be able to make one or two, you know, I have a certain commitment to the instrument and the music, cause then people say, yeah, that cat got--well, I don't even want to mention no names, but some--I've seen musicians play an instrument.  They can't really play them.  They might play one song.  It's good, you know like I've been really cautious about that.  So all the stuff we had--.
Speaker 1: So it's a gimmick like?
Speaker 2: For whatever--to me--it's not really a gimmick, but it's like--it's--it's unlimited.  They--I'm saying as good as you can play your primary instrument, how can you--how can you get out there and play an instrument like that?  Cause you played too well on the instrument you played to do that.  I mean really good cats they would never do that.  I've seen some people that played pretty well and then they will kind of--they are not all the same level musicians--musically as they are on the main instrument and they still--it take a lot of nerve to go out on the stage and try to do that.  It depends on what kind of music you playing too.
Story_ID: 11116
Speaker 1: I was just saying I always really try to learn what I, you know playing--getting all these different knids of drums and everything.  This is serious business.  This is life--life work, you know studying the forms, playing--playing--learning the authentic form and everything.  Some of that and then the payoff is if you really want to get far--you just hire the people that actually do that.  Like, we had, you know, we been dealing with South African music forms a lot because they are the closest harmonically and you know the chords and everything to--to the jazz tradition, the South of the--all of the Africans cats playing jazz horns and stuff, the South Africans got the closest feeling to jazz in my--I mean by a long shot, but anyway we had been having this back and forth dialogue with--like Dollar Brand, Abdullah Ibrahim, piano player from Cape Town, Dudu Pukwana, alto player, so we always had this thing, the Art Ensemble of Africa, or Art Ensemble of Soweto, Johnny Dyani, we worked together.  He worked in my band for a while--bass player and so eventually we had a project where we did with Johnny Dyani--didn't--we had a eight piece choir from Soweto, the Amabutho Zulu [Male] Chorus--we did a project together.  So that was like, this is--was the beginning of a collaboration that went on for about fifteen years with South African musicians.
Story_ID: 11117
Speaker 1: ...The mystique of the name--when I heard it, I was like--.
Speaker 2: Did you know about him [Famoudou Konate] before you--you became Famoudou or did you (simultaneously)--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I found out fast soon enough.  I mean, Famoudou, you know (laughter), cause there was another guy Todougou Fanu Traure (ph.).  He was at the same level.  He's from Senegal, one of the great masters, so I--this all came down through when I studying with Mor Thiam.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Besides just Mor Thiam the Senegalese master besides just--besides us exchanging musical traditions, we also talked.  He was asking stuff like about Duke Ellington and about different, you know he was getting a jazz education while I was getting--.
Speaker 2: Let me just interject for just a second--folks that listen to this know where we are.  I was asking you how you got your name Famoudou.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So I first heard about Famoudou from Mor Thiam.  Well actually I heard about Famoudou when I was in Paris, cause I was playing with a couple of dance companies.  One of them was the Elsa Wolliaston Dance Company.  She is from East Africa, but she had a lot of--she always had--it was like a Pan-African ensemble with a couple of American dancers and musicians thrown in.  So, Famoudou--.
Speaker 2: She's from Kenya, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Kenya, right.  But Famoudou is one of the names that came up and I said, who is Famoudou?  Then I found out from Titos Sampa who's a master drummer from Congo--the Congo--Republic of Congo.  He's been in the States for a long time now.  We kind of came up together while we were in Paris, but then there were drummers there from like Congo, Ivory Coast, Mali, Senegal and everything and then Famoudou was like every (laughter)--so didn't--Mor Thiam kind of gave me more in-depth explanation about the myth of Famoudou when we would--we do our studying together in St. Louis in 1971, 1972 around in there.  So that's how the name--I really familiarized myself with the name.  I first heard about it in--in Paris and then I actually found out who Famoudou represented more by--in talking with Mor Thiam.
Speaker 2: And then you finally got a chance to meet him.
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Story_ID: 11118
Speaker 1: We were talking about the look of the Art Ensemble [of Chicago].  Let's discuss what the Art Ensemble sounded like.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'll tell you what the rehearsals was like.  It's like every day--it's like we use to rehearse eight hours a day, matter of fact, sometimes we would--we would pack our instruments--we had a Greyhound Bus that bought in 1972 with the proceeds from our first record on Atlantic [Records] and combined with playing at the Ann Arbor Jazz and Blues Festival, we bought the Greyhound Bus cause we were committed to taking all the instruments in one vehicle to either work or whatever we were going to be doing.  So an extension of that idea was that we were able--we were completely mobile all the time, and then time permitting which we found time and made time, we were--everybody would stop whatever they were doing and get on the bus and we would go somewhere, rent a house and just rehearse all day, cause we did that in Ann Arbor, we did that in Portland, Oregon.  We did that in Tucson, Arizona.  We were out at San Jose, California.  We were out on the East Coast for a while--they went to Europe like that except it was three vehicles then.  So, anyway, that's--that's how we were moving around.  The sound is like---it's a combination of all the individual voices coming together for--to make a unified statement about some kind of creative idea--that's laughter, I mean you know we were like--cause he always called it improvised music.  It's not improvised--I mean it's improvised but the hardest thing to pay is improvised music, because improvised music means that everybody has to be in agreement about something that's not--that's unknown.  Like a standard--a standard tune is not improvised.  Improvised to me means that you got to create something--it's not something out of nothing and it certainly isn't free it's--it's like kind of like if you're playing with people--if you're playing--if you're improvising by yourself, it's the flow of your ideas, and--and it becomes improvisational because of the combination of--it doesn't have to be things that haven't been heard before, it just--the combination or the relationship of the sounds to each is what it improvised.  So, if--if either--if it's not improvised then you are playing a familiar song, but you can play a familiar song and then improvise on that too.  It's just then the notes start changing.  So, inside the Art Ensemble you got five minds united together to create an improvised form that's heavily rooted in thematic concept (laughter).  That's (laughter)--cause we  had played all these different themes and everything.  Some of them were made up, some of them--a lot of them are written--like we got four or five different ways that we compose, cause it's oral, it's the oral tradition, it's the written tradition then Roscoe [Mitchell]--a couple of the cats had evolved their own system of notation.  Then some--a lot of the stuff ESP [extra-sensory perception], cause you, they--you playing together for --the group stayed together twenty or thirty years.  Like, you know--you ever see the Modern Jazz Quartet?  I mean the stuff they do is like--that's not--that's not on the page, you know when you see Duke Ellington's saxophone section, the same cats together for twenty-eight years. The stuff they do, that's like the whole another kind of thing.  Like [John] Coltrane's band had that, you know certain--I mean bands that stay together a long time playing their own original arrangements and original music really have that, cause you could have some people that stayed with the same band for twenty-five years, they just playing the charts, you know.  So it's an element of originality involved in it too.  So, the Art Ensemble sounds like all of these things and more, cause we got a whole thing, a whole catalogue of written--our own original compositions, and then we hired other people to play with us to give an enhancement of like a certain musical form we were trying to--not to recreate, just to pay tribute to a certain style of music.  We'd get somebody that does that, then we play our version of that--cause I mean--then--then it's just the unknown, you know, go out and sometimes we'd go out on stage we wouldn't have--have a specific order of songs.  We use to it "stoop" and "hit", you know, stoop down and come up firing, you know (laughter), but I mean because we played so many different type of things--like we had a thirty, forty--thirty or forty-five minute period everyday where everybody would really try to play something together that wasn't--with--like really--that wasn't really anything that we do, but it could be from anywhere, but the idea is to find a note that fits in with another note--that fits in with another note, that's--that's the path towards freedom.  See, playing free is not just playing a lot of notes.  Playing free is having the freedom to play any kind of thing that might come up, but it had definitely have to have the ability to make it be in context, so it's not really free at all it's just the--like you can just--you can like play the Star Spangled Banners and play Jingle Bells at the same time.  That could be effective depending on how the person puts the notes together, you know, so that--that might be in the context of playing Star Spangled Banner--all of a sudden Jingle Bells coming on top of that.  That's getting close to being free, because that's the kind of relation that's a random thing.  You wouldn't necessarily--that's not a way it would normally be done.  That's a path toward freedom, that's not real freedom, you know, but freedom comes from--from themes or improvised things that meet at a certain point and make sense musically, but they don't have to be connected to any previous forms.  That's why I would have never be comfortable with anybody talking about free music, cause ain't none of this thing--you know.  You know how hard it is to do that man, to reach that point by yourself or with other people where it--it takes any existent familiar tune or a couple of notes and be able to extend that and have it make sense and then play it with somebody else in a random form, which is not really random at all because the people had to be in communication--the notes had to be in tune, you know the time--the rhythm--see the freedom is that you are free to play any rhythm.  The trick is can it work when you try to put them together?  That's why it is not free.  That's work.
Speaker 1: Okay, but some people when they hear Art Ensemble, they hear Sun Ra, they hear Pharoah Sanders--.
Speaker 2: Sun Ra [Ramses], excuse me, because Sun Ra is like--his band, they were well-rehearsed.  In order to get that many people willing to play off of the page--you have to be rehearsed to have it sound like something.  See, that's the difference between getting a bunch of qualified--talented musicians and then saying, we're not going to play any kind of arrangement, just play anything you want to play.  Those--there's no band that's working, getting paid doing that (laughter).  I mean Sun Ra was able to evolve with certain form because they rehearsed all the time.  They rehearsed all of his music.  They be playing-- rehearsed all Jimmy Lundstrom, Big Band songs, but--nursery rhymes, everything.  I use to go up in New York.  I was up there in the '60s [1960s] a few times when I was kid--hung out at Sun Ra's place.  That's all they did was rehearse.  I mean it was like six, seven hour rehearsals.  Grown men--then they would have brown rice and some carrots and they'd rehearse some more (laughter), you know, but I mean that's the way--I mean whatever they say about Sun Ra all or whatever it is, this cat--the band was tight.  For anything they did they had fifteen people on the stage, twenty-two people--they were in communica--they were in--in agreement about whatever direction it was going to take because of the experience of doing it all the time together, you know.  It's like, that's the beauty of the five-mind concept with the Art Ensemble.  We played together and worked together and rehearsed together so much that most--it's like sometimes the freedom is not to play anything.  So, you had to have--have--if somebody--if you get up in the band and you are suppose to play then the drummer starts playing, the bass player might freak out or something, you know (laughter).  I mean you had--you know it's certain little things, like if the bass player drops out or do different kind of things, all that comes to law of rehearsing, working out ideas, being willing to try different stuff so that--that all adds up--combines to--to make up what the Art Ensemble--you asked me what the Art Ensemble sounds like.  That's what--we got original songs--we got--then we got songs like just themes that we write based on other musical forms like, you know just paying a homage to a certain kind of tradition or a certain kind of music.  Just trying to write original--an original composition using some of the formula that it takes to write that kind of music.  So, you write--you write a song that's written in that form, like in the reggae form or in the tango form or in some kind of be-bop form or something like that, or maybe an African folk tale form.  So you can study these forms and then you can--the idea--we had a vehicle for creating expressions of original music, plus the music had to be together.  It couldn't be just a work in progress.  A lot of the stuff that cats brought to the table didn't get played cause it wasn't ready.  So, then that was part of the process in the band too, of what it sounds like.  Just cause--see a lot of times cats say I'm a composer, anything I write is good.  That--that's not true.  So we use to have big arguments about that, like--in the lead sheet that was put in front of us--the song was okay, but it would have to be a different arrangement to suit the requirements of this band and then like every person that writes a good composition is not a good arranger.  That's why they got arrangers.  I mean arrangers are suppose to make the stuff happen.  Like maybe somebody writes a song and it's not written in the trumpet rings.  Then either we gotta change this or it ain't going to be played because that's not effective for the way Lester [Bowie] plays his horn.  So--like we had music--we wrote music tailored to the--to the demands and requirements of every individual in the band.  That's why it could come to sound like that, and then--like that's the way--a good arranger can write for your band cause he knows the elements inside of that.  So, we and then--then like [Joseph] Jarman too--you know Roscoe [Mitchell] and all of them, we wrote songs, I could even write a song too based on the--the what was available inside the band.  You know, I'm not writing a song--I could really write--you could write for the band cause you know what everybody can do--the arranger, the stuff, you know.  We got five or six hundred songs in our catalogue--all original compositions, notated, documented the whole thing.
Speaker 1: It's--it's been a--Roscoe Mitchell, I think he wrote once and was quoted as having said that the Art Ensemble was trying to get people to think when they listen to the music.
Speaker 2: Well, we think, laugh, feel, emote, cause I mean you know like we--we always, they always--we had theater, we had little comedy skits and everything.  The music--but see the--you bring the ritual and the symbolism to the stage, but then you have to like have--let it be real life too.  So like we had these little--you know, the music, I mean (laughter).  I always laugh at some of these bands.  The cats, they come out with all these you know, the--I grew up and played in bands where I wear a suit and tuxedo.  I don't have no problem with that, but the look got in the way of the music (laughter), you know.  It looked like they weren't having no fun, you know.  So, I mean if you gotta wear a tuxedo and play a gig, it's okay to laugh, you know, I mean--do you ever have any music--do you have anything in your repertoire that's funny or something.  It's like all of this stuff gotta to be tuxedo music, or three-piece suit music?  (Laughter).  You know, so anyway we had a jacket for music.  That's just how I'd be feeling about seeing some of the cats.  They had a certain thing they were like into where it was wearing a three-piece suit and so that makes them look a certain way and then that's what the music sounded like, you know, but like then if I walked in I'd go get some Miles [Davis], you know, and do you know, hit Miles when he was really into all--you know like if you just wanted the sound that connected with that, but we had--our music--it just--it created--like we had--like I said we did drama.  We'd have little skits and everything on the stage and all kinds of stuff would be going on.  So then it's okay.  People have to--the idea was to make them think and take them on a trip, from like laughter, pain, joy and sorrow and everything, you know, and that's not--we're not trying to play music to create that effect.  What--like you can't--it's not like certain music you work an audience--this works and you know, so we're gonna play this and everybody will do the--I mean we just said the overview of the whole thing and all that's an inclusive.  So at some point in our presentation we considered that this is the emotion we'd like to express.  They--the people may not be able to--to perceive that, you know.  They might not understand it but that's our intention, but we're not trying to do that--we never will go out every  night and play the same thing trying to evoke a similar response every night, but certain kinds of music makes certain things happen.  So, as a collective mind of five people creatively--we'd go to certain things that do certain things, which led us to certain other things--we could do that too, effectively.

Speaker 1: Do you think that most successful bands have a concept of a collective--collective minds working together or--or--?
Speaker 2: Hell, no (laughter).  I mean a successful band is one thing--successful entity beyond music is another, cause this was more than music.  I mean we had cooperative economics, you know, houses, everybody helped everybody get together--get their own homes.  Cats had they families and everything.  So a collective band, I don't know what that is.  I mean we were more of a collective concept.  Well, I know a collective band and it is that, but it is more than music.  I mean it was a whole collective lifestyle, you know, cause the idea--I can honestly say the whole time we always ate really good, had all the hip accommodations, had the best quality of the musical instruments.  It's like we didn't--the only thing missing was cash and it was enough of that, that they could kiss our ass any time they wanted--you know, we didn't take no shit from nobody, you know.  Fairly, you know cause everything was together. You'd get a hundred--you'd get full production.  I studied all--we studied the stage production and how to deal with these--cause we never had a crew until like--we didn't get a crew until I was like in the band eight years (laughter).  1978 was when we got enough money that we could afford to budget to have a crew, but I mean, we--then that made us--any of us do to even more, you know, but I mean all that requires study.  They had to write cases, how to ship the stuff around, dealing with the sound requirements, lights all that stuff.  I mean we--[Joseph] Jarman--me and Jarman went on a whole search.  We use to go around and see different productions.  Lester [Bowie] would do that too, just to see how this shit really goes, cause in the jazz there ain't no--there's no--there's no where you can go and learn that.  I mean most of the jazz cats they might do anything (laugher).  We were trying to make it--not a show, but like a production.  A projection is what we called it you know.  So everything is like with--it has the potential to be manipulated or controlled to make the concert better, like to eliminate random things that can be dealt with.  Like we never go out on stage--some cats--I mean there's a--there's an art to cats being able to play under any circumstances which we've done, you know, but then I'd always wonder, how they--don't they--don't they want it to be better (laughter), cause we would be always be willing to pay at our own expense to make the conditions better, to perform at the gig, you know.
Speaker 1: You are talking about self-determination?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, a whole lot of those, you know, cause I've seen cats play on the road.  They play great.  I just said, well, I mean if we can convince them to do that, what we are trying to do for themselves, then the whole image of how we're being dealt with would change.  You see, it's up to the musicians to change their self.  So each cat has to realize what his position is in there.  That's why after a certain point, I stopped trying to convince other people, you know (laughter), cause if they don't, you know--this might--we figured out it might be a singular journey by our self.  It would be easier--not doing it the way we do it--it would be easier if they just--if they embraced the concept and then applied it to the particular situation for themselves.  What would happen is you got another group that's really trying to make the situation better, then you got about five or six bands, and then the situation does get better.  It's hard for one band to change it like that, but we kept going anyway, but I always was hoping that somebody else would evolve another way and then we can look at what they were doing--critically, analytically and make our stuff.  We didn't have no other model to compare it to cause we was out there by ourselves.  That was like--it was kind of hard, you know, always being out there carrying the damn torch, you know, cause the music was hard enough.  Now I got to carry a damn torch, too, you know (laugher), but hey, whatever is the price we paid.  So, you know, you can't look back.

Speaker 1: Can you talk briefly about I guess, the cultural, artistic community here in Chicago?  I mean in--in the--around 19--in the early '70s [1970s].  There was a--I know--(simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: Oh, man, it was like (laughter), oh, man.
Speaker 1: And how did you all (simultaneously)--who was the leader--?
Speaker 2: Concepts, Concepts East.  Was it Concepts East?  Transition East.  Transition East was going on.  AACM [Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians] had this stuff going on.  I remember it was a scene over on 75th Street.  What's her name?  It was a painter--she was a painter.  She had a little gallery.  We used to play in there, then it was another place 75th Street, it was about five or six different places on 75th Street just to play like storefronts and little lofts and stuff we use to play in there.  Then there was another place on 79th Street, then--.
Speaker 1: --used to play at the Institute for Positive Education?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we played over there.  Man, oh man, it was so much stuff going on just for--for performance of music and dancing, you know, people reading and all that--just positive thinking, you know, and--.
Speaker 1: What about Afro Arts Theater?
Speaker 2: That was--that was gone before I got here but I was playing with the Pharaohs so that was--I got the best of that because everybody, "Oh, Afro Arts Theater," so I got into late for, but then I was playing with the Pharaohs so that was like--I was having a good time cause it was like--I was working with Darlene Blackburn.  I was playing with the Pharaohs. I had my own band, a percussion ensemble.  I called it the Malinke Rhythm Tribe, then I was working with Threadgill.  I played with Henry Threadgill on saxophones.  I was playing with Amina Claudine Myers on organ. I mean, man, it was a lot of stuff going on, plus Pete Cosey--you know Pete Cosey, the guitar player?  We had a band going.  I mean I was working with like six or seven different bands all the time just around on--we never even worked the North Side man (laughter). I remember one time I worked at Ratso's or something up there--.
Speaker 1: Now--now what the--the significance of that?  Now you (simultaneously)--significance but I don't think that everybody would know--?
Speaker 2: I mean it's great. The significance is within a five or fifteen minute radius of my house I could be on stage playing without going all the way to the North Side, which that ain't happening no more.  I mean the significance is it was a lot more music going on the South Side than--and the significance is the North Side there still is a lot of music going on, so what happened to us?  Something happened to us?  They--they--it's not what they did to us.  Something happened to us.  I--I think that the dynamics of that we allowed that to be taken out of the community, by not putting it in the community.  See that, you know, (laughter)--.
Speaker 1: We are talking about the dynamics of--.
Speaker 2: I'm talking about live music, creative activity, performance, dance.  In the South Side community, the ratio, the number of people here for what is here compared to the North Side community for what the ratio--the number of people there compared to the number of all the creative outlets there are, you know it's like night and day, you know, then that's another whole subject about that (laughter), but I mean I just remember I could out and--man I was living off 59th Street, 60th and Blackstone.  I could walk over--there were three blues clubs right down 61st Street, man, it was 63rd Street.  By the time I got to Cottage Grove I'd be passed about three or four clubs and this like at the end of the--at the beginning of the seventies.  That all ended quickly and then you had like The Brass Rail.  You had all these different little clubs around and then cats were talking--I mean I know about the places there was like on 75th Street, I used to work with Von Freeman, the legendary Chicago tenor saxophone player.
Speaker 1: Over at the Matador?  Over there--?
Speaker 2: Man we worked--I mean I was working with (laughter).  It was like we worked all these little places and every night it was a different joint and it was like, you know, just go right down 75th Street from east all the way.  By the time we got past King Drive going you know almost to the Dan Ryan [Expressway], you know, that was a whole week, different places.  The President, the Matador, Betty Lou's--this place out there, aw, man!  See there's no place for live music no more on the South Side.  It's really--like you got the Queen Bee out there on South Chicago and whew--not too many more places man.  Teresa--not Teresa's, the Checkerboard.  No jazz clubs to speak of.  Where?  I mean, you know (laughter).  I mean there's no--no reggae joints, no blues--it's got a couple of blues places here and there, but I mean you really have to be and knowing what's happening.  It's more happening on the West Side, you know, so.

Speaker 1: At a certain point in your career, it becomes obvious to a lot of people that your talent is--seems to be greater than ordinary.  I mean people--you're not just the average drummer.  People are talking about Don Moye as being the best drummer in the States or maybe in the world at that time, you know, around the late '70s [1970s] early '80s and this is I mean magazines are--Down Beat [Magazine], they are calling you the "Drummer of the Year"--I mean what--how--how did all that affect you?  You know this is --.
Speaker 2: I--rolled me further into the workshop (laughter)--into the work shed, cause see a lot of--I mean I think--as long as they spell my name right, I don't really be too concerned, but when they start talking about "greater than this" and "greater than that"--that's [Lester] Bowie, he was always humility, because we know what's going on.  I know I can go to any small town--that is what I use to like about traveling around.  You could go to a small town and--and have a chip on your shoulder and the local drummer would come through and kick your ass--on your own set.  You know what I mean?  (Laughter).  I've seen it happen too many times man.  Cats go out there all testy and some cat--you know, like every town had their gunslingers, like the drummers were like gunslingers and stuff.  The drummers would come out.  You had tip lightly like Max [Roach] and them, they use to tip on--tip through Chicago kind of lightly cause it was (laughter), you know.  You know, the cats that know what's happening go there to see that.  I saw Freddy--Archie Shepp came in too one time looking real funny, I--Von Freeman tore his ass up, man over there at DuSable High School, cause at the high school he was like, "Man, what town is this?  Aw, man who was that?"  (Laughter).  Aw, man!  I mean--Von, I mean Von wasn't really--I mean this is like old school--he said--he said, then it was just that they had an attitude.  Ronnie Matthews went around piano.  I can't remember who was on drums.  They was mad, man.  These Chicago cats, man, you know.  I saw Willie Pickens and [Malachi] Favors and Wilbur Campbell fired Freddie Hubbard up one night.  Freddie Hubbard came in looking all like the star, you know, coming in, but I mean see they all--all know that--Freddie and Archie are suppose to know better than that.  You don't go into town beating up on your guests.  You got to tip through it.  See you already getting announced as a great person, but I mean you can't come in there like, "Well, who is that," you know, (laughter).  I've seen it happen too many times--man, a known--unknown see.  Everybody in town knows him, you just a bad dude from out of town and never heard of him and then, kachew!  That's the easiest way to get smoked, you know.

Speaker 1: Of all the musicians in the--in the country it seems as though those playing what people call avant-garde jazz, or progressive jazz seem to get the least amount of attention from the general public, you know.  I mean how does that affect you, I mean especially the black community where--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean I had to--had to come to terms with that myself.  I mean, it's like we work quite a bit considering the musicians that are suppose to be accepted (laughter).  I mean a few years ago I realized it, whatever it is somebody is perpetuating the myth of like what that is, I've had nothing to complain about.  Now the people, the sophistication of the level of the people hearing it, I had to live with that too, but see I got vehicles for that.  See like they already--they made the mis--see, when people do like that I figure they don't--they couldn't possibly know what's happening.  So, it's a dead issue already.  If somebody says, aw, man it's not accessible they haven't heard the music.  They haven't heard what I'm doing.  Now, I'm not that--I can't create, debate with them or have a conflict with them, "Why aren't you doing what I'm doing?", but when they say that, anybody white would've said that automatically I'd say, okay, if they want to have, create a format where we can let them know what we're doing, or they want to find out what's doing we can talk, but that--I won't even address that issue because like I said, within the context of stuff, we play--we got Brass Fantasy--they was like the top--all the best brass cats in New York playing very good arrangements--professional, hip arrangements of all kind of music.  So, like what are you going to call that?  (Laughter).  Lester [Bowie] started calling it "avant-pop", cause there--I mean there's no way they can that's not--and this is like, yeah, that cat, the drummer Benny Johnson, Kenny [Ken] Crutchfield--all these cats--Brian Grice--top show drummers, cause this was like show band, playing original compositions, standards with very good arrangements.  Steve Toure and Stanton Davis, then I'm playing with brass bands see so that's my vehicle for that.  Just in case they want to act right.  Then I'm, you know, I work with the leaders, Cecil McBee, Kirk Lightsey, you see that classic rhythm, trio rhythm section.  It was Chico [Freeman], Lester and Arthur [Blythe].  We had like--I don't even know what they call that post--post-avant be-bop or something.  (Laughter).

Speaker 1: Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, AACM, what--what is that?
Speaker 2: That was an organization founded and still going strong in 1965 by such notable Chicago musicians--musical legends as Muhal Richard Abrams, piano player, Malachi Favors, bassist, Phil Cohran and the power trumpet--all kinds of multi-instrumental, thumb piano, kalimba and Steve McCall, a very, very fine drummer and then some of the membership notable names among the membership were people like Vandy Harris, Jodie Christian, Vandy Harris, late great saxophone player Jodie Christian, pianist.  I mean it was--it was really an organization that was like not an alternative, it was just a response to the--to the lack of good working conditions for like people wanting to play original compositions around the Chicago scene.  I mean it was all the T.V. work and recording studios.  There was really no out in the clubs--it was plenty of clubs in 1965, but there was no outlet for creative music--where--a place where they played individual original music played possibly not without the pressures of having a liquor license and then gangsters, you know a whole scene like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the tradition, it's kind of a way to insulate a creative musician against the old--.
Speaker 2: Just--and to improve the conditions and everything.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) musicians --.
Speaker 2: Low-lifes, down--stuck down in a hole somewhere, you know what I mean.  No dressing room (laughter), you--they want you to pay the gig out on the stage and then put another show on and at the bar at half time and then everybody would be happy, yeah, yeah, they--he was so drunk, he fell off the stage, (laughter), you know, stuff like that.  So we would try to change all the conditions, just the mindset and the whole--plus provide a service to the black community of a free educational program, free classes, got instruments donated for the kids and the harmony, theory, composition, you know improvisation, so it was like--it addressed a lot of issues that were important at the time and which still are.
Speaker 1: Do you--you think it's really accomplished its goal of trying to elevate the black musicians?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean we benefited just by having--by rallying around the central theme--everybody that committed to that ideal benefited themselves and then I mean yeah, it's hard to really to capitalize and to like really pinpoint the effect it's had--enough time hasn't gone by, but I tell you one thing AACM is still maintaining their principles and is still keeping up.  We--we've made our goal--we achieved our goal and we are able to have come up with a unique type of concept and organization that--on a world level you know, like our bands and everything--the AACM bands have been all over the world so the--you know people are prepared to deal with that.  It's some kind of other--see thirty-five years ago, thirty-seven years ago, people had energy to play music and try to do all these other things too.  See at a certain point, we have to generate interest with another kind of profession.  People will come in and like at the same level as us musically to provide their expertise to make--we can't make all of it.  I learned that a long time ago.  With the Art Ensemble [of Chicago], we always--we did everything ourselves and I said wait a minute, our job is playing the music and not taking no shit, you know but I mean a lot of the things, the people got really good ideas.  I--I can't responsibly address that and do music too, and I did.  I did management, contracts, all kind of stuff, you know, because I wanted to do it but I mean our job was playing music.  So and then our job was to find people that are committed to our musical ideas and provide them--or we had to get together and create a way that they can make a living doing what they do--what they love to do and then we are working together to improve the situation and you know that's like any--any kind of professional expertise that's required.  The music or the creative thing and the commitment to communities first then after that you got to be able to make a living.  You can't work for free, you know, and you gotta admit you are entitled to make a living, on the same level as your talent if you are agreed to anything, you should be able to create a vehicle or be a vehicle within the community that allows you to be able--to not have to leave the community to do that or at least have a choice, you know.
Speaker 1: So you--so you, members of the Art Ensemble and members of the AACM are basically changing or have changed I guess--do you think they've really changed the concept of the--the jazz musician on some level--at--at least brought another level--?
Speaker 2: We, I don't know.  AACM--see AACM like I--that impacts groups within the AACM--that individually made anything happen, like [Anthony] Braxton did things.  [Henry] Threadgill did some things.  AACM just maintained, then we had to go out and do that but Art Ensemble we definitely made our mark, but I mean we achieved what we wanted to do as I--as I evolved and longevity came up and then you know we getting old and everything, some of the issues that we addressed they're still as important, but it's like, it's other business that more critical we gotta take care of, you know.  That's why we trying to raise a younger crop to keep the struggle going.  Like I--we're always looking and recruiting.  People always say, you're not doing anything in the community.  All of this--you're always going to Europe all the time.  That's bullshit too, cause I don't--all I gotta do is look at my journals from all over the year.  See, we don't have to hang a sign out about what we're doing, but we have--we're home grown--all of our sons.  It's like I've been through fifty different cats that we took out on the road, just that wanted to be like learn how to do the business and be roadies and all that.  So, you know, a percentage of those went on to do different things, you know, but I mean it's not--they--I would always laugh at when people--cause they didn't know what was happening--they didn't know, they thought we weren't visible enough in the community (laughter), you know so that was--I never--we never--we fortunately didn't get hung up in that whole--some kind of guilt trip about that, cause I know what--you know, sometimes you just have to barely struggle along and people maybe they'll find out.  If they don't we don't have to really explain--but man we get--a lotta cats came through there.  All the musicians that came through--I mean we gave them the best possible conditions that they ever had really at that level.  We took ourselves to the level where we wanted to go and took our boys with us so that's--that's--we did our job and then we had our crews.  We hired the people, you know secretaries, you know the whole thing, legal people--everything.  So, just like I said, we don't have to put no--hang no shingle out just like "blacker than thou" or something or "more involved", cause I had a falling out with one of my secretaries.  You are not doing enough in the community, but see that was the point when I changed my thinking cause I said, no, it's like I'm not like I'm on a guilt trip.  She don't know what's happening, and we don't have anything to prove, but we still got a job to do.  So, like, you know, that was more positive for me cause I would have--before I was really concerned about that.  Favors was too, cause he was "Damn, what is she--how much more can we do," you know, but at the same point we--you know we got to be true to ourselves and be realistic and then be functional--you know we doing okay, so let's--sometimes you have to just let that shit go on by, you know, and not be affected by it, cause we did our--we did as much as we could do and more, you know and that still ain't enough but we doing our job.  That's what we felt that we were doing our job.  So anyway, that's how that came up.  But all those principles were basically enhanced and encouraged inside the bylaws and the principles of the AACM.  The AACM was an outlet for that too.  So we had--we had somewhere where you could go and actually do the things--things--people weren't just talking, they were trying to do something--they were--and it was nice--we use to like to have--go to the AACM conventions.  When you saw that many weird cats having a positive idea about something--I mean it was a whole cast of characters in the early AACM from all diverse thing--type things and they were--the unified theme was to get together and make that music--you know, uplift the image and deal with the community and play original music and all that stuff, so it was--some of that old footage, man, it was--that was a cast of characters (laughs).

Speaker 1: What do you think about the new--new music coming out of the black community these days--I know you gotta feel some that--that it's different on some level because of the lack of instrumentation in the music?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's good--I was waiting for--you mean lack of music classes and all that?
Speaker 1: Well, classes like the instrumentation in--in the music--?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I mean part of that--.
Speaker 1: Well, you all never tried to do popular music necessarily, I mean not--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did all that kind of--man, we got pop tunes and everything.  I'm telling you man, I'm--it's like I ain't giving you--you know--like I was telling you before, well, you know the breadth of the stuff, the range of the stuff for the material that we did man, it--it addresses pretty much all the issues, like for hip hop and everything, we had--had the Hip Hop Philharmonic in New York and we hired all the young kids.  Lester [Bowie] hired all the cats--all the performers, black, white, Puerto Rican, male, female, that the kids--that the teenage kids like.  We hired them, and then we had the top polecats--the hard core, the veteran cats, you know all of them was in the orchestra so (laughter), but we did arrangements.  That's how you wanna find out.  If you wanna find out, hire the people that are doing it.  We wanted a hip hop sound, we hired--because Lester asked his daughter, who's the bad hip hop dude?  Then he even--cause we didn't have time to find out.  She said, oh, come on, let's go over--over to Manhattan tonight and I'll show you, and then they--we just hired him.  Go see the cat, the baddest dude in town.  A Puerto Rican dude, then another night he got a partner, the brother lives uptown somewhere, then you got a whole hip hop chorus.  That's we had.  It was like a thirty-five piece band.  Violins, all kinds of stuff.  Trombones, tubas, three, four drummers and--and it was all--it was the hip hop--the young, the current, state of the art top, you know, they--they--they hadn't been, you know--they weren't like commercially successful, but these--these were the hard core hip--the new batch of hip hop people in New York.  So that--.
Speaker 1: Where do you think our music is going now, I mean in terms of directions?
Speaker 2: Whew!  Everything is so close together now, you know with all the--the information--barrage and everything.  See we need--I'm kind of look--waiting to see what's going to emerge, cause I'm not really sure right now.  See there's this old--what do they call that--that not retrograde--whatever everybody's going back, you know, instead of going forward you know (laughter). I mean you got cats running around trying to sound like Miles [Davis] sounded in 1963 or something, which that form is great to have that, but like I'm waiting for that cats to come back that sound like Lester sounded in 1973 or '83 [1983] as a bassist--or Don Cherry.  I mean like we--Lester--the cats--the people I played with--I played with a lot of talented brass players.  They--they--they're waiting to see the next cast to come through that were--that were comfortable with Miles, comfortable with Don Cherry, comfortable with Lester and then went on to create other things.  I don't--where is it, because it's the trumpet sound is going back.  The drum sound is going back instead of going forward.  I mean but the thing, the idiom that they are playing it's a great forum, but it's like from the principles that we tried to--that made me try to do music and write original stuff--we need something more--like I remember when the young--older cats use to see us play, they felt like they had already passed the thing along, cause they could see a direct connection like Art Taylor, the great drummer.  I use to go by his house everyday.  [Philly] Joe Jones took me around.  Eddie Blackwell is a good friend.  Billy Higgins, cause they can feel the connection of tradition, correctness, authenticity and then creativity to extend the form.  We were taking them into forms that they weren't even thinking about.  Just like when they came through, Joe Jones, he--Art Blakely and all those cats--with Billy, you know some--the ages kind of mingle, you know, but it's always the responsibility of the next generation to give thanks to the previous generation and then to push forward, cause like the old cats, the worst thing they want to see is somebody that sounds like them, you know.  (Laughter), I mean it's a compliment and everything, but they wanna know what's the future of the music, cause we always did that four years ago.  All I got is a bunch of cats running around making the same sound, like the stuff I played twenty years ago.  You know what I'm saying?  They wanna hear something and then once they hear that they incorporate that into their stuff too, cause it's just music, you know.  Then the whole form evolves, you know?  But we have a responsibility to like to grow a new crop of these young cats coming along, but where are they?  (Laughter).  Can't find them.  They--had a--I found the cats that I wanted to emulate.  Like I went and found Art Blakely.  I found Art Taylor, you know I found Roy Haynes, carried his cymbals and hanging around waiting outside the club to see Max [Roach] and stuff, you now, the musicians now, how do you find them?  I mean that's the way we did it.  If there's any way to find a way to reach the younger cats so they--there must be some young cats out there that are doing something the Art Ensemble.  You know what I mean? If there isn't, like what?  I mean what do--what is that?  (Laughter).  You know, it's like--I'll be--I'm waiting to see the next cast and that will be a--give us a fresh, you know a thing, you have to--you have to--I know it's something happening.  I'm hoping there is.  I'm hoping there is something like we hoped there was something after Trane [John Coltrane], cause almost there's nothing after Trane when you think about it.  I mean after the level of the aesthetics of it, the power of it, the mystique of it--that kind of like he closed the file on it and the world of black music is bigger than that, but the minds of the people that are studying it--you know, I mean--see everybody that is--whew, it's all too conservative now, you know?
Speaker 1: You think conditions in the country are changing the--?
Speaker 2: I don't know man.  I--I--the politics--
Speaker 1: --conditions are creating the consciousness that--that--?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  It's somebody back there doing something, somewhere.  People always saying in times like you know when--when nothing's happening, there is nothing happening and then when the revolution start happens--all this stuff happens like that.  So I haven't made too many resolutions lately,(laughter) I don't know.  I know in my lifetime we were very fortunate enough to see several--it's like Jimi Hendrix, and I consider the Art Ensemble [of Chicago] to be of a--of evolutionary form like they had Sun-Ra [Ramses] came through.  Like now I'm looking, where is the evolutionary--where is the--where is the aesthetic of being of an evolution of--of a form being expressed by some young, talented musicians or something, I--I don't see that in the jazz--in the so-called jazz, you know creative music, and so I say it's problem like that's why I say I don't know what's happening.  I'm waiting to see the next cast, cause then it will be exciting.  If they did--if they--their job is to get past us, cause we got them--we did our job.  We got past the cats that brought us up, and they--they were happy for us.  They was our boys, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you have any favorite young musicians now--?
Speaker 2: Whew!
Speaker 1: --that you can think of?
Speaker 2: Man!  I like--I got to play with musicians that play well, but I don't have no favorite musicians that like--can feel--can feel like an extension of myself, you know.  Like I worked--somebody might say Art Taylor--who--some of the cats I know they would ask who was their favorite young cat and they would have a list of cats to say that.  Like me or Victor Lewis, I mean it was like Victor Jones, all these cats, Ronnie Barak.  See now, it's like I like Jeff Tain Watts.  He plays--plays with Branford [Marsalis] and all them cats, but he has the potential to step on out there but he, you know--now he's a great musician and everything--context like--where is that?  Where is somebody that's gonna explode out--like where will ya'll you take it all after Jack DeJohnette, cause Jack DeJohnette opened up a lot of stuff that he did.  He can hang up his--his holster now cause he already took it up to, you know with the whole jazz kinda of, plus he mixed in a little age stuff in there, now it's time for him to lay back and see the next cat that grab that and take it somewhere else, you know.  So the young cats, are whew.  I saw one little cat from New Orleans some years ago.  He's a--he's old now.  I can't remember his name.  He was playing with Terence Blanchard, and at the time, this was like in the middle '80s [1980s] he can--I can really see him pushing the envelope, stretching the edge, you know, but still like slick enough to get work, he wasn't scaring people off, cause a lot of times people get scared, you know, but if you back down then you're not moving, then you stop too, but he was--he was pushing it, cause he was pushing me, you know cause he came out, yeah, (making sound) and I--that's the kind of push you wanna have, you know.  It's a couple of trumpet players around too, cause Lester would always--we would always try to find the cats.  If you find them then you hire them, like James Carter.  James Carter now--but see now he been out there.  He busted out too, but James Carter, the multi-reed instrumentalist and he busted out too, cause we, as soon as we heard him we just hired him, cause if it's gonna be a young cat that going to carry the torch we might as well have him around before he leaves (laughter), you know that's what I do.  I find--I got--that's one of the baddest when you got your own band, if you can do--you can do--if you are committed that thing and you hear somebody you like, you hire them and then you got them for a while and you watch them grow and then you're off the hook.  You send him on out there or he take you on out there, you know what I mean.  That's all I'm just waiting for the next thing, then if I hear some cats next time they'll be sitting right here with us then.

Speaker 1: What do you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: Great black music, agent to the future.
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered, as a man and as a musician?
Speaker 2: So, just all with--just committed to the ideals that we established and you know, try to whew--just remain committed to all the ideas that we--we not fought, but we strove to--to maintain throughout the course of thirty-five years of the same band [Art Ensemble of Chicago] being together.

Speaker 1: What do you think your--your mother [Ernestine] would--would--oh, is she still alive?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What--what would she think about what you're doing?
Speaker 2: Oh, she's--she's totally, she loves music.  She's just concerned as any mother would be about how their kids are gonna be.  What--how are you living?  Where did you get something to eat?  Did you--you know like that, but I mean for--for a long time she's totally, she's proud of the fact--all of our parents are proud of us being musicians and then being good parents ourselves, but they are really happy that we're able to make a living, a comfortable, you know presumably comfortable living.  Whatever--that--you know they don't want to see their kids scuffling, you know, cause then they would have to be, "Why you doing that"?  So they were glad to see us being able to do what we were doing, cause all the parents, we'd invite them over, bring them over.  They'd come to Europe.  They'd go around traveling around--when families come around with us.  So, you know they get a chance to see firsthand it's not whatever they say it is.  This is it here.  This is the top.  We trying to do the top level convenience, just like y'all raised us, you know.  We want you to be proud of us.  In our strive to be self, you know for self-determination and to be men, we want y'all to be proud of us.
