ANNA FAISON:  Good afternoon.  Today is Wednesday June 13th, 2012.  My name is Anna Faison, and I&#8217;m here with Barbara Lau  to interview Lynn Fontana at her office in Durham, North Carolina.  Okay, Lynn we&#8217;re just going to start out with something really easy.  Where did you grow up and what was your childhood like and feel free to talk about some of your childhood memories.  LYNN FONTANA:  Well, I was born in New Orleans in 1959.  My daddy was a cop, Sergeant Fontana, Louisiana State Police.  And he was from an immigrant Italian family so he was born on Magazine Street in New Orleans.  And when I was a kid we used to go down to the house where his five sets of cousins all lived and grew up.  They had split the house into five apartments, and I could go on with them for a long time but they were pretty interesting.  My mother was a housewife and she had polio when she was twenty years old, and she was in a wheelchair for her whole life.  She&#8217;s eighty-three now.  She still lives home alone.  I had an older brother, an older sister and me.  My cousins lived next door.  My aunt and uncle lived next door and my grandparents lived behind them.  So we grew up in this sort of compound of fun and craziness, and I was around a lot of people growing up.  I actually grew up in a little suburb called Harahan so it wasn&#8217;t inside the city of New Orleans.  AF:  Can you spell that?  LF:  Harahan, H-A-R-A-H-A-N.       AF:  Thanks.  LF:  I&#8217;m not sure what else you want to know about that.  BARBARA LAU:  Yeah, well, I was wondering, I know that you went to college at UNC-Asheville.  Is that right?  LF:  I did.  BL:  So I just wanted to make sure, so I just wanted to ask how you ended up in North Carolina and what kind of experiences you had in school that led you to where you are today.  LF:  I wanted to get out of Harahan as soon as possible.  So but it think I was seventeen and three months old I left high school early to go to LSU in Baton Rouge.  That was where I met my first lesbian.  Because back when I was growing up in the sixties and [19]70s, nobody was out.  The only memory I had of knowing that somebody was gay was when there was a fire in a gay bar in the French Quarter and a whole bunch of people got killed.  And I remember that there was a boy who was killed in the fire who was from Harahan.  And my family knew who his family was.  And I remember everybody being A, upset that obviously people had been killed in a fire but B, really like ashamed for his family that he must be gay if he was in this gay bar.  So the images I had of gay people were not positive.  It would be like oh you&#8217;ll get burned up in a fire.  You probably deserve it.  But I mean I knew I was gay from the time I was born.  I was always different; I just didn&#8217;t know what it was until, until I went to college at LSU, and I met some actual lesbians.  I was like eureka moment and my palm slapped on my forehead oh, you can actually do that.    AF:  Well, what were the ideas in your family growing up about women and women&#8217;s roles and&#8212;  LF:  Well, I had multiple role models because my mother was a housewife but obviously was a very strong and independent person to raise three children from a wheelchair.  And my grandmother was a housewife, but my Aunt Rosemary was a registered nurse, and she worked outside the home the whole time, and she had a sister who worked at the UN who married a Danish guy, and the Danish cousins would come every summer, and my cousins were a good bit older.  My cousin Kat is ten years older and my cousin Keith was six years older and they were going off to college.  So I had a variety of female role models.  AF:  So you didn&#8217;t get told that women could do or couldn&#8217;t do things.  So obviously your family supported you going to college.  LF:  No, yes they did.  There&#8217;s a funny story.  When I was about six, I wanted, do you remember the Sears catalog?  It used to come and so you&#8217;d sit there and go through for hours and think of all these things you wanted Santa Claus to bring you.  I picked out a football uniform, complete with a helmet and pads.  And that ias what I wanted for Christmas.    AF:  And did you get it?  LF:  I did.    BL:  That&#8217;s awesome.  LF:  So my Uncle Max was gay.  My grandpa&#8217;s little brother.  But nobody talked about Uncle Max was gay.  It was just obvious that he was gay.  So I don&#8217;t think that I, when I was a kid, I didn&#8217;t, there wasn&#8217;t gay and straight.  It was everybody was straight.  But I knew something was different about Uncle Max.  He was so much fun and he traveled all around the world and would come back and bring us crazy things like Icelandic sweaters like we needed that in New Orleans or figures from Africa.  He broadened my horizons that there was a big world out there, knowing the Danish cousins and all of the other things that I was exposed to.  My uncle had a farm north of Lake Ponchetrain.  And we used to go up there all the time, and I had a very independent childhood where I was able to, I would sit in the driveway and wait for Uncle Charles to come home from work with my little motorcycle that my daddy also got me when I was maybe twelve years old.  And I would go up to the farm all weekend pretty much by myself and help them do things around the farm.  It was fun.  AF:  Well, that was sort of the [19]60s right?  You were born in [19]59.  LF:  Yeah, so it would be the late [19]60s, early [19]70s by the time I was at the farm riding around on my motorcycle by myself.    AF:  So what was the sort of milieu around or the thinking around sort of the civil rights movement and things changing in the world then?  LF:  My family they were Democrats, and my grandpa was really involved in politics.  He was like the mayor pro tem of our little town, and I remember going to election night to these, my mama would drag me along with her.  We would, it was so old they would call in on these big phones and with chalk and be adding up all the votes in the precincts.  So I would, it would be a stretch to say that they were progressive because they certainly were racist in their own way.  But I don&#8217;t really remember a lot of discussion about being for it or against it.  It was more a practical thing because my dad was a cop.  So he got sent to riots.  So the main concern in our family was that my daddy didn&#8217;t get hurt.  There just weren&#8217;t discussion when I was a kid about what was going on.  I do remember the phrase outside agitator because that&#8217;s what we would call my mama.    AF:  A pet name.  LF:  But my mother has a real sense of justice and fairness that I&#8217;m sure I picked up from her.  If something is right, you need to make it; if something is wrong, you have to try to make it right.  AF:  And growing up as a disabled or being a disabled person in the 1960s I&#8217;m sure she experienced some&#8212;  LF:  Oh yeah.  I suspect that probably has something to do with what my occupation is today.  You had asked me how I wound up in North Carolina.  I don&#8217;t know how we got off on all that.  AF:  [multiple talking at once] We&#8217;re getting there.  But tell us about going to college.  LF:  Baton Rouge in 1977 was not exactly a hotbed of political activity.  Just probably a couple years before that, David Duke used to stand on the soapbox in the pit or whatever they called it and do his crazy railings, and people would just laugh at him and make fun of him.  But college is obviously an eye-opening experience.  I don&#8217;t, that was probably where I met my first feminist because there just didn&#8217;t have any in Harahan, or in New Orleans that I knew of.  I can&#8217;t say that I was very active in anything political then.  I was just, I was barely seventeen.  I started playing rugby, I was just more exploring what you do when you&#8217;re seventeen, eighteen, nineteen years old and you&#8217;re just out on your own for the first time.  I do remember that by [19]79 there were a lot of more feminist types of activities going on, and some of my friends who that I had gotten to know were active with NOW [National Organization for Women].  Remember NOW?  And there was some, there was some incident where when you&#8217;re doing all, starting to become a feminist, you start looking at the hierarchy of things and top down management of things.  But oddly a dispute arose over the coach of the rugby team letting new people who had just come to start playing, to let them play in games and sitting some of the people who had been playing for a long time.  So at that time we thought that was wrong.  That you should, everybody should play if you come and he wanted to win.  So there were a lot of other things going on around that same time period, but the upshot of it all is that I wound up dropping out of LSU in September of 1979, and you had to go to an office and fill out some paperwork, and you had to put the reason for resigning from school.  And I put &#8220;The patriarchy is too oppressive.&#8221;  Seriously, the poor woman, she&#8217;s like the puh, the what?    AF:  Well, that&#8217;s a lot of change for a seventeen year old who&#8217;s never met a feminist to years later&#8212;  LF:  The patriarchy is too oppressive.    AF:  Right.    LF:  So I quit school, and my friend Starr Noland who is now a clinical social worker in Asheville and another friend Debbie Ozorski who is a therapist in Colorado now.  We sold everything we owned, which amounted to about three thousand dollars which was a lot of money back then.  And we took off from Baton Rouge, leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight and traveled all around, up and down the East Coast.  We went to Florida.  At some point I camped out in Pisgah Forest because my friend Starr was from Greenville, and she had been up in the mountains a lot.  So when we ran out of money, I think we were in Boston and it was cold.  We were like where are we going to go.  I said let&#8217;s go back to North Carolina because by that, I knew from Starr and other people that UNC was a really good school.  So I thought if I moved to North Carolina, eventually I'd want to go back to school.  And I thought I would live in the mountains for six months and I wound up staying for three years.  I loved it.  We lived, first we, first we lived in a tent in Pisgah Forest briefly.  And then we rented this concrete block house from a man named Tommy Hooper.  And it was two and a half miles down a dead-end dirt road across the East Fork of the French Broad River and we were the second to the last house from the end.  We did all this organic gardening, chop all your own wood, grow all your own food.  AF:  Back to the land.    BL:  Wow.  LF:  Split wood, not atoms.  And I mentioned Tommy Hooper because he was great.  I loved Tommy Hooper.  I was twenty years old, and he was in his fifties so I thought of him as very old.  Now that I&#8217;m fifty-two I&#8217;m sure he was not old at all.  But he and his wife Katie had this farm, and he worked at one of the two places you could work then.  Now I can&#8217;t remember if it was the Olin Cigarette paper plant or DuPont Chemical, but Tommy was a real good, good person.  He couldn&#8217;t understand how we were trying to do organic gardening, but he would come up with his tractor and plow stuff for us while telling us nothing was going to grow.  But we hadn&#8217;t lived there very long.  By this point it was just me and Starr.  And one Saturday morning, Tommy Hooper drives up and knocks on the door, and he had this funny way of talking.  He goes, &#8220;Do you have a gun?&#8221;  I said, &#8220;No, Tommy why?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Can you get one?&#8221;  I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, I guess so.  Why?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Well, I heard that there were some boys, and they heard that there were two girls living together across the river and they were going to come show you what real men are like.  So what you need to do is get you a gun and go out in the yard and shoot &#8216;em up.&#8221;  So the next day probably we drove down to Greenville and got a gun from Starr&#8217;s uncle, and we came back to our little yard and through, we made a big show of shooting the gun a lot in the yard.  So word got out that them girls had a gun and nobody ever bothered us.  But I thought that was pretty cool for Tommy Hooper to drive up there and tell us what to do.  BL:  Yeah, he was looking out for you.  LF:  He was.  BL:  That&#8217;s awesome.    AF:  What was Asheville like then in terms of the women&#8217;s community?  LF:  Well, I lived in Transylvania County.  And so once in a while we would scrape together the gas money to drive to Asheville, which was maybe forty-five minutes.  There was a, there was a pretty thriving gay community in Asheville in the early [19]80s.  I can&#8217;t remember the name.  There was some acronym like OOMP, Our Own Place or there was also some newsletter.  There was a women&#8217;s newsletter that went out.  AF:  Locally?  LF:  Monthly, up in the mountains yeah.  And after I finally went back to school I know that it was still going on then because there would be meetings at my house to put them together.  This was before computers.  [laughing]  Or the beginning of computers.  And they would, the mailing list I think was probably at least a hundred.    AF:  Do you remember if the sort of, the sort of lesbians versus feminists, was there parallel stuff, was there overlap?  What do you remember about that?  LF:  It was pretty separate.  I think back then straight women weren&#8217;t, were a little more paranoid about joining forces with the lesbians for fear of being labeled lesbians.  So it was definitely very separate.  That&#8217;s all I remember about that.  AF:  And how did y&#8217;all think about yourselves?  What did you call yourselves?  I mean in terms of that--  LF:  Dykes?  [laughing]  AF:  Yeah, no I mean that affiliation because there was that I mean there were a lot of separatists.  There were people who thought of themselves as lesbian feminists.  There were&#8212;  LF:  Oh right, right, right.    AF:  You know what I mean.  LF:  I do remember all of that.  I remember arguments at meetings about whether men should be allowed to do X or Y or--.  I went to some of the early Michigan Women&#8217;s Music Festivals, which as you probably know there, no men were allowed, and there was a big uproar about boy children and where they had to go and boy dogs.  It was pretty ridiculous.  I think we&#8217;ve all evolved a long time ago from that.  But you can certainly understand it when you first come out and realize that the patriarchy is oppressive and it does control everything.  You get mad.  BL:  So would you say that you identified as a feminist like very early on like&#8212;  LF:  Yes, I&#8217;m sure I was a feminist long before I knew that I was a lesbian or knew what it was called.    BL:  And would you say, because we have been talking a lot in our class about sort of the divide between lesbians and lesbian feminists and straight feminists over time, and I was wondering if you could talk about if you noticed a difference over time or depending on where you were in women&#8217;s groups.  LF:  Yeah.  I mean it&#8217;s changed a lot.  From Asheville I moved to Durham in fall of 1984 to go to law school at Carolina, and there was a women in law group at Carolina that was all feminists.  And I was out in law school and there were maybe one or two other lesbians in the group and it must&#8217;ve been probably twenty people.  There was, everybody was together then.  So I guess it changed between 1980 and [19]84.  I don&#8217;t know.  By the time I got to law school there wasn&#8217;t that difference between the mainstream feminists and the lesbians.  And it may have been maybe because I was at law school instead of in a, out in the real world.  AF:  What did you study in college?  LF:  Which time?  AF:  Well, yeah, what did you study at LSU and what at&#8212;  LF:  Well, one of the reasons I dropped out of LSU is because I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do.  I started out in pre-med and discovered that the smell of formaldehyde made me nauseated, and I did not like blood or other fluids.  So what did I switch to?  I was interested in engineering.  So I switched to engineering.  Then I didn&#8217;t like that probably because I had professors at LSU whom I couldn&#8217;t understand.  Like they&#8217;re literally a Russian guy.  It was like, what?  Then I, I don&#8217;t know if I had, (          ) English literature, a big moneymaker.  That&#8217;s when I thought I don&#8217;t know what the hell I&#8217;m doing.  I need to stop wasting money and stop for a while.  And by then the patriarchy had become too oppressive.  So when I lived in Brevard for three years I had, I had a day job.  I was the parts manager at the Ford dealership in Valley Ford in Brevard.  They hired me because I had worked at the Lincoln Mercury place at Baton Rouge when I was in college.  I worked part-time and in the summers.  So I knew how the parts were coded and whatever.  So they hired me.  And after not too long, this was when they were first putting in computerized inventories and things like that.  So the service manager--who was a guy of course--they would send to Ford School in Atlanta for his continuing education.  Whenever I would, there would be a course for the parts manager, I would say, I need to go to this class in Atlanta, and the boss would go oh you don&#8217;t need to go.  Well, I was smart enough that I could figure it out and call and ask other people and ask them how it was working.  I grew tired of not, and I was not being paid anywhere near as much as I would have been if I had been a man.  So at some point I got fed up with it and I quit.  And I went to the unemployment because I quit with good cause attributable to the employer and I actually won.  But I only remained unemployed for probably three weeks, and then the parts manager at another car dealership down the road called and wanted me to come work there.  So the deal with him was I was going to split the profits with him after we started getting that department organized and then surprise, he kept all the money for himself.  So I quit, that place also was interesting because when I worked more than forty hours aw week they would say I was on salary, and when I worked less than forty hours a week, they would dock my pay for two hours.  I didn&#8217;t think that was right.  And then I worked with an old guy named Furman Franks in Pisgah Forest in a body shop.  I did estimates and ordered all the parts and I did body work&#8212;  AF:  Who knew?  LF:  Taking cars apart and putting them back together and fixing dents and sanding, and I did everything except painting because that was a skilled job.  No really, it is.  You&#8217;ve got to, after you&#8217;ve done all that work you don&#8217;t want to screw it up with the painting.  So Furman was a really good painter.  He was a hoot.  We had a lot of fun actually and I learned pretty much every country song in existence which proved to be quite a, quite a boon at law school parties.   AF:  So was that after college before law school or&#8212;  LF:  In the middle.  AF:  Was that before you went&#8212;  LF:  It was before I went back to college.  So at some point&#8212;  AF:  Yeah, what made you decide&#8212;  LF:  I'd had enough of manual labor and three years is enough to take a break and I was ready to go ahead and finish school.  So and I was hoping that some, by that point you can tell from what I was talking about with the employment law issues, I became interested in employment law.  And I was hoping to get into law school at UNC.  And that&#8217;s why I went to undergrad, finished undergrad in Asheville because I didn&#8217;t I could stand five years in a row at the same, in the same school.  So I finished in Asheville.  It was a great, great school.  I loved it there.  I helped organize things like the first women&#8217;s week at UNC.  I should dig that stuff out my attic.  I actually have some old stuff from UNC&#8212;  AF:  Files from there.  LF:  Yeah, in my attic.  AF:  That would be good.    BL:  What was the first women&#8217;s week like?  LF:  It was awesome.  I think we had Holly Near and just all sorts of feminist things going on.  All I can remember is Holly Near.  AF:  Did you do any stuff about sort of violence against women or that kind of thing or was it more&#8212;  LF:  I remember there was a movie at the arty theater in Asheville called Pieces, and it was about chopping women up into pieces.  We organized a protest on the sidewalk of all this violence against women and misogynistic stuff.  It was in the paper.  T hat&#8217;s probably in the attic too.  When I was&#8212;  AF:  Did you take a leadership role in this stuff?  LF:  Yeah.    AF:  So why, what do you think you were called to do there and not just be someone who showed up?  LF:  Well, I don&#8217;t know.  I think it was just my personality.  I tend to be more a take charge let&#8217;s get this done.  Let&#8217;s make some phone calls .  I&#8217;m an organizer.  I&#8217;m an outside agitator.  Apple, tree.    BL:  Well, I kind of want to backtrack a little bit because I was wondering you said that you were out in law school and I was wondering what the process of coming out was like for you.  And maybe how you approached it in regards to your family.  LF:  That&#8217;s a good question.  I remember, let me back up a little bit on that.  When I decided I was quitting school and leaving Baton Rouge, somehow word got back to my parents.  And New Orleans is only eighty miles from Baton Rouge.  So we&#8217;re all packed up ready to go and who comes driving up but my parents.  I&#8217;m like oh my God.  So they&#8217;re like what are you doing?  Don&#8217;t quit school.  Why are you doing this?  We&#8217;ll be worried about you.  Where are you going?  How will we know where you are?  You don&#8217;t have the internet.  And I remember this conversation with my mother sitting in the car, and I told her that I felt like I just needed a break, needed to get out of Baton Rouge and that I was gay.  And she was like, oh my God.  She&#8217;s crying.  What did I do wrong?  She actually said that.  And then the next thing she said was how do you do it?  [laughter]  Seriously, I&#8217;m like are you kidding me.  I got to go.    AF:  How about your dad?  LF:  My father and I never discussed it.  My mother made it really clear that she did not want me to tell my father that she did not want to hear the pillow talk and frankly that was fine with me.  My relationship with my dad I did, I went to all the Saints games with my dad.  I followed my dad around the yard.  I helped him with all the projects.  I would do, I hung out with my dad a lot.  And we had a good relationship, but it wasn&#8217;t that close that we could, until until he was almost dead that we could actually talk about it.  And by then he was sort of brain damaged so I&#8217;m not really sure whether we were having a real conversation or not.  And recently I got married in Washington, DC to a woman, and my mother didn&#8217;t want to talk about it still.  I&#8217;m fifty-two years old now.  I mean come on.  You&#8217;re missing a good party.  But she&#8217;s like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go.  I don&#8217;t want to talk about it.&#8221;  Okay.  I&#8217;ll ignore it.  Now I forgot what you asked me.  BL:  Oh that was&#8212;  LF:  Coming out.  Coming out.  BL:  (                )  LF:  So I came out to my mother back when I was seventeen.  Now I&#8217;m sorry.  I was almost twenty then.  In college in Asheville when I went back to school, I mean I was out.  Everybody knew I was gay, I thought.  I certainly didn&#8217;t hide it.  But when I was about to graduate, there was a, there was an article in the school paper where I&#8217;m not sure you would call it coming out, but I was like I&#8217;m gay and blah, blah, blah.  And so there was this whole, I think that&#8217;s in the attic too.  And it was right before graduation, and at UNC-Asheville they have this award they give to I guess their best graduate or whatever.  And I was supposed to get it.  And there was a, I found out about this after the fact.  I didn&#8217;t know about it at the time.  But they actually called a meeting again of the committee that made the award in light of the newspaper article about whether I should still get the award.    AF:  Wow.  LF:  And to their credit, I did get it.  But the idea that in 1984 they would seriously consider giving, not giving their top academic and leadership award to me because I was gay was kind of shocking now in 2012 because that wouldn&#8217;t happen now.  BL:  Or there would be an uproar over it.    LF:  Yeah.    BL:  I was really interested in the story you were telling about sort of the workplace discrimination you faced when you were working for Ford and how that influenced some of the law you practice now and I know you work with a lot of different kinds of employment law and relating to discrimination.    LF:  Yeah.  BL:  So I was wondering if there were other experiences that had influenced that.  LF:  No, those tow were it.  Being not sent to school when I was clearly qualified and should have been sent to school.  That made me mad.  And I must&#8217;ve made, I don&#8217;t even remember how much money I made.  It was so little.  Nine dollars, I don&#8217;t remember, but I think I brought home $125 a week or something like that and then for them to dock you two hours, which you worked thirty-eight.  I mean I want my eighteen dollars.  It was just, and then the thing that really got me is that you&#8217;d be talking to co-workers and say, &#8220;Can you believe they did that?&#8221;  &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it.&#8221;  I&#8217;m like well that&#8217;s not right.  So I mean it was definitely experiencing discrimination myself that made me become an employment lawyer.  I mean that&#8217;s what I, that&#8217;s pretty much all I've done since I got out of law school.  It was intentional.  I started working, back then, I got out of law school in 1987.  There were very few people doing plaintiff&#8217;s side employment law, but I hooked up with one of them in Raleigh, a woman named Joyce Davis.  And I worked with her for four and a half years.  She did all sorts of sex discrimination, race discrimination, age discrimination, and I was her associate.  She was a wonderful, wonderful person with a great big heart, but she was crazy.  She was just very over-extended, over-worked, and I like to say that I got nine years of experience in four and a half years.  I was totally burned out by the time I finished working with her.  Then I started my own practice in Durham.  But I do Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which is sex, religion, race and color, and then the Age Discrimination Employment Act and the ADA, and I almost exclusively represent employees.  I don&#8217;t represent companies on purpose.    AF:  So it&#8217;s interesting to me that you go to school in Chapel Hill, and you go to work in Raleigh, but you decide to live and start a practice in Durham.  So give me what you, the early impressions of Durham when you moved into the area.    LF:  Well, I&#8217;m sure we chose Durham because of the women&#8217;s community.  My girlfriend at the time was a doctor named Jackie Wilson, and she knew some people down here who were doing more psycho-therapy kind of work, and it was something she wanted to do.  I tried to live in Raleigh one time.  It just doesn&#8217;t really feel right to me.  New Orleans reminds me of home&#8212;I mean, oops.  Durham really reminds me of New Orleans.  There&#8217;s a large minority community.  It&#8217;s more, I hate to use the word gritty.  Durham&#8217;s more real.  I like living here.  It certainly has changed a whole lot, for the better.  I tried to living in Chapel Hill one time for a brief period, even after law school, and it&#8217;s just too small and it&#8217;s not diverse enough.  Durham&#8217;s the best.  BL:  What kind of women&#8217;s organization and sort of events did you encounter in Durham?  LF:  I was, I was so busy in law school that I don&#8217;t recall having much community involvement in the [19]80s, and then I was really busy being a young lawyer working all the time.  So I didn&#8217;t do a whole lot then.  I haven&#8217;t really been involved in, frankly in the women&#8217;s community in Durham I don&#8217;t think, other than I live here and I go to stuff once in a while.    AF:  What year did you start your practice?  LF:  [19]91.  AF:  Was that hard?  Was it hard to start a business as a woman or as a lesbian in Durham?  LF:  Ni, I don&#8217;t think so.  AF:  Why wasn&#8217;t it hard?  LF:  Well, part of it is probably my practice area.  There weren&#8217;t very many people doing it at the time.  I made sure to keep my overheard low.    AF:  But did you have contacts here?  Did you know people in the legal community?   LF:  Well, I was just, I wouldn&#8217;t say starting out.  I had been a lawyer for four and a half years by then.  And even from the very beginning all of my work comes from referrals from other lawyers.  If you do a good job and you&#8217;re a nice person, other lawyers refer you cases.  So I mean I never did advertising.  I think my name alone, my name and phone number were in the yellow pages and that was about it.  But I never really had any problems starting my own business.  AF:  So when you said one of the reasons that you were drawn here was the women&#8217;s community, like how, how would you describe that?  What do you mean by that?  LF:  Well, there are all these things going on that are interesting.    AF:  Like, when you think about your early&#8212;  LF:  Protest marches.  AF:  Places to meet people, right.  LF:  Yeah, people are here.  Duke often has interesting events going on.  They bring in interesting speakers and parties.  AF:  Did Durham do you think have a reputation for some of that?  LF:  Oh yeah.  AF:  So what do you think the reputation was when you moved here?  LF:  That it was a great place for lesbians.  That there were a lot of women here.    It was a very progressive place, a great community, lots of stuff to do.    AF:  So who were some of the first people you met when you came here that you would say were like really in the community?  LF:  Laurie.  AF:  Laurie Fuchs.  LF : Well, there were the people at the&#8212;help me.  AF:  Ladyslipper.  LF:  Ladyslipper.  Mandy Carter, there were these women&#8217;s dances.  AF:  And there were bars here.  LF:  Yes, although I don&#8217;t really, I don&#8217;t remember them that much.    AF:  Bookstore?  Did you go to the women&#8217;s--  BL:  The Southern Sisters.  LF:  The one downtown?  Yeah, I do remember that.    AF:  The bar or the bookstore?  LF : The bar, no, I mean the&#8212;I can&#8217;t remember the bar, but I remember the bookstore.  AF: Southern Sisters.  LF:  Yeah.  Yeah, and The Regulator was pretty cool too.  Back then there was, what years were they in operation?  AF:  I haven&#8217;t quite tracked all that down yet, but yeah.  LF:  Yeah.  I do remember the bookstore.  Durham was just a cool hopping place.  AF:  Did you experience any sort of discrimination or were there any incidences of where you felt like being a woman or being a lesbian impacted your business or impacted your life?  LF:  No.  AF:  So it felt pretty wide open.  LF:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I, I have to say though I&#8217;m a litigator, so I have a pretty thick skin.  And early on when I was a young lawyer and even now today to a much, much lesser extent, I think there was a tendency on particularly older male lawyers&#8217; parts to be condescending or to, under, what did George Bush say, mis-underestimate me.  That doesn&#8217;t happen anymore unless it&#8217;s from some I like to call silver-backed males.  I had a trial a few years ago with a silver-backed male from Washington, DC.  He was just the most condescending, arrogant you know.  He leans over and says, &#8220;Lynn, there&#8217;s no there there.&#8221;  And then after the one point two million dollar jury verdict, he went on back to DC and never heard from him again.  But that really, even the men have changed.  I rarely run into an obviously sexist guy.    AF:  What about women&#8217;s legal organizations, or women judges?  LF:  Oh yes.  I used to be very active in the North Carolina Association of Women Attorneys when I was a young lawyer.  I was on their board for years and chaired the judicial endorsement committee for years.  Back then nobody knew how to vote for.  You didn&#8217;t have the internet.  And we did a lot of work researching all the judges and making judicial endorsements.  And NCAWA is still very, very active.  I went to part of the conference last year.  They do a lot of good stuff.    AF:  What would you say, or how would you describe their mission or the scope of their activities?  LF:  It&#8217;s pretty broad.  It&#8217;s the rights of women under the law.  So there&#8217;s a, somebody&#8217;s down at the legislature.  I actually just this morning was reading a legislative report from NCAWA about what&#8217;s going on in Raleigh.  So it&#8217;s the rights of women under the law as well as to promote the participation of women in the legal profession so there are quite a few judges now that are former NCAWA members.    AF:  Do you know when it started?  LF:  You should ask Sharon Thompson and Carolyn McAllister, I think they were some of the founders.    AF:  But was&#8212;  LF:  In the [19]70s.  AF:  In the [19]70s.  LF:   I think.  AF:  So it was still pretty young even when you got involved.  LF:  Yeah.  Yeah.  AF:  And in that organization was there, how did that, how did the sort of lesbian straight woman thing show up there or did it?  LF : I don&#8217;t think it did.  There certainly have been lots of lesbian attorneys in NCAWA and in leadership positions.  AF:  So the straight women provided there was sort of an allies relationship both ways.  LF:  Yeah, the people who started it Sharon Thompson and Carolyn McAllister as if they&#8217;re going to be uncomfortable with lesbian lawyers.    AF:  They are lesbian lawyers.  LF:  Well, Carolyn&#8217;s not.  AF:  But just sort of that idea that the straight women were being allies with.  They weren&#8217;t, that didn&#8217;t become a wedge issue in that organization like it had been in earlier in feminist organizations in the [19]70s.  LF:  No, no.  Absolutely not.  AF:  What else, any other women&#8217;s legal or things that we might think about as feminist organizations that have to do with lawyers or&#8212;  LF:  I can&#8217;t think of any.  AF:  And now isn&#8217;t there a LGBTQ legal--  LF:  There is GALA.  AF:  GALA.  LF:  Of course.  Gay and Lesbian Attorneys.  I know I have been a member of that at some point but--.  AF:  It&#8217;s not as active.  LF : They are active.   AF:  They are.  LF:  I&#8217;m just not in it.    AF:  What about you know you said earlier like you were involved in NOW, I mean you knew about that.  Were you ever involved in those kinds of organizations in North Carolina?  LF:  NOW, not really.  I mean I knew it existed.  AF:  Or straight feminists.  LF : Yeah.  I went to, I&#8217;m sure I've been to marches on Washington with a big NOW presence.  The first one I can remember is actually the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights in October of 1979.  I t was funny.  I remember I told my mama I was going and she said wear a hat and sunglasses.  [laughter]  AF:  So no one will recognize you.  LF:  She was afraid the front page of the New Orleans Times-Picayune would &#8220;Anna Fontana&#8217;s daughter at lesbian march.&#8221;  BL:  Have you ever got involved in, I know Durham is the seat of the NC Gay Pride festival, isn&#8217;t it?  LF:  It might be.  BL:  They have that every year.  I was wondering if you&#8217;ve ever experienced any marches or festivals like that in North Carolina.  LF:  Oh shoot even back in Asheville I&#8217;m sure we marched around a little bit.  The gay pride parade has gotten really festive and large.  One time it was in Charlotte, maybe early [19]90s.  AF:  They have them all over the state now.  It&#8217;s amazing.  LF:  Yeah, my organizing marches and parades days are probably in the past.  AF:  I&#8217;m curious I mean Durham&#8217;s changed as just as a community right.  I mean downtown&#8217;s changed all those things.  But if there&#8217;s anything you might share about how you think the lesbian community or gay, LBGTQ community.  Obviously we&#8217;ve gotten more diverse.    LF:  The one thing that has struck me most in the past year with the Amendment is how much everybody else has changed.  It&#8217;s not such much that the lesbian community has changed or the gay community has changed.  What has really been touching to me is how many allies we have now and how many straight people are just outraged and putting a lot of time and effort and money into fighting our battle.  It really, it really did touch me.    AF:  How did you guys decide that you wanted to get married?  I mean that&#8217;s obviously a legal statement would we say about equality and&#8212;  LF:  Well, oddly--  AF:  One might call that a feminist revolutionary act as well.  LF:  It was more for the kids.  When I started seeing Kaitlyn, the kids were six and eight, and now they&#8217;re nine and eleven.  And with her divorce from Tom had been very acrimonious and disruptive to their lives and a big part of it was wanting them to feel secure that I wasn&#8217;t going anywhere.  I&#8217;m in.  And then the other is political.  I mean another big reason we wanted to do is because somebody said we can&#8217;t.  Oh yeah?  Yes, we can.  Stop me.    AF:  It seems like that&#8217;s a little bit of the theme for you.  People saying oh you know&#8212;  LF:  You can&#8217;t.  Yes I can.    AF:  I mean&#8212;no Dad didn&#8217;t say you can&#8217;t have that football uniform, but they were, those kinds of things like (            ).  LF:  Well, I get that from my mother.  She doesn&#8217;t understand the meaning of the word no.  People told her she couldn&#8217;t do all the things she went on to do.    AF:  Which were what?  I mean you&#8217;ve said she raised three kids, but I&#8217;ll bet there&#8217;s some other things.  LF:  I mean one thing I really admire her for is in 1994 my daddy who was only sixty-six years old had a massive hemorrhagic CVA [cerebrovascular accident], the bleeding kind of stroke.  And obviously at first we thought he was going to die, and then he didn&#8217;t die.  And it was pretty much hell for at least six months because he was in ICU [intensive care unit], and they didn&#8217;t even really want to put him in rehab because I&#8217;ll spare you all the details.  So I was in New Orleans a lot and my brother and sister and I were always at the hospital a lot.  And they waited until one day when my mother was there alone and they pulled her into the room with the CAT scans, and they told her that she would never be able to take care of him that she needed to put him in a nursing home.  He&#8217;d never brush his teeth or comb his hair or do anything and that she wouldn&#8217;t be able to take care of him in her wheelchair.  Well, you know what happened next.  For the next five and a half years she took care of him in a hospital bed in the den from her wheelchair until he died.    BL:  Wow.    AF:  She was an amazing role model.  LF:  Yeah, he was pretty interesting too.  I mean one of the things I learned through that whole horrible ordeal, she told me this story of when she got polio, and the doctors told her that she was most likely never going to walk again.  She wouldn&#8217;t talk to my daddy for two weeks.  She wanted him to divorce her because she didn&#8217;t want to ruin his life.  He wouldn&#8217;t go away.  So&#8212;  AF:  She was stuck with him.  LF:  Yeah.  So&#8212;  AF:  He&#8212;  LF:  He was pretty good too.  AF:  Stick with it kind of guy.  Well, are there other people that you think about as role models or mentors?  LF:  Certainly my Aunt Rosemary.  She corrected my grammar.  She took me to the library.  My mother could drive back then.  But she, Aunt Rosemary somehow wound up taking me to the library a lot.  I guess probably because she was already going.  You know I can&#8217;t really think of any public figures when I was a kid because there weren&#8217;t, Hillary Clinton hadn&#8217;t been.  I tell you a funny story.  I actually heard of Hillary Clinton before I heard of Bill Clinton because when I was in, active with NCAWA, we planned the annual conferences so this would&#8217;ve been late [19]80s early [19]90s.  It had to be late [19]80s because by [19]92 he was running for President right.  And I remember we were trying to figure out who we would have for a speaker, and somebody suggested let&#8217;s get Hillary Rodham.  She&#8217;s chairing the ABA [American Bar Association] commission on women in the legal profession.  She&#8217;s great and she&#8217;s a wonderful extemporaneous speaker and oh by the way she&#8217;s married to the governor of Arkansas.  But I didn&#8217;t really have female role models who were public figures back then.    AF:  What about like law school professors or people in the field or other people.  BL:  Famous lesbians.  [laughter]  AF:  Yeah.  I know that&#8217;s kind of a--  LF:  I can&#8217;t think of any.  I suppose in a way Sharon Thompson was a role model because she&#8217;s articulate, very smart and would stand up at large public meetings and say something meaningful.  Don&#8217;t tell Sharon I said that.  [laughing]  AF:  Why do you think it&#8217;s been important for there to be people, LGBTQ people in the legal profession in Durham?  Or let me not assume that you think that that&#8217;s important but&#8212;  LF:  Well, actually I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s important.  [short pause] Maybe it is, and I just don&#8217;t think about it.  It&#8217;s probably important for kids.  By kids I mean teenagers, young kids, college young adults.  I think it&#8217;s important for young people to see positive role models especially now with all the bullying and the suicides, and maybe I need to step up a little more.    AF:  I know you recently shared that your stepson interviewed you but are there other ways that you&#8217;re feeling like you&#8217;re doing any of that or want to do any of that?  LF:  If there were something to do, I&#8217;m sure I would do it.  But when I speak out now, I think I&#8217;m tending to do it as a human being and not as I&#8217;m gay.    AF:  Have there been any important sort of legal cases that you were here that related to LGBTQ rights?  Were you here when the marches started?  That would&#8217;ve been I think earlier in the [19]80s but I&#8217;m just curious&#8212;  LF: Here in North Carolina.  AF:  Here in Durham.  Either one.  LF:  I haven&#8217;t really been involved in that because I don&#8217;t do family law.  I think the two-parent adoption matter has certainly been in the forefront, but I've not been involved in any of that.  I think the most interesting case is the one that Ted Olsen and David Boyce are doing in the Ninth Circuit.  It&#8217;s going to be really, really interesting to see what happens at the Supreme Court with that in the next year or two.  AF:  That&#8217;s the Prop Eight case right [transcriptionist note:  Ironically was dealt with by SCOTUS today, June 26, 2013].  LF:  Right.  AF:  Yeah.  I think so too.  LF:  And I&#8217;m afraid that the way the lower court wrote their opinion, and it was so narrowly tailored to say is there a, is it an equal protection violation to take away a right that was already conferred that I wish it had been framed a little better to go up on appeal.  We&#8217;ll see.  AF:  Right.  Apparently they can rule it very narrow or yeah, they&#8217;ll have a choice there.  LF:  They don&#8217;t necessarily have to use that case too, do a Loving versus Virginia for lesbians and gay men, and I tend to doubt that they would unless John Roberts&#8217; brother&#8217;s gay and we don&#8217;t know it.    AF:  That is always&#8212;  LF:  It&#8217;s always Anthony Kennedy.    AF:  Well, but if you think about people having personal experience with people in the community, how much that&#8217;s impacted people we might think of as very conservative.    LF:  Right.  Right.  There was a poll this past week that sixty percent of Americans either have a friend or a family member who&#8217;s gay.  AF:  Yeah.  It makes it a lot harder to discriminate against us.  So you&#8217;ve mentioned Sharon, but are there other people in the community, the LGBTQ community here that are also in the legal community that you think we should talk to as part of our oral history project?   LF:  Sherry Rosenthal.  Marsha Morny.  [pause, thinking] I mean I&#8217;m sitting here trying to think of&#8212;  AF:  Maybe Dan Ellison.    LF:  Yeah, maybe.  If I think of anymore, I&#8217;ll let you know.  AF:  Okay.  I&#8217;m just trying to make sure we have a good list.  Is there anything else that we haven&#8217;t asked you about sort of your ideas about feminism or your ideas about feminism in the South or how much you&#8217;ve witnessed and changed in your lifetime that you&#8217;d like to share?  LF:  I, you know, nothing really other than the what I had already said about the community support against Amendment One.  That was a huge, huge deal.  AF:  Do you think you felt that way about feminism, like just sort of&#8212;I can really related to what you&#8217;re saying.  I&#8217;m just sort of thinking to myself as women&#8217;s roles really changed as we were young women and I thought about allies, I don&#8217;t know that there was that moment where I thought there was all these allies.  You know what I mean.  LF:  There isn&#8217;t.  Probably why we don&#8217;t feel it.  AF:  So&#8212;  LF:  I think there&#8217;s still so much sexism, some of it is overt intentional, and a whole lot of it is, I see it in my cases all the time, is subtle.  It&#8217;s almost like the men can&#8217;t help themselves.  I don&#8217;t know if they just weren&#8217;t raised right.  AF:  What does that look like?  Can you share that, I mean obviously we don&#8217;t want to ask you to talk about cases but just because that&#8217;s not something the normal person is sort of privy to.  The way that subtle sexism is really kind of still showing up.  LF:  I think a lot of men in management positions tend to hold women to a different standard.  They make criticisms that are unfair where you could have a guy doing the exact same thing or worse, nothing is ever said to them.  There&#8217;s sort of a lot of little daddy stuff going on, but they feel a need to criticize female employees for things that are unnecessary.  There&#8217;s still a huge pay disparity.  I mean forget about subtle.  You still see women making way, way less than men in the same position.  It&#8217;s a rare company where the women are all paid fairly and are in leadership roles commensurate with the men.  Even now in 2012 it&#8217;s rare.    AF:  Do you see a difference in some of the clients you are seeing now than you were seeing fifteen years ago?  I mean are people more or less interested in stepping up or are they coming forward for different reasons?  LF:  I don&#8217;t really see any difference.  It seems to me that when a woman is discriminated against she&#8217;s still mad.    AF:  But are the people that are coming like&#8212;  BL:  Are they more willing to&#8212;  AF:  Yeah.  More people saying oh, I&#8217;m mad, but I&#8217;m going to do something about it or are they younger and have a different set of expectations?  LF:  Actually they&#8217;re older.  AF:  They&#8217;re older.  You&#8217;re seeing more older women coming to you.  LF:  I think so.  It may also be just sort of how my practice has evolved.  I represent more executives now so they&#8217;re going to tend to be older.  But there&#8217;s always been that hesitation for women to make a charge, a Title VII charge just to say I've been discriminated against because I&#8217;m female.  Because you get branded for the whole rest of your life.  I often well tell people--this goes for race too&#8212;if somebody comes in to me and they have a claim.  Maybe they don&#8217;t have economic damages or there&#8217;s nothing significant or they&#8217;re claim is not, probably not a winner.  I often will tell people you&#8217;re twenty-five.  You&#8217;re going to have a whole lot of years working ahead of you and you&#8217;re still going to be female and you&#8217;re still going to be black or whatever it is.  And if you, sometime in the future you may be discriminated against and you may have a really great case, and it will come out that you filed a charge before, and they will paint you as a serial complainer.  So think long and hard before you put this in the public record because it will follow you for the rest of your life.    AF:  Well, and it's sort of sad that that&#8217;s still a stigma.    LF:  But it is.   AF:  To being a complainer about a system that the oppressive patriarchy.  LF:  Oh that&#8217;s in, every one of my cases that&#8217;s an interrogatory.  Have you ever filed a lawsuit or an EEOC charge before?  BL:  Have you ever worked with any clients who come to you because of problems with discrimination based on sexual orientation?  LF:  We get calls.  But there&#8217;s not a whole lot you can do about it.  BL:  Yeah, that&#8217;s true.  LF:  So you say, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.  Until the Employment and Non-discrimination Act is passed there&#8217;s nothing I can do to help you.&#8221;    AF:  It&#8217;s in Congress right now.  LF:  Look for another job.  Apply for unemployment.  BL:  How does that, how does that feel to just be waiting for that legislation to pass if it ever&#8212;  LF:  It&#8217;ll come one day.    AF:  Have the laws gotten better?  Have the judges gotten better?  Is there more openness to cases of discrimination based on gender or&#8212;  LF:  A little bit.  Title VII is a federal statute obviously.  So all my cases that have a Title VII component get pulled into federal court, and as you know the federal judge appointment process, the senators nominate; then the president nominates; and then it has to get through the Senate.  So for the vast majority of my legal career most of the federal judges have been white males who were Jesse Helms appointees.  Some of them are not particularly sympathetic to plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases except for age.  But it&#8217;s changing slowly.  I've gotten some great decisions from Judge Boyle who is a right-wing Republican, but I just pulled, I got his lottery pulled in a sex discrimination I filed, and I was actually glad.  So I mean these cases are really hard though.  Something like seventy-five percent of them don&#8217;t make it to trial.  They&#8217;re very difficult cases.  AF:  Do they get settled or thrown out?  LF:  Both.  If you get to the point of the summary judgment motion, most people think if you file a lawsuit you get to have a jury trial.  It doesn&#8217;t work like that.  You file a complaint; you do discovery; the defendant makes a motion for summary judgment.  They try to convince the judge that he can throw it out, and I thought, I think the statistic was seventy-five percent are lost at summary judgment.  So you&#8217;ve got a, if you&#8217;re going to take one of these cases and spend fifty, $100,000 worth of your time on it, you have to make sure you&#8217;re going to survive summary judgment.  We have, we now have a female federal judge in the middle district which is great.  AF:  Who is that?  LF:  Catherine Eagles.  We need more.    AF:  Have you ever thought about being a judge?  LF:  Somebody asked me that not too long ago, and I said, &#8220;I have too many skeletons in my closet.&#8221;  It was Danny Follett, Professor Dan Follett&#8217;s son, and he said, &#8220;But they&#8217;re good looking.&#8221;  [laughing]  I&#8217;m like thanks Danny.  No, I, when probably I was in my twenties or thirties, I would&#8217;ve thought about running for public office or something like that, but at this point I&#8217;m not interested in that.  I&#8217;m not interested in the fundraising.  I&#8217;m not interested in the craziness, and if I were ever to run for something, I&#8217;m pretty sure I would never get re-elected.  One term.    AF:  Get what you can get done done, right.    BL:  What&#8212;.  AF:  Oh go ahead.  BL:  What do you think needs to happen for there to be more female judges and more female legislators?  LF:  Uh everybody needs to vote Democratic.  I mean the Republicans now, I mean when you&#8217;ve Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein saying that the Republicans are the problem, it seems pretty clear we&#8217;ve crossed over.  I, they&#8217;ve always been bad but this sort of level of mendacity and intentionally sabotaging the economy for political purposes is frankly treasonous.    AF:  I&#8217;m curious what advice you might give a young person who&#8217;s sort of coming up into, especially young LBGTQ person coming up into sort of thinking about doing legal work or thinking about just being out and about.  LF:  Follow your heart.  Do what you like.  Find something that you enjoy doing.  I still, I love my job.  I&#8217;ve been to my twenty-fifth law school reunion is this year, and I still have a good time at work.  But it&#8217;s because I've made my own practice.  I've worked for myself.  If I don&#8217;t like you, I don&#8217;t have to take you as a client.  I don&#8217;t have somebody else telling me what to do, and I have a good time because I get to get the bad guys.  I get to help people get the bad guys.  What could be better than that?    AF:  Really.  LF:  And I get paid, sometimes.    AF:  I&#8217;m all for that.    BL:  I actually had a quick question about feminism and you said that you identified as a feminist from pretty early from when you started college.  And so I was wondering sort of what your personal definition of feminism is like.    LF:  Now that you mention it I think I remember now in high school, I mean to me we&#8217;re all equal.  It&#8217;s really simple.  This sort of idea that there are women&#8217;s jobs and men&#8217;s jobs and women&#8217;s emotions and men&#8217;s emotion, what a crock.  We&#8217;re all human beings.  We all have the same emotions.  From something as basic as we&#8217;re all, we all should be treated equally.  We all should get the same amount of pay for the same amount of work.  That just burns me.    AF:  It&#8217;s a good thing.  LF:  I learned as an early age, I like to tell Kaitlyn this, when I was a kid, I could make ten dollars cutting the grass and three dollars dusting.  So I did both.  [laughing]    AF:  Right, not either or, and also.    LF:  That&#8217;s thirteen.  If I save up long enough I can get a new bicycle.    BL:  What would you say about your experience e living in the South and practicing in the South?  Is there anything that you think is very particular to just being in the South and in North Carolina.  LF:  I like it here.  People are nicer.  And lawyers are nicer.  AF:  Have you, you&#8217;ve never live up North.  Well, you lived in Boston for a little while, right.    LF:  No.  AF:  But you&#8217;ve encountered lawyers from&#8212;  LF:  Yeah, I definitely get the sense I mean, especially in the employment law bar we all know each other pretty much.  I know all of the defense lawyers.  Some of them are my friends.  That this, the law, the practice of law in North Carolina is much more collegial and cooperative than it is in other big city practices or in the North.  There certainly are exceptions.  I have one right now.  But by and large people are nicer.  It&#8217;s pretty basic.    AF:  I&#8217;m good.  BL:  Okay, well, do you have anything else that you&#8217;d like to add or talk about?  I&#8217;m sure that there are a million questions we could&#8217;ve asked that we didn&#8217;t think to ask.    LF:  You got a lot out of me.  It&#8217;s a good thing Nile had just interviewed me a few weeks ago to get me warmed up.    AF:  Well, and that&#8217;s actually a compliment from a lawyer.  We got a lot out of you in the interview.  LF:  You did.  All right.    AF:  Good.  Thanks.  BL:  Thank you.  LF:  Let me get a pen here.  I got distracted thinking I didn&#8217;t finish filling out my thing.  What did my grandpa do?
