Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I am the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Ma'am, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Najwa, Najwa the first, [Najwa I] N-A-J-W-A, with Roman numeral one, like Henry the XIV, like that.
Speaker 1: All right, and what was your birth name?  Do you mind giving that to us?  Arnell, A-R-N-E-L-L, Pugh, P-U-G-H.
Speaker 2: All right.  How did--what is the, or how did you come about the name Najwa I?
Speaker 1: Well, it was given to me.  I was, I went into a shop over on Wells Street in Chicago.  And when I walked in the door, a lady said, oh, I know your name.  And I said, oh, really?  She said, yes, she said, it's Najwa.  It means one that's spiritually in tune, and I said, oh, gee.  So she said, I'll, she gave--I'll give you the spelling.  And she gave me the spelling.  And I never used the name until--but I, I came home and told everybody that I had, that she had given me the name.  And when my, one of my dancers had a daughter, she called me from the hospital and say, you got to start using your name because I'm going to name my daughter after you.  I'm gonna name her Najwa.  So you have to use your name Najwa because she's named after you.  So just for fun, I said, I'll be Najwa the first and she's Najwa the second.  And it stuck with us.  So we have Najwa the first, Najwa the second and we had, we have up to Najwa the sixth.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Well, different people say, oh, I like that name.  Give me a number, you know, so, we have six in our line.
Speaker 2: So, are they all in Chicago?
Speaker 1: Yes--well, no, one is, one moved somewhere South.  Their family moved somewhere South.  I can't think of exactly where.  I think it's Mississippi.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: Okay, and do you know what kind of, what the nationality was of the person that gave you the name?  Was it--?
Speaker 1: She was--well, it was a Jerusalem, it was a restaurant over there, Jerusalem--a restaurant.  So I imagine that she was from, probably from Israel because she told me that she grew up in, all over the East.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I've been to that--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I know Najwa is a, an Eastern name.  You hear it a lot in Africa and you hear it a lot in--all over the East.  And it means one that's spiritually in tune.  I have checked it out.  There's three or four more other meanings too, but I choose to live by one that's spiritually in tune because, you know, a name, my understanding is if you have a name, you know, it should have meaning, and it gives you something to live up to.  So I preferred that one.  The other meanings I got were, one was Egyptian.  I think it's love and another African country, it was, it meant romantic or something like that.  But--oh, and the other meaning was secretive and confidential.  So my first choice is to be spiritually in tune, one that's spiritually in tune and the second choice is secretive and confidential.  So you can tell me your problems (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.

Story_ID: 11239
Speaker 1: We'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Ruby Tom, her maiden name DeMeyers.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: D-E-capital M-E-Y-E-R-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Ruby, the middle name is?

Speaker 2: Yeah, I think.
Speaker 1: So that's like a middle name, Ruby Tom Meyers?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, DeMeyers.
Speaker 1: DeMeyers, okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She, I believe she was born--I know May 16, but I believe it was 1900.  She, I'm like her, she never would exactly tell us, but what we, from what we gathered, 1900.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Miss--in Mississippi, and I don't remember right off her--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We do have this written, but I'm sorry, I don't remember right off.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't want to say the wrong city.
Speaker 1: Well, what can you tell us about your ancestors on your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: You know, I remember, I remember my grandmother, my mother's mother, Mamie DeMeyers.  And my mother, she--my mother had two--a brother, James DeMeyers and a sister, Mamie DeMeyers.  I never knew, I never did know my grandfather.  He, he, he passed, I think, while I was a little girl.  But they were farmers.  And my aunt, she moved to New York when she was very young.  I think she went to a boarding school somewhere near New York.  And then she moved to New York.  And her brother, my uncle, he came to live with us in Chicago.  And we kind of just grew up close together, but that's about it.  Her mother--my mother had a very small family, and she had some relatives, relatives here that moved like to Gary, Indiana and Chicago.  But on her side, it wasn't big, a very big family.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they tell any stories on your mother's side about life back during slavery or during reconstruction or any of that?
Speaker 2: Not as I know of.  I mean my mother had plenty stories about the South, you know, but I don't remember any stories past her, her mother, her mother.  You know, a lot of times, they didn't like to talk about those things because I remember us asking my grandmother questions when she came to live with us, you know, when she got old.  And she, you know, they don't like--they didn't like to talk about those things cause they were so horrible.  I remember my grandmother telling us about--the only story I remember is my grandmother telling us about--I think my grandmother was, grew up in Texas, some part of Texas, she was born.  And she said that one girl in her town had left and came to Chicago and came up North somewhere and got married.  And she had a baby and she came back home to, so her family could see the baby.  But she had been gone so long the people in the little town and at the railroad station didn't remember her.  And she said because they didn't remember her, they knew she was coming from North, when she got off the, off the train, and she had this little bitty baby in her arms, and they just kicked her suitcase and, you know, she was trying to walk and hold the baby and the suitcase.  And they kicked the suitcase and stood all in front of her, knocked the suitcase out of her hands.  And when she finally told, when they finally found out whose grandchild or whose child it was, you know, they let her go.  But, I mean just the idea of a black person coming from North, coming down there, they didn't like the idea.  And that's all I remember from her, from my grandmother.  Now, mother, you know, she had stories, you know, about their life and lifestyle.  But I don't remember a lot of them because my mother told a lot Mississippi ghost stories (chuckle).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I remember--.
Speaker 1: Maybe you can tell us one of those.  I mean that, but--.
Speaker 2: I, yeah, I don't, I, I have, I'd have to think about that.  But I do remember, one thing I remember, story I remember from my mother about growing up down there.  She was telling me about a man could go and buy a marriage--a license, and, with your name on it, and then come back and you were married to him (laughter).  So I remember that from her.
Speaker 1: It's probably true.
Speaker 2: And she said she had a--yeah, she had a friend.  Yeah, she said that the man--she wouldn't marry him.  And he went to the courthouse and got a license with her name on it and paid for it and everything, came back.  So she, he showed her the license that she was married, so she had to--I mean she, they didn't--she didn't know any better than not to do it because, you know, and she just had to go live with him and she was married to him for as long as they lived.  So I remember that story.  But that's about all I remember from her.  And my aunt, she never used to--she never liked to look back.  She never, she moved to New York, and I used t go visit her all the time cause we were very close.  Well, she never liked thinking about the South, you know.  She didn't like, she didn't like it at all.  She just--and she never wanted to go back, and she just never liked it, to think about it or talk about it.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any idea where the name DeMeyers came from or where--did they ever talk about that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: That's kind of an unusual, you know, you don't hear it that much.
Speaker 2: Un-un.
Speaker 1: They never talked about it?
Speaker 2: No.  No, cause I was--now, I was my mother's twelfth child, so I, you know, my parents, you know, some of my older brothers and sisters would know some of that.  You know, but I didn't really get it all, you know, from them.  And like now, when I want to find out things, I have to call my sisters (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your mother get a chance to go to school when she grew up and, and that sort of thing or did--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she went to school.  She got married young though.  She married my father [Timothy Pugh] when she, when she was thirteen.  I think--she used to always say she was married off, you know, because that's what they, that's what they did at that, during those times.  You know, if you got married--if you were thirteen, fourteen years old, you know, and somebody wanted to marry you, they considered who that person might be, you know.  I know my father was much older than her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when did your mother move to Chicago?
Speaker 2: From my understanding, let's see.  From my understanding they came--you know, not my mother, they came, she--cause after she married my father, they came back and forth.  They went like back and forth, you know.  They had a lot of children so they were trying to make a living.  And his relatives, my father's relatives were here.  So they kept coming back, and then when things got bad here, they would move back South again, like that.  So I don't remember exactly when.  I know a few of my brothers and sisters were married here in--I mean born in Chicago.
Story_ID: 11240
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Timothy Pugh, P-U-G-H.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oooh, I don't--he was born February, February 7, but I don't remember--oh, [Lower] Peachtree, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I probably can think of my mother's in a minute too, but right now--I know, Peachtree, he was born in Peachtree, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what year was he born?  You say he was older than your mother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was born in eighteen something.  I remember, he was, I think he was, must have been born in something like eighteen--in the 1880s.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the late 1880s, you think?
Speaker 2: I, I don't really remember--.
Speaker 1: You think it might have been--(simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: --cause when my father passed, I was young too.
Speaker 1: Okay, you think he might have been like ten years older than your mother or older than that?
Speaker 2: You know, it seemed to me like it was, it might have been--if I could re--I mean seem like I remember, she might have been thirteen.  He might have been like twenty-seven, something like that.  I'm--that's what I'm--you know, I don't know where that came from, but seems like I remember something like, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: So something like 1886 or '87 [1887], something like that, '86 [1886], '87 [1887]?
Speaker 2: It was somewhere, yeah, somewhere, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember I used to think all the time about his mother, you know, that she was twelve years old when they, I think she was twelve years old when they freed the slaves, so-called freed the slaves.  And they were living in Mississippi at that time.
Speaker 1: Did she, was there a story attached to it as to what things were like when the slaves were freed or what they did when they got free?
Speaker 2: No, all I know is that they changed their name.
Speaker 1: What was it before?  I think, I think it was Lipton, it was the slave master's name, whichever way.
Speaker 2: Any other, any stories about that time that they tell, any other stories about that time?
Speaker 1: No, not too much, not too much from my father's side.  And, I'm really trying to think cause I grew up, we grew up with my father's family cause he had a very big family.  I grew up with a lot of cousins, and, you know, relatives, but my father being a minister, I think we heard Biblical stories (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, so what faith was he a reverend in?  What was he, what was the--?
Speaker 1: At the time, we called it sanctified, sanctified religion, Church of God.
Speaker 2: So, so your father already had relatives here you said.
Speaker 1: Yes, his brothers were here.
Speaker 2: And is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 1: No, other than she--my mother [Ruby Tom DeMeyers] said that she just knew him, you know, as Mr. Pugh, you know.  And her and her family, you know, talked about knowing him as being a nice man.  And she just said one day, they told her she was getting married, and she was only thirteen, you know, but that's what they did during those times.  And they told her she was getting married, and they planned her wedding and all.  And she, she never, she said, she always said she wanted to be married.  She wanted to be a school teacher.  She wanted to finish school.  But that's what they did at that time, and she had her first child when she was fourteen.
Speaker 2: Okay, those are different--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think she went to live with, went to live with his family.  Now, I just, I remember my uncle telling me that, telling us one day that--see, they're the same age.  This is my father's younger brother.  And he was saying that he used to be, he used to watch my mother.  He liked her.  And then the next thing he knew because, you know, that she was in the buggy at his house.  But at the same time, I mean he was just saying he liked her, but he, at the same time, he was thinking, they wouldn't let him get married because he was too young, you know.  So I remember that, and I remember thinking, you know, that he was, she was, he was too young, but she wasn't.  He wasn't marrying her, but, you know, just, he's thinking, married, period.
Speaker 2: That's an interesting story.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, yeah.  So, you know, she, I mean just, it was the times, you know.  It's, you know, I guess.  She wasn't, she was never happy about getting married so young, but her and my father were together until he passed in--.
Speaker 2: When did your father pass away?
Speaker 1: In, I think about nineteen--ooh, in the '50s [1950s], I think about '52 [1952].  I'm not sure, '52 [1952], '53 [1953], in the '50s [1950s].  I don't remember exactly, but it seemed like about '52 [1952].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was, he had an accident on his truck.  And he never came, you know, he was unconscious and never came back.
Speaker 2: Now, what did he do for a living?  Did he drive a truck for a living?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he did.  He had trucks.  He used to, they used to call, used to haul iron and steel, you know.  But he was, he was self employed, you know.  I guess he did what he could do because he only had one arm, you know, so.
Speaker 2: Is there a story about how he lost his arm?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  He, the story--I remember him saying--this is me overhearing this, you know, when I was a kid, little kid, that he was in a fact--he worked in a factory.  And his, I think his hand or sleeve got caught in a machine, and he said that it was gonna take him.  He knew it was gonna take him, and he said, all he could think about was my mother at home with all those babies, and she--he said he reached for, he reached and was able to get a hatchet, an ax hatchet and he chopped it off.
Speaker 2: Wow, that's something.
Speaker 1: Yes, he thought about his children, and he said, oh, how will they do?  You know, he had to feed 'em, so he did that.  But the funny part about this story is, I always thought--when I heard the story, in fact, I heard the story, I was a little girl, like, you know, little girl.  And I used to hear him tell that story.  And all I could think about my father cut his arm off for me and nobody else; nobody else, and I'm the twelfth child now.  So nobody else; none of my brothers and my sisters.  This was for me.  And I, I internalized that like it was for me.  And I, so I kind of, I worshipped him, you know, that he would cut his arm out and have that much pain, you know, for me.  So every day I'd wait for him to come home, and he'd let me wash his hand, you know, cause he couldn't scrub his hand, you know, we washed his hands every day and button his shirt and help--we'd fix the tie, and tie his shoes, you know.  And, I mean it was years later, and I, I, I worshipped him all these years that he was a king or something.  He did this.  And it was years later when I found out that when he had his arm cut--when he cut his arm off, I wasn't even born (laughter).  So that was always funny.  I said, oh, my goodness, I went through all of that.  I suffered all the pain.  When he would sleep at night in the winter, you know, and it was cold out, he would moan.  And I, I would hear him, and I'd stay awake all night long listening to him, you know, because I knew he was hurting, you know, with his arm.  And I thought he'd call for me. So, you know, that was something.
Speaker 2: So it's still, it's still hurting even though it was--?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, you know, because a long time, I mean I guess during those times--he had a cast he used to wear on it, but, in the winter, you know, I guess, you know, that draft, like people arthritis and stuff, you know.  You can dress up ever so warm or do whatever, you know, but you still feel it.  It was like that kind, that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 11241
Speaker 1: What was his [father, Timothy Pugh] personality like?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was wonderful.  He was a minister, a very kind man, took care of us and everybody else in the neighborhood, looked out for everybody.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was a minister in the sense, in that kind of community sense where the minister actually ministers to a community?
Speaker 2: I don't think it was, it was, as far as the community was concerned.  He was like an evangelist, you know, and he moved about and around a lot, but he, you know, you just have that kind of person in the neighborhood.  First of all, I grew up in like what you would probably call a clan or something, you know, all his brothers and his sisters and all of their children.  And everywhere one moved, the other one moved.  We'd take up the whole block, you know, almost like that.  That's the way we grew up.  And he, with him being the oldest, he like headed the clan, (laughter) so, and then the other people in the neighborhood, you know, they, Mr. P was the person to go to, you know, if you were in trouble, you know.  And he helped everybody.  And on top of being a minister, you know, that, you know, made it better.  And then another thing, the kind of work that he did, it was a lot of times that people would know he, we--they knew he had a lot of children.  You know, so they would give him lots of things, and then he could share it with everybody in the neighborhood, you know.  They would, I remember, you know, they'd save everything for One-armed Pugh, you know, the minister, you know, the preacher, you know, like that.  So, he, he was a good person.  Everybody respected him.
Speaker 1: Okay, was the church right there in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  He was, he, he was--we were, we grew up at 62nd and Langley, Church of God.  That's where we grew up, but like I said, he was more or less an evangelist, and he, they traveled a lot.  I mean, I guess going around to small, maybe small towns in Illinois or something.  I know they always went to Anderson, Indiana, places like that.  I think that was the headquarters of the church, though, church headquarters, Church of God--Church of God's headquarters was in Anderson, Indiana.  He would--but I, you know, from what--he moved about a lot.  I don't remember him going way, way, you know, away, but, cause he was always home.  He had to work, you know.  He had a lot of children.
Story_ID: 11242
Speaker 1: What was your mother [Ruby Tom DeMeyers] like?  What was her personality?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was quiet (laughter).  She was quiet, you know, she was quiet.  If, I think, you know, if, if I'm creative at all, I think I got that, probably got that from her.  And my father [Timothy Pugh] was a strong person and I, I think I'm strong.  I know I got that from him, you know, but she was a real quiet, real soft spoken--I've never heard her raise her voice in my life.  You know, she didn't raise her voice.  She didn't say, "Come here, come back, do this", never raised her voice over, she never talked, raised her voice, very soft spoken, very nice.  You know, she took care of her children, her family, everything centered around her family.  She did her duty.
Story_ID: 11243
Speaker 1: In your household now, you have a lot of brothers and sisters, can you--where did, you're the youngest?
Speaker 2: Next to.
Speaker 1: Next to the youngest.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, but I never grew up in the house with all of them--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --cause they were older.  I was the twelfth child.  And I grew up, I basically grew up with my younger sister and my younger brother.  I was in the middle.  And I do remember, like I have two sisters that were older than my brother.  And, you know, we all live--I remember them growing up, you know, to a certain--well, till I maybe got eleven or twelve.  And then they got married, you know, but we grew up, mostly the three of us.  Everybody just thought of us as the three--like even now, people don't know I have brothers and sisters, that many brothers and sisters because they're so much older, you know.  And they kind of like, you know, they get to be like mothers or something to you or--I remember most of my big sisters--I have nieces and nephews my age.  So most of my sisters, my big sisters and brothers are like mothers or fathers or something.  Anyway, they took on that role.  And then the ones that weren't so far from us, they were like big sisters, you know.  So it was more or less like the three of us.  So I could say I grew in the house--up in the house with maybe five of us for the most part.  And then your brothers and sisters, they all came back home all the time and brought their children and husbands and lived.  They'd stay awhile, and, you know, and then they'd leave and maybe somebody else would come, like that.  But basically, they were, some of them were married when I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, well, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory, like what's your first memory?  Or do you have one?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  I do, I, I--let's see, the earliest.  I remember my brother making me tie my shoes.  And I didn't, I guess I didn't want to tie 'em.  I guess I didn't--I was trying to pretend I didn't how, and I wouldn't tie 'em, and he was gonna insist that I tie my shoes.  This was a big brother, you know, he told--he wanted everybody to leave me alone and he wanted the shoes tied.  So I remember that, him making me tie those shoes.  And I never forgot that, you know.  And I, I guess that might be, that might be probably the earliest, cause it seemed like I was, picture myself as a very little girl, yeah, that's probably the earliest.  And then I remember my brother passing.  When I was about six years old, my oldest brother, I remember that, getting dressed in white for the funeral, white high-top shoes and, and white dress, you know, going to the funeral and my mother [Ruby Tom DeMeyers] being so--she grieved so over it.  I remember that.  That's about it.
Story_ID: 11244
Speaker 1: You were telling the story about your father [Timothy Pugh] and the coats.  Could you tell that again?
Speaker 2: Oh, how I remember he used to go to cleaners, different cleaners that were going out of business or people or cleaners that had clothes that people didn't come back to get.  And he would buy out the, the cleaners or the clothes and bring them back and sell--put 'em in--he had a trailer he'd put next to our house, and he would put the clothes in there so that everybody could have coats, buy coats for a nickel, dime, quarter, you know, for coats and sweater.  And I remember winter skirts and stuff like that, wool skirts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did a lot of stuff like that.
Story_ID: 11245
Speaker 1: Can you tell me, like what were some of the--now, you grew up at 62nd and Langley?
Speaker 2: No, that was the church we went to, the church my father [Timothy Pugh], that was our church.
Speaker 1: All right, and you grew up on the West Side.
Speaker 2: I grew up on the West Side of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Where were you?
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up at--I remember when I was little--the first address I remember was Fourteenth and, and Washburn.  Then after that I remember growing up somewhere on Throop.  I can't remember that address, but I remember Thirteenth and Racine, over by the school we went to, [Wendell] Smith School, Thirteenth--1136 West 13th Street.  I remember that, and then we moved further west, Central Park and Sixteenth, and he bought a house out there.
Speaker 1: Okay, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of growing--sights and sounds?  Well, we grew up at thirt--I remember being out, when I was out, able to get out on my own more, was at 1136 West 13th Street, and I think the South Water market was on one side of us and Taylor Street was on the other, on the other side, and we had Roosevelt Road.  So we had the Italian neighborhood where we could get the Italian, Italian beef and sherbet, what you call it, Icees and stuff like that, and then I remember people going to the South Water market in the mornings, like a lot of people who didn't have, you know, had a lot of children or didn't have families, you know, husbands, they would go to the South Water market in the morning to get fruits and vegetables.  At 6:00 o'clock in the morning, you could see people passing and everybody was going to the South Water market.  What else was around there?  I don't know, I just, you know, just the neighborhood over on, on Roose--on Roosevelt Road, like around Roosevelt and Throop.  We'd walk over there.  Let's see, what was over there?  The fire station.  They had just built some projects over on Racine and Thirteenth Street, so that was new because I remember my, my mother [Ruby Tom DeMeyers] really wanting to live in the projects because it was central heating.  And we had the coal, and we had the coal stoves.  So, but she could never get in there because I think with the income thing, income situation, but to her, to, to her and a lot of people, the projects was the better thing, you know.
Speaker 1: And that's true.  A lot of people don't realize that now.  But--.
Speaker 2: At, well, at that time, well, yeah, at that time, it was a big deal because we used to love go to visit the kids over, the kids in the projects.  They had nice apart--houses, you know.  It was new and everything, you know.
Speaker 1: Right, right, that's something that's lost, and we--they were like transition housing when they first--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Right, and see then on the other side of us was, the other way, over past--well, we were at Thirteenth and Racine, and there was Thirteenth and Blue Island by Smith School, the school we went to.  And on the other side was Maxwell Street, you know.  So, I mean that's where we went every day.  That's where we--on Saturdays and Sundays, it was Maxwell Street.
Story_ID: 11246
Speaker 1: Can you describe Maxwell Street for those who have never seen it and never been there?
Speaker 2: Really (laughter).  Oh, it was so much fun on Saturdays and Sundays, especially Sundays because, you know, a lot of--it'd be a lot of entertainment.  You could see, you know, I mean shows, like the circus, people doing all kind of things.  You know, remember the man with the chicken.  I can't remember his name, chicken, the one with the big rooster.
Speaker 1: I've heard of him.  Can you describe him for us?
Speaker 2: What's his name?  Oh, gee.  And now we always thought that that rooster could talk.  I can't think of his--I, I really can't think of his name right now.
Speaker 1: Well, couldn't--I've heard the chicken would dance and--.
Speaker 2: Do everything.  And he, I mean that chicken, that rooster actually could understand him or he could understand the chicken.  I don't know which one.  But he would always be down there, and then you'd have the bands, the blues bands, and you'd have people that were handicapped, you know, had physical disabilities, you know, they could make extra money.  I know we used to like to go down and watch the man who could do everything with his toes cause he didn't have arms.  You know, and then people would give money, you know, to see what he, what, what he could do or what anybody could do that was down there.  So you'd go from one little, you'd go from one--it was real crowded cause everybody be standing around watching whatever show was, was being put on.  But you could go from--you'd, you'd walk a little ways, then you'd have to stop again because you'd see another group, you know, another person doing something, playing the guitar or, you know.  Then they had plenty food.  I remember the pretzels and the hot dogs and the hamburgers, and everything was smelling, you know, the whole place was smelling, you know.  And my mother [Ruby Tom DeMeyers], she used to--she was a real--she could really bargain.  And we'd go in the stores, and she used to try to beat, get down there first because she knew if she got down there first, whatever she wanted in that store, she was gonna get because the merchants weren't gonna let you out of that store if you were the first customer without, you know, getting, getting you to buy something cause it was like bad luck for the whole day if they didn't sell something to the first customer.  So we'd--she'd get down, she would get there early when the stores would open.  So that was, that was always fun.  And, of course, we didn't like to hear her bargain.  We'd say, oh, why don't she come on, why don't she come on?  Well, she'd walk in the store and switch around and walk out if she didn't get the price she wanted.  They'd call her back, and then she'd come back and they'd talk again, and she'd turn, walk out, and they'd call back.  It was like that, so, at all the stores, but she was good.  But then that was happening with everybody, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you had to handle--(simultaneously)--.
Speaker 2: You knew you had to go, and you knew when you went down there you had to bargain.  You bargained for everything, you know, you didn't pay the first price.
Story_ID: 11247
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little girl?  What were you like and what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I think you would have called me a little bad girl.  I was a free spirit, free spirit, and like I told you, my mother [Ruby Tom DeMeyers] was kind of quiet and kept everybody, you know, close and near her, but somehow I had to, I had to get away, you know.  So I would, I had had--I would get up in the mornings when there was no school, and when my father [Timothy Pugh] would leave the house, after I finished tying his shoes, cause he'd wake me up every, every morning to tie his shoes and fix his sleeve.  And I'd hear him, wait until he left out, and then I would get up and I'd sneak out and I'd just go walking and roaming.  And at that time, you could do that.  I roamed our neighborhood all the time, every day and then hook up with some friends and hook up with some other kids and then come home every day and get a whipping for being away all day (chuckle).  So, you know, I was kind of a busy little girl.
Speaker 1: And kind of adventurous, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then I didn't understand any different.  I didn't understand why I--I didn't understand that I couldn't go.  Why not go?  You know, I mean I didn't under--I didn't get that in my head, you know.  So I'd just get up and go and get my whipping every day, you know.  I think I kind of did everything I wanted to do.  I didn't do what I was supposed to do.  My sister, we--the three of us together, my brother being a boy, he could roam.  And my sister, she was, she was hang by my mother, holding onto her dress tail, and that, and then, and then me, you know.  So, when I'd slip away, when I'd go away and go out, I was the bad little girl cause she was sitting, be sitting right on the steps in her little pretty dress, you know, until my mother called her in for lunch or whatever.  And I would come back with my dresses all torn up cause I'd jump the fence, and we played hide-and-go-seek, and we played "follow the leader"  and all that kind of stuff.  You know, I would--did a lot of physical stuff too growing up.  I was into sports, you know, played baseball.  I played, ran track, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you take any dance when you were a little girl?
Speaker 2: You know, we took dance, we took dance classes when we went to, to the mart, to, like Marcy Center [Marcy-Newberry Association], down on, on Maxwell and Newberry, and we took dancing when we went to the community center over on Throop, when they built the new projects.  And that was when I was a very little girl, and then later, I went to dance classes like at that park districts and things like that.  But my father, being a sanctified minister, you know, you didn't tell them you were taking dance classes, you know.  They thought, you know, I was going to play ball, play, run, you know, play baseball, run track, like that.  And so when I needed tap shoes, I would ask for--I used to tell my father I needed some new track shoes or I needed some new baseball shoes, and then I could get some tap shoes with the money.  So I, when I--.
Speaker 1: So he didn't tolerate dancing?
Speaker 2: Hum?  He, he didn't know.  We didn't tell him because we knew that, you didn't dance.  Sanctified people didn't dance and so, you know, we res-respected in that, you know, that, you know, so, and he never--you know, we just didn't tell him.
Story_ID: 11248
Speaker 1: Did you spend a lot of time in church when you were young?
Speaker 2: Well, no, the church was on the South Side, so we only went with him [father, Timothy Pugh].  We went on Sundays, and then sometimes we had to go in the evenings with him, but not--we didn't, no, we weren't the kind that just lived, stayed up in church because my mother [Ruby Tom DeMeyers] didn't go very much, you know.  So she, we went, I guess when he told her that we should go.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you, were you, did you sing in the choir and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, no, I, now, later, when I got older and, and went to churches with my friends, went to different churches with my friends, you know, we joined a choir at Open Door Baptist Church, and, cause all the kids sang in the choir.  But my family didn't know I was going to Open Door Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did it limit the kind of music you heard around the house too?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We, we couldn't, you know, my, my mother--the only thing that we could really listen to was like cultural music.  And everybody think that's so strange today when I tell them the music we listened to in our house.  And that's why I think I like a lot of different music today, you know, is because when were little kids, we were listening to Hawaiian music, and everybody would be laughing at us, and my mother liked that.  And she could, she could that--that wouldn't disturb my father.  You know, it didn't sound like, you know, the music that sanctified people didn't listen to.  And we, you know, we had, we had very, we had cultural music and we had, of course, spiritual and gospel and all that stuff, we sang all day and all night at my house.  Everybody sang, and my whole family, when we were growing up kids, that's all we did was sing (chuckle).  But everybody sang church songs and stuff like that and the songs that you learned in school cause my sisters played the piano and all of that.  So we did that, but everything we did was cultural, you know.  I mean we went out, if we went somewhere, and we did a lot.  My father took us out a lot as a family, the three--my brother and my sister and my mother and father, we went to, you know, cultural events, you know, and I think that's why I like all of that today.  You know, it's because that's what I grew up with.
Speaker 1: So what kind of events would you--?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean it--.
Speaker 1: --would you go to the symphony and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Would you go to the symphony and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Orchestra Hall, yeah, Orchestra Hall, but we went to, yeah, and we went to, you know, the fairs, the railroad fair and, and the zoo and museums and, you know, all the museums and, you know, things like that.
Story_ID: 11249
Speaker 1: Tell me about school.  Now, you went to [Wendell] Smith School for elementary school.
Speaker 2: I went to Smith, let's see where did I go first?  I went to [Joseph] Medill [Primary School] first, like a thing, like kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--.
Speaker 2: And then I went Medill--no, Smith School, and then I went to Howland [Elementary School for the Arts].
Speaker 1: Is that a middle school?
Speaker 2: Howl is, well, at the time it was just from kindergarten to eighth grade, you know, Christiana and Sixteenth Street in Chicago.  And then I went to--I graduated from there.  And then I went to [David G.] Farragut High School and Harrison High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how did you like school?  Were you a good student and did you like school?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I liked school, yeah, I did.  I, I liked school.  I don't know how good I was, you know.  I was good, you know, in high, maybe when my, my, I had, I was hanging with friends that liked to do homework and, you know, get good grades, you know, went from that.  And then I had my other buddies at certain times that we didn't do anything, you know.  But basically, you know, I wanted, you know, I always liked school, still do.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: History, you know, at the time.  I think history.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, were there any teachers that like were special mentors to you or anything in school?
Speaker 2: I don't really think so.  I think while I was, you know, a nice girl and, and, you know, fun person and all, I mean I, I think I was still like maybe a little distant, you know, to, with, you know--I, I think with my teachers and all.  I, I don't remember, I don't remember a teacher, being close to a teacher.  I was closer to my dance teachers (laughter), than any, than any teachers.
Story_ID: 11250
Speaker 1: Who were the dance teachers that you remember from, you know, in those, I mean from the early days?  I mean were you taking dance in grade school?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.  We, we were going to the neighborhood places, park district, downtown to Jimmy Payne [School of Dance] and anybody who could, was teaching dance in the neighborhood.  You know, we had, like if you, if one person went somewhere and studied, say, ballet, then they came and they taught everybody in the block, on the block.  And we did our little block shows and things like that.  But I always, I always hung around with kids that got dance and sports cause basically, I, basically, I, I was an athlete, still am.  I think I still have that spirit, you know.  I ran track and, you know, I played base, you know, baseball and basketball.  I was real athletic and that's what I enjoyed, you know, I really enjoyed it and my, you know, I had to do--if I had to say, could start all over again and say what are you gonna do, what are you gonna be?  I think--and you have a choice to really do it, like, like today, the girls that are athletic, they have a lot of choices, if I had those, I would have been an athlete, professionally, probably.
Speaker 1: But in those days, there were no, there were no girls' teams for certain things?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, yeah, we ran track.  We did, we did it, you know, we did, we had our little track meets.  And they had the Junior Olympics and all of that.  We did all of that.  You know, but nobody encouraged you to, you know, be in sports cause that's where I would have been.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that phenomena is kind of new, I guess--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --where people are encouraging girls--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you didn't have--yeah, I mean I hung around with ten or twelve girls every day that we went from track to I--the only thing I didn't do was swim, track to--the seasons, you know, spring, it was track; in the fall it was basketball and volleyball in the winter, and you know, just all of that we did it, you know.  And our blue jeans and t-shirts and track shoes on one shoulder and baseball shoes--I don't see baseball shoes any more, but baseball shoes on the other shoulder and your tap shoes thrown somewhere else around you every day.
Speaker 1: So you stayed active, physically active.
Speaker 2: Very, very.
Story_ID: 11251
Speaker 1: Did you have any idea when you were in high school about what you wanted to do as a, you know, professionally?
Speaker 2: In sports, gym.  I wanted to, you know, be a gym teacher.  Gym, yeah, as gym teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you, now, you started at [David G.] Farragut [High School], and then you--did you move or something?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: It was a--I was, I was at Farragut's district, but all my friends were at Harrison [High School].  So I found a way to get transferred over to Harrison (laughter) with my buddies.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Farragut, it was--was Farragut like mostly black in those days?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I didn't think so.
Speaker 2: No, it was a lot of Polish children--kids--well, let's see at Harris--at Farragut, Polish, Bohemian, mostly.
Speaker 1: That's the school that Kim Novak graduated from.  I don't what year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, a few Jew--yeah, a lot of Jewish kids too went there.  And see that was, that's what happened up in my neighborhood.  We lived on Central Park, and the neighborhood was still, you know, mostly Jewish, you know, and I think it might have been, you know, a few black families and maybe a Mexican family and maybe a--some, somebody, you know, I, you know, it wasn't--it was all Jewish.  So that's why I went to Farragut, the children, you know, plus, they were across the way, two or three blocks over, you had the Polish children.  So they all went to Farragut, and then the children two or three blocks in back of me went to Harrison.  And at Harrison, they had a lot of Italian people, students and kids, and Italian kids and Greek.  I remember the Greek kids and Italian kids cause we all had big fun together (laughter), you know, sharing, you know, cultures.  Yeah, I remember, I remember so well how we'd get together and everybody talk about their grandmothers that was from the old country and the things that they did, and we'd share food.  It, you know, that, that was fun times, dances in school, in school, you know.  That's when we did the--we learned the tarantellas and, you know, just all the dances from the different ethnic groups.  Those were fun times for me.
Story_ID: 11252
Speaker 1: Did you have a plan about how to become a gym teacher?  Did you--had you planned to go to college?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So where did you--?
Speaker 2: Teachers College.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, Chicago Teachers College.
Speaker 1: Which is now Chicago State [University], I think.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum, I went there first.  But then I, I left to join the show.
Speaker 1: Okay, so about how old are you at this point, you think?
Speaker 2: I just out of high school, you know--.
Speaker 1: You're eighteen?
Speaker 2: --seventeen, going on eighteen, like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I'm scared to ask you what year you graduated--.
Speaker 2: And my father [Timothy Pugh] had passed--yeah, good.  My father had passed, and, you know, I was a little lost, you know, cause I was very close to him, you know.  So, but I was going to school cause my mother [Ruby Tom DeMeyers], she always wanted everybody to be school teachers cause like I said, that's what she wanted to be.  So she wanted school teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you wanted to teach gym, you actually did want to be a teacher--(simultaneously)--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wanted to be a gym, yeah, a gym teacher.  That was--I knew I was going to college.  I knew I was gonna go.  And that's, that was it.  That was the choice for me.  I wouldn't think nothing else.  It would have been in sports some kind of way.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--.
Speaker 2: Dance probably would have been good, some kind of dance, but it was nothing like going to school, college for dance at that time.  So, you know, it was gym.
Story_ID: 11253
Speaker 1: How did you get involved in your first show as a dancer?
Speaker 2: Okay, like I said, we used to go downtown to Jimmy Payne's dance studio [Jimmy Payne School of Dance] when we were like thirteen, fourteen years old--me, when I was like thirteen, fourteen years old.  But it was also my buddies.  We knew that he was teaching African--we knew that he was teaching Afro-Cuban dance and calypso dance.  And, of course, all of us wanted to be like Katherine Dunham or be in her dance group.  You know, I just knew when I grew up I was gonna be one of Kath--I was gonna join her troupe.  You know, you read it in, we're reading in  JET and Ebony, I mean not JET, Ebony and, you know, or what--I don't remember what other magazines.  It was some other magazines.  And you'd see her in Europe, and I used buy--keep those books in my drawer and look at 'em all the time because I was definitely going to, you know--that was it for me.  You know, I was aspiring to do that--when I decided I wanted to be a dancer, it was Katherine Dunham.  But Jimmy Payne did the kind of dance styles she did, so naturally, that's what I wanted to do, you know.  So we went, I used to go down to Jimmy Payne's for his classes.  I think they were on Saturdays.  I'm not sure.  So Jimmy Payne had--I was kind of--.
Speaker 1: And where did he teach?
Speaker 2: Four, at--in the Fine Arts Building downtown, and he also taught in that building where the Oriental Theater used to be, is and always downtown.  It was always downtown, but he was in three or four places downtown, and wherever he was, we followed him.
Speaker 1: Tell us something about what you know about Jimmy Payne that you think the people would want to know cause he's no longer with us, and he's a important figure in the dance in Chicago.  So.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, what I know about Jimmy is that he was from, I think, Panama.  And he lived a lot of--I think he lived in Cuba, and I think Barbados, and I'm not sure which one of those places he was from, but I know he was all around like in areas like that.  And he lived in New--he moved from there to New York.  And this is just me remembering, so I'm not saying that this is it, but this is what I kind of remember, just listening to him talk.  And that's how he started doing all the different kind of dances.  But what I was fascinated with Jimmy about was, was him being able to a, some languages, different languages.  And he used to every--you know, speak in Spanish, you know, all the time, and I'd, you know, listen to him.  But that's, that's how we found out that he was from, one of those Latino countries.  But he, he, he taught Lena Horne.  He taught Nichelle Nichols, I mean, and he used to fascinate us with all those stories about all the people that he danced with and taught dance to.  So, you know, he could play--he played, he could play his drums; he could dance, he could sing, he could tap.  He could do everything in dance (chuckle), for, you know, to us, you know, he knew everything.  And I learned how, I learned all my basics with Jimmy.
Speaker 1: Now, how old were you when you first started dancing with Jimmy Payne?
Speaker 2: I think, I think maybe like thirteen, fourteen--thirteen or fourteen.  But we didn't--he used to let us do gigs.  We weren't that good.  I don't know if we were that good.  We just had a lot of energy.  And he used to do a lot of shows at country--at the country clubs, you know.  So, all we had to do was like go in and do our little show, and then they'd pack us up and take us out.  So one time Jimmy had asked us--well, I guess I must have been about seventeen at the time, I was cause I--and, you know, this is what we'd been doing over the years, country clubs and places like that with Jimmy.  Some people used to come through the neighborhood, and at the time, you could do that.  You know, it's a man that used to come in the neighborhood and gather up everybody, all the kids who thought they could dance and sing or what, and he'd take us to go do a show and give us three dollars, five dollars each.  You know, we did all that in the neighborhood.  So, but Jimmy, well, I, we used to do little shows with him.  But when we got to be seventeen and we could do other places--when I got seventeen and was old enough to look like, you know, we could dance other places.  So he used to go to this place in Wisconsin called the White Pub.  And it was a Latino club.  And he took us there, and one night I was there and this impresario, his name was Larry Steele, he came in and he watched our show.  And we were introduced to him cause one of the girls that danced with us also used to dance with him--did dance with him.  And she introduced all of us.  And then they said they were going off to Australia, and, you know, I was excited.  She was going to Australia, and, but I never thought about it, you know.  And then about a month later, well, it might have been a month or so, a month or two later, some time later, I got this call from his wife, and she said, you know, she said, how would you like to go to Australia?  I said, Australia?  She said, yes, she said, Larry Steele called, and he remembered seeing you at the White Pub in Wisconsin dancing, and he wanted to know, he needed another girl, and he want to know if you would like to go to Australia.  So, of course, I said, yes, but I was still scared, you know, cause I had never been on a plane or anything at that time.  And she said, well, okay, she said, I'll call you back, you know.  So she, you know, called me back.  She said, you got to go down and get your fingerprints, and--I mean go down and get your--.
Speaker 1: Passport.
Speaker 2: --passport and that whole bit and all.  And my mother [Ruby Tom DeMeyers], she was having a fit, you know, (laughter), oh, no, no, no, no, you can't go that far away.  And my aunts, they came over, and "What would your father [Timothy Pugh] think?"  And oh, they went through the whole bit, you know.  But I did go.  And I remember my cousin, Opal, she got me all fixed up, you know, in her clothes.  I was skin and bones, little skinny, skinny girl, and she, she fixed me up in her clothes.  My coat was big, and everything, you know, to get me ready to go to Australia.  So I went, and I went by myself, and that was the first time I was ever on an airplane.  I went all the way over there by myself.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the troupe traveled together on the same plane.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You went by--.
Speaker 2: No, I went by myself.  They were there already.
Speaker 1: They were there already, oh.
Speaker 2: They were there already.  That was my first time--I mean I hadn't been very far at that time at all.  I don't know where else I had been.  And I don't--oh, New York.  I went to live--went to New York a lot growing up cause my aunt [Mamie DeMeyers] lived in New York, my mother's sister.  So we stayed there a lot, you know.  And my mother took us there a lot thinking she was getting away, out of the neighborhood in the summer and all of that.  But, and I stayed with her a lot in New York, which I loved.
Story_ID: 11254
Speaker 1: You were talking about your aunt [Mamie DeMeyers] in New York.  You spent a lot of time in New York, and you really forgot to tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Right, growing up.  My mother [Ruby Tom DeMeyers] used to, my father [Timothy Pugh] used to send us there, my mother and my sister and my niece.  I had a niece that was my--closer to my sister's age, but anyway, we were all a year and eight months apart, like that, something like that.  And we used to go to New York every summer, you know, just, and stay with her, like most of the summer.  Like a lot of kids went to the South, we'd go to New York.  So, and that was a lot of fun because my aunt, she was, she was a lot of fun.  You know, she was a real New Yorker.
Speaker 1: And she stayed right in the middle of Harlem.
Speaker 2: Harlem, a 125th street, a 125th and Fifth Avenue, you know, four, four dash six [4-6] West 125th Street.  I'll never forget that address cause it's all, I'll remember that address all of my life, you know.  And I moved her--she moved maybe ten years ago to the Bronx, and she passed though, but, you know, and I went to New York to move her, and she had all of this, so much history, you know, in her house.  I mean here are newspapers and, and articles she had saved since 1935, or magazine nineteen--the '20s [1920s] and all of that.  And I did save some of 'em, I did take some of 'em.  But she used to like to go out a lot.  So that gave us an opportunity to go out cause like I told you before, my mother was kind of quiet and a home person, so a homebody.  So she didn't go out that much.  And she used to let us wear lipstick, and--when we were kids, cause she never had any children.  So when we were nine, eight, nine and ten years old, you know, she would, she had all of her lipstick and all of her jewelry and everything around.  And she would let us, you know, put the lipstick on.  And my mother, when my mother would tell us to take the lipstick off, she would say, she would tell my mother, "oh, but sister, the children here wear lipstick."  But she didn't know the difference cause she never had any children.  So we would put on all of this lipstick, oh, our lips just red, red, red, red, and so my mother, she figured, well, okay, she's at her sister's house.  If her sister say, it's okay, she lives in New York.  It's okay.  And we put all of this lipstick on, I mean we were looking terrible, the three of us.  And we'd go in the street, and people were staring at us.  We'd go to play in Central Park.  They used to have some steps, and we'd like to run up, and we'd be running up with all this lipstick on, up and down the streets, and up and down the, the stairs.  And everybody would stare at us and we walked down the streets of New York, and everybody was looking at us because the kids didn't wear lipstick like that.  But my mother--you know, she didn't know the difference cause she didn't have any children.  And I, and I, I can relate to that now so good because that's the way children get me now sometimes.  You know, they come over to my house, and they say, oh, yeah, but we do.  My mother let me do this and my mother let me do that.  And I let 'em do it, and then, and when I talk to their parents, she, she--they know that they don't go out to dinner and eat dinner at 12:00 o'clock at night, you know, cause, you know, we want to go eat.  Take us out.  And I'll take 'em, you know, but I say, it's so late.  Uh-un, it's not that late, we go out late.  So I know, I know how my felt, you know, now.  But she was a dance, she was a dancer too.  I think she did, you know, she did probably a lot of different things, but she was a dancer, and I do have some pictures of her cause when I got to New--when I used to come to New York later and take classes at different places, she did know a lot of the dances, teachers, especially the African dance teacher, [Babatunde] Olatunji and, you know, cause--well, he did have a studio down the street from her.  But she did say that she had gone up for classes, and one time Olatunji came to her house, they came to meet me at the house, and he did know her.  So, you know, she probably did her little dancing.
Speaker 1: Did you see Olatunji perform when you were a little girl?
Speaker 2: No, this, I wasn't a little girl.  I was, at this time, I'm talking about I was a dancer, you know.  But, you know, we went, I used to take classes there at his studio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think he had that studio any more because I think it--later, he formed a, a band, and I think he just took his group on tour.  He had a company of dancers.  I don't know how that works so I shouldn't be saying--.
Speaker 1: Let's get back, we should probably go back to that because we probably need to talk about him, and I don't if--did you ever see [Kimate] Dinizulu perform?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, I've seen his company [Dinizulu Dance Company], many times.
Speaker 1: And there's  probably some others in New York.
Speaker 2: I've seen them at, a lot of Dance Africa in New York.  But Olatunji was the, I, I think was--I saw him a lot too, but I don't I ever saw--I saw him at Dance Africa, but I used to go to New York all the time, and they used to perform in Central Park and different neighborhoods--usually different neighborhood things.  I'd see them all the time.  And then I've seen Olatunjui here in Chicago a few times--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --over the years.

Speaker 1: You're on a plane on your way to Australia now, to join Larry Steele's Smart Affair, you know, over there.  So you're lonely on this plane, never been on a plane before, and those are the days when not too many young black girls ever got on a plane.  And you--.
Speaker 2: No, I'd been on a plane.
Speaker 1: Did you ever know anybody that'd ever been on a plane or?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't remember (laughter).
Speaker 1: Those were the days when flying was really--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right, it took us--it took a long time to get there.  I remember that.  Now, you can just jet over there.  But I don't remember--you remember I told you I was a very adventurous little girl, you know.  So it was, you know, I probably a little afraid, but I was okay.  I mean I, I was okay.  I just thought about trying to get over the fact that my mother [Ruby Tom DeMeyers] didn't want me to go, and I was going.  You know, so I was probably trying to get over that.  But I remember, you know, trying to figure, just trying to figure everything out, you know, listen, you know, so I'd know what to do.  I, you know, so I wouldn't miss any planes cause we had to change in, in Honolulu somewhere, and then we had to change in the Fiji Islands, and all of that was new to me cause I had never seen, you know, Fijian people and, you know, all that was just--I think we had some layovers, you know.  And all that was just different, you know, and then when we'd get to those places, it's hot.  And I had the big ole heavy winter coat, and, which my cousin Opal thought she was dressing me right.  So (chuckle) I had a big heavy coat.  And I just remember--I don't even remember who I talked to on the plane.  I just remember, you know, getting there.  And somebody had a sign up that said, when I got there, had a sign up that said, Celebrity Circuit, Ziegfeld Follies and Celebrity Circuit.  They had that sign up waving it, and I knew the, that that's what I was looking for.
Speaker 1: So you were going--this was Ziegfeld Follies?
Speaker 2: No, it was, like, you know, not the Ziegfeld Follies that we know, you know.  I think somehow they had combined something and still carried their name, but we mostly knew it as Celebrity Circuit.
Speaker 1: Okay, some it was some kind of--.
Speaker 2: And I think it was some, yeah, I can't remember who met me, but I want to think it was wardrobe mistress, but I'm seeing, but I don't think it was her.  I think it was somebody, some male that handled the road shows.  And, then they took me to the theater where they were working, and that was the biggest shock of my life, when I got to the theater and saw the dancers with the company with the, with the--not the, not the company, but the revue.  And, you know, we had been dancing around the neighborhood, dancing with Jimmy Payne and places around Chicago and the club dates and all, and when I got there, and I saw these girls with the long eyelashes and the lipstick and the make-up, I just stared at everybody because this is how I was imagining Katherine Dunham, you know, cause, you know, you see the--I'd seen the pictures, and they were all made up.  But I'm looking at, right at this, these girls with all this make-up on, and I mean it was just, it was--I stared the whole--and the first evening, I stared the whole evening.  I couldn't eat or anything.  I just couldn't imagine, you know, that I was looking at people that looked like that.  And everybody had on tons of make-up, and then I knew I was gonna make--I also had to put on that make-up, and I had never worn, really worn make up, I still don't.  But I never liked make up, don't like to wear it much.  But I got past it.  I soon met my buddy, I saw my buddies, and then the girls that was my age.  It was a couple of 'em that was like my age.  They had been traveling a long time, cause my girl--the girl, the one that I did know that I had met with Jimmy Payne, she--Betty, Betty (unclear), she's Betty Frazier now, she had--they had left, they had, they went, they had left school early, her and another girl that was there.  So they were my age.  So as soon as--I hooked up with them, and that's where I met Julian [Marvin] Swain, and so between Betty and Jackie [Greenwood] and Julian Swain, we got together, and that was it, you know.  I had my, my little group.  Everybody else was older though, you know, cause Pigmeat Markham was on that show and Maurice Rocco and Mabel Scott, I mean it was a big show.  And we had--.
Speaker 1: Who else?  Was that--?
Speaker 2: Hum?
Speaker 1: Who else and, you know, who else do you remember who was on the show?
Speaker 2: On the show?  Well, they were biggest, they were the stars, the star acts.  Maurice Rocco, Pigmeat Markham and Mabel Scott, they were the stars.
Speaker 1: Now, Mabel Scott, she played the piano, and--.
Speaker 2: She's, piano and sang.
Speaker 1: Pigmeat is famous for 'Here Comes the Judge.'
Speaker 2: She's what they called a boogie-woogie--oh, and Peter Ray, yeah.  Pigmeat with 'Here Come the Judge,' and Maurice Rocco, he was stand-up pianist.  Mabel Scott, they used to call her the elevator boogie girl, I remember that.  And Peter Ray was the one that danced with the chairs and the tables in his mouth and you know, head, and tap danced with all that stuff.  They were the stars, and then they had--it was a big, big show.  It was called the Harlem Blackbirds (chuckle).  But it was wasn't that original Harlem Blackbirds, but they said they got the name Harlem Blackbirds cause when all of them came in, in the country, there were so many of 'em, they just knew, the Harlem Blackbirds are back, and--cause it was Larry Steele Smart Affairs.  But so, that's how they stuck with the name Harlem Blackbirds, so they, I think they said that they just billed it like that.
Speaker 1: Cause people had already heard of the Harlem Blackbirds.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, right.  But, yeah, it was another singing group on there.  The, the guys that made that record, 'Watusi ', young boys.  They made the dance that they danced the Watusi.  Did you do the Watusi too?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Ooh, how could I forget that.  I'm just thinking about that, though, I don't know how I could I forget it.
Speaker 1: Not the Drifters or the Coasters or--.
Speaker 2: Un-un, un-um, dance, I don't know.  I can't remember.  I don't know how I forgot, but this is my first time thinking about it in a long time.
Speaker 1: Oh, I think I know who you're talking about, but I can't--.
Speaker 2: They were in that show, and, oh, the tap dancers, Leonard and Leonard, they were real good too, tap dance act.  But the best thing for me was meeting Julian and my buddy, Betty, and Betty Comeau (ph.) and Jackie Greenwood.  And Betty is still my, one of my best buddies today.  We still do the same things, you know, and get together with Julian like we used to do--cause we were all, we, we didn't know anybody other than the people on the show.  And we were there a year.  We were in Australia nine months and New Zealand two months, so, you know, eleven months all together.  So you had to kind of stick together, you know, and bond.  And--.
Speaker 1: Now, what were race relations like in Australia?
Speaker 2: Now, the only incident that I remember was a little girl, that--she used to stand outside of our window everyday, and I don't where she got it from.  She probably got it from her family.  I don't know, but I never bumped into anything, we never--I didn't, other than that.  And she would stand out our--outside of the hotel window and, I guess it was a rooming house, something like that, and say, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, you know, every day.  So that's all I remember, nigger, nigger, nigger all day, you know, so--.
Speaker 1: So there was no segregation in Australia.  Didn't seem like, to be a segregated place though?
Speaker 2: I don't re--I don't remember any of that.  I don't remember us talking about it.
Speaker 1: So you'd go pretty wherever you wanted--?
Speaker 2: I remember people there saying that they thought we had tails, and the, people came over in the army, and they said that the, the white boys in the army had told them that, not to, you know, that the black guys had tails.  And I remember that, you know, they, them saying that, you know.  And, but I don't remember anything myself.
Speaker 1: But in terms of accommodations--.
Speaker 2: Other than, with the Aborigines.  Now, the Aborigines claimed that there was a lot of prejudice against them there cause we had a couple of chances to sit with them and talk about us and them.  And, you know, they said that, you know, we talked about, you know, their country, you know, how it was taken and the position and the situation they were in.  But as, for us, I don't remember bumping into anything in the hotels.  I know what you mean in the hotels and things like that in Australia.  I--they mostly greeted us, and people wanted to be around us, you know, wanted to see what we were like, just like these girls used to come and tell us those tales, they were just hanging around just to be hanging around.  And they just wanted to see, you know, how you were because of the things that they had heard, the bad things they had heard and, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, did you have to learn the routines once you got over there?
Speaker 2: I did, yeah, I did.  And the thing about it was, I think I can learn anything, any routine now, and after that because when I got over there, I had no idea of what kind of dancing I had to do.  I'd never danced in heels.  I never had on a pair of stockings, dance stockings, the opera hose.  I, we danced in, in our bare feet with Jimmy Payne and with our friends, and maybe tap dances in tap shoes and socks.  I had no idea of what I had to do, and when I got there, they let me watch the show the first day, the first night.  And then I had to go into the rehearsals and doing something I had never done before, styles that I had never done before.  And it, and it was hard learning it because they expect you, as a professional dancer, to come in and learn the routines right away, go right into it.  But I had to learn the routine and the technique, the technique and the routines.  I didn't know those, you know.  But I guess by me having the tap and the, and the little ballet that I'd had, you know, I made it through.  I was okay after I finally got it.  You know, I learned the routines and learned the dance, the dances, and it was okay.  But it was, it was hard.  I didn't, I don't think I went in the show--into the show as fast as they thought I should have.
Story_ID: 11256
Speaker 1: Which did you like better, Australia or New Zealand?
Speaker 2: Oh, I liked 'em both (chuckle).  I liked them both.  I like everywhere anyway.  But it was, it was a lot of fun, riding bikes, and everybody rode bikes.  And you know where they had the Olympics on Bondi Beach, remember they did, yeah, we lived on Bondi Beach, right across the street from the beach, like it's, wasn't a good twenty-five feet, a little ole narrow, a little narrow street.  And we'd walk across the beach--to the beach, but we, when we go there, they did--the good thing about it was, they had dance, we had dance classes.  So that's how I was able to learn a lot of techniques cause every day we had, we had class, you know.  So, from, from Australians, their Australian dance teachers, so that was good.  And they taught the ballet, and they taught some of their technique, some of their styles of jazz.  And then they did choreography in their styles, to like update our show because it, our--if we were at theater, you might be there at that theater, you might be there six months, you know.  It, you know, they did--I remember, I think I remember being there, maybe in, in Australia about--in New Zealand, I mean in, in, Sydney, myself, cause they were there before me, remember.  I was there that long and about, maybe about five months.  Then we went to Brisbane and other Australian cities, Perth, like that, all--we traveled.  But we stayed in Sydney a long, long time, and then just traveled around to the other places before we went to New Zealand.  And I think in New Zealand, I don't remember--I don't really remember, but I think we just probably toured New Zealand, stayed at a theater two weeks at a time.  But if you're staying in one place five months or six months maybe in their case, they want to update and change the routines because people are seeing the show over and over again cause they want to, they just want to see you.  You know, they just want to see Americans, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm trying to think.  Now, what year was this when you were there?
Speaker 2: It was in the '50s, the late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Late '50s?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was--yeah, late '50s.
Story_ID: 11257
Speaker 1: Was it hard to adjust when you got back (chuckle), after staying in [Australia]--
Speaker 2: Well, when I got back, when I got back, I thought I was coming back to go, when I was coming--was supposed to come back and go to school, cause that was the thing, I'd be back for school.  You know, I, but when we got back, I think we got back in, like June and school was out, right.  So, then I'm, now, you know, they know me as a dancer, you know.  I've been, I've been to Australia, you know, people are different--everybody, all the dancers over the country, in the country, black dancers in the country know, knew who went to Australia.  We're gone a long time and pictures were sent back, and it was a lot of publicity, and, you know, dancers know dancers, and so, you know, they--this girl from Chicago was there.  Her name is so and so, like that, and from New Orleans, wherever they're from.  And, but so, when I got back, you know, people called for shows, you know, come and do a show.  People that you knew called, said, well, I got a gig such and such a place.  I told them about you, and you can go.  So then, I started traveling again, you know, here.  And then I didn't get back to school.  It was college this time, get back to school.  And I took, and, and that went on and on for years.  So.
Speaker 1: You were touring with different groups?
Speaker 2: Different, different, yeah, different revues and different people and, or just going to a town to work a show, you know, to join a show, just work a show.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't continue dancing with Larry Steele--?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, everybody came back, and they scattered and, you know, did different things, just went on, cause you had to make a living, you know.  So you just go on, you know.  I mean that's what it ended up being.  You know, I went from, you know, going to school to then ended up as, with dance as my profession.  So once you're in it, you know, you got to work.
Speaker 1: Okay, there was a big demand for dance in those days on stage, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, especially, at the time when I first came back.  And I slacked up after that to, at one point.  It was, you know, it was hard, but--for everybody, you know.  I remember.  I remember, well, I can't say that.  And it was always, I think if you didn't get a chance to go to Atlantic City in the summer or Idlewild in the summer, or Lake Tahoe, somewhere like that in the summer, then work was hard in the summer.  And I think that's what I remember the most.  The times that it was slow would be in the summer if you didn't go to one of the resorts.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you spent--what percentage of your time do you think that you spent on the road, you know, dancing in those days?
Speaker 2: When I was dancing, all the time.  I mean you're on the road more than you're at home.  I did, I mean that was something that I did.  That was my life, dancing, so that's what I did.  I mean, you know, it was--your family would love to see you when you come home, you know.  It's like, it wasn't like you're home all the time and just running and going somewhere for a day or two and coming back.  No, we were on the road, on the bus, city to city, town to town, you know, one show.  You leave that show, and you join another show that's doing the same thing.
Speaker 1: Now, is this the period of time that you were dance--cause we have pictures that we're gonna shoot towards the end of the interview of you with Duke Ellington and Count Basie and, and Dinah Washington and Pigmeat Markham, and all these different people.  Is this the period of time when you were doing the traveling?
Speaker 2: Well, it's all, it's, you know, it's--yeah, that's part, you know, it's just my whole career.  I toured, yeah, but I did tour with the Idlewild Revue and Dinah Washington and we, you know, they had a few places here.  See, we had the Regal here, you had--well, you--Regal Theater here.  You had the Tivoli Theater here.  We had the Club DeLisa, you--what's the other place?
Speaker 1: Rumboogie, right?  Was it Rumboogie?
Speaker 2: Rum, it was the Rumboogie.  I don't remember it.  That was a little bit before my time.  I remember Rumboogie, I remember it, but I didn't dance there.  You know, Roberts Show Lounge, so it was places here, you know, that we worked a lot, with a lot of the big acts cause Roberts Show Lounge, they bought in all the big acts.  You know, we worked with Dinah at Roberts Show Lounge, but they brought in Sammy Davis [Jr.] and they brought a lot of big acts and Brook Benton and, you know, just a lot of big acts at, at Roberts night clubs as well as at the Regal and Tivoli.  And the shows at DeLisa, we worked at DeLisa a lot.  A lot of the Chicago dancers, we could stay home and work at DeLisa because it was a permanent--it was just, if you worked there, you worked there.  It was a job.  You could be there, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten years.  And some girls did that.  I mean that was just their job.  They were, some girls were married and had families and all, and that's where they went every night to work and come home, you know.  And we liked to move, my buddies and I, we kind of liked to travel.
Story_ID: 11258
Speaker 1: You were talking before we, during the last break about New York and [Michael Babatunde] Olatunji and what is the first African dance you actually saw?  Can you remember who it was?
Speaker 2: I think, hum, I might have to say--oh, no--well, you know, they used to have the African ballet, the--from Guinea, Ballet Africain and the groups from Senegal, Senegal, that used to come through here.  And they used to do, when they'd come through for the show, we used to, they used to do classes.  And I, I think Ballet Africain was the first time I had a chance to, to really take some dance classes with some people directly from Africa.  And then after that, you know, Olatunji in New York, and a thousand and one other dance--African dance teachers in New York, you know.  But at that time, it was a lot of people here from Ghana, the Ghanaian dancers, and then you had the Nigerian dancers.  We did a lot of Ghanaian.  Then we did a lot of Nigerian.  I think more Ghanaian than any of it at that time, I think, and then later the Senegalese dance, Senegalese dance styles, and the Guinea dance styles.  But I think at that time, we were doing like the Nigerian and the, and Ghanaian.  That was just my first real exposure--oh, I forgot, Congolese.  I don't know, like I told you, I was a dancer, and I, and I went to New York a lot because my aunt [Mamie DeMeyers] lived there, and I used to go there to study.  I remember I'd get--I used to go there maybe like five, six times a year, you know.  I was there a lot.  And I studied all over the place, you know, with everybody.  And then like every country I, we--I ever went to, I studied dance.  I still do that now.  The first thing I do when I go to a country or to a place, you know, well, who's the dance teacher here?  Who's, where's the dance school?  Where's the, where should I got to, to, to see or talk or dance or whatever?  You know, it's just, I always did that.  And, you know, I, when, that, at, in New York, at the, you know, when I go to New York, I found out they--Olatunji was there, and it was another guy by the name of Fred.  He was African American though, but he had studied a lot of dancing from different places that he had been.  Oh, Asadata Dafora, I can't think, you know, it's, you know, I really, that's--.
Speaker 1: Now, how do you say--say that slower.
Speaker 2: Asadata.
Speaker 1: Asadata, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: A-S-A--.
Speaker 1: Is it D-A-T-A.
Speaker 2: D-A-T-A, I think, Dafora.
Speaker 1: How is Dafora--?
Speaker 2: D-A-F-O-R-A.
Speaker 1: D-A-F-O-R-A.
Speaker 2: Now, he--I had seen a lot of movies of his work in New York, and I met a guy there, a man there that used to dance with him.  I met a guy there that used to dance with him, and he was a, he was a writer, but used to dance with him.  So we did, we did a lot of, a lot of dancing.  I did a little dancing with him.  He had like a, well, it wasn't a studio, a dance studio, but it didn't--it was just a place where he used to write, but it was--he had wood floor and everything, you know, and he used, used to teach some of the dancing.  And then I forgot about Carmencita Romero.  She was here in Chicago, and she taught African dance.
Speaker 1: Is she Puerto Rican or?
Speaker 2: No, she was African American.  She changed, changed her name Carmencita for stage purposes.
Story_ID: 11259
Speaker 1: Give me your impression of when African dance started to become popular in--and you were talking about classes in New York, and some of the teachers there in New York, and--?
Speaker 2: But here in Chicago, I think in the--we, like I said, we took classes in New York, from, you know, all the time.  I mean when I'd go to New York, I'd take any kind of classes.  It didn't matter what.  I took all kind.  I took the Spanish dance classes, I took, you know, Egyptian dance.  I took Indian dance, everything.  You just take classes, but I like, we'd always like to take the African dance classes to, but I had--and we did.  Whenever I'd go, whenever I did shows, it was never African dance.  It was always jazz, Afro-Cuban, calypso, Caribbean, tap, just some other styles cause I came out of the chorus line.  And in the chorus line, you did everything, every style of dancing.  So, but what I really remembered for me, African dance and me really thinking, um, yeah, this is good to do, you know, other than what you did as a kid, dancing around.  I think, to me, in Chicago, for me in the '60s [1960s], I think Darlene Blackburn made African dance popular, I mean made it something that everybody said, oh, wait, we want to do, we could do, we want to do this.  Or let's do that.  Why can't we do or why can't--better still, it was why can't we do that kind of dancing on the stage?  Or why can't we do this kind of dancing?  Why can't we teach it, you know, teach this kind of dancing?  And why can't we make people want to learn it?  The kids learn it, they'll, you know, like it.  And she was working with Phil Cohran a lot, you know, and she had studied in Ghana, I think Nigeria.  Anyway, I think, for me, I think that she's the one that for me in Chicago, and I think for us in Chicago, I really think so, that made people think about why can't we do this kind of dancing also.  We like it, you know, you know, we feel good doing it.  Why can't we put this on stage, you know.  So I think, you know, that's, that's kind of what happened because then people, you know, I remember in the '60s [1960s] people all over started doing African dance routines.  And we went from the Caribbean, the calypso to Afro-Cuban, you know.  I, I or, some ideas of what you think African dance is, into learning some authentic African dance, you know, people coming into the country from different countries.  And like I said, a lot of, at first a lot of, I think, the Ghanaians, Nigerians came in, and you learned some Nigerian dance.  And maybe a lot of Ghanaians or vice versa, and we learned a lot of Ghanaian dances, oh, just tons of it.  Then we throw--the problem with it is, you, as soon as somebody else comes, the more people come from different countries, you know, African countries, you want to learn it all cause you don't know what your country is or what you need to be learning, you know, so you got to learn it all because if you skip one, you might be--and you had an opportunity to learn it, that might be the place you're from.  So I know a lot of dancers that do dance, African dance.  We always think about what, what's our dance?  You hear some, some people, they'll say, you know, Samba is my dance, you know, or Lamban, is my dance.  And that says, I'm from these people.  And I must--they must be my people.  You know, I feel this.  And some girls, some dancers like Ghanaian dance cause they feel it, you know.  And so they'll think about it like that too.  But we learned it all, you know, a lot of different dance, African dance styles, a lot of different African dance techniques, not just styles from, like not thinking that, you know, Ghanaian dance is--okay, you learn the Ghanaian dance, and that Ghanaian dance.  Well, they got a lot of styles and techniques and tribes and groups and, you know, that you, that's, that's got different ways of doing some dance, and so, it's, it's  a lot to study.  But you need to--you know, you got the Asante people, you got, you know, all kind, in Ghana, I'm saying, a lot of different groups in Ghana, a lot of different groups in Senegal, you know.  So you got a lot a dance. Today, people are doing a lot of Senegalese dancing and a lot of Guinea dance.
Speaker 1: The Guinea coast is--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, but I like knowing a lot of all, all of it because we always have to use it, you know.  Right now, I never thought I--you know, I wasn't thinking that come Kwanzaa and Malcolm X College on the twenty-sixth, the president is being installed and they're using, and they're doing the Asante ritual for it.  And we have to, and I'm able to pull, go back and get that dancing that goes with that ritual, you know.  So it gave us a lot, you know, to pull from.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then another thing about the African dance is, and we're so happy about, is that we learned to learn, to learn about the culture that the dance came from too.
Story_ID: 11260
Speaker 1: I want to go back to when you first started doing West Indian dance, and I know at one time you, I--there's a photo of you that, and it was always used at one time.  It shows you really, you have fire.  You got a, you're actually dancing with fire, and I think at one time you--how did you learn those techniques and how did you--and when you first start doing that?
Speaker 2: Okay, I learned how to do, I learned fire dance in the Bahamas.  I, I lived there four years, a long time.  But the way I got there is, again, there was an impresario.  His name was Freddie Munnings, and he used to bring dancers, black dancers from all over the world to dance at the Cat and Fiddle Club in the Bahamas.  So when I went there, when you go there, they had told me that his idea of doing, for doing this was that whenever we got together, when all of these people got together from whatever--the diaspora or wherever they came from, he was gonna get the same thing in their dancing.  And so they would bring you in--they brought us all in, and they put us all together, and give you a format for a show.  And that was it.  You didn't get, he didn't say come in like I did in Australia, come in, and you got rehearsal every day, eight, nine, ten hours a day, trying to learn the routine.  They put everybody together and said, we're doing fire dance, we're limbo, we're doing bottle dance, we're doing, whatever, was out of their culture in the Bahamas.  That's it.  Here's your costume.  Now, granted they had a fire dancer.  They had a, the limbo dancer.  That meant when you say you got a fire dancer, he's the main fire person.  That means that he's coming on the end, and doing the biggest tricks.  They got a limbo dancer, they come in and go the lowest.  And by, you know, on down the line.  They had nail dancers, where they'd, the people dance on the nails and all that.  But where you fit in is, when they bring you the fire sticks, you got to do something with it.  When he come and stand in front of you, when the girl, whoever is in, you know, is directing this, come and stand in front of you with the sticks, they're coming for you to take the sticks and to go out there in front of four, five hundred people and do something with them.  That's how I had to learn fire dance.  So, and it was very hard because, you know, you got people that's been there all the time, you know, people, you know, people that live that, people that's been there all the time.  They had everything taken.  Somebody was doing their arms already.  So you couldn't go out there and do your arms.  You'd go out there and do your arms and come backstage, and they'd want to know why'd you do the arms, cause I do that, you know.  You couldn't do the legs, naturally, somebody was doing their legs.  And naturally, somebody was doing their whatever.  So you had to be real creative.  So you had to thing about, when he bring me these sticks, what am I going to do with these sticks?  And the first time I got the sticks, (chuckle) I didn't know what to do with the sticks.  And I was scared to use, use them because I knew what had did in front--I couldn't do the same thing somebody else did.  And so the first thing I did was I put my foot in the--no, I put my toe, my toes in the fire.  And I had to do them in a certain way that it would catch, and I could open my toes, and then they all would light, you know.  That was the first thing I did, and I don't remember what my other trick was, but I got away with one or two tricks like that.  But then you have to do it every night, you know, almost every night, and so you get to be creative with it.  So that's how I learned it, but you can't, you can't--certain things you can't do, you couldn't do because you had to save that for the main fire dancer.  So, you know, you never learned to eat the fire because he, that's what he does.  You can't do that, you know.  So, you know, on the side we learned it.  And then on the side, well, for me, how I learned it, it was a girl from Haiti there working with us.  And whenever the main fire dancer couldn't, had off, his night off, she would do fire.  And so I used to say, oh, Jackie, you got to teach me how to do, you got to teach me how to eat fire.  You got to teach me--give me some things to do.  And so she taught me how to do it, but nobody can teach you.  I mean, you don't teach nobody how to put fire in their mouth.  It's just something you have to do, you know.  So the only thing they can do is show you how to prepare for it, you know, and then anything else you do, you got to do it.  I mean how do you teach somebody to put fire in their mouth.  You put it in there.  So then, that's how I learned it.  And then whenever you got an opportunity, somebody was missing, and you had a opportunity to do something, something that they did, and that's what happened.  So that's how we got--I got skilled with it, you know.  And then when I came back home, I would, I would do it as a solo act.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so we're talking about, I guess the, when you were doing the fire, that was--is that in the '60s [1960s] now, we talking about?
Speaker 2: Let's see, the last--no, I--no, cause, well, maybe '60s, '70s [1970s], '80s [1980s], '90s [1990s], I mean I never--.
Speaker 1: And you did it all the way through that--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I never stopped doing it.  It was something--.
Speaker 1: But you started in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: --when, when I wasn't with the show, I, my gig was fire, you know.  I could dance with fire, so that's how I made my extra, my money.  You know, when I came home, I called, you call somewhere, you know, can you use a fire act?  And I'd go work in places.  I worked over on, say, Rush Street for years and years, you know, doing fire.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So when you do a show like that, you said, and they just put like, they don't really have a routine.  They have the main performers, but then everybody else just kind of just fits into the--.
Speaker 2: They have a format.  They come, when they tell you the format.  You, you go, some people are going here, usually, so and so going there and so and so is going there.  So and so is bringing out the fire tray, you know.  So and so is gonna bring you the sticks, you know, like that.  They have a format, you know, and people do it.  And then the main fire dancer is up in the tree, and he's gonna jump out when it's time and come and, you know, go up on stage and do what he have to do.  You know, so that's your format.  So what you do, what you--the steps that you do, the reason that he said everybody is gonna do the same thing, you come with your steps.  Now, what everybody is looking for is who's bringing these new steps in because they're all on the order of Afro-Cuban, African are just from our African heritage, that's all.  So that's why he know it's gonna all be alike.  He knew it was, everybody was gonna do the same thing because--and we did.  You know, everything was more or less the same.  And then when people steal steps and all that, it just get all mixed up in the culture or whatever, and, but it's more or less the same thing.  And you never have problems--we didn't have problems learning the steps because like I said, I just, it was just stuff that's in our African American heritage, in Trinidad they got it, in Haiti, they had it, in the Bahamas, and Africa.  So when he got everybody together, you got more or less the same thing.  We could stand there and do a fire dance, and you knew that you was looking at the same kind of dancing.

Speaker 1: You said here in Chicago, Darlene Blackburn was really the pioneer--.
Speaker 2: I think so, yes.
Speaker 1: --to get people started in African dance.
Speaker 2: Right, that made it popular.  I mean till recent years, I mean now it's real popular, but I--that was the start.  I mean people was just persistent with it.  I mean Muntu [Dance Theater of Chicago], all of us, we kept on doing it.  Everybody kept on doing it.  We didn't stop.  We kept on pushing, kept on pushing, kept on pushing until everybody saw that it was good and valuable, you know, and artistic, and they wanted to see it.  They wanted, you know, to hire you.  They wanted you, you know, wanted us to, you know, perform it all the time.  And now, you know, that's what we get most of our calls for, is, you know, they want African, people want African.  They like it, they like the drums.
Story_ID: 11262
Speaker 1: Tell me about the beginnings of Najwa Dance Corps.  I mean how did that start?
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, again, like I said, I was--at that time, I was more or less doing my same act.  This was in the '70s [1970s], in the late '70s, I was more or less doing my same act, the fire dance, my fire act, and, you know, I was working, I think, over on Rush Street.  You know, I was working six nights a week.  And, you know, so I was making a good living and all of that, you know, and so I was just staying here because I could work, you know.  And then, at the same time, though, I was teaching, I was teaching at the Better Boys Foundation over on the West Side.  And I was working with Julian Swain Inner City Dance Theater, and I was working also on the West Side of Chicago.  So the students used to come to classes, and you know how you have your dances.  We were all young so we, you know, they want to hang out with me.  And I was a little older than them, but they'd want to hang out and they used to want to hear about the different stories cause they heard I had been to a lot of places.  And we used to sit around and talk, and I used to tell 'em about the different shows and the different dance styles that we used to do.  And the dancers said that they would really love to learn how to do swing and swing and tap and, and traditional jazz and modern jazz.  They just really like, learned it.  They were fascinating that I knew a lot of different dance styles, you know.  So I said, oh, okay.  So I started teaching it over at Better Boys Foundation, and they gave me the freedom to, you know, to, to, to teach classes, you know, kind of the styles I wanted to teach.  And everybody was enjoying it, and then they'd go home and tell their parents about what they had learned.  And then their parents said, oh, I know about this, and I know about that.  I know about this kind of dancing.  And I know about the shim-sham, and I know about the ball and jack and all of that.  So then they told me, they said, well, why don't we get a dance company--they asked me, why don't we get a--can we get a dance company?  Can we have a company where we could do all of these different styles?  And I told them when, I didn't have time because I had my own career, you know.  I was moving around, I was moving fast running.  I still liked to travel.  And I told them I really didn't have time.  And I said, I don't know, you know, if we could do.  And I'm working with Julian Swain Inner City Dance Theater, got a company.  I don't know if I got time for all of this.  And so they were serious about it.  They said, well, we'll do this, and I'll do this and I'll do that.  And I said, well, okay.  Okay, I'll tell you want we do.  We're gonna workshop--if we stay together, let's do a workshop for a year.  And if we're still together, and you all still want to do it, then we'll see about getting a company together.  And that's what we did.  And they stayed, they hung in there, and they told me, they promised me at that time--this is how we got it going, they promised me at that time, after that year, they said--well, when that, around the same time that year was up, Count Basie was here, coming in town.  And he wanted a chorus line, and we were the only ones--he wanted a, like a black chorus line.  And we were the only ones that knew chorus material, my, the dancers.
Speaker 1: And by that time, all the clubs that used choruses had kind of declined, I guess?
Speaker 2: More or less.
Speaker 1: The Regal was closed.
Speaker 2: More or less, yeah, it was, yeah, you're right.  I would say, we always say that we were the last of the chorus girls, the girls my, my, my age and all.  We were the last.  We say we're the last of the real chorus girls.
Speaker 1: Did it was kind of, did it sort of like fade with the decline of big band type of music and sort of thing, when that kind of--when the venues for that kind of dried up?
Speaker 2: Probably, yeah, when, yeah, and night clubs went into--.
Speaker 1: When rock and roll started, cause they were playing (simultaneously)--.
Speaker 2: --something.  They went into the disco, and they went into disco, and then they hired the go-go girls, you know, that kind of thing.  But chorus lines cost a lot of money, you know.  They started, you could, all you hear about was, he said, he say he can't afford a chorus line.  They can't afford the chorus line because you had to costume all of these dancers.  First of all they had the big--you know, and I remember the big chorus lines, and then some places would cut them down to where you'd have, you'd have six girls and four show girls.  Then you'd have six chorus girls and no show girls.  And then you'd have four chorus girls and, you know, maybe chorus boy here and here.  It started dwindling down like that.  That's what I kind of noticed, you know.  And then, cause they didn't want to costume.  If you worked in a--like when they were at Club DeLisa, and they changed the shows every, every month, there was new costumes every month and new shoes, new stockings, everything, you know.  So it was expensive, a chorus line was real expensive.  So I think they just probably find a way--I think they probably found a way to do things, some things a little cheaper.  But the go-go girls, you'd come with your own costume.  You know, they had that going.  You would come with your own costume and your boots, you know.  And the go-go period was good too because you could work, you know.  So at that time, we were going between finding a, a chorus line and finding a go-go gig, you know.  So I remember I almost went--I didn't do it, I almost went on the road with James Brown cause they was looking for go-go girls.  And I went to see a show that--he invited, they called me up and asked me, well, would I please come down to the Regal, you know, and just look at the show, you know, cause I said, I didn't know.  I wasn't sure.  I was in between other shows.  And I went to the Regal, and I saw these girls up in the cage.  They danced so hard.  Now, we danced hard in the chorus, but oh, my goodness.  They were on the stage the whole time he was on the stage, and they danced so hard, I said, no, no, no.  They said, you're not gonna go with us.  They said, we really need you.  I said, no, I can't, I can't.  I can't go.  I couldn't see myself working that hard like that (chuckle).  So, but as far as like a go-go gig, you go to a place and you, and you do, you know, your show, you know, work a few hours, do your show, and you got--you know, you had money.  So that's what, that's, that's what I did.  But, and that's, and at that, like I said, we're saying at that time, I, I mean that's how I saw it dwindling down to other things.  And then pretty soon the clubs were gone, the big shows were gone, the big revues was going off the road.  They were gone off the road everywhere, you know.  So, but anyway, by that time, you know, I was teaching and doing my solo act anyway, you know.  So I guess maybe I--it could be that I don't even know what happened to it because I had an act by that time, you know, my fire act, you know, at that time.  And then, like I said, I was teaching.  So anyway with these dance--with the, with my dance, the dancers, when Red Saunders had his fifty-year anniversary, and he was bringing in Count Basie and Billy Eckstein, they asked, they said, they want a chorus line.  And it was no chorus lines to get (chuckle).  And somebody told me, yeah, I know some, I know some dancers that got chorus material.  And I, I knew Red cause I worked with him at the Club DeLisa and I worked with him at the Regal, and he called me up and asked me did I--could I get him a chorus line together or did I have a chorus line.  And I told him what I had, and we auditioned for him, and he saw it.  He said, okay, and he wrote--he said, okay, we'll write some music, and, you know, that's what we did.  So when we did that show at the Regal Theater, that was in April of '78 [1978].  After that year of workshop, I told the dancers, and the dancers were all up about it, that we could go ahead and, you know, declare ourselves as having a company.  So that's what we did, and we started Najwa Dance Corps and started working real serious.  I told them if they really wanted to work real hard at it, we could do it.  And then they told me--I said, but I just still have to dance for a living, that this is my work.  Najwa Dance Corps right now wouldn't have any money, you know.  And they said, well, that's okay, I'll do this; we'll do that, and we had dancers in law school and just finishing law school.  And we had some that was business majors and, you know, all of that.  So they said that they would take over all of that, and so we could get started.  And you know that lasted maybe a year or two for everybody.  I never thought about it.  Then this one was getting married or that one was going to medical school, and this one had to go a law practice, and, you know.  So here I am with all the work, but, you know, twenty--it's twenty-six years later.  So we're still functioning, and some of the same, same people are in the administration with us.  Sheila Wilkins, she, you know, she's our executive director.  She started off in the group.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's some other--.
Speaker 2: She went to school and she, you know, she got her Master's in accounting cause she started out first handling our books.  So we said, you, you know, you got to prepare yourself if you're gonna do this.  And that's what happened.  We're still functioning.
Speaker 1: And they also, you know, most of the--I know the dancers, I know that are with Najwa are like real--they have their own business.  They have something going, I mean a lot of them a lot of, you know--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, they're enterprising young ladies.
Speaker 1: Yeah, an enterprising group, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, still are.  New ones come in.  They look around and say, oh, I could be doing this, or I could be doing that too.  But you have--they have to, you know, because, you know, it's money.  It's making a living, you know, and Najwa, right at this point is, you know, just a portion of their income, you know, not, you know, everybody is busy, you know, making dance work for themselves.
Speaker 1: And Najwa seems unique in the sense that the members of the company can, can go into the show stuff, you know, as well as the African dance.  They do, they do both.  They can do both.
Speaker 2: Right, that's the way they're trained.  That's the way we train--they train.
Speaker 1: And when Okoro Harold Johnson put on the play at the Regal Theater and ETA [Creative Arts Foundation], I remember all the Najwa dancers were the chorus line, you know, for the show.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the fortunate thing.  And then, and the dancers do appreciate having, you know, that they had an opportunity to learn all those fields because a lot of them come back and say, oh, we're so thankful that we came--went through Najwa Dance Corps and we had a chance to learn all these different styles and techniques because I can go, I can go anywhere and teach, you know, and if people want choreography, I can do it.  I know the styles, you know, and my dancers now they, you know, we're getting back, we're even going back and pulling some of our, our old material up and teaching it to the young people now, again, you know.  And, and they still like it the very same way that my other dancers liked it, twenty-six, twenty-six years ago.  We just had our twenty-six year anniversary, and we did a lot of our old material.  And the audience still liked it.
Story_ID: 11263
Speaker 1: One African dance that you all do, I think better than anybody in the city, I mean it's just my opinion.  But I think, but it's Lamban.  Can you tell us about that dance, and it tells a story I think, and--?
Speaker 2: Well, we do it, we do Lamban, a Jalidon, all of it is Lamban, but it's Jalidon.  It's like, done three diff--three or four different ways.  So I don't which particular one you like and all, but it's--the Jalidon we do, which we do most of, and probably what you're talking about is, you know, from the Mandingo people.  And the Griot, it's the dance of the griots, the historians.  And well, "Jali," itself, is "Griot" and the dance is, "don" is dance.  So it is a very, very, very graceful dance, you know, and you see it all the time in Gambia, in Senegal and Gambia, very popular around the Senegambia region of West Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it kind of goes (simultaneously)--.
Speaker 2: It's one of our favorites.
Speaker 1: It's not just one specific country, but, or it's a Mandingo, a Mandingo dance--?
Speaker 2: Well, I know it, I know what-- I know it from--we know if from the Senegambia region and just recent--well, in the last couple of years, we've been studying the Guinea Lamban, and that's real nice too.  It's hard, but it's very nice.
Speaker 1: So there're different versions of the same thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum, different styles.  And that's what, you know, people need to know, you know, about all the different dance styles, all the different techniques in the African dance, just, you know, like it is in any dance.
Speaker 1: Okay, so let me get this straight.  Now, this is a dance that's not just from a specific or not just done by one specific people, but it's all up and down the Guinea coast you say, I mean a lot of different groups do it.
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't saying that.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm trying to get it straight.
Speaker 2: I was just saying it's different, different lumba's, this--different styles, and I was saying we're learning the Guinea style.  We, we, we know, we learned, we, you know, we started learning that a couple of years ago.  And, and we're still learning it, I mean, you know, but I--that's all I was saying is that, you know, they have, they do--in, in Senegal and Gambia, around the Senegambia region, you know, we do the Lamban, but it's kind of a different style.  We do the Jalidon, different styles, and that's what we know, we know the Senegambia versions, region--that, the dance around that region, the Lamban.  And we know the Guinea too, but, you know, we haven't studied it as long.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, but it's real nice, fast.
Speaker 1: Are there all Mandingos doing it?  Is that what it is?  No, different--only Mandingo people doing it.
Speaker 2: No, I'm saying it's their dance, but people do it, other people do it.  We're not Mandingo, and we do it--.
Speaker 1: No, I know, but in African.
Speaker 2: --people in Africa do it, yeah.  But, well, our people know, Jalidon, yeah.  And, you know, the, the Jali people, you know, they're all there together.  So they all know each other's dances actually, cause when people come here, they might teach, say for instance, you might have a class, and you vit--invite an instructor, and he's Wolof, but he'd teach the Mandingo dances.  He'd teach the Jali, you know, and vice versa.

Speaker 1: What is the philosophy of the Najwa Dance Corps in terms of the kind of dance you teach and so forth?
Speaker 2: Okay, Najwa, Najwa Dance Corps, we're a group of dancers, that's dedicated to preserving dance styles and techniques of different eras, as it relates to the African American dance experience.  We aim to educate while we're ent--while entertaining.  We like, we come from a historical perspective at times, and then we just dance for the enjoyment, for fun, for everybody also.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what are the--well, what techniques do you teach at Najwa?
Speaker 2: At Najwa Dance Corps, well, for the, in our company, we do African dance.  We do Caribbean dance styles.  We do traditional jazz, swing, which is swing dancing, traditional jazz and modern jazz.  And we do tap.  That's the company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had a studio where we teach different dance styles, different--and we have different classes for the community, for children on up--four years old up to adulthood.  And we teach the same thing, tap, jazz, African Caribbean, swing, you know, modern jazz, and, and traditional jazz.
Story_ID: 11265
Speaker 1: I know you have a season of things you probably do on a regular basis, but what are the highlights of your year?
Speaker 2: Okay, every year in November we do our annual student concert.  And around that concert we do a dance conference, where--a dance conference, dance, a conference on African dance and drums, which means that we have--we teach dance styles, African dance styles with, from different countries, with instructors from different countries.  We teach Caribbean dance, probably, you could say dances, dance styles that reflect the diaspora, but it's mostly African dance, from Senegal, Guinea, Gambia, Ghana, and that's every year around November, you know, right before Thanksgiving.  You know, that's a very, very big event.  So, anyone can just, you know, look forward to that.  It's coming every year, you know.  And we also have drum classes.  We have master drummers to come in to teach the dance classes as well as the master teachers.  It's not taught by--it's usually--it's not taught by the company--well, we have one or two classes that are taught by the company cause people that's coming from out of town want to take classes from your company.  But the people, you know, the dancers in the city usually like to get people that they can't get all year around.  So we have these dancers that's coming from different places, you know, to, to take the workshop in different places to teach.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--.
Speaker 2: And we also do one other thing.  We also have our poetry festival, our dance and poetry festival every year in April.  It's--we switch our dates a lot in April because it's poetry month, and it's a lot going on in poetry and we try not to conflict, you know, with everybody.  But we usually try to head for toward the end of April, and it's African dance--I mean I'm sorry.  It's dance and poetry, and we mix the dance and the poetry together.  We have a lot of poets that dance.  We have dancers that are poets, and we do a lot of choreography, you know, for that special event.  And it's, you know, it's, it's real enjoyable.  We also have some, sometimes some teenaged poets.  You know, we give everybody an opportunity, you know.  And we also sometimes bring poets from out of the city, like poet--like some, maybe who won the poetry slam or something like that, that year.  We might want to bring them in.  So that's good, and then we have our student concert in June every year.  That's also near the end of June, and that's a big event, real festive.  But it's young people that take our classes and young people that are, are taught by our company members all over the city.  So it's very big also.

Speaker 1: Najwa Dance Corps is located at Malcolm X College, one of the City Colleges of Chicago.  When did that relationship start and--?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we've been at Malcolm X now, going on fifteen years.  May will be fifteen years.  We were invited to Malcolm X, I think they got the word, Malcolm--they got the word that we were looking for a home, and had someone to get in touch with us to offer us a home.  And we've been there fifteen years, and we're very happy there, and we believe--think they're happy with us there.  And we're able to add to the cultural environment, the cultural and educational environment at the school.  And the president, Zerrie Campbell, has been very supportive.  The administrative staff at Malcolm X has been very supportive.  And right now, we are getting ready for, as I said earlier, getting ready for our Kwanzaa, the big Kwanzaa.  Malcolm X has the largest Kwanzaa in, in, probably in the country every year, you know, December 26 through January 1.  So we're getting ready for that because it's gonna be a very big event.  This year is, tenth annual event.  And Najwa Dance Corps is on the committee in Malcolm X College for the Kwanzaa.  So, you know, we look forward to that every year.

Speaker 1: What are the future plans of Najwa Dance Corps?
Speaker 2: Well, we would like to do more traveling, more touring, you know, nationally and internationally, and that's what we're working toward, you know; really building our company into a touring company.  We'd like it, you know, to be known as an international dance company.
Speaker 1: And how--.
Speaker 2: That's our goal.
Speaker 1: Your dancers have been on trips to--I know they've been to Africa before--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they travel--we travel.  But, you know, they travel, they're encouraged to travel on their own to go study, you know, because that's what I always did.  You know, when I was traveling everywhere I went I always studied.  I always took classes.  I didn't care what country I was in, what city, I was looking for dance classes.  So that kind of passed on to them, you know, that urge to travel.  So a lot of dancers go to Africa, once a year, some a couple times because a lot of them do merchandizing too, selling also.  So they go there, and they go there, and they study, take classes.  They go and, and bring costumes back, you know, cause sometimes we need costuming, costuming or props, and props, and I can depend on them to do that.  I go to Africa a lot, you know.  So we travel.  They go to the Caribbean a lot.  They go across the country a lot to go to different workshops, dance conferences.  There are a lot of dance conferences in the country.  I mean you could go to one almost every other month, but there're a lot of 'em, and they're mostly around holidays, you know, because people can travel better around--get away from their obligations better around the Easter, we go--Easter, we go to New York for the dance conference up there.  And in September we go to KanKouran [West African] Dance Conference in Washington, D.C., and, you know, we got to Cincinnati, we go to Cleveland and Cincinnati, and Milwaukee.  You know, different places, Detroit, the conference there.  They come here to Chicago in November.  So it's like that.  We're always traveling.

Speaker 1: You started dancing in the '50s [1950s], but the, my impression is that--I mean the black arts movement where we really started like focusing on African dance and African art and seemed to start in the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s].  What role would you assign African dance in this, in that movement in the black arts movement, cultural arts movement?
Speaker 2: What part do you think, the dance played?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what do you think it, what part it played, yeah?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it, well, it's actually giving us a part of our history, a part of our culture, giving us a part of culture back, a part of our history back.  You know, it makes us know about ourselves.  You can learn about yourself with African dance because like I said, most people that do African dance or study African dance or even like African dance are looking into the culture and where these dances came from.  I mean you almost can't get up on the stage and just dance.  You all have to, you almost have to--you have to explain it, you know, because they want it.  People are hungry for it, for learning about their heritage through dance.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess it's like it's always been.  We're not there.  You know, we're still struggling.  I want to see our children step out in this life doing whatever they think they might want to do.  I hope we can give them guidance to lead them through that, but I--they, I, I don't want my grandchildren, and I don't want the children that I know to be worried about they won't be able to do this, and they won't be able to do this--do that because they don't have the money or they don't have the opportunities to get the education, you know, to do the things that they want to do.  I need--think we need, you know, to be able to afford our children the proper edu-education so they can do whatever it is they want to do.  I mean anything you do, you need to be educated in it, anything, I mean I, you know, whatever, you need, and you need that opportunity.  You can't go to school because you don't have money.  You can't travel, you can't research, if you don't have money, you know.  I'd just like something to happen where they have the opportunity to do those things, and we could support them in that.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything that you've done so far, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Well, I--probably many things, probably many things, you know.  I mean I don't think I'd want--I would, I enjoy, I enjoy my life as a, a dancer and artistic director, as an artist.  I make--I enjoy that, you know, and my friends, a lot of my friends that danced with me, came through with me, they look at me, and they say, you know, I envy you.  I say, envy me?  How you envy me?  You got all the castles over there and all the big, and the Mercedes and all of that over, what do you mean envy me?  How can you--you don't envy me.  They said, yeah, because you're doing what you want to do.  You're doing what all of us wanted to do.  I said, well, that's what, when you stick to something, you know, I mean you can reap the benefits.  And actually, you know, like I enjoy the position, you know, I mean as an artistic director, as a dancer, a dancer and artistic director.  So, and I'm, you know, relatively happy, you know, I'm happy, you know, as much as we're happy.  You know, I'm at peace with it.  I'm not thinking about what else I should have been, could have been, wanted--you know.  But I mean it's lots of things that I probably could have, would have done different in getting to where I've gotten to or, you know, I probably would have done a lot, you know, different if I had known to do it different or had the opportunity to do it different, cause we struggled.  I mean we didn't have the opp--we didn't just step out and say I'm gonna be a dancer.  We had to find money for dance classes, I mean beg for money for dance classes.  And at the time I danced, you know, you don't, your, you know, your parents and all, they don't see that as important at all.  Well, mine I couldn't go to--I would, you know, but they don't see it as important at all.  And my mother [Ruby Tom DeMeyers] didn't think, you know, that was important.  She couldn't see supporting that.  She wanted a school teacher.  I did end up doing that for her, I guess.  I did end up getting a degree in education, you know, and, and I still teach, but it's dance, it's just dance.  It's not in the classroom.  She never understood that because she, her idea of teaching was in the classroom.  And she didn't, couldn't understand, as much I guess as she wanted to be a teacher, she could never understand why I had a degree in education and could go in the classroom and teach, and wouldn't.

Speaker 1: When you look back, likewise, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what would you consider now to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I hope it's passing on the culture.  I, I think, when I talk to people that's around me, I think they think of me as a, as--look at me as a person that has helped to hold on to the culture in some kind of way.  And that's what, you know, I see.  I think that's my job.  I think that's what I'm supposed to be doing, is teaching what I know in the area that I know.  And that's dance.  So I would like--I'm, I'm passing on the culture through dance, through--passing on the culture through dance and teaching dance styles and techniques that may have been forgotten, could be forgotten and all, to people that could possibly hold--to make them like it enough to hold onto to it to pass it on to another generation and to keep it going.  So, that's what I, you know, I'd like for my legacy to be, that I have, you know, held on to the dance styles and techniques of difference cultures--I mean different eras as it relates to the African American culture.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question is similar to that, but it's a little different, ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Chuckle) How would I like to be remembered?  I don't care.  I don't know what to say, you know.  How would I like to be remembered, you know, as a, as a, a friend to people, a honest person, a kind person, helped others.  I mean I don't know, you know.  I'm just, I'm going about life, you know, the way I know, you know.  I, I believe I'm a spiritual person and going about it the way I know, and whatever you could think about me in the end will be great, you know, just you.  I mean, I don't, I don't know what to say, what I want people to really think about me, you know.  But I hope I helped some people, you know.  I worked--I hope I pulled some people through, you know.  I hope I taught, you know, people what I know to survive, you know, on the survival end, you know.  I don't know, you know, what to say, you know, about what I want them to think of me.  I just never even thought about that.  I just do my thing, you know, and try and to be as righteous in that as possible.
