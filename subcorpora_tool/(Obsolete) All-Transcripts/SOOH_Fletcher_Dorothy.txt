 Wilson  Fletcher  Today is July 16, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. I   m at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art today and  joining me is Dorothy Fletcher who I will be talking with about her  memories of the 1930s.  Also joining us is her daughter, Marlena Cook.   Thank you for joining me today. Would you mind telling me when and  where you were born to start out with?  I was born in Oklahoma City, not too far from here in 1921. March  1921.  Were you born in a hospital?  No, that wasn   t heard of in those days. No, I was born on the farm. No, it  wasn   t a farm, we moved to the farm when I was about a year old, but  it   s out close to the Capitol building is where my folks lived then.  So you were born at home?  At home. My mother had seven children, they were all born at home.  Where did you fall in that line?  I was sixth. I had a younger sister.  So you had a lot of older brothers and sisters helping take care of you?  I had four brothers and two sisters.  What were your parent   s names?  My parents    names were Walter and Dora Crooks. My dad was born in  5  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Pittsburgh and my mother was born in Ohio. They came to Oklahoma in  probably July of 1907.  What brought them to Oklahoma?  I guess employment. My oldest brother was about six months old when  they came. He  Dad  was a dry cleaner. Taking care of ladies    clothes  and stuff like that.  Your father was?  Yes. I think where he worked is on Reno Street, and I   ve got a picture of  it. A lot of their stuff was outside, their equipment stuff. I think it was on  Reno Street, that   s not too far from here.  So the dry cleaning equipment was outside?  Some of the stuff. In the picture, there   s an old kind of a truck, a van-like  truck and seemed like there was some clothes hanging on a line, but  I don   t know too much about that. I was pretty young then.  And you said they moved here in 1907?  1907.  And that   s the year Oklahoma became a state. Was it a state yet?  No, I think it became a state in November. I think it was November.  They got here in July. I don   t remember them ever talking about the  event, I really don   t.  I wonder if they knew if it was going to happen.  I don   t know.  That   s neat.  I know they had to ride street cars, my dad did, to work. I only  remember him having a car once. He bought an old two-seater Model-T.  I can remember, I was about four years old because my sister was a  baby. He brought it home one night, took us all for a ride and went down  a country road, down a hill, and it stopped and he couldn   t get it started.  He called my brother, he was just probably fifteen or sixteen, but he  came and started it and took it home. My dad took it back the next day  and he never had a car again. He never drove again, the rest of his life.  So new fangled vehicles weren   t for him.  6  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  (Laughter) You said you moved when you were pretty young to another  home?  We moved up to Guthrie in 1927. I started to school, I was six years old  because I started school when I moved up there.  Do you know why your family moved?  For a job. He got a job there in right in the middle of Guthrie in    The  building is still there, but of course it   s not a cleaners anymore. Are you  familiar with Guthrie?  Yes.  The theater where the Pollard is? It used to be called the Melba Theater.  It   s just right around the corner, kind of west and north is where his  cleaners was.  Did you ever help out at the cleaners?  Me? Oh, no. I was too little. That was a little before the Depression  came. We lived on the west side when we first moved to Guthrie and I  think it is probably    Anyway the Cottonwood River, the little creek  flooded. My dad heard it was going to flood and he said, oh that little  creek wouldn   t do that. He walked a few blocks to see it and he came  back in just a few minutes and came back and got everything up high,  and we were flooded. In a few months we moved to the east side.  So, your home flooded? Did you stay there? Or did you have to  evacuate?  I remember some people, if you   re familiar with Guthrie where the  viaduct is, we lived just a little west of that and then it goes uphill. A lot  of people opened their homes to people who were flooded. I remember  sleeping on the floor of, I don   t know their names, but I slept on the  floor one night and oh my gosh, that goo in our house was awful.  Did you all have to help clean it up?  Oh, yeah. Mainly it was real slick, and you had to really watch going  out.  Were many homes flooded?   Yes.  The whole area is  called    The Bottom Where the Creek  7  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Flooded    . Even now it floods when they get  a lot of  rain.  What were some of your chores growing up? How did you help out  around the house?  I did a lot. When I got old enough, I   d help Mom. We had a washboard  and stuff like that. Just a lot of little things. I went to    On the west side  was Banner School and then they called east side the Capitol School. I  went there until the fourth grade. I went from the fifth to the eighth  grade to the Lutheran parochial school. But then after the parochial  school, went to the eighth grade, started to the junior high and high  school at Fogarty and graduated from the Guthrie High School.  What year did you graduate?  1938. We were the first class to have a cap and gown because things  were so hard. People just didn   t have money and previously, the  graduates had    There was three things. You had class night,  baccalaureate was supposed to have kind of a little dressy blue outfit and  class night was just kind of casual little dress. Then graduation night we  was supposed to have the long white, organdy gown and a dozen roses. I  wasn   t by myself. Most of the kids wouldn   t have been able to graduate.  They kind of more or less petitioned. The kids got it up and   I think  there was two kids that were already wealthy or their folks had money.  We got our caps and gowns and they were so ugly. (Laughter) We were  proud to get them, but they were a heavy kind of wool gray and they  have these pretty blue ones. Guthrie has Royal blue now. I never got a  class ring. I wanted a class ring. Back then I think they were just about  nine dollars.  How many people did you graduate with?  I think about ninety-some. A couple years ago, in    08, the last class  reunion I went to was the sixtieth in    08. I got a letter from a classmate  in Arizona and she said since probably so few of us were left and the  difficulty of getting together, she was going to have a postal reunion. So  she notified everybody she could and we wrote a letter of what we   d  been doing and sent pictures. She put it all together and sent it back to  us. So it was a postal reunion.  That   s a good idea.  That was a good time.  Going back to some of your chores and how you helped out around the  house. You mentioned laundry, did you have indoor plumbing at all?  8  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  I had a rub board and P G soap, and I think it was the Gold Dust Twins,  kind of a powdered soap, and a clothes line.  What about bathroom facilities?  We had a bathroom in Guthrie, but things were so bad that    Actually  this is right as soon as I graduated, we moved about ten miles southeast  of Guthrie and didn   t have anything. We didn   t have electric or gas. We  had a huge wooden cook stove, big pot bellied heating stove, outhouse,  oh Lord. I look back now and I think, people complain now. (Laughs) I  don   t know. But you know how I look back now and those were some of  the happiest days we had. People were good. Well, they still are, but out  there, most of the time I would find some little job. When we lived up on  our farm, I got a job doing housework and babysitting at a lady   s house.  I lived there. I got my housing; two dollars a week. (Laughs) I think then  I did get to work on Saturdays at the Kress Store.  In Guthrie?  In Guthrie, yes.  What would you do there?  I think I was a clerk and I sold candy and sold hardware, and I remember  selling some material. They kind of moved you around. That was fun. I  liked that. The WPA, it wasn   t WPA, but it   s a branch of it    The NYA,  and you don   t hear of it that much.  Is that the National Youth Administration?  Yes. That really helped me out in high school. I graded papers my junior  year an hour after school. I think it was nine dollars a month. Senior  year, I got the real choice job of working in the principal   s office. I was  surprised to get it.  So you got paid to work in the principal   s office through the NYA?  I got, I think it was about nine dollars. My senior year I worked after  school, I did some babysitting for a little boy and then Saturdays, I  worked at Kress. So I think I probably made a grand sum of maybe nine  dollars. (Laughs) That was a lot of money then.  How did you sign up for the NYA?  They had an office there and you go in and they would usually hire you  9  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  for so many months, but like if you worked for a school you worked the  whole school year. After I got out of high school, I would work for the  NYA once in a while and one time I worked in a sewing room, made  white coveralls, and I think one time I worked in an office for the,  seemed like the agriculture deal. But the office is in the post office  building in Guthrie. One time I got to work in the principal   s office at  the junior high school, Cotteral Junior High School on the west side of  Guthrie. Then in 1941 I heard about, you could go to college and they  would pay your tuition. That was in Stillwater. I went to Oklahoma  A M. That was in 1941.  That was still the NYA that was paying your tuition?  NYA.  Our dormitory was called Aggie Lodge.  It was an abandoned  CCC camp and that was our dormitories. I think it was located, to me it  seemed west of Stillwater. We got our tuition but we had to work. We  had a choice of a sewing room or pottery or the mess hall, KP duty or  the laundry. So I chose sewing. We made dresses for a children   s home.  I was just there one semester and that was when World War II broke out.  Christmas that year, we got to go home and a girl, I think she lives in  Southeast Oklahoma somewhere, a little town, she came back and she  was so excited about an NYA radio school at Tonkawa. I was kind of  going towards being a teacher and I   d studied typing and shorthand. We  checked to see if we could maybe transfer to the Tonkawa Radio School,  and we got to.  They sent a man to give us a test with taking Morse Code just to see if  we could tell a difference in the sound. I think it was about four of us,  four women. It was mostly boys up at that school at that time. We  weren   t the first girls, but we were probably the second group of girls.  They taught us code and they taught us radio theory and radio shop  where we   d kind of work on stuff. Then we had to work and I did KP  duty there. (Laughs) We got a few dollars and room and board. We was  there about six months. If you passed that, they would recommend you  for a government job. I was recommended to Kelly Field in San Antonio  and I got to go to work in an aircraft radio shop first. I was there about  three months and one of my supervisors asked me if I   d be interested in  working in the radar shop. I said yes. I hadn   t a clue what radar was.  (Laughs) Anyway, it was two other girls and we three girls were the  only girls ever to be working in that shop. They sent us first to  Philadelphia to the big companies like RCA and Philco, they would  change over from making radios to making radio and radar for planes  and stuff for the government. So they sent us back there to train on that.  Anyway, I got into that field instead of teaching.  How did you get to Philadelphia?  10  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  The government paid our way by train. That was at the time of the train.  The country moved on the train. All the depots were so busy. The first  time I ever rode on a train was from Guthrie to San Antonio and I was  scared. (Laughter)  What year was it that you went to Philadelphia?  I was working down in Kelly Field, let   s see, I started work there in  September. Probably in November of 1942. The first time, I was there  about a month and a half. I went to RCA. There   s a type of radar that     They have two different types of radar. There   s ground radar and radar  that   s in a plane. Of course they have sonar and stuff like that, but RCA  made altimeter radar and it worked with a bomb. We got to learn how to  fix that and take care of that and check it out and stuff. In    43, we got to  go to Philco and it was in Philadelphia. They called it IFF, Identification  Friend or Foe. It was just a small deal, but to me it was one of the most  interesting ones. For the pilot and bombers and fighters, it would tell one  fighter from the other fighter, if they were our pilots, identify them to  each other so they wouldn   t shoot each other. Mostly it was over in  England, that operation. Ground radar, it identified planes to them so  they wouldn   t shoot our planes down. It   s the only one I know of that it  had a detonator in it. If the pilot crashed or landed, the enemies couldn   t  get any, it would blow up that set. In 1943, I got to go to Bell Labs in  New York. It was sort of a search radar. It was interesting.  So as you were learning all of this about radars, were there many other  women?  No, we were the first. Us three girls. At RCA, I still have a letter that the  secretary up there wrote my mother to tell her how we was getting  along. It said we were the only girls in the, I forget how many, it was  about three hundred men. At Bell Labs there was one girl that came  from Georgia. In Philco, there were some girls there but they were in  aircraft radio. I know we were the only girls, three girls. Actually, I  ended up, I was the only girl there for awhile because one girl quit and  the other, Kay, my friend, we were signed up to go to Hawaii to work on  radar and my orders got messed up and she went. So I was the only one  in the shop down in San Antonio. Then my orders came and I went over  by myself. I wasn   t by myself, but I was on a train from San Antonio to  Seattle then took a troop ship from Seattle to Hawaii. So I was over there  from    44 to    49. But, at NYA, I don   t know, now is this mostly for kind  of for the thirty-fours?  Oh, not necessarily.  11  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Oh, okay. I thought maybe that was it, but okay. I geared up on  nighttime, WPA and the CCC.  Well, we   ll talk more about that too. But the NYA is what opened all  these doors for you?  Oh, no doubt. I owe everything to that.  Do you remember what the age requirement was for NYA?  The age for the   ?  To participate with     NYA? Well, like I said, I was out of high school. I graduated in    38, so I  was twenty-one while I was there, but I think there were some younger  than me. NYA started in high school, so I was grading papers. At the  Tonkawa Radio School, our director was Johnson Murray who was later  Governor of Oklahoma. He was the nicest person. He was always so  friendly.    Good morning,    you know, and he knew our names. There was  a lot of kids there, but he knew our names. His wife was called Willie.  Of course, we didn   t call her Willie, Mrs. Johnson, but I always felt like  she was looking down her nose like she was going to give us culture.  (Laughter) I remember one of the first times I ate up there at that school  with the boys grabbing and later on when she had a girl at each end of  the table and the boys sit in the    I guess it was supposed to teach  manners.  When you were living in Philadelphia, did you live with the other girls?  One place I lived was just a home. A lot of people during the War  opened up their homes and the people that needed, like come down for  training or    We could stay at a hotel. I did stay at a hotel in New York  going to school, but there was the nicest old lady. She had two senior  citizen roomers, two other girls. She made sure we had a breakfast  before we went to school and left. Get up in the morning, we   d all sit  around at this table and there was one thing she fixed every morning.  She had the table full, but there was one thing she   d make, and I can   t     It   s a food that is famous in Pennsylvania. I couldn   t stand it, but I ate it.  I guess it was a special treat, but it looked kind of gray looking. They  were so nice and just looked after us. One of her roomers was a retired  railroad conductor and he was so sweet. He took a liking to us three girls  and one day he wanted to show us Philadelphia and he took us to the old  gym on the east side and helped us on the streetcar. He wouldn   t let us  pay and I remember he took us to the Betsy Ross house and to the  Independence home of Liberty Bell and all that, you know.  12  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  So you had special treatment?  Oh, and one of the girls and I was going to go just take a trip to New  York, sightseeing, and he drew up kind of a little map. I wished he felt  like he could go and show us around, but he drew us a little map and we  followed that and had no trouble at all seeing things.  When you worked in high school for the NYA, how did you spend your  money that you earned?  I gave a lot of it to my mom. You   d be surprised. Of course, a loaf of  bread now... That   s one of the things I had to do when I was little is go  to the bakery and get second hand, day old  bread . (Laughs) Get the  bread, get about four loaves at about a nickel a piece.  Did your brothers and sisters work for NYA also?  My sister did in school and she was lucky. She graduated in    43 and I  was working at Kelly Field, then. So I sent her money to come down and  see me, I sent her a round trip ticket. She came down to see me, got her a  job.  (Laughter) She didn   t go back?  No, she didn   t have to, but she did work and grade papers in school like  I did. My brothers, the two younger brothers, they were older than me,  but they were in CCC mostly in California or not California, Colorado  and New Mexico. I   ve got a lot of pictures of that.  When did you know that you were in a Depression? Do you remember  realizing it?  I never really realized I was poor. I mean, I guess when we moved in at  the farm. I know a lot of Momma   s    I remember some of the furniture  she had. It was old, but it was pretty. It disappeared. Of course she didn   t  have room for it at the farm.  When you moved to the farm, did your father still have his business?  No. His health got bad. He was sixty-seven. I was in Hawaii when he  passed away and I had to fly home and see him and do that. I didn   t get  to see him. My family and I went to Hawaii and got to relive some of the  things. I got to show them about where I worked, the hangars.   Marlena   s  husband is a retired colonel and he got us on Hickam Field  where I worked and the hangars looked the same, only newer. They  13  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  looked better.  So where all did you serve in Hawaii?  I worked at Hickam. I worked there until after the war ended and then,  like I told you before, my orders got messed up and my girlfriend went  before I did, so when I got over there, they put me on    She was in the  shop at what they call Fort Kam  Kamehameha  and when I got up there,  they put me on line at Hickam. I just took it. I thought, well    I liked it  though because I had a lot of freedom. I could go to different hangars  and got to see a lot of things, and I think after the war, they were kind of  tightening down, they were going to put me in the electric shop and I  thought, no way. They transferred me into Fort Kam, so I worked in two  different places, but back on radar equipment then. I stayed there until     49 and they had a reduction in force, so all the civilians came home.  So when you were in Hawaii, were there many other women?  Oh, yeah. They had civilian housing there at Hickam. Of course Pearl  Harbor had their employees, too, but Hickam Field, we had our housing  and they called it Hickam Village II. We had a nice two-story barracks  and they had women on one side and men housing on the other. In the  middle they had the mess hall and recreational buildings and post office  and offices, and it was a pretty big deal. They had what were called  bunas, they were buses, but they were open and the seats were on the  sides and just really rough. They would take us back and forth to work.  They also had a narrow gauge little train that ran from the housing to  Hickam. There was, I forget how many, but this is a lot of women. And  then they had housing  for married couples , you know. The radar shop  there, there was a few women in that. There was more in the radio, but it  was     And where would you put the radar? On the airplane, how would you  install it?  Oh, yeah. I even got to fly in some of those.  Really?  Yeah, the old B-24s. Not very often, but I got to go up    We   d also  remove    The radar shop was secret. We had to have passes and we had  armed guards at the door to get in. We had to have a card to get on the  plane. If a plane had radar on it, they had a guard there and you   d have  to show a pass to get on to remove the radar and take it to the shop and  check it out and see if it was working alright. A few times, I got to go up  in a B-24 and a C-47. I   ve been on a lot of other planes. I got to work on  14  Cook  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Cook  Fletcher  Cook  Wilson  Fletcher  a B-29, one of the bombers that bombed Japan. In fact, when I was  working at Hickam, I had a bicycle over there and from the housing,  sometimes I   d ride my bike to work at Hickam. I came to work one  morning and I saw this line of B-29s and I knew what they were because  I worked on one at Kelly Field. I thought, oh my goodness, you know,  they were so huge then. I thought the next day I went to work I   d take a  camera. I   ve still got the little picture, it was one of them little Brownie  pictures. That was the flight of planes    I had forgotten.  The Enola Gay. The plane that bombed Japan, the Enola Gay, was one  of the planes.  The Enola Gay. She researched    In fact, it wasn   t too many years ago,  I got to looking at it, her daughter was doing an essay on World War II  and she was asking me stuff. So I got that picture out and she enlarged it  and you could see on the tails of the plane there was letters. She  researched it.  So it was headed to Japan?  It was the one that bombed Japan, it sure was.  She wasn   t supposed to be taking pictures out there.  (Laughter) I took a picture of a captured    It   s just that one    It   s the  Japanese Kamikaze. They had one on exhibit when I was there and I  went to work one morning and I come out and they had this Kamikaze in  front of the  headquarter building . I took my camera back the next day  and took a picture of it. I took it with me when we went to Hawaii this  year and they said it wasn   t at Hickam Field anymore, but it was on Ford  Island. It   s still over there.  Obviously it was one that didn   t work well. It was still in one piece.  So was there a precise science to exactly where you would place the  radar on the airplane?  Oh, yeah. They had everything on the plane that was, you know, was it     44? Early part of    44, they had a special project. I went to work my  hours during the day and they told me to come back at twelve o   clock  that night to work twelve hours, it was special project on B-29s. They  had a B-29 in the hangar and I got to help install the IFF on it. The B-29,  it was on the tail end of it. It wasn   t a very big piece of equipment, but  the B-29 has a tunnel through it from the tail to the front. For some  reason, I thought I was supposed to crawl through that tunnel, but I  never could get through that tunnel because every time I thought there  15  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Cook  would be a man coming down there and he   d keep a comin   , so I   d back  out. I finally got down. There   s so many people working on that plane  that you   d have to sit there and wait to get up. I   d sit there and I   d get  sleepy. I   d worked that day and I was sitting there and I was with two  other guys in the shop. I was sitting there and all of a sudden we   re  moving. These two guys were just looking at me. They had a tug going  on, the plane, they were towing it. Tugging it over to the    They called  me Dottie then. They said,    Toughen up Dottie, we   re going to bail out      (Laughter) Were you supposed to still be on the plane?  Yeah  They didn   t, well, I was. Anyway, those guys, they were just  sitting there, seeing what I   d do.  How many planes do you think you installed radars on?  I don   t know. I know there was B-29s, a lot of fighters. When I first got  to Hawaii, they had an assembly line that they put me to work on.  They   d bring the planes over from the mainland. Hawaii was still a  territory then and I always say the States, you know, but anyway, they   d  bring the planes over and we   d assemble them. Somewhere over in my  deal, I   ve got a little magazine that   s got that line. Anyway, I was way  up on the line then, radar was one of the last  to be installed . So we did  a lot of those. Planes run in and     How long would it take?  It didn   t take too long to put that in there.  So you would do about how many in a day?  I don   t know because it would take awhile for the plane to get to that  spot. I don   t know if I did more than one or two a day.  Most every day?  Yes. For awhile now, that didn   t last too long at that assembly line. Then  I got to go all over Hickam Field for different    I know one time I was  there, somehow I was down in Hangar 15 down at the end of the field.  As far as I know I was the only one down there, and I heard kind of a  commotion at the front of the hangar. So, of course, I had to find out  what was going on. I got there and it was a C-47 right out to the side of  the hangar.  They were taking nurses off that plane from the Philippines.  16  Fletcher  Cook  Wilson  Cook  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Cook  Fletcher  I think I was the only one that saw that. There was ambulances there, but  some were walking off and     The government didn   t want any publicity about women being hurt and  women actually being    So they actually pretty much snuck them into  Hickam Field. Really injured and     Oh, and then they went to the hospital there?  The government never let anyone, people, know that women were being  injured.  But you know, they   d been over there all during the war.  Yeah, we don   t hear about that.  Anyway. I don   t know     Did you have any vacation time while you were in Hawaii?  Yes, I did. I came home in    46. In    46, a lot of people were quitting and  going home and to encourage people to stay. Well, this girl, my co-worker  all these years, and she   s still living. She lives in New York and  we still correspond, but she and two other girls, we came back and they  paid our way back, all that transportation stuff and going to visit our  folks and stuff.  What about Christmas? The Christmas tree.  After the war in    45, we heard a ship load of Christmas trees had come  into Honolulu and Kay and I, there was an empty room in the dormitory,  and we thought we were going to have us a Christmas. So we decided  we   d go into town and get us a Christmas tree. We get on the bus and the  bus came from Honolulu out to Hickam Village II, where we lived. We  would go into town, look around. We found this real nice, about six, it  was taller than us, six foot tree. Got that paid for, got it, now how in the  world are we going to get this home? (Laughs) Just carried it to the bus  stop. The bus come around and he said,    Oh lady, please.    We hugged  that tree, got it on the bus, hugged it all the way home. People were  looking, some of them were laughing, some of them gave us a dirty  look. (Laughter) Anyway, we didn   t buy ornaments. Some of the girls in  the dormitory worked in the tin shop and she made little stars and little  things like that and painted them. Well, vacuum tube, some of them they  call peanut tube. They   re small. We got some of those that were no good  and we painted them, tied strings on them. There was a, it   s a thin  aluminum and it   s in a roll and during World War II, it was secret.  17  Cook  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Especially over in Europe, they would drop that roll of foil from the  bombers, just throw it out and it would confuse the enemy radar because  the radar picks up that metal, whatever it is, and it reflects back. It was  so much of it inside that. It was secret. It was extra secret. I   ve got a roll  of that. (Laughter)  This foil, we used as tinsel.   And again, this is on tape. The government is going to come get you.  (Laughter) Oh well.  So you had a nice Christmas that year?  We sure did. One girl that worked in the offices, she made rings and  little Christmas stuff, birds and I forget what else. Different ones that  worked in different places came up with some idea and we bought gag  gifts, you know. We had a good Christmas.  How would you communicate with your family at home?  Air mail. We had a post office at the housing and had our own post box,  a mailbox down there. When I first got there, we didn   t have phones in  the dormitories. We finally got phones back in    48. They laid the cable  from the States to Hawaii and when they opened it, it was in May  because I thought, I   d like to call my brother. My brother and sister   s  birthdays were the same day, May 30. I had to get up real early in the  morning and catch a bus into Honolulu and I think I made an  appointment. I went in and I can   t remember how much it cost, but then  it cost quite a bit, but I called my brother on that. But I   ve never heard  about that thing since. Of course, now, everything is    But that was    I  called my brother and all he could say was,    Well, I   ll be darned.       This  is Dottie.       I   ll be darned.       Where are you calling from?       Honolulu.        Well, I   ll be darned.     (Laughter) How long did you talk to him?  Oh, just a few minutes, but I had to talk and then, you couldn   t both just  like we do just to keep, I would talk and then he would talk.  Did you get to see much of Hawaii?  Oh, yeah. I   ve got tons of pictures. That was fun comparing my old  pictures to present day  because it   s built up and just all these high rise  things. I got to look at the pictures of the way it was about seventy years  ago and the way it is now. And the people were so nice up there. The  bus that took us around the island took us to Pearl Harbor. My birthday,  my ninetieth birthday, was over there. The bus driver sang happy  18  Cook  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  birthday. (Laughter) Anyway. Fort Kam, you don   t see that on the map.  That   s where the airport is now.  Really? There   s a Hawaii airport there?  I have walked from Hickam to Fort Kam. Walking one day, when I  walked to Fort Kam, you could see ships in the little harbor there. I  walked by these ships there and when I came back, the flags were at half  mast. I wondered what in the world happened. That was the day  Roosevelt died. I finally figured it out, why it   s not on the map. It   s  because the airport is there.  Let   s go back to the 1930s and talk about that a little more. We talked  about your family moving to the farm. What year did they move?     38. Just as soon after I graduated.  Okay. So did you help out on the farm any?  I worked mostly in town. I tried to find me a little job. Yes, I   d help out  there whenever, but everybody was    My brothers, in the summer time,  would go to Kansas to work the harvest. People would work any jobs  they could find. Before we moved out there, I was going to tell you  about the Depression, the little dogs. They were a godsend because they  were so entertaining and loving and     Were they your pets?  Oh, yes. We had a little male and female and the momma dog had five  little pups. You watch Bumstead, Dagwood, Blondie. The cartoon, that   s  back in the thirties if you can imagine cartoons being that old. Daisy the  dog compared to our little dog. She had five pups and things Daisy  would do would be like our little dog would do, too. Also the Monopoly  game came out in the thirties and I loved that game to start with, but my  dad loved it and every night after supper (my brother bought it for the  whole family so we   d have something to do) we   d finish eating and as  soon as we   d get the table cleared off, my dad would have that  monopoly game spread out. He played for blood, I   m telling you.  (Laughter) He would   ve made a good banker. It used to be,    It   s my turn  to play.    It got to be,    I played last night, it   s your turn.    (Laughter) But  those things like that, you only have to get through.  Did you play any card games?  We played pitch and there was a game, solitaire, old maid, I loved card  games. Of course, when we were little, another thing I remember, in the  19  Wilson  Fletcher  Cook  Fletcher  Cook  Fletcher  summertime we didn   t have air conditioning, of course, and we   d stay  outside and put a quilt down and play out there. Every night, you would  set your clock. At nine o   clock that mail plane, this one little mail plane  would fly over. We   d sit out there and wait for that plane to come by.  (Laughter) That plane helped solve, back in the thirties, it solved a  kidnapping. There was an oil man named Walter Urschel that was  kidnapped and I think the gangster   s name was George    Machine Gun     Kelly. He took Walter Urschel southeast of Oklahoma to some remote  farm or something. But Urschel, when he was a prisoner, would listen     he would hear a mail plane go over and he had a watch, but anyway,  when they finally paid the ransom and everything and he was released,  he told them about the mail plane flying over at a certain time. By that,  they located where the farm was  by the time the plane flew over .  That   s neat. What else did you do for entertainment? Did anyone play  musical instruments?   Yes, my dad played guitar and mandolin.  The neighborhood, it was  altogether different back then. There   d be people sitting out on porches a  lot and even as a little kid, I knew all the neighbors. The grown-ups, I  knew them, and where I live now, and I   ve lived there fifty years, longer  than that, I hardly even see my neighbors. I know a few of them pretty  well. As a kid I knew what all dirt and everything. It   s just a different  time.  What about the Victrola? The wind up Victrola?  Oh, yeah. That   s another thing we loved. My dad bought this old  Victrola, it was taller than my sister and I, we   d wind it up, I don   t know  if the records came with it, but he must have bought it used. We learned  all kinds of  songs . He had Strauss waltzes and he had the March King,  Sousa. A lot of his records. I know there   s one by the opera singer, my  nephew has still got those records. Kate Smith and    My sister and I     Some of the saddest records. (Laughter) We   d stand there and play that  thing listening and just bawl. Baggage Coach Ahead, Taking the Dead  Girl Home and Letter Edged in Black. Old Shep.  What about the one that Thelma didn   t like?  Oh, my older sister, she   s ten years older than me. She was engaged to  get married  to an older man   probably twenty-eight or thirty years old .  It probably wasn   t that old. To a ten year old, that   s awful old to me, but  anyway, we had this old record, Get Away Old Man, Get Away and I   d  threaten to play it when he was there. It disappeared. She died when she  was twenty-one. When we were out at the farm, when I was helping  Mom get some dishes down out of the pantry, I found that record way up  20  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  on the  top shelf . (Laughter)    Get away old man, get away. Young  man   s heart is full of love, get away old man get away.     Would you listen to the radio?  We had a radio and I loved that. Fibber McGee and Molly, and Jack  Benny, and oh goodness. All of those. My dad liked boxing and we   d  listen to the World Series. I don   t remember listening to any football  stuff. They weren   t into football.  What about fireside chats?  Yes. Even as young as I was, I loved to listen to Roosevelt and his voice.  He had a way and when he died and Harry Truman, the first time I heard  him talk, I thought,    Ugh.    And I didn   t like him. I guess just the sound  of his voice. Then.  Did your family raise a garden?  A garden? Yes, in Guthrie, there was a vacant lot east of us and the man  that owned it let my dad use it for garden, just to keep it up, you know.  Keep the weeds out. That   s one thing that helped during the Depression.  We had a garden out at the farm, too. My dad, he worked at it with just a  little hand plow. He had a nice big garden. I can   t think what it was,  there was something else     What are some of your favorite meals that you remember your mother  preparing?  I remember kind of the    Out on the farm, I don   t think I   ve ever heard  of it or remember seeing it, I never tasted it since. There used to be wild  grapes. Little tiny grapes that grow wild. There   s not much to them  except skin and seed, but they sure had a good taste. There was a creek  not too far and we gathered those wild grapes. We   d gather those and  she made some grape dumplings and they were so good. We had this big  old wood stove out at the farm and it still amazes me how you can cook  on those and not regulate the oven and stuff like that, but we turned out  some good  food . She fried biscuits a lot and she had an old iron skillet  and she put a little bit of hog lard in that there and the biscuits, oh they  were good.  Would you eat them with butter or molasses?   Yes, homemade butter.  She would can a lot of chili and everything we  would put up, but yes, we   d eat them with that. We raised chickens. We  had one old milk cow, Auntie Boo.  21  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Cook  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Did you have to help milk?  I never did milk. Momma did that. She did a lot of the work. I look back  now and I think, gosh, we have it so easy.  Did she make her own lye soap?  I think she did once or twice. Did you kids make it in 4-H?  We tried.  Different projects. Got a recipe and make    Yeah.  What about sewing? Did she sew the children   s clothes?  Sewing, she had me do it. (Laughs) She got out of that. I remember  teaching her to embroider. She was doing some kind of embroidery and  she didn   t know the stitches. She   d kind of makeshift and anyway, I  taught her the stitches and my gosh, she would make dresser scarves.  Every time she got a chance she   d buy some  pre-stamped dresser  scarves, embroider them and give them to everybody .  Did she quilt?  Not much. My sister that passed away made a flower garden quilt. A  little tiny    You still have that don   t you? Did it all by hand. But I never  have quilted either.  But you learned to sew pretty young?  I quit sewing, after  we moved back home to Oklahoma . We lived in a  trailer, my husband   s job, we had to travel a lot and we lived out in  California. Every time I   d get the sewing machine out, I had that big old  Necchi sewing machine. I   d get it out and open it up and get there. I had  the three girls at the time and they would gather around me and I got  where I   finally, the best things I   d make was little night gowns for  them. The kids all learned to sew in 4-H. So once my daughters learned  to sew, I quit. Let Kathy do the sewing.  You mentioned your brothers worked for the CCC. How did they get  joined on with that?  There was an office in town. Kind of a government office where you go  in and put an application in. My brother Raymond, I think he went to  Durango, Colorado. He came home for a weekend or something on leave  22  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Cook  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  and it was the first time I ever tasted cottage cheese and pineapple. He  was saying oh, that is so good. So Momma bought some and of course,  we all loved it and the next time he came back, he wouldn   t touch it. I  guess he got fed up on it. Cottage cheese and pineapple.  Do you know what kind of work he did in Durango?  They did a lot of, CCC boys, even now, they   ve built bridges and roads  to    Have you been to Mt. Scott? That road up to it, they built that and  they did construction building stuff in Colorado and New Mexico. I  think he was at Roswell once, too. I   ve got pictures, but he didn   t mark  them, so I have no idea just what state they were in. Probably from  several places.  I   m surprised they didn   t stay around Oklahoma.  They just went wherever they were sent. When I was still in school,  there were big army trucks and they had the tarp over them and the guys,  the young men in the back, I   d pass it going to school in Guthrie. When  we lived out on the farm, the land across the road from us, from our  land, was wooded and they came out for several months and they cleared  that all off. So they did all kinds of different stuff. I know my younger  brother did, what do they call it when they do the soil   ?  Terracing.  Terracing, he was taught that. So they learned a lot of different stuff  from working. He worked up at that agricultural place I was telling you  about that I worked. I remember he drew a map. He was left handed and  was good at drawing. He made a big map for them and they really liked  that. So the WPA and all the different other organizations, it taught  people from school teaching to a whole lot of stuff. Like me getting into  radar and stuff, working on that stuff.  Did you live in town in Guthrie most of the time when you moved there  early on?  Yes. I lived there until, well I left in    41 to go to Stillwater and then  when I came back from Hawaii, I came back and lived with my mother  up in Guthrie and went to work for Tinker. I met my husband, also had  worked at Kelly Field and he worked in the radar shop when I worked  there. I remember seeing him and probably talked to him, but at   Tinker , I was in the cafeteria and he was in line behind me. We got to  talking and he recognized me I guess, so we started going out together.  Then I lived in Oklahoma City for awhile and then moved out to  California where he worked for the CAA and we had to travel to  23  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  Cook  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  different airports and he took care of the radio and radar at the airports.  What is the CAA?  It   s the FAA now, but previously it was called Civil Aeronautics   Administration . Now it   s the FAA,  the Federal Aviation  Administration .  And what   s your husband   s name?  James. Jim.  When did you get married?  In    52.  Where?  Where? Oklahoma City. No, Guthrie. The wedding, we got married in  my mother   s house in Guthrie.  And then, how many children did you have?  I have five. Four girls and a boy.  And when did you move back to Oklahoma?  We moved back to Oklahoma in    62. She  Marlena  was born in Texas  and when she was three weeks old, we moved back. Jim was working  at    I can   t think of the name of the town you were born in.  San Angelo.  San Angelo. Anyway, he transferred from there. We went all over. We  lived in California, Washington, New Mexico, Georgia, Texas    The  kids, my oldest daughter was going to start school, so we wanted to get  settled down and we came back to Oklahoma in    62. We moved to  Newcastle. We bought the land in    62. We built out house there. My  husband and I built the house and are still living in it.  What does Oklahoma mean to you?  Home. (Laughs) Yes. I love to see things. My husband and I, we  travelled all over the world, but it   s always good to get home. I like to  see things, I think they   re pretty, and I haven   t been anywhere I didn   t  like. I see things going on here and it just tickles me. Glad to see them  24  Wilson  Fletcher  Cook  Fletcher  Cook  Fletcher  Cook  Fletcher  Cook  Fletcher  Wilson  Cook  Fletcher  Cook  Fletcher  Wilson  Fletcher  doing.  When history is written, what would you like for it to say about you?  Say about me? I haven   t a clue. (Laughter) That old lady  I don   t know.  All the years with 4-H. You donated your time to 4-H.  Oh, yeah. That was one of my favorite things.  You will always be known for that. Twenty-five years.  Yes. But, all my kids, you all learned so much in that. I had all five of  them     Not just her kids.  Spent nine years each, put your nine years in and you got to go to, all of  you got to go to Washington and    Really proud of that.  She has been a big influence on many people.  That   s one of my proud deals.  In the Newcastle area?  Newcastle and McClain area. She influenced many, many kids.  She graduated from OSU and three others graduated from OU. Got three  nurses. She   s a nurse, my daughter Becky is living in Seattle now. Used  to all three work at St. Anthony   s. Kathy still, she   s a lab     She   s a microbiologist.  She   s a microbiologist. Jimmy is a mail carrier down by Texhoma and  Becky is a radiologist up in Seattle. Anyway. I don   t think    I   m ninety,  but I feel ninety. (Laughter) I know they seem like they should be. You  people are fifty next year. (Laughter) I   m telling you.  Well thank you so much for talking with me today. I really enjoyed it.  I guess they say, talk your leg off. Okay, well thank you for listening   -------  -------
