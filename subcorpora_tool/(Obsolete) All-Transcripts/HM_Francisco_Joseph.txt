Story_ID: 26816
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your, your father's side of the family first.  And if you would give his name and what you know about him?
Speaker 2: Okay, so my father's name is Joseph Salvadore Francisco.  He was born in New Orleans [Louisiana].  His father, my grandfather, he was Joseph Salvadore Francisco.  He actually came over from Italy, working on a, I guess it was a merchant ship, came in via New York.  But in that time, actually, late 1800s, early 1900s, down in Louisiana, they needed workers for the sugar cane fields.  And so, you know, he came over, you know, as part of, you know, that group of immigrants to, you know, to work the, you know, the fields there.  And so they have my grandfather coming in from Port of--coming in from Rome, Italy, although from what I learned from my father, that he was actually from the southern part of Italy, south of, of Rome.  But on censors and stuff that my dad had, had him coming in port entry from, from Rome.
Speaker 1: Now, you were primarily raised by your grandparents, right?
Speaker 2: That's true, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how well did you know your father and your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: I didn't know them very well.  I didn't because my father and mother [Lucinda Antoine Lang] divorced when I was two months.  And so I moved to Texas with my grandparents, and back then.  But, you know, during the summers, you know, periodically, not regularly, I would go and visit both my mother and my father, who both resided, you know, in New Orleans.
Speaker 1: And what--so he was Italian, that's what you're saying?
Speaker 2: He was half Italian.
Speaker 1: Half Italian.
Speaker 2: My father was half Italian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His father was full Italian.
Speaker 1: Full Italian, okay.  And do you, did you--could you describe him?
Speaker 2: Which one?
Speaker 1: Your father.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah, in what, in what description?
Speaker 1: Physically or in personality or--
Speaker 2: In terms of physically, you know, he was about five [feet] eight [inches], very outgoing individual, very, well, he was always on the go (laughter).  That's how I would describe him.  But, you know, one of the things--you know, he had a lot of challenges growing up.  I think, you know, part of the challenge that he had was that my grandfather died when he was very young.  And so it's really more the community that really helped with, you know, raising, raising him.  So I don't think he knew his, you know, side of the family, you know, very, very well.  But what I remember about my dad was, you know, his sense of always moving forward with whatever challenge there was, you know.  He always had to continue to move forward, and roll with the punches kind of thing.
Speaker 1: So what was his occupation?  Do you know that?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 1: Okay, can you tell me about, I mean what his occupation was?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he actually was a tailor.  So he would actually, you know, make, you know, clothes.  So that was his occupation.
Speaker 1: And so, how did your parents meet?  Do you know that?
Speaker 2: No, that I don't know.
Story_ID: 26817
Speaker 1: So give me your mother's name, and--
Speaker 2: Her maiden name or--
Speaker 1: Her maiden name.
Speaker 2: Yeah, her maiden name was Lucinda Antoine.
Speaker 1: Antoine?
Speaker 2: Antoine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But actually, it's--I think it's Lucinda Antoine Lang.  There we go.  I missed the last name.
Speaker 1: L-A-N-G.
Speaker 2: L-A-N-G, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how much do you know about her background 'cause you--
Speaker 2: I know a little bit about that one, yeah, as well.  So, my mother was born in Baton Rouge [Louisiana], and so my grandfather was Edward Lang.  He actually came from Jackson, Mississippi, that side of the family.  My grandmother on my mother's side, her maiden name was Sarah Johnson.  And she was actually born in Port Allen, which is right across the river from Baton Rouge.
Speaker 1: And so was Sarah--you said Sarah Allen?
Speaker 2: Sarah Walker.
Speaker 1: Walker, okay, okay, that's what I thought.  Okay, I have it.
Speaker 2: Her maiden name was Sarah Johnson.
Speaker 1: Sarah Johnson, okay.  So, so what did your--how well did you know your mother or not?  Are you mainly raised by your grandparents and that's who you--?
Speaker 2: Well, I was mainly raised by my grandparents, but I would go and visit my mother--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, and father.  So, during the summers, yeah.
Speaker 1: So tell me about your mother.  Can you also describe her?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in terms of what her occupation--
Speaker 1: Her occupation, what's her personality, her--
Speaker 2: Her personality, well, actually she was a very smart lady.  I'll just--and she, her occupation was a, she worked as, as the help in New Orleans [Louisiana].  So she worked for a Jewish woman as her help.  She worked for her for a very long time (laughter) as her help.  And, and so that's, that's primarily what she did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when did you move to, to, to Beaumont, Texas?
Speaker 2: Two months after I was born.
Speaker 1: Two months after you were born.  So that decision, so do you think your parents--your grandparents took you to raise you right or--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's describe them.
Speaker 2: My grand--, my grandparents.
Speaker 1: This is your grandparents.  It's Merlin?
Speaker 2: Merlin and Sarah Walker, yeah.  So, in terms of describing them, what they did.  So my grandmother was primarily a housewife.  And my grandfather--he was really my step grandfather, he actually worked for a, as a manual laborer for Pyramid Pipe Company.  And that's what they did, but what I remember, you know, about them, well, actually, several interesting things to remember about them.  One, I know my grandmother had a sister, and she had a brother.  Her sister was poisoned by, you know, a friend and, and so she, grandmother took in her children and raised her children.  And then, you know, my step grandfather, Merlin Walker, he had about four or five kids from a, you know, previous marriage.  And, and they took them in, and, you know, raised them.  So it was really, you know, quite a few kids that they just really took, you know, their families and raised them because of certain things.  So the household was really quite a, you know, big household.  We're all--I just remember a lot of uncles and aunts, but, you know, from really both sides, etc.  So they really had a good heart in terms of, you know, stepping in and taking care of the, you know, the family and the kids.  It didn't matter, you know, who they were.  They just had an open heart to, to really, really do that.  One of the other things I remember, you know, about them is they were very entrepreneurial, very business--  You know, even though they had, you know, labor-- labor or housewife roles, they actually had a, some real estate business on the side.  You know, they built apartment, a couple of apartment complexes, and, you know, rented that out, you know.  And part of that too was always providing some kind of combination, you know, for the kids as they were really getting their lives started.  But they also then used that to bring in some revenue, you know, as well.  So I remember one of my job functions at home was keeping track of the monies that were coming in and what was coming in and from whom, and where money was going out.  And so that was one of my particular roles, you know, at home.
Story_ID: 26818
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?  Can you take me, do you remember how young you were or, with that memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I was maybe four years old, yeah.  So I remember one of my favorite toys was a rocking horse.  And I used to like to, in the kitchen, you know, try to rock from the kitchen into the bedroom (laughter).  So that's, that's my, how far--I think I was about four, four years old.
Story_ID: 26819
Speaker 1: That you lived really sort of in a blended family is what I hear.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: You know, so, where are you?  How--what is the household?  Can you describe the household to me, so you have your grandmother [Sarah Johnson] and your grandfather [Merlin Walker].  But how many kids are there, and--
Speaker 2: Well, so when I was actually there, I was the only one.  I think all the others had really grown up and started to, you know, started their own families.  I got to know many of them when they stayed in the apartment, you know, complexes.  And so, but none were really in the main house.
Speaker 1: So were these apartment complexes owned by your grandmother and grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and they're in the real estate business.  So when you, so I'm just trying--so you're basically then, you're telling me you're raised as an only child then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep, yep--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yep, in that household, yeah, I was the, the only child.
Speaker 1: And so how old are your grandparents?  How old are they at that point?  Do you know, when you're young?
Speaker 2: Ooh, so, I guess when I entered the household, well, let's see.  I can calculate it here.  When I was born my mother was about thirty-one.  So when my father--and so thirty-one, and so, add sixteen on top of that, forty-seven, forty-eight years old.  That's when, that's what they--
Speaker 1: They're about in their forties, late forties--
Speaker 2: Late forties, yeah, early fifties, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when, when I, I was brought into the household.
Speaker 1: And so what--I just wanna understand what growing up in the household was like.
Story_ID: 26820
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll just ask you this, about what sights, smells and sounds remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay, alright, alright, alright.  So, you want the latter one or you wanna go--
Speaker 1: We can go in order, however, you wanna start.  People have senses different kinds of ways.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You wanna try sights?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, one of the things about me is that I have a precision for sights and locations.  I went to visit my, let's see the last time I visited my grandfather's house was when I was twelve years old.  But three years ago, I actually found my way to his house.  So I just, landmarks and whatever, I can really remember.  So what do I remember?  There's a lot of details about my house and yards, etc.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me that?  I'd, I'd like to record that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so our house was a brick house, and the history of the house was it started as sort of a, a little bit of a row house, and they just over the years extended, extended it, and then transformed it into sort of a, you know, an elongated house to, and so a double house, brick house, and they bricked it.  It was very nice.  It was on a plot, and, of course, in the back was, you know, the first, you know, apartment complex, which was a two-story.  And in the back of, next to it in the backyard of that was a pecan tree.  That was something I remember 'cause fall time is pecan-tree picking.  In the back of that, along the fence, we had a fence where honeysuckle trees, which, of course, the spring, you know, offered that.  And then to the, facing from the street, looking back in the house, in the back of the apartment complex was a mulberry tree.  And, and so actually two mulberry trees.  One was, had fruit that was very young, and one that bore fruit that was rather mature.  And so, yep.
Speaker 1: So those were--
Speaker 2: You're smiling.
Speaker 1: No, I'm smiling because you--the trees had special memory for you.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, because I would just eat like crazy (laughter).  You know, before school, I would, during the springtime, the mulberry tree, I would raid it before going to school and after school.  And the fall time, the pecan trees, I would actually, you know, pick the pecans and then sell them or one of the things that me and my grandfather [Merlin Walker] would do is to make pecan praline, which is a real, you know, real treat.  And so, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, then what other, what is the neighborhood looking like around you?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, our neighborhood was a very interesting neighborhood.  It was one that I really have, looking back on that, several times looking back on it, really come to really appreciate.  And I'll take our street, Washington Boulevard [Beaumont, Texas].  In fact, I lived in 2645 Washington Boulevard.  Directly across the street was a school teacher.  Diagonally across the street was a pharmacy.  So we had the African American pharmacist, the African American dentist.  In fact, my first job was working as the janitor, you know, cleaning up after school, the pharmacy.  And over the years, I worked my way up to being the clean-up boy to the store clerk, to opening the store, managing the store, to assisting the pharmacist in the back as well.  Just to the-- right next door to us was the secretary for the high school principal.  About a block down from us was the first African American professor at Lamar University [Beaumont, Texas].  And then we had, you know, African American doctors and attorneys, just a block over, etc.  So, on our street, you know, it was just a lot of good role models, when you look back at it, a lot of kids too.  You know, we knew each other.  We knew about their families.  We, yeah, you couldn't, couldn't get lost in our community.
Speaker 1: So you're living really, your block is really a solidly middle-class, black community, right?  It's a black community (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I never thought of it as middle class, upper class.  I didn't know.  I had no concept of that.  I just knew if, you know, ever got sick, I knew where a doctor was.  I knew where the dentist was.  I knew where the pharmacist was.  You know, I knew where the teachers were.  You know, that was just a, you know, a good community there.
Speaker 1: So let's go back.  So those were sights.  What about sounds?  What sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, where we lived on Washington Boulevard, it's a major street.  It's almost like Michigan Ave, you know, here.  It's a lot of, you know, traffic.  My house was right on the, on that street.  And so, in fact, my bedroom was really facing, you know, that street.  So, you know, I remember a lot of the passing of cars and, you know, and trucks and, you know, those kinds of things.  So that's a sound that's really, you know, persistent.  I remember a lot.
Speaker 1: Any other sounds?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Smells?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my grandmother's cooking (laughter), particularly when I'd come back from school.  I would always, you know, smell whatever she was cooking.  One of the foods I did not like was rabbit.  I could smell that a mile away.  So, but, yeah, her cooking was fantastic.
Story_ID: 26821
Speaker 1: And so what other memories do you have of, of growing up in that household?  Some special times?  Were there things around holidays or--
Speaker 2: Well, we did a lot as a family.  You know, what, what I re-- really have learned, as I say, gone back and looked at in my own sort of childhood and something I really appreciate about my grandparents [Merlin Walker and Sarah Johnson], is the sense of freedom and, that they gave me.  And what I mean by that, well, you know, after dinner, if I wanted to go and walk--I had a lot of dogs.  So I had a lot of animals.  I had about twelve dogs and two cats, three rabbits, about fifteen chickens, two pigeons that I caught.  And I remember my folks saying, "Son, you need to go get a job to feed your animals."  And that's why I started working at the pharmacy as the clean-up guy to make some money to buy, you know, food for the animals.  But they didn't restrict me in terms of, you know, bringing home any stray pets or animals or anything like that.  They, they--I guess in the community, and that's why it was a good community, they--I felt that I can go anywhere in the community.  You know, I would tell them where I was going.  They didn't have a real problem with that.  You know, there was a lot of trust there. But, you know, in retrospect, they pretty much knew where I was because in that community they would--someone would call and say, "Did you know where your son was?"  And, and, you know, so they were getting a little read out of, you know, where I was and what I was doing in that community.
Speaker 1: You know, I--when I read that you had all those animals, I just knew you lived on a farm (laughter).
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So--
Speaker 2: No, we're in the city, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, how large is Beau-- Beaumont [Texas] at this point in time because when the--
Speaker 2: Maybe about, maybe about seventy-five, eighty thousand, you know, people, yeah.  So they're actually two African American communities in Beaumont.  There is the Pear Orchard and then there was the North End.  The North End of town, a lot of people, that part of town, really worked at the refineries.  And then there was the Pear Orchard, and, which is, you know, where I lived.  There were two African American high schools.  One was Charlton Pollard, and the other one is Hebert High School.  They were cross town, you know, rivals.  In fact, a lot of the NFL [National Football League], you know, players came from those, those two schools.  In fact, one of the things I remember about Sundays would be going out to one of the open fields, maybe about a mile from our house, and all the kids from the community go and play football in that.  And, and that was sort of a, you know, fun thing.  Unfortunately, I was just too short and too small, but I would give it a shot.  I always ended up in the bottom of the pile and someone saying, "Eat grass, Francisco".  But when I go back and think about, you know, some of the players on the field, you know, I actually feel rather proud that I was able to play some of those figures.  So they've gone to, you know, to, you know, some real good, professional, semiprofessional careers in the sport.
Story_ID: 26822
Speaker 1: But I'm still, I'm sort of stuck on the animals because--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that was a--so when did you start collect--I mean when did you start, I don't wanna say collecting animals, but I think you were saying--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when, but, well, how did I start?
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: So I had my favorite dog.  It started with my favorite dog--
Speaker 1: At age what?
Speaker 2: I guess it was maybe five, four or five.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: That I can't remember.  But, you know, he was a shaggy, white dog.  But there was a, sort of a kindergarten school I would walk to.  And every morning, he would walk me to the kindergarten school.  And, you know, I'd go and do the kindergarten thing.  And he knew at, you know, when school was out because, you know, he was there, and, yeah, he was there.  And he would, and I would walk back, you know, with him.  He was one of my favorite, favorite dogs, yeah.  And that's--
Speaker 1: But how--
Speaker 2: That's when my close relationship with animals started.
Speaker 1: Right, but when did all the other--you had thirteen dogs?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, I had thirteen in the summer.  So, that one year, so my folks allowed me to, you know, have pets, and, you know, I can have a pet in the house.  And so my dogs, you know, a dog or dogs, only two were allowed in the house.  So they would sleep with me, usually at the foot of my bed, you know, and I'd go out and, you know, play with them, etc.  But what, one year, what happened was, well, actually, I only had four dogs at that time.  But I had a relative who had some dogs, and he passed on, and there were some bloodhounds, and so I wanted to take care of them.  Then one of my German Shepherds, she had puppies.  I wanted to take care, you know, of them.  And a couple others that came into the fold some way, and my folks, you know, they didn't restrict that at all, you know.  And they allowed me to take care of them until it started to eat away at their budget.  And so I had to go out and find a job to take care of 'em myself.
Story_ID: 26823
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so of the, one of my, you know, one of the things I really enjoyed, you know, a lot was, you know, on Sundays taking all the dogs out to an open field and just, you know, you had to do it on lease, and just take 'em out to an open field and just let 'em run, and, you know, it was just--I, I enjoyed, I enjoyed that a lot, you know.  And I looked forward, you know, to those Sunday afternoons of really taking the dogs out, you know, for that, you know, open field, you know, run.  And, in fact, it was that, you know, one of those days where I had this sort of chance encounter with Richard, Richard Price.  And that was a very defining moment for me, but we'll talk about that one a little bit later.  I'm sure you'll get to that question.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want, I, yeah, I do wanna get to that question.  But I wanna, so I just wanna understand also some chronologies because you, basically, you're born in 1955--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --and by 1957, you are, your grandparents [Sarah Johnson and Merlin Walker] have you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Beaumont, Texas.
Speaker 2: Well, two months after I was born.
Speaker 1: Two months, oh, no.
Speaker 2: Two months after I was born.
Speaker 1: So two months, so in 1955, you're, okay.
Speaker 2: So, in '55 [1955], yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so are you going summers back and forth at some point?  Well, after your memory, are you going back as early as when you were five to New Orleans [Louisiana] and--
Speaker 2: Yes, I can, I can remember going, you know, spending some summers back then.  So when I was New Orleans [Louisiana], I would either stay with my mother [Lucinda Antoine Lang] or stay with my sister.  My, my sister was thirteen years old, and she's a half-sister.  But she was thirteen years older than me.  But I would stay with her.  Some summers I would go and stay with my, my mother's father, my grandfather on my mother's side.  And he lived in Shreveport.  He was a very interesting man.  This was Edward Lang.  He was, he was a very disciplinarian type of individual, very strict kind of guy.  And so he and I clashed a bit, I guess, 'cause I was more, a little bit of a free spirit, you know, given a lot of freedom with my grandmother [Sarah Johnson] and step-grandfather [Merlin Walker] there.  So when I'd go and visit him, I didn't quite like that--those visits there with him because he was very, very strict.  But I didn't really appreciate him as much as I should have because, you yeah, I learned really, you know, after his death that he was one of the few African American sergeants in the U.S. Army.  And so I didn't realize how significant that was, etc.  But I would spend some summers over there, you know, with him.
Story_ID: 26824
Speaker 1: So, the school that you're attending, so what is your first school?  And what is the name of the first school you attended?
Speaker 2: The first school I went to was Blanchard Elementary--
Speaker 1: Blanchard Elementary [Beaumont, Texas].
Speaker 2: Um-hum, Blanchard Elementary.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so who's your favorite teacher at that school or do you remember even your first day of school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I remember that, yep.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Ooh, goodness.  Yeah, I remember the school.  I remember the classroom, the fact I can even pinpoint the classroom (laughter).  If I was brought back to school, I can actually pinpoint the classroom.  I know its exact location.
Speaker 1: What is its location?  What's the address?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know the address, but I can get us there, that, landmarks or whatever, I go by landmarks, but I can get us exactly there.  Yeah, I remember the first grade.  The first day was, it wasn't terrifying.  It was like what I was doing there, the new kids.  I didn't know them.  It was, it was a little bit, I wouldn't say upsetting.  It was just sort of a little bit disorienting.  I remember that, that feeling.  But eventually, I got to know it very well.  I felt very comfortable with it.  And, and I would, I remember, you know, walking there every day, and I would--I actually remember the--the first couple of months I would take a city bus from where I lived to the school and be dropped off there, and then take the bus back.  But actually, once I got very comfortable, you know, with it, I just walked.  I walked from there to school, which is actually about a two or three mile walk to there and then back.  So, yeah, so I remember about it.
Speaker 1: So did you have a favorite teacher there?
Speaker 2: There, actually, no.  I had a favorite nurse (laughter).  She was very nice.  She was, you know, very friendly, you know.  Unfortunately, I was a very sickly kid.  I had asthma, I suffered from asthma a lot.  And so, you know, I was always in the nurse's office from an asthma attack or whatever.  But she was actually, you know, very nice.  In fact, one of The HistoryMakers who you interviewed, [Albert] Thompson, a chemist down at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], it was his, his aunt.  So it's a little connected community.
Speaker 1: So you, so were you--did your asthma have you--you would have attacks.  Were you ever hospitalized with that?
Speaker 2: No, but I was in the doctor's office, you know, quite a bit--
Speaker 1: A lot.
Speaker 2: --a lot, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you went to Blanchard until what grade, until sixth grade?
Speaker 2: Till sixth grade, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I went to junior high school.  It was called Odom Junior High School.
Story_ID: 26825
Speaker 1: What is the young Joe Francisco like?  Are you an internal child?  Do you, you know, you're an only child, so are you living inside your head or, I mean what is the--I know you had a close relationship with your grandfather, and I'd like to ask more about that.  But I'm trying to understand what you're like?
Speaker 2: In--I don't quite, help me to understand--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) I mean are you rambunctious, are you, you know, are you mannerly, are you--I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --what you're thinking about?  Do you like sports?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh, I was more of an exploratory kind of kid.  You know, I had a lot of curiosity about things.  I, yeah, I was just more, more exploratory.
Speaker 1: So what are you exploring?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, maybe about, how many blocks from our house, one, two--two city blocks from our house was a railroad track that separated the white community and the black community.  And I knew I couldn't go into the white community, you know, for fear of what may happen.  But for me, you know, I found the railroad tracks, you know, rather fascinating.  I was always curious about the stuff that's been spilled over, you know, from the, the tanks coming from the refineries. You know, what was that stuff?  Thank God, I never did a taste test (laughter) on some of that stuff.  But I would, you know, pack it up in a little brown bag and bring it home and, you know, collect a lot of those things.  And then, you know, once I'd learned a little bit about a library and what information I could, you know, get from the library, then I was always curious about, you know, what did I just pick up and, you know, and stuff.  You know, that's an example.
Speaker 1: And you're what age at this point?  Are you--you're eight, nine?
Speaker 2: About eight or nine years old, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, and so what you're basically saying, and we find that, that what you're doing today was really formed back around that time, instinctively.
Speaker 2: Instinctively, yeah.  There're certain instinctive things that, you know, were manifesting itself.
Story_ID: 26826
Speaker 1: You know, one of the other things I, I wanted to do, I got an interest in model rockets.  And, you know, there was a hobby shop, and, you know, I went there to try to find out how to buy a model rocket to, you know, just to do that.  But, you know, I didn't have the money for that.  So I said, "Oh, okay, I don't have the money for it.  Well, how do I make my own?"  And so I went to the library to find out about rockets and how they're made, and, you know, how you can make your own.  And I found out what the basic ingredients were, and some of 'em, I didn't really know by the formal, chemical name, but I just kept searching and start to realize that a lot of basic ingredients, I can buy off the supermarket, you know, floor, without any adult supervision whatsoever.  And so, and then, you know, with some of the other ingredients, I had 'em in hand, off of the railroad tracks.  So I started making, you know, stuff, making gun powder, packing, you know, bamboo things to create a rocket, and folks allowed me to, you know, do that.  And it was kind of cool.  They just said, you know, do it outside so, you know, don't touch the house, and, you know, if you wanna blow yourself up, go ahead, you know.  But leave the house, and so I had that kind of flexibility to go out and experiment with that.  I got a little brave and wanted to make nitroglycerin and I found out what the basic ingredients of that and had some I couldn't get.  But I decided that I could make it myself.  And--
Speaker 2: So what were the ingredients you were using?
Speaker 1: Oh, I will not do that for the tape (laughter).  I, that I won't do for the tape.  But I found that out, and I actually started it.  And I remember an incident, I was--before my grandfather would go off for work, you know.  It was around six o'clock, when I had to take off for school, which is around seven, my grandmother would be asleep, there was a period of an hour that I can get on the stove and start to try to make stuff.  And I would do that, and I think one day, I sort of left the stuff cooking, and it exploded.  And when my grandmother got up, the kitchen was on fire.  And, and so when I got back home that day, it was very interesting.  So I said, "My God, what happened?"  So my grandmother said, "It's you and your experimentation.  And, you know, you nearly burned the house down."  I said, "Oh, you sure it was me?"  "Yes, it was your chemistry stuff."  And so I said, you know-- "But here's we're gonna (unclear) you do.  So we're gonna build a little, little thing for you out in the yard.  And so if you wanna go and experiment and blow up something, you can go do it in there, but not in the house."  So they restricted me from, you know, experimenting, doing the chemistry stuff in the house, but they allowed me--built me a little, a little shed kind of thing, just for one person, and I would just go off there and do things.
Speaker 2: But don't you think that's pretty amazing?  They allowed all that creativity to just, to percolate at a young age, but is-- are you still eight or nine or you're older at that point?
Speaker 1: Hmm?
Speaker 2: Are you still eight or nine at this point 'cause that's--
Speaker 1: That was, I was starting to be more about thirteen--
Speaker 2: Thirteen, okay.
Speaker 1: About thirteen, twelve, thirteen.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was before I actually started high school.  So, yeah, I started exploring all that before then.
Speaker 2: So all of this is really occurring outside of school--
Speaker 1: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 2: So, so you're not taking a science class or anything that--
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: --that is of interest to you--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --or have a science teacher that's opening up your world?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: What about your first chemistry set?  Do you have a first chemistry set?
Speaker 1: No, my sister felt that if she bought me a chemistry set, I would definitely blow the house up.  And so they got me some sort of biology thing to sort of, you know, explore with, which was really quite boring.  But if I--I got my first set, that was more of a little biological thing with microscopes and look at some insects and things of that sort.  That, that just wasn't of interest to me.  So, but I, if I wanted to do chemistry, I knew--all I had to do was go to the library.  I knew which books to turn to, and I could find out whatever I wanted, and I knew, you know, trade names, generic names and, you know, I can go to the supermarket and get whatever I want off the floor.  So I didn't have a problem there.
Speaker 2: So I wanna explore, I wanna go to the pharmaceutical--
Speaker 1: They've changed all that now (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, 'cause, right, you can't get all that stuff--
Speaker 1: You can't, you can't do all that.  You can't do all that, but, you know, yeah.
Speaker 2: So was the librarian, were they cultivating this interests, showing you--
Speaker 1: Nope.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were just, okay.  So--
Speaker 1: I was on my own.
Story_ID: 26827
Speaker 1: Let's explore, before I get away from this, I wanna explore your relationship with your grandfather [Merlin Walker] because it was a very close relationship.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a very good one, um-hum.
Speaker 1: So tell what things you, he taught you, what things, when you hear today, you, you know, it makes you think of him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, actually, so one of these I, that I remember even now with raising my own daughters, one of the things he would always tell me--and even with talking to, you know, his own kids, he would tell them never to really scream at your kids, really, don't scream at your kids, never to do that.  And, you know, I've really come to appreciate how difficult that is.  But at the same time too, how important, you know, he would always say, it's very important to talk to your kids.  And, you know, that's what, you know, we would do is certainly talk a lot.  I remember, you know, when he was working at the pipe company, well, the fun would be, is he would come in with his truck.  And I would just go with him and ride in the truck with him, you know, help him clean pipes, you know, and stuff.  I remember we, we also had enough land that we can do a little garden.  And during the fall and the spring, it was sort of a fun period, an activity, and I love to do, you know, with him, is spade the, you know, the ground to get ready for planting season for the fall and also for the spring.  We'd plant green beans, you know, the tomatoes, and, of course, one of my favorite things that we would plant yearly would be sugar cane.  And that's something I tried to introduce to my kids, sugar cane, give 'em a lesson where sugar comes from and introduce them to the taste of, you know, of that.  But, yeah, that was, those are activities that, you know, I really enjoyed, you know, doing, you know, with him.  So it was always doing something.  When I had all my chickens, you know, we needed a chicken coop, you know, for them.  And so he let me build it, and he helped me to show how to, helped me, you know, build it.  And then I decided to try to build one on my own, and that was sort of fun to have the chickens go up there and lay the eggs and stuff.  So, but we did a lot of, sort of hands on kind of stuff, you know, to, you know, together.
Story_ID: 26828
Speaker 1: So he's [step-grandfather Merlin Walker] a busy guy, though, because he's working at the pipe company--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum.
Speaker 1: --and then he, and then your--
Speaker 2: Then they come back and manage the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Then they come together, and you, and he and your grandmother [Sarah Johnson] are running this real estate--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and they have tenants and those--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --those types of issues.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And so you're saying that you have the job of helping keep the books--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --is that what you said?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Now, what age did that start?
Speaker 2: Ooh, so a little bit about, about my grandparents.  So, my grandmother only had a third grade education because then she got pulled out to work on the sugar cane farms out in, you know, Port Allen [Louisiana].  For him, he only had a second grade education.  He was then pulled out to work in the cotton fields.  And, and so, you know, for me, my role was to put all the mathematics that I learned, you know, together to really, you know, do the adding, subtracting and balancing the, you know, the books.  So, you know, that was, that was my, you know, my job.
Speaker 1: But was it your job at eight, eleven, thirteen?
Speaker 2: Well, let me see how far--
Speaker 1: Or are you--
Speaker 2: Ooh, that, when did that come in?  That, I think I was about ten, I was about ten when that, that role set in.
Speaker 1: Right, and so when do you start working at the pharmacy then?
Speaker 2: What or when?
Speaker 1: When.
Speaker 2: That was during junior high school, so I must have been about sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're about twelve then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did that-- I mean I know it was a local pharmacist.  He knew you and so, what are you learning there?  I mean what, was that attractive to you all of a sudden 'cause you're this--
Speaker 2: Well, what was attractive was I had my own money (laughter), you know.  What was unhappy about that was that most of that money went to buying dog food, and, you know, chicken feed, and rabbit food and all of that.  And so I guess that was the lesson my grandparents wanted to sort of teach me, that, you know, you make your money, you take care of your animals, and things of this sort.  But that was, that was okay.  But, you know, it was basically an afterschool thing.  I would go there, you know, take out the trash, sweep up the floors, and, you know, dust off things, whatever the pharmacist need a hand with, I would do that.  It was only two or three hours, you know, and, you know, at the end of the week, doing that every day, I'm making about twenty, twenty dollars, yeah, which for me at that time--
Speaker 1: That was a lot of money.
Speaker 2: That was a lot of money.  The pharmacist was really very generous.  But, you know, you know, I--I stepped up, and the pharmacist, you know, gave me more responsibility, you know, in time.
Speaker 1: And his name was Allen Fowler, right?
Speaker 2: Allen Fowler, yep.
Story_ID: 26829
Speaker 1: I read that he [Allen Fowler], he--you start learning how to make or you were intrigued or he taught you maybe how to make certain compounds?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, no.  So with Dr. Fowler, so I'll give you a little bit of the progression.  So I start as like the clean-up boy, and then I start to see that certain shelves, you know, for over-the-counter things, it didn't have a real order or a, or a pattern, you know, to it.  And I made some suggestions on, you know, how things could be reorganized for how people may wanna look at the--he took those suggestions to heart.  Then he gave me a little freedom to reorganize shelves for better presentation.  And then he also saw that I was also, you know, pretty good with, you know, customers and also managing money.  In fact, he taught me how to count money out.  I still remember this, and the order of money, the pattern of money, and, you know, how to count the money in the register, keeping track.  And I got down to, at the end of the day, I could manage my register and come within one cent, you know.  But the whole sense of the money management, you know, I learned from him.  He taught me a little bit of that.  Then as I went into high school, and he saw that I was doing well in chemistry, then I got to go in the back and assist him.  He allowed me to, he taught me the, the prescription terminology, how to read prescriptions.  I would actually take prescriptions from doctors over the phone, write them out.  He would authorize it.  He allowed me, under supervision, to fill prescriptions.  So, you know, under his supervision.  That, you know, working in the back with him, I also reorganized the filing system and tracking system of medications, you know, for him.  And, and was doing that.  I would take note of the, the contents of, you know, descriptions of medications, their molecular formulas, their pharmacology, you know, their side effects, and I would talk to him about these kinds of things.  So, and that's when some of the real chemistry stuff started to really, really hone in.
Speaker 1: So what was fascinating about that to you, that it sort of honed in, you know, that you're--
Speaker 2: Whoa, well, what was fascinating for me as I would see these formulas, and I knew what their, you know, basic, the molecular constituents were, I did not know how they were really put together.  I was just told that in a little more years of chemistry, I would learn a little bit about that.  What was fascinating for me was seeing these structures, and a lot of 'em showed now, remarkable similarity.  But they had very different effects when people took these medications.  And, and for me, you know, what I would witness were, you know, patients coming in, you know, I saw how sick they were, you know.  I would see a lot of the effects, you know, both, you know, the improvement effect, also side effects, that, you know, I could really relate that and pinpoint that back to, you know, the medication.  And I knew what the structure of the medication was.  And I always found that connection between what I saw as a formula, a chemical formula for something and the, the impact on the, on a person's health.  You know, it was just very fascinating and also very, very stark.
Speaker 1: So, and that's what I--so are you, you're talking about molecular structures.  But you, are you taking chemistry at this point in school?
Speaker 2: Well, when I actually started working--
Speaker 1: Or is he showing you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's showing me that.  That's why--
Speaker 1: He's showing you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then I started taking the chemistry at that point.  So I didn't to work in the back with him until I got into high school.
Speaker 1: Until you got in high school, okay.
Speaker 2: So I knew a little bit.
Story_ID: 26830
Speaker 1: I was asking how you ended up going to Forest Park [High School, Beaumont, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a little bit of that history.  Yeah, so Forest Park, oh, let me, let me try to retrace a little bit of that history, what triggered that.  What triggered me going to Forest Park was--there were really three things.  One, what I saw with that school, they always had one of the best music programs.  They were always, you know, placing very well in, in state competitions.  And, and they were also, you know, very, very good.  And I remember asking, "How can I go there?"  And the remark was, "Well, you can't go there.  It's a white school.  And, and it's really quite far away."  You know, it's not, it's in my school district which means I could go to it because actually what Texas had started experimenting with was freedom of choice.  So if a school was in your school district, you had the freedom of choice to go to that school.  Now, you had to get to that school somehow, but they didn't restrict you to go there.  But at Forest Park, there were only two African Americans.  And, so, you know, some people felt that, you know, could I, you know, really function in that school and do well in that school, you know, with all the white kids?  For me, I didn't think about, you know, that was never an issue for me.  I didn't think of them as, as, as superior, you know, or whatever.  I just saw that they had resources, and, and they had excellence.  And I just wanted to be, you know, part of that.  That was not necessarily being satisfied at the school, you know, that I was at, and I wanted to be part of that.
Speaker 1: So you applied?  Or you--
Speaker 2: No, we just had to tell them that, you know, that's where I wanted to be.  Now, the question was how to get me out there because it was actually ten miles from where I lived, and, you know, my grandfather [Merlin Walker] went to work at, you know, at, you know, six o'clock in the morning.  So the question was, how I was gonna get there.  So my grandparents, they actually--we had an African American, the first African American school board member, you know, for that district.  And they called him over and had a conversation with him.  And all I remember was, well, if I walked two miles down, you know, from the house to another school, there's a bus that would pick up some school kids from the local, the high school that was in my community.  And they would go and bus those kids over there to, you know, take courses that was not available at that school.  So I would just basically get on that bus and, and go out there.  So my grandparents, you know, opened that opportunity, you know, up, you know, for me.
Story_ID: 26831
Speaker 1: In terms of the Civil Rights [Movement], if asked what a defining moment was for me, what I remember was when Martin Luther King was assassinated, and I remember it was very quiet.  And, you know, the community was just like very few cars that were passing along this main street, just almost like a ghost town.  And I went outside, and I was gonna go down to the store down the street and by a, you know, a soda.  And I remember this white kid who was walking through the community, he was being chased out of the community.  You know, he only had to go two more blocks in order to get across the railroad tracks to be in his side of the town.  But, you know, some African American kids chased him out.  I felt real bad about that, but, you know, I think, and I realized, you know, people were angry, you know.  But I didn't quite know why he had to be chased out, you know, of, of the community.  And even though I know if I crossed over the railroad track, I would have that fear of being chased out, and because they did it, that didn't necessarily mean that we had to do that.  And that was my, you know, feeling and thought at the time.  You don't have to do unto others as others [have] done to you all the time.
Story_ID: 26832
Speaker 1: So high school at Forest Park [Beaumont, Texas], was it a hard experience, and are you--you're taking chemistry now, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: How was your first chemistry class?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was fun.  It was a lot of fun.  You know, Forest Park in the transition, it was not as, as difficult as I thought it would be.  You know, I think a lot of people had a sense and feeling that I would be a failure.  And that just didn't, that just didn't happen.
Speaker 1: When you say a lot of people, is that the teachers or people--who are "a lot of people"?
Speaker 2: Well, it's very interesting.  So people in my community thought, you know, back home in my community thought, "Wow, he's going to Forest Park, you know, probably, you know, the only African American kid there.  You know, he's gonna have to deal with, you know, low expectations, and will he, you know, do well?" And then, you know, the teachers at the school, you know, "Well, you know, he's coming from, you know, the African American community.  Does he have the kind of preparation that would be necessary for him to really compete and be successful, you know, here in our program?"  And so, you know, there were both, you know, both those expectations.  I didn't really think about those expectations.  You know, I didn't.  I just saw it as an opportunity, you know, do well, and, yeah, I saw resources.  And, in fact, I liked that they had no expectations.  And so that gave me a sense of, you know, freedom to define myself and do what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 26833
Speaker 1: Between your junior and senior year, you decide you're gonna compete in the science.  Was the competition science fair during the summer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, how did that start?  That was, yeah, that was my junior year.
Speaker 1: Your junior year--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was taking physics--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (simultaneous). Is that like-- Is that 1970, 70-something--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-one [1971] or '72' [1972].
Speaker 1: Two [1972], okay.
Speaker 2: That was, yeah, that was my junior year.  I was taking physics at that time.  And I also started taking Chemistry II, you know, at that time.  What I saw, well, so I had a cool physics teacher as well.  His name was Mr. Bartlett.  He actually had a, sort of a machine shop back at his house.  He was a helicopter pilot.  He worked on engines, very mechanical.  And he also, always opened his door in shop and open to kids who were interested in doing something.  Kids couldn't come out and hang out at his place and not do anything, but if you had some ideas and wanted to something, you can always do it as his house.  So, and I would get on my bike, and I would ride out to his house which was maybe about fifteen miles out from where I lived, but I would get on my bike in the morning, go out there, spend time at his place.  And in the evening, he would just sort of drive, put my bike in the back of the truck and drive me back, you know, back home.  And, and, but, yeah, I had an idea, you know, going to libraries, I thought, you know, it might be interesting to do a science project.  I didn't quite know what kind of science project I would do.  But the idea came by.  One day I was just hanging out on Lamar University's campus--
Speaker 1: Now, how far is Lamar University [Beaumont, Texas] from--
Speaker 2: From our house?
Speaker 1: --from your house?
Speaker 2: About, maybe five or six miles.  So I went on campus and, and I was going through the chemistry building.  I was looking at the blackboard.  And, and a guy came up to me, a white guy came up to me and said, "Well, what are you doing here?"  And I was telling that I was looking at the blackboard and was learning a little bit about chemistry and he got curious.  And I thought he was gonna say, "Well, you're not supposed to be on campus.  You know, you need to get out of the building.  You need to get out of the campus." But he didn't.  He said, "Why don't you come with me.  I'm gonna show you what I do." And his name was Dr. Eads, Edwin Eads.  He showed me an instrument called a gas chromatograph.  What he would do is take samples from, you know, the refineries, and his job was to separate and find out what was in those samples--you know, in those mixtures.  And he took a, a napkin, you know, a paper napkin, and he sketched out how the thing worked on the napkin.  And I asked him, could I keep it.  And he said, "Sure."  And at the end of the day, I spent maybe three hours with him.  He showed me how--everything, the inner workings of it.  So I decided to go to the library and learn a little bit about how it worked.  And then I decided I would, I could make my own.
Story_ID: 26834
Speaker 1: And so, I decided to get material from the junkyard.  So I went to the junkyard and looked for materials from the junkyard in old abandoned, you know, appliances and brought everything together and asked Mr. Bartlett if I can go to his place and, you know, construct it, and did it.  And I wanted to try to experiment a little bit in how to get the thing to work a bit.  And, of course, I had a little explosion (laughter), and, but I was not in the house this time.  I was in my little shack, you know, doing this.  But we worked it out and got it to, to work 'cause I was dealing with propane gas, as my carrier gas.  And I was injecting stuff in.  And then at the end, I used a little piece of copper wire, and that the different materials that would come off will burn through the copper wire with the propane.  But it would burn differently and give a different color.  And by looking at the color and monitoring the different intensity of the color, I can tell what was in the sample, you know, and how much was in the sample.  And so, you know, that I did from just basically, material from the junkyard and ten dollars.  So my chemistry teacher and physics teacher thought that was just so cool.  And so they had me to, you know, write it up and, and they entered it into a state-wide science fair competition, which I, you know, placed very, very well, and, and that just, well, that was the start of something big.
Speaker 2: So I'm just trying to also understand about who is influencing you.  So is--
Speaker 1: The community (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, I--well, the whole community is, but the community is a diverse community.  So is Dr. Eads, is he African American?
Speaker 1: No, he was white, yeah.
Speaker 2: He's white.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, but and your--
Speaker 1: And I only met him that once.
Speaker 2: You just met him that once?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, but he, did he know what you did with the--it's called chrom--
Speaker 1: Gas chromatograph.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I never went back to him.
Speaker 2: So he never knew that you did it?
Speaker 1: Well, no--maybe, maybe he did because it was in the newspapers and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: I see, okay.
Speaker 1: So, I'm sure he did.
Speaker 2: And you're also the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But he doesn't realize that it came from what he had scratched out--
Speaker 2: On the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --on the paper napkin.
Speaker 2: Right.  And then, so you just basically, he showed it to you that day, and then he sketched it out.  And then you went and did the rest by going and picking up these, you know--
Speaker 1: Well, I went and learned a little bit more about it, you know--
Speaker 2: You did, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  What was fascinating to you about this though?  What was its function?  I mean, you know, I know what--what was its function, the gas chrom--
Speaker 1: Chromatograph?
Speaker 2: Chromatograph.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the--oh, okay.  So the function of the grass--gas chromatograph was to really separate complex mixtures of chemicals.  And that was just, you know, just fascinating.  Why it was fascinating?  I don't know.  It just, I thought it was quite fascinating.  But for me, it was that, well, "I can do that," kind of spirit, you know, I can try it.  And I wanted to try it, and it was something I felt I could do.  And it was a really, a very expensive piece of equipment, but I could show that you can do it with materials from a junkyard and ten dollars.  You can do pretty much the same thing, yeah--not quite as sophisticated, but the basic functioning object could, could be made.  And I thought--
Speaker 2: So were you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --that was a little bit of a challenge and a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 26835
Speaker 1: Are you getting good grades in school?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  It depends on now, what period of time.  Before--
Speaker 1: I'm talking-- Go ahead.
Speaker 2: So before high school, no.  When I started high school, yes, and that, that turned around simply because after I met Dr. Richard Price in the chance meeting, and when he started talking about college and what you need for college and everything, and I started to realize--and the importance of grade, then I realized that I really needed to give, you know, attention, you know, to that.  So pre-high school, no, because I didn't know, I didn't--had no clue about how important it was or I had to really give attention to it.  Nope, didn't.  But, you know, after meeting with Dr. Price and, you know, learning, you know, about how important grades were in terms of college and what you can do in college and why it was important, then, you know, it became very meaningful, and grades were really good.
Speaker 1: So when do you meet Dr. Price?  Is it, do you meet Dr. Price--it's Richard Price, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: And do you meet him after you've had this, this sort of, you know, the winning of the--
Speaker 2: No, that was before.
Speaker 1: It's before, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that was going into high school.
Speaker 1: So you're going into high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: You went into high school in tenth grade?  Or you went into high school in ninth grade?
Speaker 2: I went into high, well, I went into Forest Park in the tenth grade.
Speaker 1: In the tenth grade, okay.
Speaker 2: So I met him at around ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how do you meet him?  Did (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That was a chance meeting.  He was walking, you know, he had just moved back to the area and become a professor at Lamar University [Beaumont, Texas] in the mathematics department.  And he was just reacquainting himself with the community.  So he was walking, you know, from, yeah, I think he was walking from church or some place.  But he was going back to his mom's house, and he had actually just stopped in front of our house and was looking at a map.  And I was just coming out from eating, sort of lunch.  And I walked out the door, and I saw this guy looking at a map.  And I went over, you know, and just curious if he needed a little help, you know, because I knew the community back and forward and offered--and he told me where he was going.  And I knew exactly where he was going.  So I said, "Well, look, I'll show you, you know, how to get there.  I'll walk you there."  So I just walked him, you know, over to where he was going and struck up a conversation, never seen him before, and, you know, and curious of who he was and what he was doing.  And, and in that conversation, he was curious about me and where I was in school and what I was doing, what my ambitions were.  And so I spent, good grief, a good five or six hours, you know, that day, you know, with him.
Story_ID: 26836
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had talked for about five or six hours that day, you know, about, you know, just a range of topics of education and what my interests and what my thinking and where I was thinking about going.  I hadn't really thought about it.  He [Dr. Richard Price] opened my eyes to what the possibilities were, but those possibilities would, would not really make itself apparent unless I, you know, did well in school.  And I remember he was getting ready to go off on sabbatical to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  He was gonna go to Yale and work on a divinity degree, take some time off from Lamar [University, Beaufort, Texas] and work on a divinity degree and then return.  And he said, "Well, you know, stay in touch with me, you know, here's my address.  Write me and tell me how you're doing." Sort of like a pen pal, you know, kind of thing.  I would write to him, send him my grades and he would, you know, give me some feedback, and so he was very, very encouraging and very mentoring.
Speaker 2: So he-- did he ever tell you what he saw in you that day?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: You never had that discussion?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I see, okay.
Speaker 1: I've never really cared what people saw in me (laughter).
Speaker 2: But he--
Speaker 1: And I still don't (laughter).
Speaker 2: Of course, you do.  I mean but he obviously did see something in you--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, he must have, yeah, yeah, because he--actually, he's been a real, he's been a real good man.  And what I mean by that, he's been there, you know, for me in some real critical times.  I remember one of the things I could do, you know, with him after school, if I wanted to go, I would get on my bike and go to Lamar.  He would introduce me to some mathematics, and I could get on his board and work out a problem.  He would give me a problem.  I would work that problem.  He would tell me if it was correct, what the steps were.  I really enjoyed, you know, that.  And he would always give me a different math book and to, you know, if something I saw that I was interested in, if he felt I could do or read, he would, you know, give that, you know, to me.  When my grandfather [Merlin Walker] was sick, and really was dying, I remember we were at the hospital.  My grandmother [Sarah Johnson] was there.  She was not doing well coping with the fact that he was dying.  And I, you know, when he passed away, I had to be there to tell her, you know, what happened, and etc.  And I had to make it back home somehow.  I couldn't drive.  She was in no shape to drive.  So I called him, and, you know, he and his wife came over and they really, you know, helped me, you know, through that.  They helped me go through the funeral preparations.  You know, they were there, again at the funeral.  When my grandmother died, you know, they were there, you know, helping me, you know, through that.  When I graduated, you know, from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you know, he was there, you know, as well.  So he's, he's been there, you know, real, real critical, you know, points, there for me.
Speaker 2: You know, so he was a true mentor.  So I had read though that he also told you what you needed to fill in, in terms of your science education?
Speaker 1: Yes, that's exactly right.
Speaker 2: So can we talk a little bit about that?  What was he telling you that you needed to do, besides get your grades up?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, he was giving me some sense of the kinds of courses I needed to take, you know, the mathematics I needed.  He felt that if I was gonna do science, I really had to have a strong foundation in mathematics and problem solving.  You know, he really wanted to make sure that that was really grounded.  He knew I also had an interest in chemistry, you know, as well.  He wanted me to make sure I really explored, explored that.  So, he didn't--he was kind of this very, very encouraging, very directing, but not--not very heavy handed.
Speaker 2: So did you--so during this period of time, now, I know on the science fair, you, didn't you win first prize?
Speaker 1: I came in second.
Speaker 2: Second prize.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But also, was it third in the state?
Speaker 1: Yes, third in the state.
Speaker 2: Okay, third in state.
Speaker 1: Well, actually--well, sorry.
Speaker 2: Okay, (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was first prize--
Speaker 2: That's what I thought--
Speaker 1: --in the district, but then when I went to state, I came in third.
Speaker 2: You came in third.  That's what I read, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hum.
Story_ID: 26837
Speaker 1: What about John Flannery?  Was John Flannery your--
Speaker 2: He was a student, well, he was a student-teacher at the high school [Forest Park High School, Beaumont, Texas].  And John was actually very good.  He was a-- he really helped me a lot with getting down on paper how I did stuff.  I hated writing, I really hated writing.  I still hate writing, even though I've published five hundred papers, I still hate writing.  And, but he was the one who really helped me a lot to organize my thoughts, you know, how to put those thoughts down on paper, how to organize it.  And, and he really also helped me to really see where gaps in things I had tried and what I could go back and try to do and encouraged me to, to do a, you know, a lot of that.
Speaker 1: So what were your gaps?  That's what I keep hearing about, sort of filling in the pieces.  But what gaps did he sort of see--
Speaker 2: Well, certain experiments, you know, that--and maybe certain conditions to run the experiments.  Remember, I'm not a professional scientist at that point.  And, you know, he was actually working on his master's degree.  So he saw a lot of those things that, you know, as a, you know, as a kid, I didn't really, really see.  But those were really key to helping me to see how things connect with experiments, in what I was doing and how to look at data because that was the first time I really had to think about data and what data was saying.  And he sort of helped me to see that and what data was showing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so are you doing well in your classes then?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So what grades are you getting?
Speaker 2: "A's" and "B's."
Speaker 1: "A's" and "B's," okay.  Okay, so, so did the other black student do as well as you, and were they in another--were they in science as well?
Speaker 2: No. No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was just you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So your experience in Forest Park High School was a very positive one for all--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was very, very positive.  It was very, very positive.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26838
Speaker 1: When it comes time to think about college, what are you thinking or what are people advising you?
Speaker 2: Well, so even though I had a guidance counselor, I never talked to the guidance counselor.  I never did.  So I didn't get any counseling.  Of course, you know, my grandparents didn't know anything about college and so I didn't, I didn't really know.  So actually, what I remember was my physics teacher asking my parents, grandparents' permission to take me to a visit to Texas A & M [College Station, Texas], and that was my first college visit.  And that was my physics teacher.  I went along with he and his wife, got to go to Texas A and M, see the campus, see what life was like, and, you know, what college was like, what dorm was like.  It was kind of interesting, and cool.  And that was the first time, you know, I had really started to think about college, but I had never applied.  And I didn't think about applying.  I didn't know how to apply.  I didn't know what the process was.  So what was very, you know, very, very interesting, was I remembered this distinctly, in the spring, a lot of my classmates were getting their acceptance notices from various colleges, and I thought, "Oh, wow, they're going to college."  And I hadn't even applied.  And I didn't know what I was gonna do.  I didn't know where I was gonna go.  I didn't know, and I started thinking, well, maybe I could go to Lamar [University], and, you know, I just didn't have a clue.
Story_ID: 26839
Speaker 1: We're at-- having lunch, and I said, "Well, I'm gonna be finishing high school very soon.  And, you know, I should start thinking about college, and, you know, do we have any money?"  And they [Francisco's grandparents, Merlin Walker and Sarah Johnson] said, "Well, you know, no."  And so, well, you know, "How are we gonna work this?"  And, and, you know, their feeling was, "You know, son, it'll work itself out."  And I said, "Well, that's good.  It'll work itself out, but I don't see how it's gonna work out, you know, quickly."  And I remember, they said, "Well, let's just go work in the garden a little bit."  And I said, "What?  Go work in the garden?  How's that (laughter), how's that helping me to figure out if I'm gonna go to college?"  So they got up and decided to go work in the garden a little bit, and I think they really wanted some time to think about how they were gonna really help and make, make this happen.  And just as I was about to go out and talk to them, the phone rang, and there was this professor from the University of Texas at Austin whose, his name was Thomas Edgar, I believe, it was.  He was a professor in chemical engineering.  He said, well, I'd been admitted to the University of Texas, and I said, "Oh, this is great."  And he said, "Well, you know, would you like to come?"  And I said, "Well, where is it?"  And he said, "Austin, Texas."  I said, "Well, where is Austin?" You know.  So he said, "Well-" I said, "Well, look, where is it relative to Beaumont?  How many miles is it from Beaumont?" He said, "It's about, you know, about a three or four-hour drive from Beaumont."  I said, "This is great, you know, because it'll take my grandparents a while to get there, and so, you know, and give me a chance to clean, and, you know, or get rid of the stuff or whatever."  And so, he said, "Well, look, you know, are you doing anything over the summer?"  He said, "We'll pay for you to come over in the summer, give you a little scholarship to start over the summer."  And I didn't have a clue of what I was gonna do over the summer, so I said, "Sure, I'll start."  So, I just said, "Yeah."  I had no clue where the university, if it was good or whatever.  Now, I had never applied to the University of Texas.  I had never applied to the school.  I had never applied to any college.  It was my physics teacher and chemistry teacher, you know, working with my grandparents that had applied, you know, for me.  Yeah, yep.
Speaker 2: So what--
Speaker 1: Now, that's not--you're not gonna find that on paper anywhere, but--
Speaker 2: I know, but it's--
Speaker 1: But, yeah.
Speaker 2: So what, what-- where does Raymond Davis come in because--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So Ray was, so when I started the University of Texas--
Speaker 2: So you get in?
Speaker 1: I get in, yep, I start the summer--
Speaker 2: And then you go in, and then you--
Speaker 1: --in the summer.
Speaker 2: You start in the summer program?
Speaker 1: Yep, um-hum.
Speaker 2: Did they have a, back then, did they have special programs for minorities or--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, no, in fact, the thought was I, if I started early, I would--well, okay, so the University of Texas is very complex.  Its history is very complex.  So let me back up a little bit, etc.  So University of Texas has always been a school that has resisted admitting African Americans to that school.  It's had that history.  Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas], Prairie View [A & M University, Prairie View, Texas], a lot of the African American schools that were started in Texas were started in order to provide programs that African Americans take, you know, at, you know, at those schools.  And then you have to go to University of Texas.  Now, the only way you can go to the University of Texas is if those schools didn't, had a program that you wanted--they didn't have that program.  And that was the only place where you can go.  But in the '70 [1970s], they decided to try a grand experiment of admitting, you know, African Americans, you know, in the top 10 percent of their class, you know, to the university.  The grand experiment with that was that they were not supposed to do very well because this was the University of Texas, and they're coming from schools that didn't have quite the preparation for them.  They were not gonna, you know, do very well.  And I was one of the first fifty students, you know, to be admitted, you know, during that grand experiment.  And so that's one of the reasons why they wanted me to start early, that, you know, I would use the summertime to get acclimated to the environment, start, get some confidence, and, you know, and transition nicely, you know, for the fall.  But I didn't know all of that, you know.  For me, what I saw was an opportunity.  You know, I had a scholarship.  I had money, you know, I was in the college.  I didn't even know where the place was, but I just saw that as my opportunity.  I didn't know all the kind of history, nor did it really matter to me.  I just saw it as the opportunity.
Story_ID: 26840
Speaker 1: So, but I start in that summer.  I took chemistry.  And that was with Ray Davis [Dr. Raymond Davis].  He was the chemistry teacher, you know, at that time.  And now, one of the reasons, what I liked about University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas] was that it had very large classes.  So as people were telling me all of the kind of, you know, racial problems, that the university had with teachers, I said, "Well, you know, because it had large classes, I could be a social security number.  So it really wouldn't matter."  So my goal was to be in large classes, not small classes where I could be identified any kind of way.  And so Ray's class, his chemistry class was like about three hundred students.  And that really fit my criteria.  And so I liked the class because you could just walk in it.  He didn't know who you were.  I would not sit in the front 'cause I didn't wanna know--him to know me.  I didn't sit in the back either.  I always sat somewhere in the, in the middle.  But one day I went to go and collect my exam, and he was there.  He had passed out the exam.  He announced to the class that, you know, the exams were graded and, you know, they were in the boxes.  So I went there to pick up my exam, and he was actually collecting the exams back.  And so he said, "I guess you're here for your exam?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "Well, I'm collecting exams.  I have to do a re-grade, but it's not gonna change your grade."  And I thought, "Now, wait a minute (laughter).  What does he mean by it's not gonna change, you know, my grade?  You know, he, he doesn't know I am.  He shouldn't know who I am, and, and was it really being directed at me, he's not gonna change my grade?"  Now, that, that troubled me quite a bit because, you know, in my book, he was not supposed to know me.  I didn't go and make myself known.  What I wanted to do was just go in and take, learn something from his class, do well in chemistry, take good notes, do well on my exams and, you know, go on and do my own thing.  But it turned out that he did know who I was, and the reason why, you know, it wouldn't change my grade was because it was my exam that, that spotted the error (laughter).  And, and so my exam forced a whole class re-grade.  And so he asked the TAs [teaching assistants], "Who was this guy?"  And they pointed him who I was.
Speaker 2: So can you talk about that a little bit more.  And before you go to Ray--'cause Ray Davis was, he was a very popular teacher, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, he was very popular, um-hum.
Speaker 2: He was a very popular teacher.  But I wanna make sure, now, you're physics and chemistry teacher, their names again, where you said--
Speaker 1: My chemistry teacher's name was Irene McKnight, and my physics teacher, Dr. Bartlett.  I can't remember his first name.
Speaker 2: Dr. Bartlett.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Bartlett, um-hum.
Speaker 2: So you, so what are you-what, what error?  I mean because you talk about it, but what error are you--
Speaker 1: What do you mean error?
Speaker 2: You said that, you said--what did you say that?
Speaker 1: Error.
Speaker 2: Error.
Speaker 1: Yeah, error, yeah--
Speaker 2: That's what I said.
Speaker 1: --on his exam, oh, okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) That's what I said, well, what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I was thinking E-A--E-R-A, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: No, I meant E-R-R-O-R.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So what error that was on the exam?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, that, that, I don't remember.  In fact, I didn't really pay much attention to it.  You know, he, he--
Speaker 2: Well, wait a minute.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: So you're taking the exam.  You point something out in the exam?
Speaker 1: No, I don't.  No, they collect all the exams, and they grade it, you know, and the TAs grade it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, and they record the grade and puts it back in the box.  But apparently, when grading my exam, they, they noticed, you know, that my answer was very different than everyone, I guess the TA looked carefully at what I did and then realized that I had done it correctly and that my answer was the correct answer.  And so, what they had thought was the answer on their key was not, not the correct--
Speaker 2: Answer.
Speaker 1: Answer, yeah.
Speaker 2: I see, okay.
Speaker 1: And that forced the whole class, you know, re-grade, all three hundred.
Speaker 2: So, is this--this is the first exam that he does or is this--
Speaker 1: I think that was more, I think it was the second exam.  It was the second exam.  It was, yeah.
Speaker 2: So he got to know you at that point, or you became known to him and the TAs.
Speaker 1: Well, I became known to him.  I did not make any effort to know a teacher.  I did not want to know teachers.  I just wanted to learn from them, do well and, and that was it.
Story_ID: 26841
Speaker 1: You came into the University of Austin-- Texas, Austin [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], with "As" in math, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, "As" in math, and chemistry too or physics?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had--what was your grade point average in high school?
Speaker 2: They didn't do grade-point averages.  No, they did, did like 80 point something or 90, you know, etc.  Mine was 90.1.
Speaker 1: And so is this part, so the first year, you're taking entry-level courses then?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so what is your experience?  Are you part of, you know, or do you join--are there any science or math class that you join or have--when do you declare a major?  I'm just trying to--
Speaker 2: Well, so I came in the chemical engineering program--
Speaker 1: So you had come in at--you decided, you had to declare at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, I was coming in on an engineering--
Speaker 1: A scholarship.
Speaker 2: --scholarship, um-hum, to do chemical engineering.  So I was in the chemical engineering program.
Speaker 1: So what was the structure of that program then?
Speaker 2: I, I don't really--
Speaker 1: Remember?
Speaker 2: --remember any--about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, no problem.  Okay.  So, can you tell me what was significant about your college experience?  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so let me, let me just finish the story with Ray [Dr. Raymond Davis]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, toward the end of the class, again, I never went up to Ray to talk to him or learn anything about him or what he did.  But I remember after, toward the end of the class, he said, "I'd like to see Joe Francisco, you know, afterschool".  And I thought, [panicked breathing sound], "Oh, my God.  I didn't cheat, you know, 'cause, you know, 'cause why does he wanna talk to me, you know?"  It had to be something awful.  And one, he should know anything about me.  And, but I remember the first reaction was, "I did not cheat, you know."  And so he said, "Well, you know, look, Joe, I want you to come and talk to me, you know, once the class is finished.  I really want to, you know, just chat with you for a few minutes."  So, and after the final exam, I made an appointment to go and talk to him, and went to him, and--to his office.  And he said, "Look, I wanna tell you some stuff that I do, and work that I do."  And he started to describe research that he did using x-ray crystallography.  He took me to his lab and showed me the instrument and went through description of how it could be done.  And then he took me in his lab and showed the, from that instrument, data from that instrument, how he developed these 3-D images of molecules, you know, in space and I just thought that was just so cool and fun.  So he said, "Well, how would you like to work for me?"  And I said, "Yeah, sure."  And so he gave me a key to the building, chemistry building and he gave me a key to the lab, and he--I had, showed me my own desk.  And I thought that was just the coolest thing.  How many freshmen have a key to a building, an office and have their own desk.  I was in, shared an office with postdocs and graduate students and that was just, just so cool, and, and, you know, and fun.
Story_ID: 26842
Speaker 1: And that turned out to be very timely too because I had an interesting roommate who, it was, it was very interesting.  I remember when I walked into the room, you know, the room, your beds--each, each had a bed that was sort of against the wall, but the beds were, you know, you had to face each other.  And I had moved in.  I hadn't seen him, and, you know, and I remember he had moved in.  And I was off registering.  And when I got back into the room and he saw who I was, yeah, he, it was, it was like oil and water, it didn't mix.  Part of the problem was, you know, he had his Confederate bedspread, his Confederate pillow, his Confederate flag, his Confederate rug, his Confederate uniform, and I thought, "Oh, my God.  Okay, well, how are we gonna manage this one?"  But it was interesting.  So I went, I remember leaving going to the housing and said, you know, "Maybe you guys made a mistake here, and is there a possibility of changing?"  And they said, "No, you can't.  The only way you can change is for you to decide--if you pay for the whole room yourself, and he can go off and-" And I just didn't have the money to do that.  And so they said, "You just have to stick this out."  And I thought, okay, but when I got back, what he had done was pull the bed from the wall and turned it around where the back would face me so he didn't have to see me, which was, you know, very interesting.  But it didn't matter because one, I had a key to the chemistry building.  I had a key to the office.  I had my own desk, so I didn't have to worry about really living in that room with him.  So I had my own space where I can study and not be distracted and influenced or discouraged or having to deal with that kind of drama.  I would go in and just, go to sleep, take my showers and then go off and do my classes each day, you know, in the, in the office.  So, and that was something that he had issues, you know, to really deal with, you know.  So, but that was his problem.
Speaker 2: You were there, you were his roommate the whole year?
Speaker 1: I was, he could only take me for one semester.  So he decided that he would, he just couldn't deal with it.  He would pay for the room, so I had a room for myself.
Story_ID: 26843
Speaker 1: I wanna go to the lab.  So what is this, because this is really your first exposure to a lab?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so can you describe what that was like?
Speaker 2: The environment was like?
Speaker 1: The environment, the structure, the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so Ray [Dr. Raymond Davis] was, Ray was cool.  So Ray, it turns out that he didn't take very many undergraduates in this lab.  He only had maybe about four or five undergraduates in this lab.  I didn't realize that either, but he opened that door and gave me that opportunity.  Well, what was important about that was so much solving the structure, you know.  But that was kind of fun, cool and learning how to do that.  For me it was, the interesting fun about that was learning a lot about the mathematics and the theory behind which I found cool.  And that became motivation for structured courses that I would take, that I felt would be very important for my background.  But what was important about the experience was being in there with the graduate students and the postdocs, hearing them talk about the science, hearing them talk about graduate school, hearing them talk about, you know, the research, hearing them talk about, you know, career opportunities, and so that really was the most important aspect about being in there because by time I got in my sophomore year, I had already decided that I was gonna go to graduate school, and I think that decision was really nurtured by being in that laboratory.
Speaker 1: So, so what--[Off camera comment:  Is there something you wanna say?  Okay, sorry.]  Right. So I have, so I wanna understand though about what are you learning about his research and its applicability with x-ray crystallography?  What are you learning about the applicability and what, what questions are you seeking to--is he trying to answer in that lab?
Speaker 2: So he would get a crystal structure of a new compound, and the question was, how did it--how were the atoms in that molecule constructed?  What was their shape?  What was the arrangement of atoms?  And so, by doing, you know, x-ray diffraction, you know, by looking at how the atoms scattering, you know, the x-rays, and by measuring the scattered x-rays, various angles, position in space, one can back out, you know, positions of atoms and how those atoms actually were involved in that scattering process.  And then you can take maps of that scattering and then back out positions of atoms in space.  And there's some mathematics behind how you do all of that.  I was introduced to that mathematic--those mathematics.  I was also introduced to computers and the computing programs, and how to, you know, submit jobs and, and do that on the university's mainframe.
Speaker 1: Because computers are coming into use.
Speaker 2: Computers are coming into use, and the University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas] had one of the biggest and fastest computers.  And not many undergraduates had access to that.  I had access to that as a freshman.  And, but, you know, that was kind of, kind of cool and fun.
Speaker 1: Okay, what class--you also mentioned that being there sort of changed--not changed, but helped you decide on certain courses to take.  I was just wondering what some of those courses were then?
Speaker 2: So, when, in getting behind, getting to the mathematics of analyzing the x-ray diffraction patterns, you have to use tensor algebra, and I got intrigued by the tensor algebra.  And so, you know, I wanted to learn a little bit about that, and courses that I need to do that.  And so, that was actually a graduate course, and I actually took that graduate course in my sophomore year, the second semester of my sophomore year, which I remember Ray thought, you know, "Should you be doing that?  Is this the right thing to do?  Are you way over your head in doing it?"  But, you know, I saw it was important, and I learned a lot, and it was really kind of fun, and cool.  It was a lot of hard work, but it was, it was really, really good.  And it was the very foundation of me helping to understand a lot of the theory behind, you know, x-ray, you know, diffraction. But it turned out to be really foundational for, you know, work, that I was gonna do at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: So can you talk about that, how--just expound a little bit more about that, why that was foundational for the work at MIT?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so at MIT--
Speaker 1: We're not gonna get to MIT yet, but I mean I just wanna know why it was foundational?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so at MIT I started to do work on lasers.  And that's again, radiation, and I'm looking at now how molecules interact with lasers and trying to look at the physics behind that.  And so a lot of that fundamental mathematics behind that having to do, you know, with molecular motions and structures and space, you know, as well, so a lot of that foundational mathematics, rests in tensor, you know, algebra.

Speaker 1: The summer of your sophomore, I think between sophomore and junior year, you--
Speaker 2: Came up to Argonne National Laboratory [Lemont, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that and, I mean so you're sort of--first of all, you're a rising star, sort of--within a--I know you don't like to position yourself that way.
Speaker 2: I, I, no, yeah, no, and I didn't see it that way then.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, okay, but are you doing well--let me put it this way, you're doing well, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm doing very well, yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how do you get this, how is it--I mean is it something you apply for and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, let me see how, I don't remember exactly.  So at Argonne National Laboratory, there was, you know, they had a big neutron reactor.  And instead of doing, and instead of doing x-ray, they were doing neutron diffraction studies.  Now, the cool thing about neutron diffraction studies, the neutrons, if you had very light atoms, you know, and you scattered neutrons off of that, you can see that scattering better.  Light atoms didn't really scatter x-ray radiation very well.  Like, for instance, hydrogen.  So in the structures I was doing in Ray's [Dr. Raymond Davis] laboratory, if they had hydrogens, it was kind of hard really pinpointing, you know, where the hydrogens were located.  But if you go off and do neutron diffraction work, you can really get more exact locations of that.  And you could only do that at Argonne National Laboratory.  And I thought it might be cool to, you know, do that.  And Ray made that happen.  He thought it'd be good for me to go off and get a little bit of experience with that.  Now, he thought that was a good experience to get from another dimension.  Yeah, I'd never been out of Texas, except going to New Orleans [Louisiana].  And so he thought, you know, taking young Texans and exposing 'em to, you know, different environment, outside the state, was a good and healthy thing.  So he encouraged me to apply.  He wrote a good letter of recommendation and I got selected to be part of the class.  Normally, it had graduating, you know, seniors and some, you know, senior, you know, juniors.  But I was as sophomore that had gotten selected to do that.  So that was pretty special.  But it was also special, that was back in 1975, it was my first time taking the airplane trip.  My first time on the airplane, which I thought was really, really cool.  But unfortunately, I didn't have enough money to pay for an airline ticket.  So I had to go and work and find a job to work to make some money to pay for the airline ticket.
Story_ID: 26845
Speaker 1: So I had to find a job to work to, to pay for an airline ticket.  And who would wanna hire somebody, you know, to work for about three or four weeks rather than the whole summer.  But I actually, just went around asking, you know, I went to Sear and Roebucks.  I went to J.C. Penny's, I went, you know, every place.  And Sears and Roebuck decided to, you know, I guess they said, "Well, we'll help the kid out."  And they gave me a little job cleaning air conditioners, and so I had to go and clean air conditioners.  I did that and made enough money to buy an airline ticket.  But I remember that experience was, I had to go over to Vidor, Texas.  Vidor is where, sort of [Ku Klux] Klan headquarters in Texas.  And I remember I had to, we had to go and clean air conditioning over there.  And I was just, "Oh, no, I can't go, I can't go there."  I kept telling the guy who I was working with, "I can't go there."  And he said, "It's okay, you can go there.  I'll be there."  I really shouldn't be in Vidor, Texas.  I may get shot, I may get lynched, you know, I really wanna go to Chicago [Illinois], and I said, "Look, we're gonna go and do this job.  We're gonna get our, do our job and then, and get out."  So I remember we got there, and I had to get out and go knock on the door.  And the person just wouldn't come out as long as I knocked on the door.  And, you know, the guy saw that the person was looking out.  And he got a little worried.  So he said, "Joe, come back and sit in the truck." And he went and knocked, and the person came out and said what the air conditioning needed to do.  And so he came back to the truck, told me what I needed to do.  He kept the other person occupied, and got them back in the house so we can go and clean up the air conditioner and, and did the job, and then walked out.  So that was the first time that I actually set foot in Vidor, Texas and had, you know, that was, was a troubling, you know, moment.  But, you know, hey, they felt I did a good job, very professional, got the job done, made the money, got the airline ticket and came up to, to Chicago.  You know, my first plane trip, and that was kind of cool.
Speaker 2: So, so Argonne, I mean it's very--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --it's a very prestigious place, filled with scientists.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And what was the structure of the program?  How many students--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there were about, maybe twenty-five of us from all over the country.  We stayed in Naperville [Illinois].  I guess place was, the little college, there was a little college there, Seaton--
Speaker 2: Wheaton?
Speaker 1: Wheaton.
Speaker 2: Wheaton College [Wheaton, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Wheaton College, stayed there on campus there.  And, and we had roommates.  There was a bus that would come and pick us up and drive us to the site, and we'd do our work and then come back.  And my roommate, he was actually from University of Minnesota [Twin Cities, St. Paul, Minnesota].  His name is Gary Brudvig.  He's now on the faculty at Yale [University, New Haven Connecticut].  In fact, he's the chair of the department at Yale right now.  [cough] And so we were roommates there.
Story_ID: 26846
Speaker 1: Did you get to build up your research in Dr. Davis' lab or was--were you there the whole four--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  So what Ray [Dr. Raymond Davis] did, he would pick out, you know, he would identify what freshman that he wanted in his laboratory.  He handpicked out of, you know, eight hundred kids, you know, that he would teach a year, you know, one or two that he would invite into his labs, usually one.  And that was just to get them started.  He wanted to really just introduce you to, you know, research.  He wanted you to have fun.  Also, it's really too about teaching a work ethnic as well, of research, methodology.  It was, you know, he had, he had a method to what he wanted to do.  But he did not encourage students to stay in this lab the whole four years.  In fact, he encouraged me, one--he was the one who encouraged me to go to Argonne [National Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois] and get some experience there.  When I came back, he encouraged me to go and think of some other research, you know, opportunities.  He wanted me to see different viewpoints, how people, you know, looked at problems, how they solved problems.  They're not--you don't solve problems all the same way.  And he wanted me to really experience that.  So it wasn't really to provide graduate training at the undergraduate level, but really more of an introduction to, you know, the research and to build, you know, an excitement and an interest.  If you weren't interested in it, he wanted you to discover that as well and use the experience and the time wisely that I had at University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas], to find what was it that really was, you know, of interest for me.
Speaker 1: So you're, so after your sophomore year, you come back, and so what are the next two years like for you in terms of your academic training, and what are you doing during the summers?
Speaker 2: Well, the next two years was, I decide to switch areas a little bit and learn a little bit of inorganic chemistry.  So I did some undergraduate work with Joe Lagowski [Dr. Joseph Lagowski].  He was an inorganic chemist, you know, as well.  And he was a very interesting man.  What Joe was very interested in, you know, with his students was how you thought about things.  He was really, he didn't care so much about the results, you know.  He was curious about how you came to that result, you know, "What was your thinking?"  So I, what I really enjoyed about working with Joe was he would sit down with me, and whenever I came up with some and accomplished something, he wanted--he always wanted to know, "How did I get to that point?  What did I do?  What was my thinking?  What was I was, (unclear)?"  And so a lot of the conversations, you know, with him was, you know, "How do you get to that?  What did you do?  How did that idea come about?  You know, what was the, the genesis of that idea?"  So I did, you know, undergrad research with him.  I stayed there during the year and also during the summers with him.
Story_ID: 26847
Speaker 1: Came down to my senior year, I knew I was gonna go to grad school, and so the question was where I was gonna go.  I wanted to stay in Texas, and one of the reasons why I wanted to stay in Texas, I wanted to be close to my grandparents because, you know, health, you know, I was concerned about that.  And someone needed to be close by to assist them.  But all my professors at U-T Austin [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] felt that, that was something that the--that was not going to happen.  So I remember being called in by Ray and Joe Lagowski, and asking the question, "Where are you gonna go to grad school?  Are you thinking about grad school?"  The answer was yes.  "Well, where are you gonna go?"  And I said, "Well, I was gonna stay at U-T Austin, you know, things were going well."  They said, "No, you're, we're not gonna allow you to stay even though we admit you, it's not gonna happen."  So they said, "Where else are you thinking?"  I said, "Well, I'll go to Rice University [Houston, Texas]." And they said, "Nope, that's not gonna happen either.  We want you to leave the state of Texas and go elsewhere."  And I didn't have a clue where, so they gave me some guidance of, you know, some people to start looking into, some universities to start looking into.  They asked me again, what was my thinking?  I said, "Well, University of Wisconsin [Madison, Wisconsin] looks pretty good, you know."  And, and so there was a faculty member--chair of department who was, at Wisconsin, who would come down to visit the University of Texas.  So they had arranged for me to talk to him to find out about the University of Wisconsin, the graduate school, you know, what it'd be like, you know, and is that really a right fit for me?  And I remember having the conversation, you know, with this professor.  And at the end of the conversation, you know, well, toward the end, he asked me, you know, one question.  "Who are you interested in working with?"  And I told him the two individuals.  And he said, "Well, I don't recommend that you work with either of them.  And so Wisconsin is really not the best place for you."  And I felt really bad 'cause I'd done a lot of work, and that seemed like a great place.  And here was the chair of the department saying, "Don't go there."  So I asked him, you know, "Where should I be looking?"  He said, "Well, I would like for you to look at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and Stanford [University, Stanford, California]."  And I thought, "Oh, okay.  You know, where is Stanford?"  I'd never heard of it, and, you know, I'd heard of Berkeley 'cause some of my classmates were thinking about it.  I knew of MIT.  And so I had turned my attention to looking, you know, a little at those schools.  One of my chemistry professors who would take me out to play tennis, you know, play tennis, he wanted me--he didn't want me to go to MIT.  He wanted me to go to Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California], and he really wanted me to, to really think about Cal-Tech in a very serious way.  And I liked Cal-Tech, but the problem I had was, they had a small number of faculty, and I always worried, what if I go there, and the person, there weren't people who were there that, you know, wanted me to have--in the group I was interested in joining, but they didn't want to have me in their group or I didn't wanna be in someone's group, and my choices were limited.  So I wanted to create some flexibility for myself.  So I looked mainly, either at MIT and Berkeley because they had large faculty, and I felt that I had to have more than two or three individuals there that, whose work I was very interested in.  So if my first choice wasn't available, I at least had a second, third or fourth choice.  I felt it was important for me to work under someone whose work I was interested in.  I may not necessarily be interested in the person, but I was interested in the work because if things didn't go well with the person, the work was the thing that would drive me completion.  So, you know, you know, having the interesting work and then the person follow, was key for me in choices.
Speaker 2: So you applied this time?
Speaker 1: So I applied to MIT, Berkeley and Stanford.  And so I was admitted into all three programs.
Story_ID: 26848
Speaker 1: So what made you decide MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, that was a little bit, that, the complication, the decision was complicated by the death of my grandfather [Merlin Walker].  He had died two weeks before graduation from undergrad school [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].  And, and so when thinking about, you know, graduate schools, I decided I would go to [University of California at] Berkeley [Berkeley, California] because I had a relative who lived in Berkeley, and I thought that, you know, it's a good program.  I have a relative there.  My grandmother can come along with me to, you know, to Berkeley, stay out.  And so that would be a, you know, a good choice.  But this, this relative was just very a difficult, you know, person.  And, and so I had told Berkeley I gonna go there, and I had turned down MIT.  But in the meantime, in preparing to go to Berkeley with all the sort of difficulties, family difficulties, I felt that it would be best not to be in a place where relatives would be.  I didn't really want that as a variable, as a distraction, you know, for me.  So I called up MIT, and I talked to them about, you know, the situation and asked them to really defer--and I called up Berkeley, and told them the situation and asked them to defer.  Then I decided to take a year off, and just--first worked to try to get the house ready for my departure, and pay off bills and make sure grandmother was in a good situation, but use that as a time to sort of work through what was the best situation.  And in the end, I decided that it's best to go to a place, when I looked at Berkeley, MIT and Stanford [University, Stanford, California], all the players who I was interested in, all had that same background, that same area, pretty much doing the same kind of things.  So it didn't really matter who, you know, which institution I was gonna go.  I was gonna get a good experience at either one, and it didn't really matter who I was gonna work for 'cause all of 'em knew each other.  And they were swapping grad students and postdocs.  So it really didn't really matter there.  So I felt that the most important decision was I would be in, find an environment that I would have little, you know, family distractions, you know, from, from the work.  And so I opted to go to MIT for those reasons.
Story_ID: 26849
Speaker 1: A couple things.  You graduate [from University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] in 1977, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum--
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: I worked for a year at Monsanto.
Speaker 1: And you worked for a year.  Now, you graduate--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And that started in '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: With a degree in chemistry and a minor in math, I have--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, I do wanna ask about your grandfather passing.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Just because he was such a critical part--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --of your life.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And that happens, you know, graduations are a time of celebration.  And so, but he had been sick, you had said, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: He had been sick.  So, where is Monsanto located though, I mean--
Speaker 2: In Texas City [Texas].
Speaker 1: In Texas City.  And how far is that away from--
Speaker 2: About ninety-eight miles.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you then take a job, and then you're--
Speaker 2: Commuting.
Speaker 1: Ninety-eight miles from Beaumont [Texas]?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was doing two hundred miles a day.
Speaker 1: So, what are you, and that--one thing I think about Monsanto, is it's an experience with industry.  You haven't had--
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's correct.
Speaker 1: --an experience with industry at this point because you've been in academia--
Speaker 2: That's correct, um-hum.
Speaker 1: --you know, primarily.  And you've been at a lab.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, nationally, to a nationally-recognized lab.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So when you, so what are you doing there?  I know you're a technician.  What department are you in and was that job hard to find, coming out of school at that time 'cause there's a lot of opportunity, I think in the 1970s, right?  With--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Sort of, you would think.  You would think so, but, you know, I, I remember going out looking for, you know, a summer job, and it was a little tough, you know, given all the refineries around Beaumont, you know.  They just didn't, they didn't hire.
Speaker 1: They weren't hiring?
Speaker 2: They weren't hiring.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I thought, "Wow, I should be able to find something with all these refineries being, a chemistry degree from University of Texas, I should find something."  But they weren't hiring.  But Monsanto, you know, had a summer, summer, basically summer internship.  And they were really interested in having me go back into chemical engineering and becoming a chemical engineer.  So I was a little bit, learning a little bit about what a process chemist does and what my chemistry degree would get me if that was gonna be my terminal degree and then look at what I'd be doing as a chemical engineer.  You know, it was, it was a good experience.  It, what the experience taught me was how industry goes about, you know, their job as--I was a process chemist, but they have a way of doing things, you know, under, you know, very, very highly managed, a lot of milestones, you know, a lot of goals, a lot of progress reports--
Speaker 1: A lot of structure.
Speaker 2: A lot of structure, and so it was, it was interesting being in that and learning a little bit about that because that actually turned out to be a very good thing for me going into graduate school.  And so it got me into really the time management, you know, the, how to talk about results, you know, how to just communicate your results, both in writing and also in presentations.  So it was a good experience, you know, in that regard.  But the time in that year too was good in a lot of regards of having a time off gave me a chance to just sort of-- just regroup a little bit, step away from, you know, the hard core kind of chemistry stuff.  And even though I was commuting two hundred miles a day, it was a good, good distraction.  It was a good thing to do because then when I went back and started at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], that was, that was a very intense experience.
Speaker 1: And it probably would have been a little too intense, given that this was a hard--I mean it's hard to--
Speaker 2: That's a hard program.
Speaker 1: It was--
Speaker 2: It was a very hard program.
Speaker 1: Well, a hard program, plus, you had had a very significant.
Speaker 2: That's true, and I didn't, and it'd just been too much and overwhelming--
Speaker 1: And I think--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --so, but it was, it was just a lot of things came to, you know, together, which I think was just right because I remember my class.  A number of very bright kids in that class, when they, when it got down to the month of November, that first semester, many of them were just so burned out, you know, and to start directly from undergrad school to graduate school, they were just burned out.  And so they were dropping out like flies.
Speaker 1: You mean, the others who you knew that went into graduate school immediately--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right--
Speaker 1: --so they were burned, okay.
Speaker 2: They were just being burned out.  And so that, that year part was really, separation was a good, good time to (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You know, there's another question I have about Monsanto too--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --because I don't hear their name mentioned much, and I'm just wondering, you know, you hear for engineers, Bell Labs [Bell Laboratories], I mean--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --you know, and you hear DuPont.  I don't really hear Monsanto as it relates even to the minority community.  So was there, were you sort of one in class--class there or were you or have you come across the (many somewhere along?) the way, later, even though you're not in, you know, you're not in industry.  I just was wondering about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, if you hear about Monsanto, you hear mostly about Monsanto through the research and corporate in St. Louis.  So that's where you hear the most, you know, about Monsanto.  But, you know, Texas City Plant [Tex, you know, it was purely a, you know, manufacturing site.  And that, you don't hear very, very much about.
Speaker 1: Okay. Gotcha.
Story_ID: 26850
Speaker 1: So you arrive at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] the fall of--
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy [1978].  There are a couple of things significant about this.  This is your first time really North.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and it's Boston [Massachusetts], and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you're the only, you enter into the physical chemistry program?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, who's advising you, one, at this point?  I mean is there--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so let me, let me give a little--I'll come back to your question.  But let me give you a little preface to MIT.  So I remember in my senior year, I went up to MIT to take a visit.  And I decided, in my last semester, I took all my courses pass/fail.  And so most people take their pass/fail courses in their first semes--in their first year.  I decided to save 'em all up and take 'em in the last semester.  And so I could go off and visit colleges, you know, and universities and look at the programs.  So I decided, instead of flying up to Boston, I would take a bus to Boston.  That way, I could see a little bit of the, you know, the country, and, etc.  And, and this was in March, and Texas in March, it was about eighty degrees, and everybody--I was wearing my little Dashiki and I had my jeans and my Dashiki, and I got on the bus.  And I got off in New York, and, 'cause I had to change buses.  Of course, it was like about six o'clock in the morning.  It's quite cool, but you expect early mornings to be cool.  It would warm up in the day.  And then when I got to make my bus connection from New York to Boston, you know, it was fine and got into the outskirts of Boston, where the bus was driving around a little lake, and I saw ice floating around.  And I thought, "Now, wait a minute.  Let's do a little back of the envelope calculation.  Now, what temperature must it be outside for ice to still be floating around in that lake?"  And I thought, "And I'm wearing a Dashiki, with no tee-shirt, and everything."  So I said, "Well, no problem.  We got, we got, you know, a sweater and stuff like that in the suitcase, and, you know, hopefully, that's on the bus."  And I just assumed that it was on the bus.  "Well, I'll just wait until I get into Boston."  So as the bus was rolling into the bus station in Boston, I saw all these ladies wearing these fur coats.  And I said, "Now, let's see here.  What temperature must that be for those fur coats to be out, you know?"  So I got out, it was like thirty, thirty-four degrees, and I'm out with a Dashiki, with no tee-shirt on or anything.  So I said, "Okay, all right, all right, well, we'll make it.  Let me get my luggage out."  And they said, "Oh, your luggage is still in New York."  You know, I said, "What?"  So I said, "Well, how am I gonna get to MIT with a Dashiki on and it's, you know, thirty-some odd degrees?"  So I got to MIT.  And I said, "Does anyone have a sweater?"  (laughter).  So I remember the, the advisor, he said, "This is what you came in with?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "This is all you have?"  I said, "Yeah, 'cause the luggage-" You know.  He said, "And we admitted you?"  I said, "Yeah, you did." (laughter).  But his name was [Robert] Bob Silvi, and he was a great, you know, a great advisor for all the graduate students, the first year graduate students.  And, and so, you know, he's an easy guy to talk to.  You know, the first semester, it was really surviving the gate-keeping courses, you know, at MIT.  They're really very intense and a lot of work.  Yeah, but I was getting something like maybe three or four hours of sleep, you know, a night, with just with all the studying and the problem sets, and dealing with the problem sets.  So, you know, it was very intense.
Speaker 1: So really, even though you had done well and U-T Austin [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] was a great program, this was, went up several pecks?
Speaker 2: Aw, yeah, well, you know, the situation that when you get everybody who's the tops in their class, and you put 'em all together, and they're, you know--
Speaker 1: And everybody's driven.
Speaker 2: And everybody's driven, you know, it became, you know, well, it became apparent that not everybody could be on top.  And for myself, what I said, "Well, I'm not gonna try to, try to be on top, you know, but I'm gonna make sure I'm not on the bottom."  So my goal was not to be on the bottom (laughter), but I was not gonna be, you know, unrealistic and try to really, you know, be on the top, you know, at that place.

Speaker 1: So what made you choose physical chemistry at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, lasers, lasers.
Speaker 1: Lasers, but what--
Speaker 2: You know, I saw the Star Wars movie, and I thought--
Speaker 1: I know, but what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and I thought lasers were really kind of cool, and they had lasers galore at MIT.  And I wanted to learn a little bit about the lasers, and, you know, it made sense as another, you know, radiation sources compared to what I had been working with, the x-rays and neutron diffraction to go off in that direction.
Speaker 1: So what's the role of Professor Jeffrey Steinfeld then?
Speaker 2: Well, he was my, he was my Ph.D. advisor that I selected.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's later, okay, that's later, okay.
Speaker 2: That's--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's later, okay.
Speaker 2: That's later, yep, um-hum.
Speaker 1: So, oh, yeah, okay, so let me ask you.  So, but you're entering a Ph.D. program when you enter MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or are you entering--
Speaker 2: That's correct, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, you weren't--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they only admit you for the Ph.D..
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so it wasn't a masters program, that led into a Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they don't--no, they don't do the master.  It's a, a--if you don't succeed the Ph.D. program, they give you a masters.
Speaker 1: So at what point are you deciding what you're gonna do for your dissertation then, I mean what--so how long was the program?
Speaker 2: Four years.
Speaker 1: Four years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, four years.
Speaker 1: Okay, they don't like you, they don't let you languish there, huh?
Speaker 2: Well, no, you're money, you're--it costs, it costs them about fifty, fifty to sixty thousand to keep you there a year or so.  They don't wanna keep anyone, you know, there.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a full scholarship?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, what, at what point are you declaring, I mean deciding on your dissertation, and is that under Steinfeld?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, so in that first semester, professors are looking at all the students and the students are looking at various professors.  They even have in mind who they want to work with.  In November, you have to pick a research supervisor.  I had four people that I was interested in working with.  The first guy I was really interested in, his name was John Ross.  John, you know, was a person I was interested in, but when I got to MIT, he was leaving MIT to go to Stanford [University, Stanford, California], and I just turned down Stanford.  You know, if I had known John was going to Stanford, it'd been different.  But I didn't know that. And I thought it was a little awkward to start at MIT and then turn it down, then go to Stanford, just as I turned down Berkeley.  That just felt awkward, but again, the nice thing is that there were three or four people there that I was interested in working with.  One of the other (unclear)-- so I decided to sort of, sort of systematically look at everyone, you know, who I was interested in, and talk to members of the group.  I even sat in some group seminars to see how they interact with their students.  And, but, you know, Steinfeld was, his work I was very interested in.  A lot of students tried to tell me not to work for him, you know, he was not a very good guy, didn't communicate very well.  He was a little harsh.  His students really had difficulties, you know, communicating with him.  And so they, they tried to convince me that that may not best be the right choice, you know, for me.  So I remember asking him if I could just work in his lab for a semester to really see how things would go.  You know, not commitments, you know, from him, no commitments from me, you know, no hard feelings whatever.  It worked out, that's fine. I would continue.  If it didn't, you know, I would move on.  And he agreed.  He allowed me to do that.  He allowed me the space to do, gave me a, what I thought was an interesting cool problem, and I'll just take a little bit of water here.
Speaker 1: Okay, sure (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: And, and it worked out very well.  I, I felt that the group dynamics was something I could manage.  And I felt that I could communicate with him.  And I like, you know, his, his approach.  And so I didn't, all the problems that other students were having, I didn't see those as being real issues, you know, for me.
Story_ID: 26852
Speaker 1: You decide, you decide that [Dr. Jeffrey] Steinfeld is someone you can work with?
Speaker 2: Yes, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you go, is it the summer after your first year that you go work in his lab or--
Speaker 2: No, so, starting in January, that January, that second semester I started to working his lab--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --and, you know, doing experiments.  The question that we--I was in charge, was if we can take laser light and if we can tune laser light to a specific motion of the molecule, could we force the molecule to break apart, you know, in a very specific and selective way by tuning to a particular molecular motion.  So let's say, say I have three atoms that make up a tri-atomic molecule.  Say I have a carbon hydrogen bond and a carbon chlorine bond, okay.  Now, the carbon chlorine bond would, should break first because it's the lowest energy bond, you know.  But the question is, if I excite the carbon bromine, you know, bond or carbon chlorine bond, you know, quite naturally, that energy in that bond would force it to break apart.  But the question was, if I put energy in the carbon hydrogen bond, could I break the carbon hydrogen bond or would that energy go into the carbon, you know, chlorine or bromine bond and break that first.  And so what was the energy when you put that energy in that molecule in a very selective way?  What was it doing and where was it going?  And could we then tune it to do specific things?  And then what was the physics behind, you know, how that light interacted with that molecule to allow that energy to go into it and flow in and around it?  And so that was the question that I was actually, started to work on with, you know, with Steinfeld.  So that got me to look at just the experimental work, but it also got me into theoretical work in terms of the physics behind all of that.  And so it got me to work with a lot of the physicists then.  But it turned out to be very interesting because, you know, at the end of that semester, I had enough data to, you know, publish a paper and, actually published my, you know, a paper, you know, with Jeff, you know, for that work.  And that work actually got the attention of a researcher in Australia.  He was at the University of Sydney [Sydney, Australia].  He's a theorist.  And he'd actually been developing a very different theory that really could help us to explain the experimental results.
Speaker 1: So let's, I mean first of all, what were your findings?  What, you know, from the work that you were doing, and then the, the, the Australian scientist was Robert Gilbert?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep, Robert Gilbert, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: So what we were actually finding was that we could actually see some selectivity, but that selectivity needs to be refined a little bit more.  And the question was, what was it about the molecular structure.  This is where the x-ray diffraction worked, you know, came in with, knowing a little bit about the structure--
Speaker 1: It goes back--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and, you know, how that structure really defined the physics and now what was the connection of that physics, you know, with the light and the radiation?  And then how did that connection connect with chemistry that was ongoing?  So I can characterize the chemistry.  So how do we connect all these pieces of the puzzle together to get a holistic understanding of how lasers, you know, interact to induce chemistry and molecules, and could it be selective.
Story_ID: 26853
Speaker 1: But that turned out to be--that was very important at the time because there was an interesting little race going on between the U.S. and Russia where they were doing, using lasers to isotopically enrich, and so if you've now got an isotope and you have two different isotopes and they have their natural abundance, now, you can use the laser to selectively tune to one isotope without interfering with the other.  And now you can break the one apart and now enrich the other one.  Now, the importance of--
Speaker 2: All through lasers?
Speaker 1: All through lasers.  Now, the importance of that is the following.  How the U.S. and how the Soviet Union would keep track on everybody's nuclear capability was they used, you know, big diffusion processes to enrich.  And you can track that by satellite.  So you knew a country's nuclear capability by satellite by looking at these big diffusion plants.  Now, if you're able to do this in this enrichment with lasers, it's not way you can keep track on, you know, what kind of laboratory they have because I can actually do that work in your office (laughter).  And I can get the laser in here, set up a couple of bulbs, and do that way.  And so, you know, their--the race was on and really, you know, trying to understand, you know, how to really optimize, you know this, this process to enrich uranium.  And one of the things that we--
Speaker 2: Oh, to enrich uranium?  See, you hadn't said that, okay.
Speaker 1: Uranium, oh, yeah, or any isotope for that matter.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But they were really going after enriching uranium.  So, this work was really key to really getting at more of the physics and the chemistry, you know, underlying those processes.  So one of the guys at [University of California at] Berkeley [Berkeley, California], who again, I was interested in working on, had actually did some demonstration experiments to show that this was really quite, you know, plausible and could be done.  And there was a guy at the Russian Academy of Sciences, Latohauf (ph.), who had actually, simultaneously, shown, you know, that this could be done as well.  So the race was on with, you know, some of the laboratories around the globe and where we're looking at this.  So the, at, in Australia, Bob Gilbert, was really working on a theory behind all this.  And the physics behind all this was really quite complicated to really solve, given the number of equations that you need to solve.
Speaker 2: So was Bob Gilbert a physicist then?
Speaker 1: He was a theoretical chemist.
Speaker 2: He was a theoretical--okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, with a strong physics background.
Speaker 2: And I had actually been working with a physicist from Los Alamos [National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico], you know, as well.  So my advisor had had a close relationship with the Los Alamos physics, and experimental community.  But I had been working with a physicist at Los Alamos.  But Bob Gilbert came along with a nice sort of methodology that, you know, we could really explain a lot of the results that we were seeing--
Story_ID: 26854
Speaker 1: Yeah, with, so Bob [Robert Gilbert] actually took notice of our work.  He actually had made a special trip over to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to talk with me, and I met with my advisor.  He took me out to lunch.  I remember this very vividly.  He took me out to lunch, and he wanted to know a little bit about me, and more of the experiments we were doing and what were some of the questions, what were some of the challenges I was facing?  And he said, "Well, look, how would you like to come over to Australia and work with me on the theory part.  I think I can help you.  And we can make connections with, with, with your experiments."  And I said, "Oh, that's great."  And he said, "Well, let me go back and talk to your advisor, Jeff [Jeffrey Steinfeld], and see if we can get you to come over to Australia and spend six months to a year to work with us."  And I got real excited.  So I said, "Well, wow, Australia, is Vienna there?"
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And so I thought, you know, Vienna was in Australia.  You know, I thought, "Oh, I'm going to go to Vienna," etc. He said, "No." He said, "That's in Austria."  I said, "Oh, what's the difference?"  "Ah, well, they're about, you know, six thousand miles apart."  He said, "You seem to be challenged by geography."  I said, "Well, I'm a Texan, so, you know, anything outside of Texas is, you know, foreign land to me."  So he said, "Oh, we've definitely gotta get you out of the country."  So, actually that was my first trip out of the U.S. to go to Australia and to work with, work with Bob.  And it was a, you know, very, very enlightening experience, a very--a good experience, you know, working with him.  He was a very intense individual.
Speaker 2: More intense than Steinfeld?
Speaker 1: Well, oh, he was very intense.  Bob Gilbert was very intense.  He was very intense.
Speaker 2: So, but what about the work that you did together there because, you know, he's saying, "My theoretical approach could help inform (unclear)" (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: --so, and you're also talking about--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So he thought I had a cool theory.  It was, it was a master equation.  So it was very, very simplistic, but very powerful way of taking--what I was planning on doing was taking properties of each particular molecular motion.  He was able to group all those motions in a way, and allow for those motions to talk to each other.  So just like, for instance, you have an arm.  You can move your arm like this.  You can move your arm like that, but, boy, if I took a bowling ball, and just tossed that bowling ball at you, you know, and that bowling ball hits you, your arms wouldn't be going this way or this way.  Your arms would be going all over the place, your head would be going another place, etc.  So all of a sudden, all those motions are all coupled in a way.  So the question was, how would you describe all that motion which may very, be chaotic in nature, but yet you've excited by, you know, putting that energy into, you know, your system, you know, with that collision with that bowling ball.  So I can think of a laser and a molecule.  That photon from the laser is that bowling ball, and you're that molecule with the molecular motion, and now, all of a sudden, you've just been hit with that bowling ball, and you're just moving all over the place, shaking your head, popping your legs, arms all over the place.  But I gotta describe all that motion because in the end, something's gonna happen.  Something's gotta give.  And usually, it's something good that's gonna tell us some insight about the chemistry.  But he had a way of really describing that in very nice and very eloquent, very simple way.  But what was missing was a piece to connect his theory to the experiments I was doing.  There was a little piece that was missing.  And so my job was to figure out that little piece that was missing, that little theoretical piece that took the experimental observables and connected with, you know, his theoretical observables in a very nice, connective way.  And that was a theoretical model that I worked on, you know, by myself.  He was quite surprised, you know, when I had done that 'cause he didn't know what my mathematical background was, and if I knew how to really set up model frameworks.  He just sort of told me the problem, and I just went off and just, you know, did it.  But it worked, you know, very, very beautifully.  You know, at the end of that experience, I had to come to MIT, you know, and finish.
Story_ID: 26855
Speaker 1: But I, I remember we had a very important conversation--
Speaker 2: You and Bob [Dr. Robert Gilbert]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He took me out to the beach, and, you know, we sat down, and, you know, just on the beach, and we were just talking.  And he said, "You're gonna be graduating soon, and I know you're gonna be considering postdoc," and he wanted to know where I was thinking about.  And I said, "Well, you know, people from the East coast tend to go to the West coast, and so I need to be thinking about Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California], Stanford [University, Stanford, California] or [University of California at] Berkeley [Berkeley, California], you know, and vice versa."  And so he said, "Well, I would like for you to leave the U.S." And so I said, "Leave the U.S?"  He said, "Yeah, I would encourage you to take a postdoc outside the U.S.  I think it'd be good for you, be a very important step for you.  And so when you go back to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and sit down and talk with [Dr. Jeffrey] Steinfeld, you need to have a conversation about, you know, your next steps.  But those next steps should be out of the country."  So, of course, I had no clue of how to really go about that whole process.  But Gilbert, you know, he flew back over to the U.S., had a conversation with Steinfeld and they had made some connections with a couple of individuals.  There was a guy at Oxford University [Oxford, England, United Kingdom].  That guy from Oxford flew over to Oxford to sit down and interview me and talk to me about coming to Oxford.  I was offered a postdoc opportunity to go there.  I went over to their conference in Germany, and I spoke German.  I took German.  It was one of the two foreign languages that I took.  And the director of the Max Planck Institute for Laser Research in Munich [Germany] got interested.  And he had offered me a postdoc, you know, position, you know, there.  So I had two postdoc offers, one in Germany at the, Universitate--Technical University Munich, and then one at Oxford.  Then as I was looking further at, came up with another researcher, Ian Smith, at Cambridge University [Cambridge, England, United Kingdom].  His work looked interesting.  He had gone to, he was over in the U.S. at a conference going to, at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] that [Dr. William] Bill Jackson had organized.  And so I came down from MIT to go and hear him and talk to him, see if this is an individual that I felt there was an opportunity to work in his lab.  And he had offered me a postdoc in his lab.  So I had three opportunities to go abroad. And I selected Cambridge University.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Story_ID: 26856
Speaker 1: Can we go back a little bit--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yep.
Speaker 1: --because you did a very good job of talking simplistically, in simple terms about your work.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: But I would like you to go back and talk in terms of scientific terms, in your--you know, in what you did because what you--so you were really trying to understand more of what laser initiated chemical reactions would do--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --but I need you to talk, so, because you said that there--one, you say in the larger context, there's a lot of interest in lasers--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --and there's a race going on.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: But you never really told me who's, who actually--I don't know if that's, the race is still going on, but who won the race.
Speaker 2: I don't think anyone won the race.
Speaker 1: Right, but who are the key players in the race at that point, and then what is your work because Gilbert is a polymer--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He's theorist (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --chemist.  Right, he's a theoretical--
Speaker 2: No, and at that time, he switched over.
Speaker 1: He switched over, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he switched over, yeah, at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, I got you, okay.
Speaker 2: But he was a theoretical chemist.
Speaker 1: He was the theoretical, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: People do switch, that's okay.
Speaker 2: So the, there was a group in the Soviet Union, Latohauff (ph.) at the Russian Academy of Science.  He was really leading, you know, along with some of the work that was going on at, at Los Alamos [National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico], and then also at [University of California at] Berkeley [Berkeley, California].  The key figure at Berkeley was Bradley Moore.  He was, actually did some, you know, some real similar experiments to show that, you know, he can selectively tune to one of the isotopes and only dissociate that molecule of that isotope.  And thus, leaving the other one untouched, and, you know, unimpacted.  And so, and that way you got the enrichment, you know, that way.  So the experiments were really, you know, paving the way that this process could really--but the question was, if you're really gonna look at how you can control that, and how you can be more selective, I mean the question was, that worked for that one, that worked for that one system, but, you know, could you use it for other molecular systems to enrich other isotopes or other materials.  Well, that hadn't been proven, but the key to really understanding how that tunability can happen, if you really understand some of the underlying physics of, you know, what molecular motions were involved, how do you describe those motions mathematically, how do you know when you can access those molecular motions, you know, with the laser.  Once you now get the laser to interact with those motions, now, the question is, how do you, how do you get that energy that's been put into that molecule, into that motion to stay in that molecule, you know, or does it?  So how does that motion couple with other, you know, motions?  So what is the mathematics in describing the physics of those emotions and how those motions, you know, couple.  So, and that's--now the question is you do that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, but that was your missing piece, is that what you did?
Speaker 2: No that wasn't my missing piece.  I'm going back and really understanding--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --the foundational aspect of that.  I'll come back to my missing piece.  So, you know, the--so the question was, when you start looking at, as you're building a bigger and bigger molecule, there're more and more motions, and there's more and more coupled motions.  Now, it becomes a really mathematically intractable problem.  And so how can you really capture the physics, you know, with some simplistic theory?  And that was really the key to what [Dr. Robert] Bob Gilbert was doing.  But now, the big problem is when you start looking at the physics which was describing one particular motion for one molecule, and one particular motion, now you start thinking about an ensemble of motions and coupling of motions, you know, how do you describe that?  Well, you have to do a lot of averaging.  I mean, so you have a lot of integration that you have to, have to do.  But then even more complicated, that's describing the, how a laser interacts with one molecule.  But when you shine a laser beam through a vessel, in that laser beam, you've got a lot of molecules.  Some, and some of these molecules are not absorbing in the same way.  So you're getting a distribution of interactions with that laser beam.  Experimentally, you're seeing the distribution.  You're not seeing how one molecule.  So, now, what you've gotta do is then average over distribution.  And so what was key was taking the theory which really described, you know, the physics and chemistry from one molecule, average that over a distribution that really mimic what you see in the real system, and, and the missing piece that I worked was really taking that distribution, doing the averaging, developing the theoretical framework, you know, for that averaging.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, what were the--
Speaker 2: That's getting into some real detail.  I don't know if your audience will understand very much, but--
Speaker 1: But, so what are the real applications that came out of that, out of your--the real--
Speaker 2: Well, actually, what came out of that work was that you could use lasers to bring about new chemistry, okay.  You could actually use in some cases to tune the chemistry.  That actually led to some other work in other laboratories around the globe and, in terms of selective chemistry.  So that was actually really realized, but a lot of that early work was foundational to that work.  That certainly led to, you know, other kinds of chemistries.
Story_ID: 26857
Speaker 1: One, in work that I then used to extend when I became an independent researcher, was using that to, lasers to prepare specifically unstable new species that, you know, would have importance in atmospheric chemistry.  And so what I started to do was use lasers to mimic sunlight, to initiate chemistry, but then at the same time too, use lasers to probe the chemistry that had been initiated to understand how chemistry in the atmosphere was propagating and evolving.
Speaker 2: So, where did that interest come, and is that work coming out of the work that you're doing at Cambridge University [Cambridge, England, United Kingdom] at that point or is this--is this later work?  And I'm just trying--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the--
Speaker 2: --'cause this is the-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --genesis of that work was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: 'Cause this is tied to photosynthesis.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, so the genesis of that work came about by one day sitting in the library, at Cambridge--
Speaker 2: At Cambridge?
Speaker 1: At Cambridge, yeah.  So at Cambridge, you know, one week out of a year, they shut down the whole department.  And only one person can go into the department.  That's the head of the department.  And so for one week, you know, you can't get in that department.  And I didn't know what to do.  And so I was told, "Go do a vacation."  And so I got on the bike and I went down to, I decided I would bike Europe, and so I got on the bike and cycled from Germany to Switzerland to Italy, and then France and then back to England.  I did that in two weeks, and, yeah, on my bike.  And I got back, and the place was still closed, and I didn't know what else to do.  So I said, "well, you know, we got another week because of some complications with some building renovations."  So I went to the library, and just decided I would pull up every, every journal of 'Science Magazine' from volume one to, you know, 1985, and just go through it and see, you know, what science was done, what was interesting, what was fun and see how thought in science was evolving.  And there was something that caught my attention, and I though, wow, this is maybe something that would give me an opportunity to integrate, you know, everything, you know, together.  And it was a problem that Professor [F. Sherwood] Rowland and Mario Molena had worked on in looking at CFCs [chlorofluorocarbons] and how they damage ozone.  And, and I quickly realized when I looked at literature, not all that chemistry was fully understood.  And I thought that, here was an opportunity to take everything that I had learned and really integrate into this area and really provide some new insight and new direction.
Speaker 2: Now, this is a much discussed or it's beginning to be a much-discussed topic--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It's beginning to be much discussed--
Speaker 2: With the ozone.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: --and what was actually happening, you know.
Speaker 1: That's exactly--even though that research had started in the late '70s [1970s], but the impact--
Story_ID: 26858
Speaker 1: So even though that work had, had really been pinpointed in the, you know, late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s] about the impact of chlorofluoric carbons on the ozone, a lot of details of that chemistry were slowly evolving, but it really had, depended upon sort of serendipitous discovery of new things coming out of the laboratory.  But I realized that with the experience I had gotten, you know, from the experiments using lasers and also the theoretical experience that I had gotten, that, the integration of all of that in this new area, we can actually take, remove a lot of the serendipity discovery of that chemistry, underlying chemistry and, you know, make some significant progress in understanding the details of that chemistry.
Story_ID: 26859
Speaker 1: My challenge was the following.  If I'm gonna go off and do, have an independent career, what's the likelihood of me being funded to do research and continue to do research--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --in that area.  And, and, you know, could I compete with all those bright people--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --in that area.  So I felt that, you know, I needed to find another direction that allowed me to develop my own uniqueness, okay, that I could be clearly distinguished from the rest of the crowd--
Speaker 2: I see, okay.
Speaker 1: --okay.  And I didn't feel that, you know, what I could do in that area could allow me to be distinguished enough from the rest of the crowd, that I can stand on my own as an independent researcher.
Speaker 2: Well, that's important as a research scientist.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: I mean you have to find the new areas that--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You've gotta find your niche--
Speaker 2: --it's more difficult.
Speaker 1: --in what you can do, and etc.  And I think, you know, the key is what a lot of people try to do is to do the coolest, the best experiment, and they think they have it solved.  I didn't go in that situation with that in mind, because what if that experiment failed, then what was my back up.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wow, okay.
Speaker 1: So I needed to have more flexibility, you know, for myself, but I felt--I was also looking for--I remember asking the question, "So, what if I did that?  So what?  Yeah, so what if I did that?  What new does that add?  You know, what would I be, you know, learning?"  And I couldn't answer that question for myself continuing in that line of area.  So I felt the chlorofluorocarbon one, what I saw, there were a lot of questions that were unanswered where I felt that now, you know, integrating a lot of what I, experience that I had could really learn something new.  And I, there's also a niche, you know, there for myself.  But there were difficulties.  There were difficulties breaking into that as well.  So and I'll get into your question--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --one, in terms of what [Dr. F. Sherwood] Rowland [and Dr. Mario] Molena had proposed was that, you know, UV radiation from the sun, particularly UVB radiation when chlorofluorocarbons will absorb that radiation, won't break apart the chlorine.  And the chlorine would go on and react with ozone, destroy the ozone.  And from that proposal, what I saw in the literature and how the literature had evolved, is everybody had focused on that chlorine because they felt that the chlorine was the important entity.  And what does that chlorine do?  And all the chemistry and focus on that chlorine.  But what I saw when I looked at the literature, that other fragment was out of the picture.  It was missing.  They didn't really look at all the details of that chemistry.  In fact, there were about, maybe five or six studies compared to over a hundred on the chlorine.  But on the fragment about five or six studies, and I was curious as to why that was the case.
Story_ID: 26860
Speaker 1: And the problem--and the only thing I could surmise of why that was the case, you can only study something if you know what you're looking for (laughter), you know, or if you know what you're studying.  So on the chlorofluorocarbon, they know where to find chlorine.  They can follow the chlorine and study what the chlorine would do.  The chlorine acts to the ozone, and they know it's gonna give a ClO, a chlorine oxide radical.  They know what that radical looked like in terms of its structure.  They knew--have key markers, you know, for that species, and they can follow that chemistry on that.  But the other fragment, they didn't have that.  So how can they study something they know nothing about?  And I think that really, in my mind, what I saw was that was an opening because I felt with a lot of the theoretical work that I had learned, you know, over the years and also at Cambridge [University, Cambridge, England, United Kingdom], that I can open that door, you know, what would be key signatures for that species.  I'd opened the door of what that chemistry could be even if it was not very accurate, but I can really, really get into that ineptly.  But the challenge was for me, was I had skeptics, I had both, you know, the atmospheric chemists didn't trust, you know, chemical physicists.  They thought they were too molecular.  And, and they, they didn't know any--where, "What is this theory about, you know?  Where is the theory coming from?  We do everything with experiments, and how can we trust that?"  You know, then the other side, you know, dealing with my colleagues in the, you know, chemical physics community, "Oooh, that's atmospheric chemistry stuff.  That's very applied, you know, it's not really fundamental, you know, and where is that gonna get you?  So the challenge was, and then how believable is the theory, you know?"  And so the challenge was, one, how to get the atmospheric chemist to see that you're credible, how do you get the experimentalist to believe your theory?  How do you get the, you know, theorists, you know, to work with the, you know, experimentalists.  So it was a, you know, very interesting, interesting challenge.  So I honed on, I felt was a real test problem and a key species that was central to the other fragment, that people had been searching for, for about fifty years.  And I felt that if I could really get at that species and do everything myself--I had my lab do the theory and the experiments myself, pull it all together, that would be a real true, true test.  And so that's what I decided to do in my independent, you know, career.  Some people thought that it was highly specialized, very, very narrow.  But I saw it otherwise because I saw it as really opening the door if it was really successful.
Story_ID: 26861
Speaker 1: So I spent the first year really working up the theory to see if this, trying to prove to myself with the theory if this new molecular entity in how the fragment part of the Rowland-Molina problem, the chlorofluorocarbon were gonna break down, what was a key fragment species there.  We worked up the theory on that and then I said, well, gheez, is it gonna be plausible to probe for this.  And I worked up the theory to convince myself under the conditions of the experiment that I was gonna do, you know, it was gonna be there.  And then I worked up the theory to show me where it was gonna be, and that turned out to be an important thing to tell the student where to tune the lasers to go and find the species, and etc.  And we did it, we did it, and--
Speaker 2: Now, you did it where?  Are you at Cambridge [University, Cambridge, England, United Kingdom] at this point?
Speaker 1: No, I was at Wayne State [University, Detroit, Michigan]. At Wayne State.
Speaker 2: Oh, so you have, this is past your postdoc, and then you take this--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So the postdoc, post doc helped bridge the, you know, like that's why I came up with the question and started working on that independently as a post-doc.  Okay, I started doing the calculation on the side as a post-doc, and I, when I took my position at Wayne State, I did more calculations, you know, to show that this thing's gonna exist and where the thing, you know, which signatures for this entity.  Then I developed the experiments to really go after that at Wayne State.  And right where we had predicted it, we tuned those lasers there, and within two or three days, we had actually found it.  And most people take about, maybe two or three years to find it.  And--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Now, why do you think you found it so quickly?  Is it because of--
Speaker 1: Because of the theory.
Speaker 2: --the theory that, but isn't the theory--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The theory, working together--
Speaker 2: But is mathematics part of that at that point or not?
Speaker 1: Well, the mathematics had all been worked into the theory through the computers so, you know, it's all part of that theoretical framework.  But, but, yeah, that, that theory working together--really, that theory guided the experiments.  And then we, we demonstrated that.  And that touched off, that touched off a worldwide fury because, first, like I said, that species hadn't been found.  People had searched for it, but when we did the theory, I went back to some of the papers that had reported that they couldn't see it.  And when I looked closely at the spectra, and when I looked closely where the theory said the species should be, and I went back and looked at those old papers that showed the spectra, as claiming that it wasn't there, I saw patterns in the, in what they considered noise of the spectra.  But it had a regular pattern, and a regular pattern that fit where the theory said.  And I knew it was there.  I didn't tell anybody because I wanted us to go and, and be the first ones to pull it out.  And we did.  So I knew those experiments had shown it, but they had all claimed that it was not the case.  But I knew it was there because the pattern--they didn't know what pattern to look for.  They didn't know what signatures to look for, but I, I saw that pattern from the theory.  And I knew what to look for in that spectra and what--it was there.  So we just had to go back and do it and do it in a way that really brought it out.  And that's what we did.  But it touched off a fury.
Story_ID: 26862
Speaker 1: So can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: The fury? Yeah.  That fury was, so all of a sudden now, people had ignored that fragment because they had all focused on the chlorine chemistry.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we raised the question was, well, now, there are all these new species from that fragment.  Can that fragment too have chemistry and what is that chemistry?  Now, if you're gonna look at describing the whole chlorofluorocarbon that you put up in the atmosphere, describing that chemistry is not just about describing the chlorine, but you gotta have the fragment to have the whole picture.  And everybody just focused on only one half of the problem.  And now, we had opened up the, you know, the door for the chemistry of that other.  Now, that turned out to be very important because now, as industry was moving to new materials, those new materials were using a lot of that fragment chemistry as sort of a basis of that, those new materials, and they--
Speaker 1: So when--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and they hadn't realized that either.  They were just merely guided by understanding the, the kinds of properties that they wanted in those systems for their applications, i.e., refrigeration applications, not about the chemistry.  But we had actually shown that when you look at those new materials, a lot of that chemistry is fundamental to that new fragment that we had opened up.
Speaker 1: So you're talking about refrigeration, you're talking about aerosols also, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, aerosols, you know, refrigerated fluids and, you know, that whole thing.  So, and so the race was on, really understand these new materials that were being adopted into new generations of air conditioners and car air conditioners, what impact were they gonna have on the ozone layer.  And what was that chemistry.  And, of course, we then decided to use, you know, theoretical chemistry and map all that out.  And then we're gonna then use the lasers to really pinpoint all the key, key spots to that.
Speaker 1: So what techniques--you're talking about what you're identifying, but what techniques are you using?  Are you using mass--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  And that's what, that was the problem with all the past experiments they used mass spectroscopy.  And the problem with mass spectroscopy, even though it's sensitive and it's great, how it probes for the ions allowed you, wouldn't allow you to really distinguish those short-lived species.  There's no way you can couple all those masses.  So it yielded no information.  So you needed something much more selective, something, you know, a little bit softer than mass spectroscopy.  So that's why I went the optical route with lasers.
Speaker 1: Lasers.  So lasers really are--
Speaker 2: It was key.
Speaker 1: --were key.  Okay, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But the key to really taking advantage--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But what, why--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --of the lasers is knowing where to tune your lasers.  So if you don't know anything about the optical properties and molecules or where to tune the lasers, you don't know what, you don't know what to do.  And that was the problem with using lasers in a real forward and innovative way.  For things on, you know, the chemistry regarding the chlorine, groups like Jet Propulsion Laboratory [Pasadena, California], Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], [University of California at] Berkeley [Berkeley, California], labs at Oxford [University, Oxford, England, United Kingdom] and labs in Germany, labs in Japan, they can do those experiments 'cause they knew where to look.  But if you don't know where to look, it's hard, and that's where the guide to where to look was where-- theory was really important in guiding that and opening that door.
Speaker 1: So let's talk about this in context and why 'cause you say it touched off a firestorm.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Really, so industry, what side are they on?  They're actually, they're creating products, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that have these properties--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in them?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But these properties, how are they interacting--what is the, how are they interacting with the issues around the ozone?
Speaker 2: And that's the question that they had to, had to address, but they didn't know how to address that.
Speaker 1: Because it was complicated?
Speaker 2: It was very complicated with a lot of--
Speaker 1: Because a lot of money has gone into it.
Speaker 2: Well, it was complicated for 'em because they didn't know all the chemistry--
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: --and then the techniques that they're using, to measure in chemistry, was not discriminating enough to, you know, decouple all the competing reactions.  So they needed to come up with something a little bit more selective--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but you couldn't do that just by experiments alone.
Story_ID: 26863
Speaker 1: So what are [Dr. Mario] Molina, do--are Molina and Sher--
Speaker 2: [Dr. F. Sherwood] Sherrie Roland.
Speaker 1: Are they--they're aware of your research at this point, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what are they saying about your research and how are you balancing off what's happening in industry and your--
Speaker 2: So, the situation was I was not gonna go down the chlorine chemistry route because I couldn't compete with those figures, okay.  So for me, looking at the other fragment where everybody had just forgotten about providing an avenue for demonstrating an approach of the marriage of theory and experiment together and opening up new avenues for, you know, unexplored, you know, chemistry.  So, you know, when I actually got this new species--it's called trifluoromethoxy radicals, CF3O radical.  And like I said, you know, people had been looking for that, you know, for about fifty years.  And we found it and gave a signature for it, and showed that you could monitor it, you know, over very short time scales.  You can probe it in any reaction.  Then, you know, people wanna know how was this done?  You know, what gave that insight to that, you know?  Could this be used in other things, you know, as well and getting at details of very complicated chemistry, you know, in a very selective, you know, way.  So I can monitor this radical--even thousands of reactions may be going on, but I can pinpoint that one out of those thousand reactions.  And that's what people really wanted to, really try to know and because when you're looking at, really chemistry in the laboratory or even in the atmosphere, there're thousands of reactions that are going on.  But you gotta really try to understand each one in the singular, molecular, you know, step.
Speaker 1: So who is interested in your research--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: --at that point because--
Speaker 2: Who was interested in it?
Speaker 1: Yes, because you have, you have--also, you mentioned the Jet Propulsion Laboratories [Pasadena, California]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know, and work going, you know, several of our scientists have talked about the work that they've done--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but, and, then you have the atmospheric scientists part also trying to sort of--so who is looking at your, you know, this research.  And--
Speaker 2: Well, so an interesting thing had happened.  So when we came out with that work, and then raised the question--
Speaker 1: And that paper, what was the name of that paper then, that you published with that?
Speaker 2: Oooh--
Speaker 1: You don't remember, okay, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was--
Speaker 1: Sorry.
Speaker 2: --published in 'Chemical Physics Letters' in, I think 1980-- 1988, I believe it was.  But nevertheless, that work, because it was very relevant to getting at the underlying chemistry of the these new materials, alternative chlorofluorocarbons, and industries were developing these new plants and they didn't wanna know that they were gonna vest these millions developing these new plants and find out that there materials are not going to be, you know, environmentally, you know, sound to use.  So there was a really quite interested, really see what extent this was true.  A lot of people over here did not believe our work.
Speaker 1: So they were challenging it?
Speaker 2: They were challenging it, and that was fine.  We, we believed in it. But, but-
Speaker 1: Can I ask another question too before--? Just hold your thought.
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.
Speaker 1: Was it unusual for this level of work to come out of Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan], too?  And I was just wondering out of--
Speaker 2: [Sighing sound].
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Well, I could, I have a story to tell about that because that was challenged too.  In fact, I got a call from an executive from one of the manufacturers of those materials, you know, questioned, "What kind of credibility, you know, do you have coming from a place like Wayne State, and who do you think you are," kind of stuff.  I tried talking to him, saying, "Look, this is new research.  I'm happy to come over and talk to you about our work."  They just wanted us to be shut down, and at that point, I told them, I said, "Look, I'm not getting funding from you.  And I've tried to be, you know, open with you, and so I don't have to, you know, have any further conversations."  At that point, he said, "Well, we know where we're getting your funding from."  And so at that point, I said, "Well, I'm sorry, no more discussions."  I went to the head of the department and told him of the conversation.  He got alarmed because I wasn't tenured at that point.  He went to the dean, and then the dean went to the president of the university.  So the president decided to do a review of my work.  So, so the president formed a special committee to do a review of the work that I was doing to make sure, you know, going in the right direction.  Then they called me back in and said, you know, "I just wanna let you know that we're behind you 100 percent.  So you just continue to do, you know, what you're doing."  And then in my third year, they brought me up for tenure, promotion to tenure.  So I was brought up for promotion to tenure in my third year at Wayne State.  And so--
Speaker 1: 'Cause tenure usually doesn't happen that--
Speaker 2: Until, yeah, about your fifth or sixth year, you know.  But I was brought up in my third year.  So, you know, that was a good thing, you know, but it was a little bit nerve wracking to, you know, go through that kind of, you know, internal, you know, review process, but it was good to have the institution, you know, behind you.  And I just kept--but I--it was not well received in the U.S.  But the support for our work came from colleagues outside of the country, the Germans were supporting our work, a group from Oxford [University, Oxford, England, United Kingdom] was, you know, behind our work, a group from New Zealand.  They were all validating, you know, our work.  And that was, you know, that was a good thing.
Story_ID: 26864
Speaker 1: And so what happened was, the guys from Jet Propulsion Laboratory [Pasadena, California] invited me over to spend the week with them.  They wanted to learn more about what we were doing.  They wanted me to learn a little bit about what they were doing.  And they felt that instead of me going out there as the lone wolf, you know, fighting against some big institutions, that they wanted to sort of give me a little bit of guidance along--I mean it was a new area for me, atmospheric chemistry.  I'd never been in that community, but I knew my lasers.  I knew my theory.  They knew the lasers.  They didn't know the theory, and they wanted to see where the opportunities were to really, you know, forge a collaboration.  And so I saw an opportunity that if I could help them with their work, you know, by helping with their work, I could learn a little bit how they approach problems, and, you know, how they approach problems I can really take that in terms of my own work, and really strengthening how, you know, I make cases for, you know, our work.  So I used that as an opportunity to learn how they were really successful and really branding, you know, themselves as Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as a world-class institution and recognized in atmospheric chemistry.  And I learned a little bit about the secret of what they do.  And so I wanted to really learn as much as--from working with them, collaborating on their work and bringing some of our work in to help them strengthen their case and at the same time too, bring some of what I learned from them back over into our own work.
Speaker 2: So how did you do that then?  What actually happened as a result of that?
Speaker 1: Well, so I would--every summer I would leave Detroit [Michigan] and spend the summer out at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  Then they gave me a visiting associate at Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California], spent time in the geological and planetary science (unclear).  So I had to learn about atmospheric modeling, and what I learned is what really makes them successful and what guides them is a real interesting push and pull between developing instruments that go up into the atmosphere, make measurements of the chemistry, but then they complement those measurements with laboratory studies, but those laboratory studies are guided by, you know, what they're seeing in the measurements.  So that really adds focus and relevance and importance to the laboratory work that they're doing, but the big overview of those two is the modeling which really gets at the, where and the impact of that chemistry.  So I really saw this sort of three pillars that were really key.  Most people, if you're working in just, you know, theoretical chemistry, they don't see that, you know, and they don't see that connection.  If they're working in the laboratory and trying to break into atmospheric, they don't see the connection between the atmospheric modeling and the, and the field measurements of how that's really informing.  They just see, "Wow, these guys have done some important stuff that everybody is interested in, and they think it's important."  But they don't see how it came about as being important and really seeing the importance.  And I got a sense of that, and I learned a little bit about each one of those, and I also learned how to really judge the literature on each one of those and really guide, defining, you know, what are really the important abstract problems that we would work on, that would really have some real impact in informing the chemistry and the community and getting the community excited about the work that you do.  But what I learned from JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory] and Cal-Tech that was really important, that whatever I do in that arena, that I push the envelope and the work that I do in terms of accuracy and precision and preciseness.  And so that, that forced us to up our game two notches to really, you know, push things to the limit with the best work that we can possibly do.
Story_ID: 26865
Speaker 1: What are the similarities between sunlight and lasers or are there any because I--
Speaker 2: Sun, the difference, no, there's no difference.
Speaker 1: So because I was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But what a laser does is, sunlight, you're getting a whole spectrum of radiation and wavelengths, and, you know, but a laser, you can actually pick out only one of those wavelengths.  So, with a laser you have tunability.  With sunlight, there's no tunability.  You're getting everything.  So everything is exposed to all radiation.  So, it's like going out on, on a football game and looking out in the stadium.  You've got many different color--people wearing many different colored cloths.  So you're seeing many different colors of light, okay.  And think of sunlight as that.  But with a laser, I can pick out and only have reds.  I can pick out and only have blues.  I can pick out and only have yellows.  So lasers allow us to really pinpoint particular, you know, radiation colors out of, out of, out of sunlight and use those colors to drive chemistry or to probe the molecular structure of things to develop, you know, spectral fingerprints.
Speaker 1: But that's, that's some of the work that JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California] was doing, wasn't it, with their scientists in the, in Antarctica, I think, or in the--because I was just looking at an interview we had done with--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Krishna Foster and she was saying--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah, Krishna, yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, she was saying how, you know, they realized that in the dark, not much was happening, but in the, when the sunlight came out, all kinds of things started--all right, thank you (laughter).  All kinds of things start happening, and so I'm just, I want you to talk--
Speaker 2: But her chemistry is very different.  So her chemistry is really--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's why--
Speaker 2: --looking in the clouds and, you know, the role of clouds and sunlight, interactive chemistry.  Ours was before her work.  We were looking in the gas phase, without clouds, what--how light interacted with inducing that chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay, so and, without light, how gas interacts--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you just said, okay.  So what did you find though?  That's what I'm saying, what else did you find?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, what we found is that there's a lot of chemistry and a lot of new species, and that if you're really gonna understand the chemistry in the atmosphere, you have to first understand what are all the species that are up there and what role and what chemistries they're playing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then you gotta put that into models to really understand the complete picture.
Story_ID: 26866
Speaker 1: There's still an underlying theme, and let me connect the underlining theme.  And the underlining theme of that is, understanding how is chemistry in the atmosphere evolving.  But in order to understand that chemistry, you've gotta know what you're looking for.  You've gotta understand how molecules are interacting up there.  And, and that's where the theory and the computer modeling with that theory gave new insight about that.  And, then, of course, it gave us new insight then where one can see markers, you know, or signatures for these new species.  So it's all about identifying what are the species, once you identify what are the species?  Now, if you have a marker to follow that, can you use that marker to trace what chemistry takes place.  So if you look at all the work that we've done from the '80s [1980s]--
Speaker 2: Eighties [1980s]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --1986 to even today, when you look at the core fundamental thread, there's that thread, what are the species involved, where do you find that species, and then what chemistry that species have and then now, how do you put that whole chemistry in the bigger context.
Story_ID: 26867
Speaker 1: How do you do your work, Dr. Francisco?
Speaker 2: So in that picture, how we've evolved, let's go to the big picture.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: The marriage of theory and experiment is key.
Speaker 1: Right, they are--
Speaker 2: Let's take that framework.
Speaker 1: Okay, marriage of theory--
Speaker 2: And experiment-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and experiment is key.
Speaker 2: --okay.  So now, the question is, if we're now going after new species, and now new chemistry, the question is, what theory, what can theory tell us about the structure of those new species?  What theory can tell us about where to look for those new species?  And then, now, what does theory tell us about the chemistry of those new species?
Speaker 1: But I'm asking you what are the new species that--
Speaker 2: Well, hold on, hold on--
Speaker 1: That's all I'm asking.
Speaker 2: So, but I gave, I told you.  So one, one key that helped us to really--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: They all have--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  One key species that helped us to really demonstrate just the plausibility of being able to work across that platform is the CF3O radical, trifluoromethoxy radical.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that had very key applications to really understanding the chemistry behind the chlorofluorocarbons in terms of the other fragment, and it was key to really understanding the chemistry behind new alternatives.  Now, what is that key is a lot of complicated chemistry that I can't go into.
Speaker 1: Why can't you go into at least some of it for this interview, at least some--
Speaker 2: Well, I need, I need to, I need pad and pencil.
Speaker 1: You need a pad and pencil.
Speaker 2: I need pad and pencil.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Sound like he's ready to do some equations.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE 2):  No, that's the language.
Speaker 1: That's the language.  I need pad and paper.  Otherwise, you won't understand.  You will not understand what, what, what etc.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE 2):  He's explaining to you at a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, I--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE 2):  A lot of things (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, no, no, I do, I do--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE 2):  I know he got that.  I heard it--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I know he does a lot--okay, this is the same thing as Dr. Lester.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE 2):  (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Okay, no, but this is-- (OFF-CAMERA VOICE 2):  (Unclear) Notice the science in all of this.
Speaker 1: Okay, but can you explain it, and then you can draw it later?  Is that possible?  Can you do both 'cause I can't--otherwise, I have to do a different set up.  Can you do that for me?
Speaker 2: Well, I can try, I try--
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.
Speaker 2: I can try, all right.  So let's take the chlorofluorocarbon molecules.  So when sunlight hits that species, it breaks off the chlorine.  The chlorine goes and does a chemistry there.  You're left now with a CF2, Cl2 or CFCl3 radical.  Now, that takes up O2 to give us CF2, CHCl2O2 radical, peroxide radical.  That radical reacts with NO to get NO2, to give you now this CF3O radical.  That CF3O radical now, you got a lot of stuff in the atmosphere.  You've got OH radicals, you've ClO radicals, you've got methane, you've got CO2.  Now, that CF3O radical can react with all those things, and so what is the chemistry there, okay?  And so the key is mapping out what kind of products you see with that chemistry?  So let me take a very simple example of CF3O radical, you know, reacting with methane.  So with the CF3O radical reacting with methane, it now goes off and the oxygen from the CF3O radical can take off a hydrogen, give you a CF3OH radical, and now, to give you methyl radical.  That methyl radical can now react with O2 and break down to give formaldehyde and a whole bunch of other stuff.  And then now what is the question, what does the CF30H species, you know, do in the atmosphere?  Will it produce new chemicals, you know, and will those new chemicals have an adverse effect on your human health and air quality 'cause you're gonna be breathing that stuff in.  Well, those questions were not known, but simply they didn't know because they didn't know what they were looking for.  So what our work was able to do was to break down the details of, you know, that chemistry.  And that chemistry, when you look at the details of just that fragment, it turns out to be about eighty-four different chemical reactions that takes place before you get to the final product of CO2.  But there are other species in those eighty-four chemical reactions that have coupling chemistry, but other garbage that's out in the atmosphere that produces some air quality issues.  Is that the kind of detail you wanted?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: But I--
Speaker 2: Now, I can't go into that detail with the other, with the other, you know, alternative refrigerated materials because that's a lot of chemistry there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have to write it out on the board.
Story_ID: 26868
Speaker 1: You get recruited from Wayne State [University, Detroit, Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you join--
Speaker 2: Purdue.
Speaker 1: Purdue [University, Lafayette, Indiana].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, what is your interest in joining Purdue at that--I mean I know there's a difference in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the--but what are they offering you?
Speaker 2: Oh, goodness gracious.  What made Purdue attractive?  Well, one, I was going to JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California] every summer.  And what JPL offered was a connection, you know, with the atmospheric modeling group and the geological and planetary science.  And I felt that that was a need.  If I was going to really make our work, you know, have impact and have relevance, I needed an atmospheric modeling group.  What JPL actually had was the laboratory measurements guy, group and also the field measurements group.  So they had this three pillars right there.  And those three pillars talked regularly.  And I saw that that was really key.  At Wayne State, I was just only in the chemistry department.  And I didn't really see that if I was going to really have an impact in this field, that I could have an impact just by being solely in the chemistry department.  So I was looking at, for an opportunity that would allow me to at least have access to the three pillars without having to always go out to California.  And Purdue had a geological and planetary, you know, science department.  It was atmospheric--earth and atmospheric science department.  They had an atmospheric group, you know, they had a good modeler they were developing.  They were bringing in a measurements guy, you know, developing instruments to go out and do the measurements.  And I felt that that was an opportunity where, you know, I could develop the laboratory and the theoretical modeling for my group and interface with that and have a group in that, in that department and have that same kind of three pillars that really made JPL, you know, very, very successful.  And I saw it as an opportunity to have that and develop that, you know, at Purdue University.
Speaker 1: So has it worked in that way?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  Yes and, and no.  But what I also saw about Purdue University--remember, I'm, I'm all about flexibility.  I saw--one question I raised for myself, well, this is fun and it's great.  And this is going well.  But, you know, you need, you need some flexibility to change with new emerging problems.  And if this is no longer the flavor of the month or the flavor of the year, what opportunities do I have to change and evolve into something new, and is the environment, one, that'll allow me that flexibility.  And what I saw at Purdue was a chemistry department that, that was a big chemistry department.  You know, it had about, you know, sixty faculty members.  But, you know, it's a lot of research going on.  But it was a very collaborative department.  And I felt that that would be a good thing to have in my back pocket in case these kinds of problems I was working on were no longer of interest, you know, to the community.  But I had some flexibility to move into some new areas and that there were people there that I could collaborate as a, sort of a jump start to go off in a new area.  So I'm always looking for things that'll enhance what I do in areas I go in, but I also look for flexibility in case there are changes, you know, you know, in the wind that I need to be able to respond to rapidly.
Speaker 1: So what hasn't worked though when you say, "Yes and no?"  So you got the flexibility.  You've got resources.  It's a major research, you know, institution.  But what has not worked about those three pillars?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, yeah, I've had--it's been a great place in terms of collaboration, been great in terms of colleagues.  It's been great, you know, with students.  You know, I think, you know, what's a little bit--Purdue is a little bit isolated, you know, and that if you now want to branch out--
Speaker 1: You mean geographically.
Speaker 2: Geographically, you know, it's really very geographically isolated.  That's made it, you know, somewhat challenging in terms of having--if you're gonna be, you know, on the cutting edge and a player in the global field, you know, you've gotta have touch with that pulse and it's been somewhat isolating.  And that's been good and bad because in some ways, being isolated gives me more time to really have the group to be able to really make some, you know, headway in things.  And the bad side, you know, you lose some touch with, you know, the emergence of new, new things and new areas.  And so, the challenge has put upon me is really to be more forward thinking and innovative in thinking ahead, you know, of the field.  Sometimes I get it right, and sometimes I get it wrong.  You know, it'd be nice to get more right than wrong (laughter).
Story_ID: 26869
Speaker 1: What questions would you like to answer, now, in terms of your research?  I mean out there and who, you know, because there's so much focus right now on the ozone and--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --you know, global warming, and all the things, and finally, you know, the average citizen is realizing something's, you know, awry, and that--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --but what are the things that you would like to spend your time doing, and what are some of the questions you would like to ask, you know, ask, and hopefully provide answers for now?
Speaker 2: Ooh, I, I don't really--so I'm just, to be honest with you, I don't really have perceived questions out there that got--so, let me explain what I mean.  So I usually, once we're on a research, you know, problem, I usually let the problem sort of dictate where we need to go, what new questions arise.  And getting back to your earlier question, so about, a question about this new species that really got at this unanswered question in acid rain.  Well, that came about really looking at the question of how OH radicals react with nitric acid.  In other words, how are some of these acids in the atmosphere removed, if they are removed?  And what I found was that they actually formed, you know, some very stable complexes and aren't really moved, removed in the traditional way.  And I thought that was very interesting.  Most people had ignored it, you know.  They had realized something was there, but they had ignored it, and we decided to really follow, you know, "Well, why did they ignore it, you know?  Did they not know where to look?  Did they not know what its structure was?  Did they not know what its chemistry was?"  But we have all the tools to probe those.  And so we decided to just sort of probe that.  That opened up a whole, you know, brand new area for us that we hadn't anticipated of really looking at now, chemistry on clouds.  And also, you know, and people had just ignored the role of clouds.  Now Krishna's group, Krishna Foster's work, had actually pinpointed that clouds would have chemistry, but a lot of that chemistry was really what I call, very stable species chemistry.  But in terms of radical chemistry, a lot of that had been ignored, didn't know.  But that work, by following, you know, that question of what did that complex--nitric acid OH complex does, opened up this whole brand new area.  So I tend to let, follow the data where the data goes or what the new questions are.  That's good and that's bad, and it's good and bad because of what--where it's good is that for us, a lot of unexpected questions and things come up.  For instance, the new thing that we're working on is, out of those questions of looking at that cloud chemistry and how radicals interact with clouds and now looking at what molecular interactions are taking place.  What we found is that there's some new kinds of bounding that have been going on that people hadn't really discovered, and that was radical hydrogen bonding.  Well, that now turns up to open up some very interesting questions about oxidative stress, and, you know, and DNA damage.  You know, everybody says eat your antioxidants.  You know, how do you know those antioxidants are working?  You're paying top billing for that, but you don't know if they're working.  And a lot of the food manufacturers don't know if that stuff is working.  What is the underlying chemistry behind that?  How are the free radicals damaging your DNA and other, you know, important biological systems.  Well, the key to answering that is really some new work coming from our work at looking at chemistry on clouds.  So here's that fundamental, you know, stuff about molecular structure and then interactions.  You know, from that domain, really informing something very, very, very new.  So, now we've--I've never taken a biochemistry course in my life or a biology course in my life, but here's how it worked from this realm of atmospheric chemistry where it's being important in translating over to this new, you know, biochemistry world of oxidative stress and DNA damage or Parkinson's disease, and, you know, and stuff.  But you can't make real headways out of that unless you understand, you know, how radicals and radical damage and new, this new bonding that's been unearthed from this totally unrelated, you know, area.  But, you know, I could have said, "Hey, I'm not a biochemist.  I'm not going off in that area." But I decided to just follow where the new insights of atmospheric chemistry lead.  So in answer to your question, I don't have any, I don't allow myself to be pigeonholed into a particular area.  I let the, let it sort of guide us with the new questions and the new findings and where that, and where it goes.
Story_ID: 26870
Speaker 1: Your research with clouds, how long has that been, have you been working on that?  And do you work on--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Ooh, gheez, yeah, it started--
Speaker 1: How do you work on clouds?  I'm just--
Speaker 2: Well, we haven't gone out there with a plane and--
Speaker 1: (Laughter)--
Speaker 2: --"Well, I'm gonna capture a cloud here and put in a vessel.  And I'm gonna work on this."  We haven't done that.
Speaker 1: No, I (unclear), but I just was wondering--(laughter), I was just thinking were you making, you know, miniature clouds?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, we don't do that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't do that, but some of my former students do that stuff now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, we theoretical--we develop a theoretical framework for the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So you're really, a lot of your work is comput-- computational then?
Speaker 2: Yep, and we use experiments to back, back those up.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see, okay.  Now, I have a few more questions about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You talk about determinations, spectroscopic determinations of electronic and vibrational transitions in radicals.
Speaker 2: Yeah, those are those markers.
Speaker 1: Those are the markers that you were talking about.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Well, what--is that the, what about the kinetics of individual gas phase reactions?
Speaker 2: So, now, once you've found the marker, so once you find the marker, you can use that marker to follow, you know, that species.  So, now, for instance, I'll give you an example.  So, say, you're now at, at a rock concert, okay.  And I know how you dress.  I know how you look, and say you're wearing a red blouse with some red shoes with a black sweater and some real funky glasses, okay.  I can now tag you, and I can follow you wherever you're going as you're moving around.  Now, that's what the laser allows me to do.  So as you're bumping into somebody, you know, I can see how you're bumping into somebody.  So as that molecule is bumping with something, I can monitor that.  If that molecule bumps and something reacts, I can monitor how fast it reacts.  So that's the kinetics.  So the kinetics get me, allow me to look at how fast something, you know, is reacting.  The electronic structure stuff, the vibrational stuff, allows me to identify how you look, so I can follow you with the laser.  Does that help?
Speaker 1: Yes, it does.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So lasers are still very important in your work?
Speaker 2: Very much so, yes.
Speaker 1: Very much--
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: But there've been a lot of developments with lasers over the last, you know, twenty, thirty years, so how have those developments impacted the work, you know, that you do?
Speaker 2: Yeah, some of the new innovations in lasers have come from widening the spectral range that you can probe, you know.  You've got lasers that can probe in the infrared region, probe in the visible region, probe in the UV [ultraviolet] region, probe in the VUV [vacuum ultraviolet] region.  Professor Jackson, [William] Bill Jackson, you know, has lasers probing the UV and VUV regions.  There's now even the x-ray, you know, lasers.  So a lot of innovations have now been made to really broaden the spectral regions where you can actually use lasers to really, really pinpoint, and spectrally.  Lasers have advanced in terms of how fast you, you know, they can probe things.  In other words, move from time scales to milliseconds to, you know, picoseconds to femtoseconds to attoseconds, 10-15, you know, seconds.  So, those have been significant, you know, innovations.  Innovations have been miniaturizing them, you know, from lasers that used to take this whole room to now lasers the size of your purse, you know, to do the same function.  So all those have provided innovations that allow just a broad range of, you know, new applications of, you know, those devices in, you know, in research and also in technology development as well.
Story_ID: 26871
Speaker 1: Dr. Francisco, what else would you like people to know about your work?
Speaker 2: I'm a nice guy (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, your work. And I think you're a nice guy (laughter). No, but your work.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My work.  Gheez, well, if you ask me what I've learned about my work, and what's made it exciting, and made it very interesting, what's made it, you know, challenging and fun is sitting on interfaces.  In my particular case, our work is really set on an interface between theory and experiment and starting off with that, that allows us to branch out and now sitting on the interface between theory and experiment, and actually, geophysics and has allowed and integration of information from all of those has really allowed us to really be innovative in a way that the world has taken note and given a lot of work--our work a lot of attention.  So if there's, if there's a message that, you know, I could leave out there, is the hottest, the hottest and interesting and exciting problems are really working at the interfaces of fields.  And I think this is where giant leaps and disruptive innovations are really gonna come from in the future.
Story_ID: 26872
Speaker 1: You came in, you came into a new field.  I mean you created groundbreaking work in a new field--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --let me put it that way (simultaneous)--That's a better way to put it--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right, that's right, yep.
Speaker 1: So can you talk--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: We're being credited for pioneering the field of computational atmospheric chemistry.  That's what--the field that we created.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about how that field has grown and what real-world applications, you know, what real-world effect for those of us who are not, you know, that field is having--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, everyday life?
Speaker 2: So, yeah, so what--let me go back.  Let me go back to the original motivation at the time.  The original motivation was how do we identify the chemistry when you don't know experimentally what chemistry is going on?  Okay, you know, if you don't know where to tune your lasers, how can you--if your massspec [mass spectrometer] is complicating chemistry, how do you know?  If you're gonna make any advance in chemistry, knowing chemistry, you've gotta know what's going on.  But if you don't have the tools to tell you what's going on, what can you learn new about it?  And this is where computational chemistry has been a real powerful, you know, tool in bringing that insight.  But bringing that insight and marrying it with atmospheric chemistry has just been the real big, you know, big picture in innovation that opened it up because a lot of people were confused about-"Well, I got these rates.  I got the spectra, but I don't know what I have, you know.  So I can rationalize what I have, but is that truly what I have?"  And the computational chemistry takes a lot of that uncertainty out of understanding the experiments.  The computational atmospheric chemistry and the significant impact is if a company now develops a new material, and they wanna go to market with that material, and all of a sudden now, that material is in the market, and it's released.  How do you know that material's gonna have a air quality problem that, you know, and how do you know that material's not gonna have an air quality problem.  Can you wait twenty-five years to find out that that material has a significant problem that you can't reverse?  How do you know that you shouldn't be using that material?  Well, what we've now been able to introduce in the field, is we can take a lot of that guesswork out.  So we can now reduce--you can, there's no reason why you should not know what a material's gonna do in the atmosphere and the chemistry of the atmosphere before you go into mass production and what we've done.  So you can go in with some good certainty of whether the materials that you're manufacturing are gonna have, be benign in terms of the environment.  You don't have to wait until your chlorofluorocarbons which were actually made in the 19--, you know, '40s [1940s] and had been used and be discovered in '78 [1978] that they had a detrimental problem.  And those materials have a lifetime of two hundred years.  So once they're there, you can't do anything about 'em.  We can now take all that guesswork out of, out of that.  And that's significant.
Speaker 1: That's significant, and there's a huge amount of money that would go towards that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, so now, so now what's happening in the field, there're groups around the world who, you know, are doing those kinds of work.  I know the Japanese government set up a whole institute, you know, where they brought, you know, theoretical chemists working with experimentalists to do what we did and what we pioneered in doing to really determine whether the materials that they, (well?), are making, are gonna have, you know, have the right kind of properties for their applications, but what the environmental impact is gonna do.  So they all know now have that.  You know, Germans, you know people around, around the globe are doing what we're doing.  So in terms of a measure that I remember being invited to Barcelona, Spain for a conference where I was one of the keynote speakers.  And, and there was a guy from Germany who had researched what the impact of our approach had been on the theoretical community in terms of looking at the number of papers that were doing atmospheric chemistry work with computers.  And you could see where we started.  You know, we were (unclear) back in the '80s [1980s] and it just has gone exponential.  And that's actually been, you know, rather exciting and, and very important.  When I got elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, I was surprised to be highlighted in their news release as someone who had really revolutionized our understanding of chemistry in the atmosphere with the kind of approach that we had done-- I hadn't really given much thought to it.  But, you know, that was something that we had done.  I didn't really fully appreciate the impact of the work that we had done.
Story_ID: 26873
Speaker 1: Actually, it's very interesting.  You know, one of the hot topics is dual-use chemistry.  I remember when I was president of the American Chemical Society in 2010, I had to go to the State Department to try to, yeah, advocate them to, you know, give visas to summer, you know, scientists from abroad to come and give plenary lectures.  And, you know, they're really being very, very strict and very rigid in who they gave visas to and so--
Speaker 2: Dr. Francisco, I'm asking about your work?
Speaker 1: No, no, no, hear me out, hear me out.  I'm gonna get--I'm getting there.  And so one of the questions that they asked which was surprising, was, "When you're talking about chemistry, there's dual use."  And I was perplexed by the dual use of chemistry because I've only thought about chemistry in ways that would really, you know, bring about a, you know, a benefit and better living through chemistry.  But there is the dual use.  And when you think about it, there is the dual use.  So I'm not trying to trivialize or marginalize, you know, what you're saying.  I'm really being supportive.  But there is the dual-use capability.  No doubt about that.  And, you know, like with any aspect of, any aspect of science that you do, there is always gonna be the dual-use question.  But I've only, really have focused on, you know, how we can really benefit and, you know, the chemistry, better living through chemistry.
Story_ID: 26874
Speaker 1: You came, when we look at you and where you've come from--
Speaker 2: Uh-oh.
Speaker 1: --it's not very far away, a long way in some respects--
Speaker 2: Uh-oh.
Speaker 1: --except I remember the kitchen experiments.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Unfettered (laughter), the freedom that you had.  You know, you were seeking at Purdue [University, Lafayette, Indiana] you had in your kitchen, your--growing up, well, kitchen and backyard, growing up.  But I want, you have done work to help--I think, let me see.  Hold on.  You've done work to help-- in teaching, you know, teaching, you know, science, and I want--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --want to, you to talk about that 'cause you were saying that integrating multiple teaching methods--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --into general chemistry,--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --classroom was really the way to go.  Can we talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so let me give you a little bit of the genesis of that.  So, you know, when I was at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] I had a fellowship.  So I never taught a class at MIT.  And so when I was getting ready to go out on my independent career, I suddenly realized that I'd never, never stood up in front of a classroom to teach.  And, but I felt that, you know, I had some good models, some good teachers, and, you know, emulating those teachers.  And I have a belief that all students can learn.  You've just gotta find the way, how to connect with them, to reach them to see the material and make it connect and, you know, with them.  They would get it.  And the job of the teacher is, you know, how to do that.  So it's not just delivery of information, but helping them to connect that information.  So, but I had some challenges when I was teaching, teaching general chemistry, and I, you know, I had very high standards.  But I wanted to set the standard high, but I wanted to create opportunities for the students to work towards reaching that standard.  And, but, you know, students were resisting, you know, and, you know, they were saying I was a poor teacher.  You know, maybe so, but, you know, I really wanted them to learn--whether they thought I was a poor teacher or a great teacher, that didn't matter.  I really was more interested in them really understanding material, being able to use the material, to think with the material.  And that was really important for me.  But I had a student come up to me and said, you know, "Dr. Francisco, you know, I spent, you know, sixteen hours studying, you know, and I really knew this material.  But, you know, I only, you know, I bombed this, you know, the exam.  And I don't really know, you know, what happened."  And, you know, I believed the student, you know.  And I really wanted to understand, you know, what was really happening as well.  You know, it wasn't that I was gonna off and give an easy exam.  It wasn't that I was gonna go off and give out Twinkies as well, you know, to make a student happy, you know, about, you know, their, their performance.  So, the question was why, what was going on?  So, I remember going to one of my colleagues and, in fact, I went to the chair of the department.  And I said, "I need some help, you know."  I don't know what's really going on.  He said, "Well, I'll have one of the best teachers in the department to come in and sit in your class and see what you're doing."  And that best teacher came in the class, spent a couple of times in class. "Ah, you're doing well.  Your problem is just your exams are too hard, you know.  These are not good students.  Give 'em an easy exam."  Well, I just thought that was, that was not the way to, you know, to go about this as well.  And so it was not very satisfying, you know, for me.  So I realized that, you know, all my training has been in doing research and being a good researcher, and I just have very little experience in the classroom, being a good teacher.  So I went over to University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and went to their educational psychology department and talked to (unclear), who knew some good people who had some experience and paid for them to come and sit in my classroom and look at what I was doing and to give me some advice.  So, you know, from a, you know, pedagogical standpoint, you know, how I could (unclear) get me improved, you know, in delivery or, you know, how I was lecturing.
Story_ID: 26875
Speaker 1: And the person came in a couple of times and really looked at what I was doing, gave me some feedback.  They thought I was doing a great job, but she said, "You know, I'd like to come back to your class again.  I saw something."  I said, "Well, do I have to pay for this?"  So she said, "No, you don't have to pay for it, but she said, I saw something, and I just wanna come and sit in your classroom."  So she came back a couple of more times, sat at various places.  She was watching, you know, what I had learned and, and doing.  She thought, gave me feedback, I was doing a great job.  But she said, "I was watching the students in the classroom, and clues that you were giving and things that you were delivering, they were not responding the way, from an educational psychologist standpoint, that they should have been responding and that-" So she wanted to get at some of that.  And so we decided to develop a little diagnostic to try to probe on certain delivery things that I was doing to engage students, what the students were doing, you know, and what they were getting out of the that delivery and collected a lot of data.  And actually, the real interesting thing I learned was that students were doing different things.  They were seeing different things.  They were learning different things.  And one amazing thing I learned, that if I got up in front of the classroom and just wrote a lecture on the blackboard, I was only engaging about a third of the class because you have some students who are very good listeners.  You have some students who are very kinetic, that are writing and taking notes.  They learn in that way.  Some, through hands on, some students are hands on.  So when I go into a lecture, I realize that if I'm going to reach a classroom more than a third, I have to engage in activities in delivering that material in different ways that play to their learning styles.  So, just going up and giving a lecture is not gonna cut it, but I have to have, you know, people give PowerPoint's.  They think they're pretty, and they're doing a great thing, but they're tuning out a third of the class because some kids, when you write something on the board, the act of writing triggers a learning event, you know, for them.  And so that work was just very interesting because it actually started me in generating a series of papers getting into learning styles in the classroom.  And I learned that the problem just wasn't me, but, you know, the problem is that you have to deliver your lecture in different formats in order to engage the kids.  But I also, too, learned in the process that the kids have to know how to take notes.  If we assume as a professor, that in a high school and junior high school, they know how to take notes, well, I learned that many of them don't know how to take notes.  I assumed that they know how to listen, you know, for those clues.  Well, I learned that, you know, a lot of them don't know to do it.  I assumed that because they've been taking tests for (laughter), elementary school, junior high school, and high school, that kids know how to take a test and that really when a kid takes a test, and, you know, that test is a measure of whether they know the material, well, I learned that that's not the case.  It's a combination of how good they are taking tests or how they're not good at taking tests, plus the material.  So they may know the material very well, which that young lady, I believe, but what crippled, she did not know how to take a test.  And that hurt her.  And it wasn't that she didn't know the material, but she didn't know how to take a test.  So as an instructor, you know, I took that really rather serious in really getting at, you know, why my students didn't do well.  You know, a lot of students wanna complain.  They wanna put all the blame on the professor.  And I really, I was ready to accept that blame, provided I really understood enough of what was going on, not only from my perspective, but from the students' perspective.  And so that series of work triggered us off into really venturing out into learning styles, learning skills in the chemistry classroom.  So we published about, you know, six, about five or six papers in 'Chemical Education,' really getting at research to form how one can deliver better pedagogy or frame the class work where students can learn, you know, better.
Story_ID: 26876
Speaker 1: So that leads me to another question about minorities in STEM [science, technology, engineering, mathematics] education--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --because I think when I hear your story, you're exception, you know, really in some--
Speaker 2: [Sigh] Oh (laughter).
Speaker 1: --given the right mentorship.
Speaker 2: Yes, okay.  Yeah, there we go, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay, no, I mean, okay, I'm not talking--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, I understand.
Speaker 1: But, you know, we have this whole dilemma with education in our country--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and STEM education, so what have you learned that could be taken, you know, into elementary schools and things like that, that you think will help, you know, the United States sort of move forward?
Speaker 2: Ooh, so, you know, I was actually invited to sit on the National Academy's Board on Science Education.  And I was intrigued that was asked, invited to, to sit on that board.  And I always wondered why.  And I found out that the reason, recently, why because they actually had been using some of our work in reference to really thinking about developing a national curriculum.  One of the problems that we have in this country, we don't have a national curriculum for STEM.  We're very decentralized.  Even in the district, you have no common--
Speaker 1: Standards.
Speaker 2: --standards.  And, and so, you know, one has to really think for this country some national standard.  And I know there's gonna be great resistance.  There's great resistance for that politically.  But actually, and so for me, I was, I really accepted with the light to be on that committee 'cause I see that that's really important, you know, for STEM and really making some headway to really reach our full diverse demographics and population.  It cannot be as spotted as, as, as it is.  I know resource rich communities have the best curriculum.  Resource poor communities have little or no curriculum or guidance or idea how to approach teaching in STEM.  So by having some kind of national standard begins to put on, you know, a platform for which everyone can build in that.  And that's very, very important.  That's how I see the future.
Story_ID: 26877
Speaker 1: You've been honored, had, you know, quite a few significant honors.  You know, being the fellow, and then you've been accepted into the Academy [National Academy of Sciences] and then--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you were president of the American Chemical Society [ACS]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in 2010, and I--were you the first African American?
Speaker 2: No, the second.
Speaker 1: Second.
Speaker 2: Second in thirty-years years, um-hum.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about that and also what you did 'cause your term is up.  You served--
Speaker 2: Yes, I served my term, yeah, yeah.  So what aspects do you want me to talk about?
Speaker 1: Well, I wanna talk about, well, who preceded you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's a very rich experience (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's talk about that, but, so who preceded you?  Who was the first African American?
Speaker 2: The first African American was Henry Hill, and that was in 1977 where he was president of the American Chemical Society, hadn't been one since.  So, to give you a little bit of the history on that, is--you wanna go in that direction or where do you want me--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes, I--no, I do wanna hear that.  At that point in time, had the American Chemical, had they acknowledged the work of Percy Julian at that point?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, okay, fine, so.  (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, no.  No. So when I was called and asked if I would, you know consider being a nominee for the president of the American Chemical Society, I thought it was a joke.  I thought someone was pulling a prank.  And I asked them for their phone number and said, "Could I call you back to make sure I've got, you know, a correct number."  I thought it was one of, a student who was pulling a prank.  But I called back, and sure enough I got the person, and I told them to let me think about it.  So when I thought about it, I said to myself, this is an opportunity to do something, think long and hard about what is it I wanna do.  So here's a chance as a member, if you wanted to change something, if I had complained about something and wanted it to change, this is an opportunity to change.  And if I don't do anything, I should never have a complaint again, okay, 'cause I had an opportunity, and I chose not to do anything about it."  And so I said, now, if I feel that there's something that should be changed.  And if there are three things that I could see could be changed, and I could convince myself that these are worthwhile changing, then I would run.  And so I thought about what are the things I felt needed to be done, you know, for the community, you know, for young people, what would be opportunities that will give people and young people the same kind of opportunities I had coming along, and, you know, and what were barriers, impediments, you know, to that.  And I came up with, you know, three or four.  And then what I did was, and I think it was a smart thing.  In our 'Chemical Engineering News' journal, sort of our little trade journal for the field, to have a little column where people can raise concerns and issues and, you know, vocalize about that in print.  I went over a ten-year period and look at that, and I wanted to see if any of those overlapped with what I thought were, 'cause I wanted to see if people were having the same or shared vision as I had.  And I saw some of that, and I also saw some emerging things as well.  And then I said, "Well, okay.  I think I'll throw, you know, I'll agree to be considered as a nominee."  I asked who, who all was running.  And they wouldn't share that information.  And I'm sort of glad that they didn't share that information because if they did, I probably would have withdrawn 'cause I would have thought I didn't have a chance.
Story_ID: 26878
Speaker 1: But when I got to the ACS meeting where all the nominees--there were four of us, had to go before the membership and ask--you know, answer questions that membership had.  And then we had to go before American Chemical Society council and give a, you know, blurb about what our platform and what we're all about.  And there're four hundred council members, and they will vote for the top two, you know, nominees.  But when I got there and saw who the other three nominees was, I said, "Oh, my God, what did I just do?"  And, you know, one of the nominees was Professor Hood, University of Chicago, Steve [Steven] Barry, who was, you know, a very big guy in the field.  He was also a home secretary for the National Academies.  There was another big National Academy guy, Joseph Mickell, one of the pioneers of photo chemistry.  And then there was a guy who was the director of the Ames, you know, Laboratory [Ames, Iowa], you know, and--
Speaker 2: His name?
Speaker 1: Thomas Barton.  You know, these guys were over sixty years old, you know, and here I am in my fifties, and I thought, "What's wrong with this picture here" (laughter).  And what did I just sort of step in?"  But I looked at the opportunity.  One, it wasn't so much a win or lose for me.  I looked at it as an opportunity to make a statement, and I felt that I'm gonna make a statement what I see are the problems and the emerging problems.  And I also posed solutions that I thought would, you know, would go.  So, but not just about what the problems are, but what I think we should go.  If people felt that, that's something that they believed in, then they would vote.  If that's something they just didn't believe in, then they wouldn't.  But my feeling was by bringing them out, if enough people felt that those were issues, and I didn't, you know, when--then they can bring that on up and champion those issues.  So this was a chance for me to make a statement, and then, you know, if I lost, I can go back and say, "Hey, you know, I had a chance.  How many people have a chance to really get before all the stakeholders and tell them what they really should be doing?"  And that's the opportunity that I took.  So whether I won or lost at that time, became a candidate or, you know, or sent home packing, at least I had that opportunity to message.  And I took that opportunity.  And then it turned out that, you know, I was one of the top, you know, two to be selected.  So now, go into, you know, the, you know, the campaign, and one of the things I really did not realize, just how global the American Chemical Society is, and I got a sense of that when the polls opened because when the polls opened, voting around the globe took place.  And I got to see all that voting and how it lit up the globe in terms of people looking at you and voting.  So, and that was, that was very impactful for me because I had really taken for granted the real, you know, function and role that the American Chemical Society, you know, played, and it really had a global, you know, role.  And, in fact, I saw the global aspect of chemistry really emerging more so, and that was with--I made a pitch of how, with our members and students, being educated in this country, is the curriculum that they're being trained in, allow them global flexibility, you know.  Would a company, a global company wanna hire anybody from here, you know?  And, (unclear) that's a reality that's coming really fast, and we really had to, you know, look at that.  Well, that was a, a theme that members really picked up on and global members, you know, really picked up on as well.  I think that really was the key to, you know, my being elected president.
Story_ID: 26879
Speaker 1: So what are you proud that you accomplished in that time [as president of the American Chemical Society]?
Speaker 2: Well, ooh, I accomplished a lot.  You know, I--what I had actually pitched for myself were only three things.  I wanted something very ambitious.  I wanted something, low-hanging fruit, and I wanted something in between.
Speaker 1: So what were those?
Speaker 2: Well, one was, I felt that in this country, you know, we need to create, you know, global opportunities, you know, for students.  I felt with the restrictions on visas, the tide of a lot of people coming into the U.S., into the laboratories was decreasing.  And my thought was, well, you know, we need to keep new ideas coming in, and if you're not operating on the global scale, you need to be in touch with what's going on in the global.  And so if our government is restricting what new knowledge through exchange of people coming in, what we can do is get more of our people to go on out and create those opportunities for those to go on out.  And so one of the things I was really pushing was to try to create an international center which was a central clearinghouse for opportunities, making members in our field aware of opportunities that are outside the U.S. as well as inside.  And so I was able to, you know, get that off the ground and started, endorsed by the board of directors and up and going.  So now you have a world map, and if a kid, you know, outside the U.S. wanna see what our opportunities, they have a map in the U.S., somewhere, the opportunities, they can click and find.  If some kid here wants to know about, you know, international internships in France or in Japan, they can click and see, you know, what's available and then where to go.  It's hard to Google, and then it's hard looking on various company web, you know, websites.  But in this way, you know, companies and the enterprise and practitioners can advertise what their opportunities.  And kids have one place to go shopping for, for opportunities.  So I'm very proud of that success.
Speaker 1: So that was innovative?  That wasn't the low-hanging fruit?
Speaker 2: That was the low-hanging fruit.
Speaker 1: Oh, so what was the innovative?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, one of the things I pushed was entrepreneurs, creating more entrepreneurship in the chemical enterprise, creating small businesses.  And the problem with our curriculum and chemistry, it's very intense in terms of courses and core areas.  So students have very little opportunity to go and take courses in the business and learn about, you know, business, how to set up a business plan, how to manage a budget or anything like that.  They don't have that opportunity in graduate school.  So when a student comes out and wants to go and think about forming a business, well, they just don't have any experience in that.  They'll go and work for a company, you know, years with a company, and now what's happening is those companies are laying off.  So, so my question was, how to create, you know, job opportunities.  And I think the job opportunities came, you know, with creating new, small businesses.  And I got an insight on that.  That's the cool thing about being a president.  You can ask for data.  And anything with data in the chemical enterprise, the American Chemical Society has or can get.  So I actually had them to look at large companies and small companies (that were hiring?).  So what I found in the chemical enterprise, our unemployment is about, the highest its been is about 4.6 percent when the U.S. average is, you know, in the double digits.  We're about 4 percent.  And I wanted to look at, you know--but we had actually moved from 2 percent to 4.6 percent.  And I wanted to get a--where, you know, what was the trend?  And I wanted to see what the trends in size of company.  So what I saw was big companies were laying off, but why, and they were laying off big.  And I knew those numbers, but why we were at 4.6 and not in the double digits and--like the rest of the country.  Well, the reason why because the small companies were hiring.  And so when you average, the average turns out to be a small, small number.  So I, I took that as a real positive signal that, if we're gonna look at keeping the unemployment in the chemistry field low, we have to create new opportunities with small businesses in creating jobs.
Story_ID: 26880
Speaker 1: So I commissioned a task force, and I went over to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and talked to Professor George Whitesides at Harvard.  I sort of camped out, you know, in his office to meet him.  And, you know, he gave me five minutes, and I only wanted five minutes of his time and asked if he--because he actually--at Harvard, you know, renowned professor in the field.  But he's also--have, you know, created, you know, over ten or fifteen small companies.  So he had that real experience.
Speaker 2: Is he at the business school?
Speaker 1: No, he's a chemistry professor.
Speaker 2: Oh, he's a chemist?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am, he is.  So he now understands how to relate with the chemists, but he also has the business acumen to, how to start.  And I asked him if he would lead a task force to guide the American Chemical Society in developing a roadmap for how we can help young people to start up new businesses if they wanted to.  And the original thought was, take a lot of the guys who spent twenty or thirty years in these big companies, moving from the bench into the management, but now these companies are laying them off.  They're the first ones to be laid off, how to use that experience.  You've got the young guys who have good ideas, but they have no business sense whatsoever, how to bring those two together to, to get that business, you know, over some of the key hurdles.  Young guys don't know how to manage.  They just don't have that.  These guys do.  How to bring those two together to seed small companies?  So that was the, that was the big challenge.  And so we actually have got the American Chemical Society to invest, and we've gotten up an entrepreneurial center.  And President Obama [President Barack Obama] has gotten interest.  I had to go before his Council of Science Advisors to give a briefing, you know, on that.  That was kind of interesting and cool.  We got grilled, but they were very interested.  And, and so we're off and running and seeding young chemists, giving them training and also trying to seed them, and developing business plans to seed them and getting small companies going.  So that was the big challenging one, going in.  And then I did some other things to--that I hadn't planned on, but I just seized the opportunity to make some changes within the organization, to do.  So, and there was a lot of excitement when I was president, and a lot of things happening, and a lot of changes that took place.  A lot of the committees jumped onboard.  Even now, the current president, her platform is a global platform.  She's building upon, you know, what I started.  A lot of the committees have now taken on the entrepreneurial, you know, initiative, and they're really developing programming in their divisions to develop that.  And, you know, that's been exciting and good.  So I've had a, you know, major impact in the organization that way.
Speaker 2: You know, that--I find that fascinating because I've been telling, you know, a lot of people in the business community, "You need to check out these scientists over there.  You could make lots of money together."  But, you know, so I think that, I thought that your--that whole thing is fascinating.  And I just came from something where there were a lot of young STEM [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics], entrepreneurs, actually--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I (simultaneous)--that's exactly right.  And I think that's really, just really, really great, you know, to do.  And I always like when I go and visit schools and invited to give a talk, and they give me an opportunity to talk to the, you know, graduate students.  I, one of the questions I ask, "How many of you wanna be your own boss?"
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, you can be your own boss.  I think with my generation, I remember when talking to my peers about their job and where they saw their future, it was either, you know, going into academia, you know, or government lab or going for a blue chip company like DuPont, and, you know, IBM and, etc., you know.  But now, a lot of these kids don't want that.  They wanna get out there and strike on their own.  I applaud them, and I wanna really support them in, in, in that.
Story_ID: 26881
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you, 'cause you're, you've been in this area for a while--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and I'd like to know what research you would like to do, that you haven't done?  And, and why?
Speaker 2: Hmm, well, that's a very good question.  It's very interesting that you're asking this question now.  And so I'm gonna, just cut to the chase and just tell you.  I don't have a quest-- an answer to that question, but it's a question I have really been thinking about.  And, you know, and what precipitated me really asking that question is that, so now, I've been elected to the American Academy.  Now, I've been elected to the National Academy.  It's the highest in the field.  I've been president, you know, of the American Chemical Society, president of NOBCCHE.  You know, what's next?  Yeah, NOBCCHE is the National Organization for Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers.  So, you know, what's, what's, what's next.  And so what more, you know, could I do and what new ways, you know, could I contribute.  Certainly, I've demonstrated I can contribute and have an impact with the science.  I've shown that I can contribute and, you know, have an impact in the, you know, in the service, you know, to the community and policy, you know, realm and program development.  I've shown I can have an impact in the classroom.  And so, you know, what' the new territory and the opportunities out there?  So, and that's a good question that you ask.  I don't have an answer.  It's something I'm seriously, you know, thinking about.  But I will say right now, the answer I have is continue to do some good science and look for, you know, the opportunity to have, and make a contribution.  When I look at everything that I've done, I've looked for the opportunity, and I've looked--I've been very true to what I could bring to the table to, you know, to contribute and do.  And so I will continue to do, you know, those things.
Story_ID: 26882
Speaker 1: You mentioned one other thing I wanna--you mentioned, is it Henry Hill, the one who, Henry--
Speaker 2: Hill who was the president, um-hum--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You didn't talk about his presidency.  And I was wanting, 'cause I wanted to sort of tie that into, into Percy Julian because--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --the American Chemical Society was sort of late on the recognition of Percy Julian--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, well--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and so I'm wondering how that all happened, came--
Speaker 2: Ooh, that's a very interesting--American Chemical Society is a very complex organization.  You know, it's very big.  It's, you know, our council is like the House of Representatives.  And I really don't know how we really get anything done.  Well, I know how to get things done.  In fact, I was told how to get things done, and, and I exploited that when I stepped in the presidency.  And I, and, but if you try to rely upon the usual mechanisms of working through the, the divisions, you know.  There're over thirty divisions, twenty committees, and then you have a council and you try to work from ground up to (unclear), it will take years for anything to make it up to the board of director, you know, for action.  If you're not strategic when you're in the role of president--remember, you have one year as president-elect.  One year as president, and one year as an immediate past-president, and your key year to really get anything done is in that president year.  So if you're not strategic about what you wanna do and lay the framework in the year before, you won't be effective, you know, as well.  So I, you know, I've been pretty, you know, effective as, in the role of, you know, of president, and been very, very strategic, you know, in what I've done and how I used the system in order to get what I need done through.  So it's history.  The American Chemical, as I said, that just sort of describes the complex--I was just framing the whole complexity.  So, you know, in the '70s [1970s] as, I'll take pioneers like Bill [William] Jackson, you know, Bill [William] Lester, Ferguson, who you've interviewed--
Speaker 1: Lloyd Ferguson.
Speaker 2: Lloyd Ferguson, who you--these are actually the pioneers and founders of NOBCCHE.  Well, you know, that group, it was group of five of them, you know, Bill Jackson, Lloyd Ferguson, Bill [William] Guillory, a chap in chemical engineering who, who's since passed on.  There was another one, but these guys went up to the American Chemical Society and said, "Look, it'd be good if, you know, you formed a group where we can have a voice in the chemistry community through the American Chemical Society."  And it was just having a committee and a group.  But that was denied.  And denying that, you know, gave--
Speaker 1: Birth to the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --to the genesis and birth of, you know, of NOBCCHE [National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers].  Well, the American Chemical Society have, there have been other cases through organizations who had approached American Chemical Society for giving them a voice, and that voice hasn't really been heard or acknowledged, and that gave genesis and birth to other spin-offs.  And that's just because of just the real, sheer, complexity.  And people wanna do something and have it done now, you know, within a few months.  And that organization, through its whole infrastructure, can't respond in, you know, in that way.  And I've just learned, you know, why a lot of that, you know, by being at that, the top of that organization, you know, why that happens.
Story_ID: 26883
Speaker 1: But in terms of, you know, Percy Julian, in terms of Henry Hill, you know, Henry being the president [of the American Chemical Society].  You know, he was really a very good president, and also, you know, very effective.  But, there's always a question of legacy, you know, what have you left behind, left a legacy?  Now, he's left, I think a very important, you know, imprint and footprint that led to legislation looking at employment practice in the chemical industry, and that had a real, you know, big, big, big impact.  And so in that timeframe, you know, he did have that impact.  I think he also opened the door for the election of the first, you know, woman president of the American Chemical Society.  That was Ana Harrison because, you know, a lot of the questions about, you know, his election and would he be successful and how would he represent the American Chemical Society, he did it with great dignity, and he did leave an impact.  That just opened the door, you know, for others.  So, but I think the American Chemical Society has struggled in the past with, certainly in the past, I mean the '70s [1970s] and early '80s [1980s], how to--what's the word I'm looking for?
Speaker 2: Diversify or acknowledge or have a larger umbrella?
Speaker 1: Have a, have a meaningful impact, you know, in diversifying, you know, the chemistry field.  It's struggled with that, and even, even now, today, it still struggles, you know, with that because of just--there's so many different divergent, you know, points of views.
Speaker 2: So NOBCCHE was formed in what year?
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-three [1973].
Speaker 2: I see, so that's fascinating that he was elected as president--
Speaker 1: Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 2: --four years after NOBCCHE was created.
Speaker 1: Umm-hmm
Story_ID: 26884
Speaker 1: So what are your feelings about NOBCCHE [National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers] in terms of its role still today?
Speaker 2: Oh, it still has a very, very important role.  In fact, I think it has--its success in what it does and how it reaches kids and the mentoring role, not only in terms of the young kids, but, you know, graduate students, undergraduates, graduate students, even young faculty, you know, no organization, you know, in the field has been able to match.  I know the American Chemical Society [ACS] would love to do what, you know, NOBCCHE, you know, do, but their infrastructure, it doesn't allow them to really have that kind of reach and impact.  And so I see the role of NOBCCHE and the role of ACS really having, really, I wanna say, partnering, you know, and--roles in being able to, you know, impact the number of kids going into chemistry from the full demographics of this country.
Story_ID: 26885
Speaker 1: What I saw, you know, when I was asked to run, you know, for NOBCCHE [National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers] president, I saw an opportunity to, one, give something back and empower members.  I wanted the, I wanted the members to have a greater voice in the organization.  I wanted the organization to serve the members.  And so my goal was to really think about what was programming that members needed that really would, would, would help them.  And so that's how I started when stepping into the office of, you know, president of NOBCCHE, really going about doing--talking with members, finding out what they were, they wanted to see, what they wanted changed.  They're paying their membership dues, and I was just point blank with them.  "You're paying your dues.  What are you getting for your dues?  And, because if you're unhappy with paying that, why would you wanna pay and you're not getting any services?  So what services, you know, did you, do you really need and what should the organization do for you?"  And so my, my goal was to turn it around to say, "Not what you can do for NOBCCHE", you know.  "What should NOBCCHE be doing, be doing for you?"  And in those two years, was changing that whole platform as well and also being really more proactive of going out and fund-raising, you know, to support meaningful, you know, programs that delivered to those who are willing to, you know, to pay.  And so that's what I, I did, and one of the things I also realized too, that African American organizations do very little to-- succession planning.  And what I saw with, you know, other organizations, they do a lot in succession planning.  And African American organizations do very little of succession planning.  And one of the things I wanted to do was to turn that around, you know, as well and put something in place that if the organization was gonna have longevity for the next twenty to thirty years, to make sure it was in good hands, it had to have some kind of succession planning, you know, you know, infrastructure in place, and that was one of the things that I, you know, tried to do as well.
Story_ID: 26886
Speaker 1: Joe, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I have no clue.
Speaker 1: Yes, you do.
Speaker 2: Okay, I wanna be known as a good guy.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: A good dad, a good father--
Speaker 1: You have three girls too?
Speaker 2: I have three girls--
Speaker 1: And a wonderful wife.
Speaker 2: And a great wife, and be a great husband and, you know, leave something behind to, you know, have helped the next generation, but not just do anything--one thing singular.  I'm a believer in organizational structures, like you have to put some structures in place for sustainability.  And so a lot of the things that I've done have left behind so far, structures that allow things to continue to be grow and develop.  So it's not about a singular thing could make a transformation.  It's about, you know, an infrastructure, organization infrastructure to make that transformation, it will continue.  So if you ask me, you know, like you say, that's, I think one of the things that I think if you look deeply into what I've done, you know, from research to teaching to mentoring, to, you know, to, you know, policy, you know, organizational policies, it's been at the infrastructure aspect for sustainability.
Story_ID: 26887
Speaker 1: What, what are your hopes and concerns for the black community as it relates to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I--
Speaker 1: --science and--
Speaker 2: --yeah, saw, I'm concerned about community.  I think if I look at my whole experience, it really was a community throughout.  You know, a safe haven, you know nurturing people, you know, a freedom to, you know, explore, be creative, you know, flexibility.  You know, I worry about our community, you know, of having all those elements for young people there.  I worry about, you know, young kids being so restricted in their safety and concern, that they haven't--they don't have that flexibility to, to explore and that chance to really explore their creative--you know, creativity in the way in which, which I had.  I mean, you know, I often wonder if I was growing up in today's world, you know, I probably would have been, you know, killed, raped, you know, murdered, you know, by some, you know, pedophile, you know, here's a kid, you know, wandering on the streets, and, you know, not thinking about, you know, those kinds of things.  You know, as a kid growing I didn't have to think about all those kind of, kind of things.  But it allowed me that kind of freedom to explore, and I think that kind of freedom in today's environment is very dangerous, you know, freedom.  And I do worry, you know, about that because I know I really benefited, you know, from, from that.
