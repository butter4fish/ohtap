 Gill. Today is October 16, 2009. I   m visiting Mel  Semrad in Stillwater, Oklahoma in the Alumni Center on the OSU  campus. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Mel, I understand you   re  here for a couple of special reasons this weekend. One for you   you  were in the class of    59, your fiftieth reunion. And the other one is?  The other one is my wife is class of    59. And yes, she   s had things going  on all day.  Did a great job. We appreciate it.  Thank you.  Welcome back to OSU.  It   s good to see the campus again, and be here. And Jerry, it   s good to  see you again.  I know part of the answer, but if there wasn   t the Women of Willard  reunion, what special reasons would you have for coming back?  Well, some of the special reason was, of course when we graduated here  on May 24, 1959, that was after we had been married that afternoon.  Right here across the street at the Bennett Memorial Chapel.  Same day?  Same day.  My gosh.  5  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Well, Jerry, our parents were both wheat farmers from western  Oklahoma. Virginia   s parents were from Fargo by Woodward and my  parents in Hunter by Enid. We had talked about it a month or so before  and Virginia made her wedding gown. And she says,    You know,  they   re only going to come to one thing. So do we get married, or do we  graduate or do we do both?    So we did both on the same day.  That   s a great story. You mentioned that you grew up in Hunter. Can  you back up and tell us a little bit about your early life? Where you grew  up, school, your family, brothers and sisters, parents, things like that?  Sure. I grew up three miles west and two miles north of the town of  Hunter. Independent school district back then and my class was a class  of nine. I went there for my first ten years of school and, being a farm  boy, was a pretty good size young man at the time. I was not quite as big  as I am now but not far. And in the process of that we had two miles of  real mud roads to go and the first two years the school bus didn   t come  to where I was. My kids say,    You   ve got to be kidding.    Anyhow, I  rode a pony. And this is where they say,    You have to be kidding, Dad.     I rode a pony a mile south to catch up with another OSU grad in later  years, Ron Smith. Ron and I grew up a mile apart and we to this day go  to all the Big Twelve basketball tournaments, he and his wife go and my  wife and I go.  So at any rate, we went the first ten years there and then my sophomore  year I was injured playing basketball. I still remember my freshman  year. You know when you   re in a small school, you do all the things  they have available. I played basketball, was lucky enough to start on the  high school basketball team when I was a freshman. I   ll never forget, I  was about 5   9     , maybe close to 5   10    and one of the people I had to  guard wound up coming to Oklahoma State. He was 6   7   , I   m 5   9    and  I   d just dodge the elbows as we   d played. His name was Dale Pier and  he and his brother Dennis were from Pond Creek. Anyhow, that   s where  I spent the first ten years and my last two years I went to Enid primarily  to play baseball.  So you didn   t move, you just transferred.  We transferred. What we did, my dad had a cousin who was a custom  wheat cutter. He had two boys and unbeknownst to me, because I wasn   t  aware that for the American Legion team in Enid they were wanting me  to come in and play ball. And my dad and mother didn   t want me to  have a big head or anything, so they just said,    How would you like to  go to school in Enid for your last couple of years   ? And I said,    Well  that sounds pretty interesting.    He said,    Well you could probably play  some ball there,    even though later I found out   and in those days there  6  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  was a little bit more recruiting going on legally than there is today. Went  in and played two years of American Legion ball and went to high  school there the last two years.  We traded homes, literally traded furniture and everything. They lived in  ours, and we lived in theirs. I lived in the east side of Enid. They lived  out on the farm. But I went to the farm. My dad says,    Well you can  play all the ball you want as long as we get the farm work done.    So  many a morning, 4:30 in the morning, we got going to the farm. And  that was in the summertime, of course, to farm and then back in. He  said,    You can play all the ball you want.    And I remember that one  summer, I went and played seventy-two ball games. You   re an athlete,  you know what it   s like to give dedication, but it was relaxation then to  come and get off the farm and play ball and go travel. That was it.  So you graduated from high school there in Enid in what year?  In    55. 1955.  So did you go to Oklahoma State then that fall?  I came to Oklahoma State then that fall, yes.  Is there a story about how you got to Oklahoma State? Did somebody or  something influence you to come to OSU?  Well, it didn   t really pan out. Yes, there is a reason. I had it in mind  because we had a pretty good baseball coach here at Oklahoma State at  that time. You could remember him quite well, I   m sure. But I had a  ruptured disc that year and thought, well   and I was supposed to come  here to play baseball. I came and couldn   t bend over to tie my shoes and  I kept thinking it would get better. So in Cordell Hall I slept on a bed  that I had to put a board underneath it thinking it would continue to get  better. Well by the time I was a junior I could hit and throw and run as  well as over, but they didn   t have DH   s then, Designated Hitters. And I  could not go down and get the low riders, I played outfield. So Mr.  Green, Toby Green, who was the baseball coach said,    Mel, you can hit  and run,    but he says,    I can only use you as a pinch hitter.    So I didn   t  get to play and we won the College World Series then, as you may  recall, later that year. There was a great bunch of guys.  Now were you on that team?  Well, I was to be on that team until I had to say,    No, this is not good for  me taking up one of slots.    But a couple of my fraternity brothers, Mel  Wright and Dick Soergel, they were on the same team, of course. But I  7  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  wouldn   t change things for the way they   ve happened because we   ve  had a great life.  Were you recruited to play baseball at Oklahoma State?  I was encouraged.  Encouraged, okay. Did you get a partial scholarship or anything?  No, no. Because when you   re laying flat on your back in the hospital in  Enid where I was with not much feeling in my left leg, there was only a  hope and prayer that it would go ahead and work itself out. No, I did not.  But had a fun time here at college.  Mel, some significant things happened during your time here. When you  started here it was Oklahoma A M College.  That   s correct, Oklahoma A M College.  The Aggies. And then we changed to Oklahoma State University and the  Cowboys and we went from the old Missouri Valley Conference to the  Big Eight.  That   s right, to the Big Eight.  How did students feel about those changes, particularly the name  change?  Well the name change seemed to go pretty well. I don   t recall any real  animosity, from my perspective anyhow, of changing from OAMC,  which I still remember. We   d go to the football games and it was  OAMC and getting to go to the Oklahoma State University Cowboys, it  seemed different but I don   t recall it being a negative. In fact, I think it  was maybe more positive than anything.  Well do you remember about that same time there was a mascot called  Pistol Pete?  That   s correct.  Do you remember the first Pistol Pete?  I remember Mr. Frank Eaton. I remember watching him in parades and  when he came on. The first year of Pistol Pete, I remember the old  headset that was worn by our first one or two Pistol Petes was most  unique. But I do remember Frank Eaton himself who became the Pistol  8  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Pete as we know him and have known him ever since, our mascot.  What was your major at Oklahoma State?  My major was agriculture economics. Like I said, I grew up on the farm  and I knew there was not any way. Well I had one brother, who was my  middle brother just younger than myself and I knew he was going to  come back to farm. I was the first one that came from my family to  college. And then when we did that, I came and said I would still keep a  little tie to agriculture because I wanted to get into maybe the Ag  business part. So I went into agriculture economics and got a BS in that  and then a MS two years after I graduated from that with some work in  between.  Are there some special classes that you remember and professors that  influenced your life?  Well yes. One of the first professors that I had, his name was Mr. Dilts.  D-I-L-T-S. What was interesting, when I came into his class he says,    I  think I know who your dad and granddad were,    because he had been  out in the Hunter-Garber area when my dad was in high school. And I  still remember one of his sayings. He said,    Yeah, you all had a John  Deere D Tractor.    And I said,    Yes, and I drove that John Deere D  tractor starting when I was about eight years old.    He said,    You know,  that tractor, that   s the one where the piston stands still and the tractor  jumps back and forth.   And Mr. Dilts, he was in the Ag Engineering  department and I   ll never forget that. I   ve told that story many times,  especially to the fellows that go to these antique tractor shows.  Are there any other faculty members that were influential to you and  your personal development when you were here at OSU?  Well, all of them had an impact. It was more when I was in graduate  school. When we graduated and got married, like I say, on the same day,  in ten days I was starting a training program with at that time what was  called CCA, or we would have known it as Farmland Industries  headquartered in Kansas City. I was on a training program. And we  thought we would be in Fort Scott, Kansas for a year, year and a half on  the training program and after three months they sent me back here to  run the co-op here in Stillwater. I said,    Are you sure?    They said,     Look, you   ve been around the co-op, you   re from Ag, you know it.    So  I came back here in August after having just gone to Fort Scott in June.  When I got back, I spent a year running the co-op and then getting to  your question, the head of the Ag Department said,    Mel, while you   re  here, you need to get your master   s.    And I said,    I didn   t go to  9  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  undergrad school to try to get a master   s.    I said,    I was an above  average student and could have been better but probably didn   t apply  myself quite as well.    He said,    Well, you really should.    And I said,     How long is that going to take?    He said,    Well if you   re not working,  you should be able to do this in less than two years.    I said,    I don   t  have money to go beyond one year.    He said,    You don   t know what  you   re asking.    I said,    Yes, I do.    I have to do this in twelve months.  The long ways around your question, the instructor that was teaching  econometrics, I never heard that term before, but he says,    I will help  tutor you.    He said,    If you   re willing   you sound pretty determined  and dedicated to doing it in twelve months,    because there was some  like upper levels of algebra and economics, higher level of economics  but more the trig and calculus. He said,    I   ll help tutor you.    He became  my advisor and we made it   and I say we   in twelve months.  Do you recall his name now?  Well no, Dr. Plaxico was in the department, he was the head of the  department, Jim Plaxico. But no, I don   t recall. How should I ever forget  someone who was very instrumental?  So you did that in one     Two semesters and a summer. And that included the paper.  Wow. And you were still working full time at the co-op.  No. Dr. Leftwich also taught an economics class over in the business  school and I made a C in that course in undergrad and I needed to have a  higher grade than that so I took it over. So there were three hours,  because I was carrying in grad school approximately fifteen hours each  semester and doing my research for the paper. But I   ll tell you what, it  was great training for the future. And I would never go back and try to  do it differently.  Would that have been a pretty young age to manage a co-op, besides  that here in Stillwater?  Yeah, it was. I was approximately twenty-two years old, twenty-one  going on twenty-two. I came when I was twenty-one. And then we  managed a co-op out here. And the co-op, now we did not handle grain,  but it was all the TBA, the tires, batteries, and accessories, the fertilizers  and everything else. They delivered propane and all of that.  Great story. Now coming back to your classroom experience, what  10  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  buildings did you have most of your classes in?  I had several classes in what was the newer classroom building, at that  time right, here close to the Union. And then, of course, I had animal  husbandry and I had classes over in the old dairy building which was  literally where you could get an ice cream cone. But that   s where we had  econ.  The chocolate milk.  The chocolate milk, right. But I had lots of classes there because I was  an Ag Econ major and that   s where the Ag Econ department was.  Where did you live when you were in school before you got married?  Well when I came, for one day I was in Bennett Hall and planned to be  there because no one in my family had ever come and enrolled or gotten  enrolled. But I was here one or two days, it might have been two days,  and a person by the name of Tom Tate (Tom had proceeded me as the  State 4-H Club President) said,    Melvin, why don   t you come live with  me, I don   t have a roommate for this semester yet.    And he was in  Cordell. So I moved in with him. 201 Cordell in the south wing. Great  room because it had windows on both the west side and the north side so  we had a breeze in that corner room, 201. That   s where I spent the first  year and a half   well, the first year. Then I wound up pledging a  fraternity.  Several of the fellows in the fraternity were agriculture majors as well as  business and others, geology majors. I knew two or three of them really  pretty well and there were half a dozen. They encouraged me, and I  didn   t know the first thing about it. I had been an independent and then  went to a fraternity so I had both sides of life in college. I think that was  a great experience to have done both. Then I went over to the Sigma  Alpha Epsilon fraternity house, the SAE house, and lived there the  balance of my time.  So in graduate school then I guess you all were living somewhere in the  community?  Yes. When we came back to Stillwater that would have been in August  and there weren   t a lot of places to find a place to live, because we   d  only been gone, well from early June to mid-August. We found an  apartment just south of the   it   s no longer there because the creek runs  right through it, but there were some apartments and one of our first  major experiences there (and this was on North Main) we had a flood  that year. Our apartment had a lower level and an upper level, and I still  11  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  remember us moving our furniture up on trashcans to keep that furniture  from being flooded. We rented a place just north of the stadium which  was only a block and a half north and that   s where we spent the next  year.  Well backing up a little bit, I understand from a previous interview, your  wife Virginia, when you were dating in college, she was in Willard Hall  and you were in Cordell Hall. Can you go back and share a little bit  about your hall experiences, about living in Cordell and dances, social  activities, share a little bit of the social life?  Yeah. As I said, when I came to college I didn   t have much flexibility  because of a ruptured disc in my back but at the same time I still  remember the first event I went to; it was the Howdy Dance. The Howdy  Dance was a big deal. Eddie Sutton and I have laughed about this for a  long, long time because my first date to the Howdy Dance was Patsy and  she was from Stillwater. Patsy and Eddie and us, when we lived in Iowa  and Nebraska they would come up and we   d get to see them now and  then, you know. And I   m sure Patsy probably remembers. That   s the  only date we had together. But living in the dorm, you were trying to get  acquainted. And I was a freshman. You didn   t date anybody in a dorm  that was going to be willing to stay out very late and I didn   t think about  keeping girls out late at night anyhow. But they always had to be locked  up by, I don   t know, 8 o   clock or 7:30 or something like that.  During the week.  During the week. And then the weekend they got extended hours to like  ten or so.  Well let   s see, speaking of that, do you recall PDA, public displays of  affection? Was that a serious infraction? Can you share with us what  PDA was about?  Well it was, oh you kind of thought, well now who   s putting on the  show tonight with their affection and hugging and especially going over  around Theta Pond because not a lot of us had vehicles then so you  walked a lot of places you went and a lot of the girls dated the guys that  had vehicles. But I   ll tell the one story and I mentioned this to many of  those from the Willard Hall group where my wife lived for the first year  and a half. Her name was Virginia Adams. I remember the first time I  had a date with her. I took her up to the front steps, it was 8 o   clock, she  had to be in. I looked up and in the windows across on the second floor  and the third floor were all of these Willard Hall ladies looking down to  see   and I know what they were   and I thought,    Uh-oh. If I   m dating  one, I   m dating them all.    So Virginia and I had one date my freshman  12  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  year because I could see they were looking down to see if    is he going to  kiss her or not?     Do you recall in those days, did guys have a dorm mom?  No, we didn   t have a dorm mom so to speak.  Dorm dad maybe?  Well we had a floor chairman. Now I was in a south wing of a dorm. We  weren   t as tight as the women were, I don   t believe. I don   t remember  who was overall head of the dorm down in the office area, but we had  our own floor monitors. One other interesting experience, I mentioned  the gentleman I wound up rooming with my freshman year. And in the  first couple of weeks, the interesting part and I   ll just refer to him as  Tom and many of them know who that was because I mentioned that  name a little earlier in the interview. He came in and he was dating  Virginia, who I later married, and who I had the one date with each year  my freshman year and my sophomore year but I took her to some of the  nicest things.  Can you back up? I want to set the story. Tom is the guy, you were state  president of the 4-H club and he was the year before you?  I was state 4-H president. When I came to college I got elected that year.  Tom preceded me. He was the year just ahead of me. So here   s one state  4-H president and then the next.  That   s what I was thinking, the plot sort of thickens.  Well it got a little thicker. Tom, he came in and he was a year older, of  course. And he had his eyes on Virginia because she was state 4-H song  leader so he knew her pretty well, or he thought he did. And Tom would  come in and he   d say,    Oh, I   m in love. I   m in love.    And I said,    What  are you talking about?    And he said,    Do you know who I   m going out  with?    and I said,    Well, I think so. Is it Virginia Adams?    And he said,     Yes.    He said,    You know, she   s so pretty. I just really       He kept  saying it. I said,    Tom, go to sleep. Turn over and go to sleep.    Well that  Virginia wasn   t in any way wanting to get serious with anybody at that  time. In fact, I think her motto that year was she wanted to see if she  could date a lot of different guys.  He came in one evening and he was just bubbling over and I was already  in. He says,    You   ll never guess what happened.    And this is back in the  days when the girls wore hoop skirts, beautiful skirts. But while they  were dancing and whatever her hoop broke and he thought that was the  13  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  funniest   not funny, but the neatest thing that he was trying to fix her  hoop so it would still be a full skirt, you know. But those are just some  of the interesting things back in that day and time.  Let me kind of fast forward here from your college experience but also  from your SAE fraternity experience. Are there some friendships you  made that you still have today?  That   s correct. I lost one of my really good friends that helped me come  into the fraternity. His name was Eddie Fisher. Eddie was from Cushing  and Eddie was a great guy. There were two or three of them who were  strong in agriculture that I really respected and convinced me to come  over and give it a try. Well Eddie became a veterinarian, wound up  going back to Winfield, Kansas. He married a Chi Omega that was in  school here and set up his veterinary practice. In the latter part of about a  year ago, that was in 2008, Eddie was unfortunately killed by one of his  own herd bulls in their pen. Eddie is recognized in lots of parts of  Oklahoma State, Oklahoma A M, Vo Ag, FFA; he was strong in FFA  and Vo Ag. His dad was a Vo Ag instructor. Eddy was a great guy. His  sister Bonnie Fisher married a real close friend of mine who took my cap  and gown when we got married and graduated that evening, Don  Muegge who was from Lamont, Oklahoma. I handed him the cap and  gown and I said,    Donnie, you already know.    He was Ag Econ and I  was Ag Econ. He knew he was going to get this cause we   d been  married in the afternoon, graduated that evening and when I got my  diploma I handed him the cap and gown, kept the diploma. Handed him  the cap and gown and we took off on our honeymoon to Colorado.  Where did you go on your honeymoon?  We went to Estes Park, Colorado primarily.  And do you live in Colorado now?  We live in Colorado now. We live in the southern part, South Fork,  Colorado. Beautiful country. And I know I said for years and years after  putting up hay so much when I was young and in the hot humid hay-mow  of Hunter, Oklahoma, I thought, I   m going to retire someplace  where it   s not so humid, and so we live in southern Colorado full time.  And just again, talking about some of your general experiences, we   re  talking about where you live   this is Homecoming weekend.  Yes.  What do you remember about Homecoming back then? Was  14  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Homecoming as big then as it is today?  No. I   m sure it was Homecoming. One of the first ones I remember, the  Air Force Academy started football after it was involved and I believe     now I   m not totally positive but it   s the first Homecoming I recall. We  had the Air Force Academy here that we were playing in football. And  in fact, I believe the quarterback for Colorado   s name was Mayo, M-A-Y-  O. I remember that because the floats. I   ve never seen floats quite like  that before. And of course Homecoming is very, very significant. That   s  the first one I really remember at Oklahoma State. And we   ve come  back many times. Well, several times to Homecoming over the years.  And as a student in SAE did you enter the float competition each year?  Yes. Yes.  At that time was there more emphasis on floats and a little bit less on  house decorations?  Well it was to a degree. At our house, because we were the one that had  the eight big white columns and covered the whole block, the Sigma  Alpha Epsilon house usually tried to do both. And yes, there was more  emphasis on the floats at that time. But we did that and they still do the  house decorations. Because it   s like a three story house that   s long. It is  a colonial style home.  What student activities and student leadership opportunities,  organizations you were engaged in?  Well one of the first things that I became involved with I said I don   t  want to be an officer in it. Tom happened to be president of it, Tom  Tate. It was the collegiate 4-H club, so I became involved in that.  Became involved in the independent party on campus in campus politics.  I was involved in that. The Aggie X Club, which was the Agriculture  Economics Organization. And then the Wesley Foundation, to an extent.  I wasn   t heavily involved but I attended there a lot. But the Aggie X  Club, the Intercollegiate Club and then as we progressed was a member  of Blue Key which was one of the honorary societies. Wound up being  president of the Junior Class here at Oklahoma State.  And I say, a lot of these things worked together because I   d been  independent for a year, about a year, but then pledged second semester.  So I knew a lot of the independents and then became a part of the Greek  system and the Inter-fraternity Council, I was a part of that. One of the  things that became a real   well that year I was just fortunate enough to  be named to the Oklahoma 4-H Club Hall of Fame and Oklahoma   s  15  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  always been strong in 4-H and Future Farmers of America. I was  fortunate enough to be selected when I was here in college to be an  exchange person with a Canadian 4-H delegation. Four of us were  selected from the United States to go to Toronto and they then sent four  back down to us the following year. And this was from the country, not  just from Oklahoma.  How long did you stay there, Mel?  We were there like a week to ten days. And one of the real highlights  you think of people   because I was an ardent baseball fan and loved the  sport and even though I couldn   t play, and I still remember coming back  on that plane from Toronto to St. Louis to Oklahoma City. The person I  sat right next to was Stan Musial. Stan Musial,    Stan the Man,    a grand,  grand gentleman. And I   ll never forget talking to him because I said,     Mr. Musial?    He says,    It   s Stan.       You have sons, are they going to be  baseball players?    He said,    One is an exceptionally good baseball  player.    And I   ll never forget this. He said,    But he doesn   t want to  follow me because of his name. He   s probably as good as I am.    Well I  said,    What   s he going to do?    He said,    He   s also a very good football  quarterback.    And he wound up going to be the second team quarterback  at the University of Purdue. But Stan Musial, you talk about people that  have an influence, it   s not all about what you want your kids to do or  like to see them do but help them be the best at what they want to do.  And that   s kind of where I   ve come out over time.  Did you get his autograph?  No, I didn   t get an autograph.  Thinking back, we   re here during Homecoming. Obviously Homecoming  is a tradition. Were there other student traditions, activities that you  remember were important at that time?  Well, one of the things then was basketball in the winter time. Sure,  there were things going on a little bit socially and some dances, but  going to the basketball games was the highlight. It was especially for me  having been involved in athletics and  having  played basketball. So we  loved doing that and one of my fraternity brothers, a great guy, I was  playing baseball with him and like I said, I couldn   t get back on the  field, was Mel Wright. Mel was from Amarillo and a great guy. Knew  his wife quite well. Mel played centerfield and I was also an outfielder  and we looked to do that together. But when Mel made the winning shot  and beat KU and Wilt Chamberlain, it was like this whole town erupted.  I think the whole stadium erupted, Jerry.  16  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Now was that the shot that   .  The shot that was heard around the world. That is exactly right.  I   ve heard that told so many times.  Well I was so fortunate. I was on the end of the court (which would have  been the south end) where Mel launched that shot out past the semi-circle.  And I was on the fourth row of the bleachers so I was down on  the lower section and it was like pandemonium broke out.  That   s great. So sports and of course wrestling were probably pretty big.  Basketball, football games. Were there other social activities, things you  did for fun or entertainment?  Well yes, in my senior year I became president of the Sigma Alpha  Epsilon fraternity, so you were involved with a lot of things from  helping to promote academics as well as intramural sports. But one of  the big things was social and learning your social graces. And we had  one of the most wonderful   we called her mom, Mom Woods. We had  one of the most wonderful house mothers one could ever expect to have.  And so we did that and the special thing of the year was the Plantation  Ball, and I think it   s still today a very, very prominent thing, but back  then it was probably the premier social event on campus. And I said I  dated Virginia once my freshman year, once my sophomore year, and  then took her to the Plantation Ball my junior and senior years and by  the time we were seniors we were pretty serious. In fact, we were  engaged. But that was key, along with Inter-fraternity Council things I  went with, because I was president of the fraternity and involved in  some campus things and Virginia was class officer in her sophomore  year.   Can you think of  favorite hangouts both on-campus and off-campus?  Where did students gather?  What were some  popular places?  Well, of course in my situation, it was mostly on-campus or close by.  One of the first pizza places was right down here on south Washington.  And I   m not sure it was called the Hideaway then, but I remember  having pizza for the first time right there. Another meeting place was the  Edmon Low Library. You went to study and you also went to look at the  girls. And you went to maybe have a date and go to the library and the  Student Union. Those were the primary things. If you were fortunate  enough to have a car or have a buddy with a car maybe you double  dated. I didn   t have a vehicle and couldn   t afford one until the latter part  of my senior year, but those are the things we did.  17  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Talk about the library now. There were dress codes as I recall back  then?  Yes, yes.  What about those?  We had dress codes for lots of   although, we didn   t wear our work  clothes. We didn   t wear our tattered clothes or our shorts. I still  remember, my main jacket that I wore and Virginia used to get   and I  still have it   was the old   well I had two. My letter jacket from Enid  High School, which I still have. And then the finest leather jacket from  the George E. Failing Company in Enid who was the world   s first  portable core drilling company. He sponsored ball teams. He had four  teams that year. We won the state championship and it was a red and  white lined, beautiful leather. The only thing though is it was red and  white as I think about it, Jerry. And so that   s the reason it didn   t get  worn a whole lot more because we were orange and black.  Now as I recall, the women had to wear dresses, is that right?  Yes, that   s right. That   s what was neat   and that   s not to say they   re not  classy people today but the women did have to dress up. They had a  stricter code probably than we did. But a lot of that was probably the  fashion, more self imposed. I always thought, they   re looking real, real  good. Back then it was about 80  male on the campus and about 20   female, and they had their choices. But we as the men will   and  remember me talking about Eddie Fisher. We would wear a lot of times  starched shirts, stiff collars if we were going to be out on campus. And  today you wouldn   t see that. It   s just not the fashion today.  You mentioned cars. What percentage of students had cars on campus at  the time?  I would say it was less than 10 , probably more like 4-5 .  Very few?  Very few. And those that had them were   it was kind of the old term the  cat   s meow. They got the good dates. They flaunted it too, so     You mentioned a lot of good experiences you had. Looking back, what  were some special memories you have of your undergraduate experience  at Oklahoma State? What do you think back on and what stands out in  your mind?  18  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Well one of them, like I say athletics was always big. I played a lot of  intramural basketball, football and softball. And I still remember when  our fraternity happened to have won the intramural basketball  championship for the whole college, the campus. So us having done that,  we got to play the freshman team of the Oklahoma State Cowboys. And  some of these names and three of the players on the Cowboys there on  the freshman team, at least two of them   well I know Moe Iba, I  guarded Moe. But I   d watched Moe play before and I knew he really just  went one way. But he was a dead eye shooter. We also got to scrimmage  a couple of other times that had more than just the freshman and that  included Eddy Bunch and Cecil Epperly. They were Stillwater products  and very, very good athletes and very good basketball players. That   s  one that sticks out in my mind. The freshman team beat us two points  that night in Gallagher   well Gallagher Hall, they called it then. It  wasn   t Gallagher-Iba yet, it was Gallagher Hall.  So did you shut Moe down a little bit?  I did. And I would see Moe in years later when he was doing some head  coaching at the University of Nebraska because we were in Omaha and  we kind of remembered each other.  Good times. Were there any key events that occurred of historical  significance that stand out? I   m not going into social things, but was  there a presidential visit, a key event that happened in your time at  OSU?  Well it was right at the tail end of it when Oklahoma State was major     in fact it probably really started here. We had the Point Four Program  and that was winding down. I was always impressed with that. But see,  we were moving closer then to getting into   well I was subject to the  draft, was drafted. And because of that back injury I was classified like  4-F or 4-D; wasn   t 4-A. And I thought, I want to get this out of the way  because everyone was very sensitive to helping protect your country.  And you know, we had the Korean War and later others that came along.  But I still remember,  I thought,  I need to do this. Not that I necessarily  totally wanted to, but I needed to do it. So I went, got my physical and I  couldn   t pass the physical. So then I went ahead and was able to go to  work. But that was a significant time there in the fifties and then on into  the sixties. And things started changing quite a bit in the sixties when I  was starting graduate school, even the music and things going on in  California, that was starting to spread around the country some. But  those were kind of significant things.  As we talk, I can see that spark in your eye as you   re telling of some  special feelings. What is it about Oklahoma State University that sparks  19  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  such loyalty in students as alumni?  Well I   d say there   s two or things that stick out in my mind. I know  people that ask me,    You were in agriculture. You came from small  town America,    which I did. Well a little town like Hunter, Oklahoma,  even though I went to Enid my last two years. But I think Oklahoma  State, because of its mix and its friendliness, has helped over time  people adapt to whatever they need to face in the world. Now sure, not  everyone does that. But I think it   s been very significant to see people  who have gotten their basic education here and their training and then go  off into a career. Back then, we were the first generation that really left  home, so to speak, and it helped prepare us. But I think today, there   s  some big loyalty there and we keep with a lot of OSU graduates,  especially of the    59-   60 class, and they might have received their  education in one discipline but then they wound up in another one, just  like I did because going from a trainee and running a farmer   s co-op and  then into extension, which is agriculture, and then farm and ranch  broadcasting and then into the natural gas business. So a lot of the basic  principles that you learn through school here that would help you  prepare for what you   re going to face in life and around the world.  Can you summarize your life, your career after you left Oklahoma State  University? You were at the co-op and then finished your master   s.  Where did you go from there?  Well, I said I needed to get out in a year, which I did. The degree was  actually conferred, I believe it was the following January, but I finished  up my paper in late July of that year, turned it in. It was approved. It was  a research paper. That would have been in    61. Then, I went into  extension. We wound up going to Guymon, Oklahoma in the middle of  the panhandle and I was head of the 4-H club programs for Texas  County.  You were a county extension agent?  Yeah, I was county extension agent and 4-H was my prime  accountability because we also had a couple of regional agents. One was  a regional engineer and we had Bob Sheets, who was the official main  county agent. But we had some wonderful people. So I was there for  four or five years, four years maybe. And then because there was some  top notch 4-H club members there and I loved what I was doing because  I had been a 4-H club member and we had a real good rapport, I did,  with those kids, we were called to go to Amarillo to a radio/TV station.  Because I had one trio of singers, they were beautiful young women,  very, very down to earth young women, but tremendous singers. One  went on to be Miss Wheatheart of the Nation as the queen. One of them  20  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  went on to be the third runner-up of the Miss Teenage America pageant.  And the third one who played the piano was a really good musician. But  I was called,    Can you bring your kids to Amarillo to the KGNC  Radio/TV    for what was called The Farm and Home Show. They said,     We want to do an hour special with these 4-H club kids on a Saturday.     I said,    Well yeah, we will.     Took them down and I also had the National 4-H Achievement Winner  from our county and the state winner who had gone on a trip to Houston.  At any rate, we went down. We did the show. And as we got ready     towards the end of the show, the person   s name that was interviewing  us, kind of like what you   re doing, was Cotton John. Cotton John Smith.  Cotton John asked me about my background and how these kids became  so good and I just gave all the credit to the kids. And when it was over  he said,    Mel, come here. I want to talk to you.    So I went back to his  office and I thought,    Uh-oh, did I screw up on the program?    He says,     I   d like to talk to you about going to work for me.    And that   s how I  got into the   and after about four months I finally agreed to do that and  went into the farm and ranch broadcasting. And then from that     How long were you with the radio station?  I was there from    65 to    68, a little over three years and got to do some  great things. Texas Farm Bureau took a Market Builders tour of Europe  and I got selected from one of those from the great state of Texas to go  promote Texas products along with about eight or nine other farm either  broadcasters, radio or TV, or newspaper writers. Toured seven countries  of Europe and anyhow, that was a real highlight. I showed many a film.  It was all black and white then, there was no color. It was all black and  white.  Is there a story about how you go from radio to gas and energy?  Well it would have been 1968, I know it was    68 because it was the year  after our daughter was born in 1967 in Amarillo. I got the call that  morning and I had already taken my wife to the hospital. So I got to  announce my daughter   s birthday on the air that morning and that was a  highlight. And then in    68 I was asked on a reference for someone that     it was Northern Natural Gas but their distribution division was People   s  Natural Gas. And they wanted to serve the irrigation market in Texas,  primarily the Texas Panhandle. They asked me about a person who had  applied for that job. In fact, I knew the person that was interviewing; he  was from Oklahoma originally, he happened to go to the University of  Oklahoma. But anyhow, they said,    What do you know about him?    I  said,    He   s a good man. He knows agriculture, he   s well-respected. He   s  very honest, and he   s good.     21  Gill  Semrad  Two weeks later they bring in another group again and he said,    Mel, I  want to talk to you a minute.    I said,    Well how did your interview go?     He said,    The interview went very well and the gentleman would like to  have it. But why don   t I talk to you about this job?    I said,    Dean, I  don   t know anything about the gas business. Not one thing.    He said,     You know what? You know agriculture and the people in these five  states know you. We   ll teach you the gas business.    I spent thirty-two  years in the gas business, and that   s how it came about.  As you moved up the ladder, you moved up to some major management  responsibilities, I understand.  Well, yes, I   ve been very fortunate. Like I say, I credit a lot of training,  even changing from the little town of Hunter to Enid, then going to  college and not knowing what I was getting into, to Oklahoma State or  Oklahoma A M. But what occurred here is that from getting into the  gas business, which I knew nothing about, Agri culture  Supervisor of  Market Development in the Texas Panhandle and at KGNC Radio/TV in  Amarillo, there was one other requirement. I always believed in taking  your best tools with you. And one of the things, I said,    If we   re going to  do this, and we   re primarily going to be serving the agriculture market  for irrigation and feed lots (didn   t have what we call town-plant  operations in Texas, in other words serving towns) I want to have ten  minutes of what we   ll call    The People   s Natural Gas Irrigation  Report.       They said,    What?    I said,    Yeah. I want to have ten minutes  of airtime every day on this radio station and TV station because that   s  when farmers listen. But I want five minutes of the weather in my  report.     So I got the weather person, we sandwiched it, and I put the weather  news within my ten minute show. And the proof was in the pudding  watching it over the next year and a half. We hooked up over 10,000  irrigation wells, most of them in the Texas Panhandle but that included  Southeast Colorado, Southwest Kansas, Oklahoma Panhandle, Western  Oklahoma, and part of New Mexico. And our competitor, I know,  literally almost had heart attacks. He would sit up at noon rather than  going to lunch and watch my show to see what I was talking about next.  And it was all honest stuff because we developed some tremendous  programs.  From there, they asked me in 1970 to come up to the Midwest which  was big time area for natural gas distribution and I became Supervisor of  Market Development for two states up there. Then was made a district  manager in Eastern Iowa. Came back as Head of Marketing and  Advertising. Became over a little bit of time, they had me in government  relations and economic development for Northern, and their advertising.  22  Gill  Semrad  Gill  Semrad  Then back into People   s and became the Iowa area manager over all  aspects.  Then got a call one day, the president of the company calls and says,    I  need to visit with you.    I said,    Uh-oh     It was another one of those  things kind of like the Amarillo experience. I thought,    Where have I  really messed up?    He came over and he said,    You know, I really like  what I   ve seen. The way people respond with you and you respond to  the people.    I said,    Well the people are what make the difference. It   s  your people.    He said,    I want to put you in charge of all of the  operations in all five states.    First of all he had made me a vice president  and then when he came over to do that, I became a senior vice president.  And I traveled a lot, but I have always remembered your main assets are  your people. And I know at that point in time I had 1,700 employees and  I think I could have called 95  of them by first name when I saw them  (a trait I am not as good at today (laughs) as I was). But I still remember  if you treat your people right, and they respect you and know you   re  honest and it   s not fake, they will make you successful.  You spoke very positively about your ties over the years with Oklahoma  State University. What has kept you connected to Oklahoma State? From  my personal experience, I know for about twenty-plus years you   ve gone  to the Big Eight and Big Twelve basketball tournaments, you   ve stayed  connected with the university, even when you were three states away.  What   s the appeal, what   s the tie there that   s kept you so close to OSU?  Well, two things. One is, I believe Oklahoma State had a major impact  on my life by allowing me to   I knew nothing about business when I  came to school here but I was in Ag Econ. It helped me adapt. I believe  when someone or something has been that helpful to you, at least I have  given the credit there, so I still have a fondness of that. And our son  wound up coming here to Oklahoma State, as well. I think that   s the  major thing. And it   s like home, because it   s a friendly, an aspiring  university, it   s one that has all walks of life. And in all my work, it   s all  walks of life. I think it helped train me, or helped prepare me, even more  to do things. I didn   t know what I was going to be doing necessarily next  but it helped me adapt. I have just had that, where give to the world the  best you have and the best will come back to you. I really believe that.  Mel, we   ve covered a lot of things. Is there anything we   ve left out? Are  there any comments you would like to make about your OSU experience  or being back for Homecoming or just anything we failed to address?  Well, not that we probably failed to address, but the greatest thing, two  things. One is, my major aspirations (and the guys all around me that I  played ball with and all) was to play professional baseball. I think the  23  Gill  Semrad  Gill  good Lord   s watched after me and helped me work through all of that. I  have no hesitation for the fact that I didn   t get to, I knew a lot of those  guys. I knew how it could be when the scouts are following you and  doing all of that stuff, I think if that would have happened, I   m not sure I  would have the family I have today. Virginia has been wonderful for me.  She   s a very talented woman. She was very talented here in the school.  And I have no regrets. I would say it had major impact on my life.  Mel, thanks. I appreciate you taking time to be with us and taking a  break from all the Homecoming activities. I   m sure you want to get out  there to Walk Around.  Jerry, it   s been most enjoyable. And as I told you yesterday when we  saw each other, you have done major contributions to the university  yourself as I   ve known you as you were head of the OSU Alumni  Directorship.  Thank you.  -------  -------
