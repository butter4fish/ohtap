Victoria Petermarm: So this is Victoria Petermann with Laura Clark Brown. It’s the 5th of
June, 2013, at the Love House, and we will be talking about her work as an archivist including
her work in the UNC Southern Historical Collection. So, thank you so much, Laura, for being
here.

Laura Clark Brown: Thank you.

VP: So first off I’d like you to tell me a little bit about your childhood.

LCB: Okay. Well I was born in New Orleans. I spent my childhood living in New
Orleans in the actual city. My parents were both academics who worked at the University of
New Orleans. My father is a historian and he worked in the history department at the University
of New Orleans, or UNO, and my mother was an English instmctor and she also worked at UNC
in the English department. So our home was in a neighborhood in New Orleans very close to the
university on what’s known in New Orleans as the Lakefront, and that’s the house and
neighborhood where I grew up. I went to Catholic school from nursery school through eighth
grade and went to two different schools. For kindergarten through fourth grade I was at a
parochial school, a parish Catholic school, and then in fifth grade I moved to Ursuline Academy,
which is an all-girls K through twelve, but I only stayed there till eighth grade. Then for high
school I went to a magnet school, Benjamin Franklin High School, which at that time you had to
test to get into and maintain a certain GPA to stay in. It was very much a college preparatory
magnet school.

Growing up in New Orleans I think was instmmental in forming who I am and I still very

much consider it my home. I think the people of most places like to think of their home as being

exceptional, but I think New Orleans has a [Laughs] fair claim to that. The diversity of the
population, racially for example, was really—. It was just natural to me, and I never experienced
direct segregation, even though at the time that I was in elementary school in the mid-1970s
there was [long pause] certainly still a lot to be done in terms of desegregating. But the schools
where I went had African American students and also Creoles of color and that’s what I grew up
with and that was very natural to me. I didn’t know otherwise. So I think that really ended up
shaping my perspective on race, for example, because unlike in I think many other Southem
cities where there’s a lot of separation of the races, just always being in an integrated
environment I think provides you with a different perspective.

VP: So, that sort of different perspective, how did that—? Obviously you took that into
college with you, so what sort of differences did you see then going to the University of Texas
after that?

LCB: Right. Well, Texas was a little bit of a culture shock to me. I mean as a young
person I had traveled with my family, been on vacations, spent a fair amount of time in
Baltimore, which is where my father’s from, but actually living in another place, Texas was the
first place I had done that, and it was during the college experience. One of the things I noticed
right off, aside from the very obvious sort of accents and expressions [Laughs] that I had never
heard before, and likewise I had expressions from New Orleans that made no sense to anyone.
Sort of the classic is in New Orleans when you want your sandwich to have lettuce, tomato,
pickle, and mayonnaise you say you want your sandwich “dressed.” Well, [Laughs] when you
say that to someone in Texas, like a waiter, “I’d like my sandwich dressed,” they look rather
puzzled. So, you know, I started to become very keenly aware of the differences in dialect and

things like that.

But one of the major differences that I noticed was that it seemed to me that a lot of the
people that I was in school with had not had much exposure to really anything beyond their, what
seemed to me to be, rather homogenous communities, and not a lot of people from—. It’s kind of,
a little bit like the University of North Carolina where you have a lot of students coming in from
very mral parts of North Carolina. Texas is the same way, and they’re—. Well, it depends.
Obviously in the more southern part of Texas at that time there was a—and this would have been
the late 19805, early 19905—there was certainly large Latino populations, mostly Mexican
American, in the southern part of Texas. So those from that part did have, you know, perhaps
more exposure to people different from themselves, [Laughs] whereas a lot of people from the
other parts of Texas that were coming to college had led frankly what seemed to me to be a very
sheltered life and hadn’t had the same kinds of experiences that I had. It was interesting to see
them without parents. Here I was, I was their peer, I was the same age as them, this was my ﬁrst
experience in college, but having grown up in New Orleans it wasn’t as though I was set free
[Laughs] by going to college, and I had the sense that that’s how these other college students
were reacting. All of a sudden they weren’t under their parents’ thumb, and a lot of them went a
little, you know, a little overboard, or a lot overboard. I guess I felt like I didn’t need to do that
[Laughs] because having grown up in New Orleans I had spent a lot of my time having a lot of
fun. That’s just how the city is. I mean I could go into [Laughs] more detail about that if you
want.

VP: [Laughs]

LCB: So those were some of the differences I noticed. This was at the height of political
correctness on university campuses, and 50 that was very interesting, experiencing that in Texas,

because there was a lot—. You know this is where the academic departments were very concerned

Brown 8

with the language of race, and gender, and class, and sexual orientation, and sort of the other side
of it was that these liberal academics are hypersensitive, and these are just terms and they don’t
mean anything, and why are they getting so upset about it and not really seeing below the
surface. So I was rather appalled as I saw fraternities do just blatantly disgustingly raci5t things,
like do you remember very recently there was that incident at Duke—

VP: Yes.

LCB: —where there was an A5ian-themed party and there were all these stereotypes. Well
that sort of thing happened when I was in college and it wa5—. I just couldn’t believe it. I was
like, [Laughs] when is this? It’s interesting because you always expect the rest of the world to be
where you are when you are considering a matter, or the way that you see the world. You expect
that others are right there with you. So that was very eye-opening. I guess the combination of
having grown up in New Orleans with parents who were academics, a very academically
oriented family, that I, sort of experiencing the—. I’m trying to be careful here and not sort of
generalize or stereotype folks in Texas, but some of the more conservative, very, very religious
[long pause] folks in Texas, how they almost seemed threatened by, [Laughs] like I was saying,
the political correctness of the time. They seemed to really be defensive about that and unwilling
to bend, and that really did take me aback and I think probably energized me to some extent in
feeling even more strongly. So maybe going from sort of taking it for granted that people were
people, and I was accustomed to being around all different types of people, to now feeling, given
what I was seeing in Texas, given [fraternities] having Sambo parties and just horrifying things
like that, I realized that it wasn’t a given, 50 it probably made me a little bit more energetic

politically to consider these things.

I’m trying to think. I did go to a typical college campus, there were some prote5t5 on
campus, and I did attend those. I remember specifically attending a protest against that fraternity
that had that party. There was also, at the time—thi5 kind of swings towards the women’s issue.
At the time I was at Texas there was a gubernatorial race, and it was when Ann Richards, who
was the first and I’m pretty sure the only woman governor of Texas, a Democrat, very, very
charismatic woman, but she was rum1ing against a Republican, a kind of good ol’ boy Texan, I
think his name was Clayton Williams. During the election, or during the campaigning, he was
quoted making a joke about rape, and his joke was something to the effect of, “It’s like bad
weather. You can’t do anything about it 50 just sit back and enjoy it,” or something to that effect.
Well that obviously enraged a lot of people. Here again, I was just appalled, like, what is this? I
don’t understand. I’ve never really been around folks like this. So in an odd way I was isolated
from [Laughs] what was very commonplace in Texas and what I experienced they were very
isolated from.

So, anyway, I did attend, and there was a lot of talk at that time—well, there almost always
i5—about Roe v. Wade and abortion rights, and I became at that time very, very prochoice and
attended rallies and things and also prote5t5. I think there was someone who Visited the campus
from a very, very right-wing group that was prolife or anti-choice, and I remember on my car
having a bumper sticker. I think it said something like, “Pro-child, pro-family, prochoice,” and
that’s how I felt. Having been raised a Catholic, you know Catholics of course are—. The
Catholic faith obviously pu5he5 a prolife position, and having gone to Catholic school I
remember in eighth grade writing an essay for my religion class, because we actually had
religion class. It was an argumentative essay and I had written an essay against choice. It was a

prolife position. I was thirteen years old, didn’t really know much of anything about it, but

Brown 10

ba5ically could not see any reason why there would be a need for an abortion, taking that very
narrow View of, “It’s a life and if you can’t raise the child then put it up for adoption,” kind of
thing where it wasn’t at all seeing the whole picture.

But I think like many young people who then go off to college and experience new things
like I was experiencing, their Views start to change in some cases, and mine certainly did. I mean
I wasn’t active in any kind of prolife movement in high school or anything like that. I probably
didn’t give it a whole lot of thought. But in college I became very much prochoice, and I
remember there was a course I took and I couldn’t tell you what the professor’s name was or
even what department it was in, but essentially it was a seminar and we explored all of these ciVil
rights issues. Now, looking back at it, I think, “Wow, that was really quite a class for that time
period.” It’s something you would almost expect to see here in 2013, not so much in 1990 in
Texas, but we looked at not just again sort of the classic story of the ciVil rights movement,
Martin Luther King, and very focused on African Americans. But rather we looked at women’s
rights, LGBT rights. That was my first exposure to that as an issue at all and that was very eye-
opening. Of course here again New Orleans had made gays and lesbians and tran5gender5 a norm
to me. It was not something that was foreign to me, but obviously—. I keep 5aying“obViou51y.”
[Laughs] Maybe it’s not obvious that the general View, especially at that time, was that
homosexuality wa5 deviant and that that was not normal behavior and needed to be curbed, and
certainly not mainstreamed, if you will.

But in this course, [pause] it was the first time I’d ever heard of Harvey Milk, for
example. We watched a documentary about Harvey Milk who was, you probably know, the first
openly gay councilman, I think in San Francisco. He was assassinated later by one of his

colleagues. I remember we looked at Latino, or at that time they were talking about Chicano ciVil

Brown 11

rights. And then I just kept kind of taking courses like that, and I think that just had a big impact
on me because not only was I seeing it in the external world but in my intellectual world I was
begimnng to understand that the world was not how I had seen it growing up in terms of—. I’m
not quite sure how to say it. I don’t want to suggest that I was a Pollyanna who [Laughs] saw the
world through rose-colored gla55e5, but the way I approached people of all stripes, 50 to speak,
was not the norm, and it hadn’t even occurred to me that that was not the norm. Does that make
sense?

VP: Yeah.

LCB: In terms of, you know, when I went away to school, what I saw was very different
than how I had perceived the world because of my experiences and because of my community
and environment and parents.

VP: So coming back, like coming home from college, maybe on breaks and stuff or over
the summer, did you, taking this new knowledge that you had learned in your classes, did you
see some of the inequities, 50 to speak, like in your hometown that you might not have noticed
before?

LCB: Right, yeah. That’s a great question because I think, yeah, you do come with a new
prism, right, or a new lens to look at your own place. I think that’s absolutely right. I think it was
particularly right with class, not just race. I think what my eyes were opened to in New Orleans
was the horrifying disparity between the haves and the have-nots, and it was 50 5tark. It was very
5tark. You would literally have these housing projects and not six blocks away you would have
these man5ion5 where people were living, and they’d be driving by the housing projects all the
time and you could just see. I mean in the housing projects it was practically like you were

transported to a Third World country. You could just see the suffering there. I mean it was just

Interview number U-0095 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern
Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.

Brown 12

right there in front of your face. You saw that these people were horribly impoverished and
really suffering and what a dangerous life they were living, and at that time New Orleans crime
was just skyrocketing. The murder rate was through the roof. I think that was the time when New
Orleans led the country in murders, of all dubiou5 distinctions, and the vast, vast majority of that
violence was black on black crime and it was in the housing projects. What struck me was that
there seemed to be no value to life. Life was not valued, in the way I thought it was, in these
communities, and to me what made sense was that there was no hope. They felt no hope. So if
you don’t have that, how do you value life? It’s nothing to take a life if you don’t see value in
life. So that was really heartbreaking.

I’m trying to think if that wa5—. I can’t remember the exact timing, I’m sure we could
check it, but I remember going to see Sister Helen Prejean speak about the death penalty. I don’t
know if you’re familiar with her but she was the author of Dead Man Walking. They later made a
movie with Susan Sarandon playing Sister Helen Prejean. But she -- just a remarkable woman --
and she was a Catholic nun. I’m not sure which order she was in but she actually, you know,
nun5 take a vow of poverty. She took a vow of poverty and then some because she went to live in
the housing projects, in one of the most dangerous housing projects in New Orleans, and lived
there to do community work right there. She didn’t drive in [Laughs] and then go home to a
more comfortable environment. She was right there living the gospel there. But she kind of came
to fame for her work with people who’d been condenmed, who were facing the death penalty
e55entially, and then she came out as a strong opponent of the death penalty and that was very
inﬂuential to me. It was the first time that I saw a nun in that kind of light, because having grown
up going to Catholic schools with nun5 as teachers, and there was even a convent at the Ursuline

Academy and 50 there were all these very aging nun5 who wore the full habits and things like

Interview number U-0095 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern
Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.

Brown 13

that, “nun” to me meant either a very strict teacher [Laughs] or a very, very elderly woman in a
full habit. But to see Sister Helen Prejean actually in the community helping the poor was really
remarkable. Then I think that just is one of many ways I think that the class differences became
very 5tark to me in New Orleans.

But I think that’s a really good question, about how coming back you see things in a
different light, and after college I did return to New Orleans to live for about six years 50 really
did have a different take on the city than I did when I left.

VP: So how did that sort of maybe direct your work as an archivist and historian?

LCB: Yeah. Well, I’ll take you back a little bit. One thing that was also, I think, a little
different from my experiences, I think going to Texas, a public state university, where they pull
mostly from the state and bring in folks, there were of course a lot of ﬁrst generation college
students there, much like here at UNC. Their parents hadn’t gone to school. Well having grown
up in academia it was a given that I would go to college. I mean that was at a minimum. There
wasn’t any question about it. I never questioned it. It was an unspoken understanding: “of course
I was going to college.” Then it just naturally seemed in college that I would proceed and go on
to graduate school. In college I was a history major, I wrote an honor5 the5i5 at UT, and did
archival research for that honors thesis and enjoyed that very much, although it was very difﬁcult
because it was up at the National Archives, their facility in Maryland, not in DC. That was a little
eye-opening. I was sort of taken aback by how strict they were, which is funny given my
profession now. [Laughs]

So in college I met who would become my husband and we married literally the week
after I graduated from college, but I knew that I was going to go to graduate school. I went to the

University of New Orleans for my graduate degree and wanted to focus on history. I had the

Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.

Brown 14

intent of then pursuing a PhD but while I was at UNC and working on my seminar papers, and
also my ma5ter’5 thesis and what would later become a scholarly article, I did a ton of archival
[Laughs] research and basically fell in love with “the 5tuf as us archivists call it. I really
immersed my5elf e55entially for the better part of a year, because I had completed my course
work and needed to write the thesis, and I went to a lot of different repositories. They were all in
Louisiana, the main ones being the Historic New Orleans Collection, Tulane University’s special
collections and LSU’5 special collections, but particularly the Historic New Orleans Collection,
which is located in the French Quarter, and I was working on a thesis about this, for lack of a
better term, this artists’ colony in New Orleans during the 19205 and 19305. So Iwould go into
the Historic New Orleans Collection, be reading all these documents and looking at this amazing
stuff from the past, and then go out and walk on the streets where these artists had shown their
work, passing the buildings where they had had studios and apartments, and it ju5t—. I know it
sounds kind of, I don’t know, maybe a little too nostalgic or sentimental, but it really reached me
in a very real sense. It became not just an intellectual exercise. It was actually understanding a
piece of the past in a way that you couldn’t do without this kind of intimate reading of the
documents.

So, I was like, “Huh! This is interesting.” And of course simultaneously the job market,
much like it is now, for PhDs in American history, really, really a rotten time to be getting a PhD
in American history and attempt to get a tenure track position. So that looked pretty grim, and
given how much I had enjoyed the archival work, and I did enjoy writing the thesis but not
anywhere near as much as I enjoyed researching the thesis, [Laughs] I was encouraged by my
thesis advisor to look into archives a5 a profession. So I ended up going to Louisiana State

University’s library school and getting a master’s degree there. Most of the course work there

Brown 15

was very much on the librarian side of things rather than the archives side of things, and they’re
related profe55ion5 but there are some very, very major distinctions, and 50 I kind of had to, to
some extent, make my own path. So, for example, when I would be assigned something in class I
would have to spin it from an archival perspective.

What made it tolerable, [Laughs] trying to forge this curriculum essentially on my own,
was that I had a fellowship at the special collections there and I worked in the archives, both in
what’s called processing, or arranging and describing collections, and in reference services, 50
helping people locate materials. That hand5-on experience, you know, being on the opposite
5ide—. I had been in the reading rooms and had been looking at the documents, but now I was in
the back and understanding sort of the art of archives and not that these materials ju5t magically
[Laughs] appeared in these boxes and were all arranged and described in finding aids, what went
into that, and I was hooked. [Laughs]

So, I’m not sure I addre55ed your original question. [Laughs]

VP: [Laughs] I think you did a great job.

LCB: Okay.

VP: So maybe what were the gender dynamic5 like in the history department, in
undergrad or working in archives?

LCB: That’s a really good question, yeah. So in undergraduate, you know there were
some moments where Ivery much felt my gender and felt like I was looked at as somewhat
le55er by the hi5torian5. I’m trying to think. I don’t think that I had a single female history
professor at UT. I carmot think of one. I had female professors but in other course work, but I
don’t think I had a single—and my guess is, just thinking back, that the professors were very, very

largely male at that time, and it’s a huge, huge department. I can think of all kinds of—. I mean I

Interview number U-0095 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern
Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.

Brown 16

can think of a lot of the professors that were there, but not a single woman comes to mind, which
is telling, I think. [Laughs]

Because I was writing an honor5 the5i5, before I wrote the thesis I had to take a seminar
and it was a very small seminar, maybe fifteen people but I think even fewer, and I was one of
two women, or young women, in the class, and the professor of course was a man. Yeah, I think
I was very aware of that, and I remember that the other woman in the class wa5—. There was
something up with her paper, her seminar paper, I don’t know, that it wasn’t up to snuff or
something. I’m not—. Well, I’ll just skip over that because I can’t remember what it was, but I do
remember there being some sort of conﬂict there with one of the women, and this was more of a
feeling than anything else, that the men there felt very much like this was their field, that they
were the ones who were going to write history, not these women.

Then there were some kind of odd moments with my honor5 the5i5 advisor. I mean
nothing really untoward happened but there were moments when I became acutely aware of my
gender. I was sitting there in my advisor’5 office di5cu55ing my thesis with him and just out of
the blue he says, “I really like your earrings.” It was ju5t—. I mean that’s seemingly pretty
harmless but then, because of my sort of hyperawarene55 at that point about women and
women’s rights and things like that, I was like—. I didn’t say anything to him but I was thinking
to myself, what was that? Why would he make any kind of comment on my appearance, be it
something I’m wearing, and I find it hard to believe that [Laughs] had I been a man that that sort
of thing would come up.

I did sort of have the feeling that everything I did was seen through the prism of me being
a woman and not—. I didn’t feel like I was beingjudged solely on my own merits or

shortcomings, for both better and worse, and again these are just my perceptions and my

Interview number U-0095 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern
Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.

Brown 17

feelings, but I suspected that on both sides of the coin I was maybe forgiven some of my
shortcomings, “Oh, she’s just a girl,” kind of thing, and then on the ﬂipside maybe where I did
well was constmed a5, “Yeah, but...” [Laughs] And again, that was just a feeling. I had no means
of comparison. I mean I had no way to be a part of, say, a thesis conference with a male student,
like be a ﬂy on the wall and see how their interactions went.

So when I went to graduate school that was a very small department and it was very male
dominated. In fact, I think the only tenure track—. There was only one tenure track professor that
was a woman at that time, and she was a Latin Americanist [and] I wasn’t in that field 50 I never
had her. There weren’t a whole lot of women in the program. It was predominantly men 50 my
peers were almost all men and 50 the classes were—. Sometimes in the discussions there would
definitely be some gender issues, and I’ll tell a couple of little stories. In one of the proseminars I
remember we were reading about this woman, I carmot think of her name, who was around the
early 19005. She was a patron of the arts, she was very bohemian, she was married a few times
and just kind of a free spirit, did her own thing, and she was a really fascinating figure for what
we were exploring, which was some of the transitions from a very Victorian culture to a more
modernist culture. And I remember they just thought this was 50 funny, that a lot of the men in
this proseminar cla55 ju5t—. I think they even used the word “slut,” like, “This woman’5 just a
slut.” She’s sleeping with all these men, she has all these husbands, and just completely
dismissing everything else about her. It was all about her sexuality. There weren’t too many
other women—. I’m trying to think. There were maybe three other women besides me in the class,
and I think we tried to defend her, but it wa5—. Thi5 historical figure, which sounds 5illy,
defending a historical figure, but that was troubling. Even some of the men that I actually really

liked personally and had respect for, it was just kind of surprising to me how quickly they

Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.

Brown 18

devolved into kind of childish name calling and not being very—. I don’t know. [Laughs] So that
was one incident that sticks out.

There were two others. One of my peers, a woman, was very much interested in military
history and she was actually told by a professor that women don’t do military history, and she
said, “What do you mean?” and he said, “Well you can’t possibly understand military history
because women don’t serve in combat, 50 you can’t even imagine what combat is like 50 you
can’t do military history.” I remember being enraged about that, on her behalf of course. It
wasn’t me. And this was a major, major figure in the field of military history, so basically he cut
her off at the knees right there. Here she was, this young woman taking an interest in military
history, and who knows where she might have taken that? She might have been exploring
women in the military, or what have you. There are all kinds of ways to go. But to be cut off
right there because of your gender, that was horrifying to me.

Then I had the experience of being assigned to be a TA, a graduate assistant, for one of
his courses, and it was on World War II 50 it was an undergraduate course but I was the graduate
assistant. From the get-go it was clear he didn’t think I had any business being his graduate
assistant because I was a woman and he basically brought in somebody to do what I should have
been doing. A male student, maybe an upper cla55man, was doing it on a voluntary basis and was
doing the work that I was supposed to be doing. It was never said to me, you know, “There’s
nothing you can contribute to this course because it’s about World War II and you’re a woman,”
but the writing on the wall was pretty plain to me [Laughs]. So I resigned from the position and I
sent him a letter saying I’m not going to stay in the position. I think I made it clear that I was

unhappy but maybe that was more the subtext of the letter rather than anything real open or

Brown 19

honest about—. In other words I didn’t confront him and say, you’re biased against me because
I’m a woman and that’s not fair. I didn’t say any of that. In retrospect I sort of wish I had.

So definitely it very much felt like that history was still, even in the 19905, very much
male dominated. I mean I’m sure you can make that argument still today. And just kind of that
idea of, you know, there wasn’t a woman’s history course. There was no effort, I think, to—. I
take that back. There was, I think, for some professors, an effort to really be inclusive, say in the
readings and the focus of the course, but not always. I mean it did 5till sort of smack of a male
dominated historiography and historians. Women did play a huge role in the artists’ colony that I
ended up writing about, 50 I definitely explored that.

At the time that I was getting into archives most of the people at sort of the top of the
profession were also men and that’s still, to a large extent, true today. If you go over to Wilson
Library there are very few women in the top positions. There are a lot of women in the middle
management positions but in what would be considered the top, the curator level, there is only
one woman curator. The Southern Historical Collection has only had one female director, and
that was back in the 19705, and hasn’t had one since. So even in an academic ﬁeld, in a playing
ground, you still feel, I think—I want to be careful here because I don’t want to overstate it but—
that it’s not always fully— your progression in the field is not always about merit. It’s just a little
too starkly different. I mean it’s a little too 5tark that there are many more men at the top when
it’s generally a field dominated by—. Librarianship is generally a field dominated by women but
men, for some reason, seem to quickly rise to the leadership positions whereas the women don’t,
so that’s troubling. [Laughs] And then I think there are also some pretty significant 5alary

differences too. Men and women doing more or less equivalent, you know, on equivalent levels

in the organization chart, and presumably with similar personalitie5—. I mean—. Personalities, I’m
sorry, [Laughs] similar responsibilities. I don’t where “personalities” came from.

The male is often making a good bit more, and you want to think that relic5 like, “Well, a
man is the breadwinner and has to bring home the bacon for the family,” you want to think that
those are relics of the past, but you have to wonder if those still do linger in the minds of those
who do the hiring and setting of salaries. I mean as it turns out I was, and have been, the
breadwinner for my family and you do see more and more of that today, but that was never
something I had a problem with. Here again I think this goes back to childhood, because my
mother worked, and even when my brother and I were little she, I think maybe with some brief
time off, 5tayed working, at least on a part-time basis, even when we were young. So from a very
early age I saw, you know, both my parents worked, and again that was the norm for me. So it
never would have occurred to me that I would not work someday, I mean work external to the
home. That was always a given for me. So I never had the idea—and this is actually another
interesting thing. In Texas I actually met women who were unabashedly open about their goal in
college being to find a husband or, you know, on the so-called MRS [Laughs] track, and that was
just completely foreign to me and just utterly puzzling. And even though I married very young it
never would have occurred to me not to pursue a career.

So, I sort of got lost in my own [Laughs] talking there, but essentially I always felt, I
think, like I had to be able to take care of myself, and that meant having a career regardless of
whether or not my partner in life would have a career that would largely support the family or
not, that I was going to have that level of independence that I could take care of myself, and in
fact now—. I was the breadwinner for my family and now I’m the sole breadwinner for my

family, 50.

VP: Did you ever receive any outside sort of commentary about the fact that you were the
breadwinner in your family or as you were married [and] pursuing an academic career?

LCB: Yeah, yeah. Certainly some family members, although they tread pretty lightly,
becau5e [Laughs] I think they knew from the outset that I had an independent streak in me and I
was going to do what I was going to do. There were some doubts expressed to me about-- my
husband was a musician, 50 I think my grandparents on my mother’s side said, “What is this?
Who is this guy? He won’t be able to support her,” ba5ic, kind of some light disapproval of the
idea that he would pursue music, which was obviously not going to be profitable [Laughs] and
that I would pursue a career. My mother wondered if I went through and got higher degrees
would it be difficult for me to be—thi5 sounds so funny now in retrospect—would it be difficult for
me to be with someone who wasn’t sort of at that academic level with me, and that’s funny
because I think that reﬂects her experience with my father. They were both academics and I
guess academic equals in that sense.

So, yeah, there was that, and I think, you know, people, friends and just people I knew,
were often very surprised that I was the career person and that my husband wasn’t in sort of a
regularjob that brought home most of the money. When we decided to have children it was
obvious that he was going to have to be the one to be the 5tay-at-home parent. Childcare was out
of our price range, I meanju5t way beyond our price range, and we much preferred the idea of
being able to have the children in our home. So a lot of people did kind of question, “Well, is
Matt up for being a 5tay-at-home parent?” and some doubts about [it]. Even though it’s become
more and more common now, even ten years ago when my oldest daughter was born it wasn’t all

that common for the dad to be the 5tay-at-home parent. But, yeah, I definitely felt like there was

some judgment going on, or some disapproval, but like I said most folks tended to tread lightly
[Laughs] on that subject.

VP: Getting back to your work as an archivist, this is sort of a broad question, but in
working as an archivist and looking at all these primary sources and such, and studying them, do
you feel like sometimes your perception of history, like the one you might have been taught in
college and the one you might have learned growing up, has changed at all, especially in regards
to maybe women or ciVil rights?

LCB: Right, right. The trouble in answering that question is trying to isolate the impact of
my profession, working with the materials and other experiences I’ve had, and other people
whom I’ve encountered and their impact on me.

VP: Well feel free to bring them both in. [Laughs]

LCB: [Laughs] So, yeah. [He5itate5, laughs] Well, okay, so I’ll go back to this. In 2005
the Southern Historical Collection wa5 celebrating 5eventy-five years of being here at the
university in an official capacity, and in a lead-up to that year we had decided that we were going
to do a big celebration and that we were going to have a very large exhibition of materials from
the Southern Historical Collection, that we were going to hold a little symposium and invite
historians of the American South to come and speak about the importance of the collection and
Southern sources in general, and I headed up this effort. I remember discussions around the
themes we would explore, in the exhibition specifically, and it came up, well, should we have
exhibit ca5e5 devoted to women’s history? Should we have exhibit ca5e5 devoted to African
American history? And I came out strongly against doing either of those—haVing a case about
women, having a case about African Americans—and my rationale for that was that that is

isolating and putting a tight framework around women in history, African Americans in history.

That’s not how it ever has been. I mean, ye5, white males in our Western culture have been in
power, but women, African Americans, other groups, have always been a part of everything. I
hope that makes sense.

VP: Mm hmm.

LCB: So, in other words, the idea of saying if you want to know anything about women,
come over to this case and see, oh, here are the women, that seemed absurd to me. So what I
advocated for and what we ended up going with was that we would have to make a concerted
effort to make sure that we were exploring not just affluent white men but also, within the
themes, the gender, the class, the race, 50 we agreed that we were going to make this concerted
effort. Well, 10 and behold, it didn’t take much of an effort because of course the women’s voices
were there, of course the African American voices were there, and they were important voices.

One of the things I really, really treasure about the Southern Historical Collection, which
I think a lot of people find surprising, is that we’re not an archive that has a bunch of collections
from super famous people that everybody has heard of. Now there are archival repositories that
practically every collection they have you’ve heard of the person. Our collections really, I think,
document the people, the people of the American South. Yes, there are some very noteworthy
people. Yes, our collections are still very heavily skewed cla55-wi5e, race-wi5e, gender—wise. But
still within those you really are as close to the ground in documentation as you can get and I
think what—. In my career as an archivist, and particularly at the Southem Historical Collection,
to see the impact that women had in a community, women that we’ve never heard of who’ve
done these amazing, amazing things, it’s very eye-opening and it’s a very different, I think, take
on history then sort of the famous, huge, global impact kinds of [Laughs] things a lot of people

would think about with history.

I mean you think about someone like Je55ie Daniel Ame5. I don’t know if you’re familiar
with Dr. Hall’s work on her, but we have the Je55ie Daniel Ame5 papers. Well I’d never heard of
Je55ie Daniel Ame5 prior to coming here. Wow! What an amazing historical figure. Other
women, like Olive Dame Campbell, who founded the John C. Campbell Folk School in
Bra55town, North Carolina, another amazing woman at the turn of the twentieth century. She was
widowed at a fairly young age and she was from the North and she stayed here in the South, in
the mountains, and opened this incredible folk school after traveling, I think it was to Denmark
to learn about how the Danish did their folk school system, and brought that back to America and
it’s something that persists today. Probably most people haven’t heard of her, but there are a
million stories like that in the Southern Historical Collection, and I am very drawn to the
women’s voices in there, and if you look for them, they’re there. They’re there to uncover.

So, I would say, absolutely. I mean I am sort of evangelical when it comes to the idea of,
if you really want to understand the past you need to connect with the people of the past, and
right now the best way to do that is through these documents. They’re not perfect, they’re not
comprehensive. They’re a5 imperfect as we all are. [Laughs] They are as incomplete as just
about anything. But the insights you can glean, and you can really empathize with people in a
way—. I don’t want to suggest that people with awful Viewpoints who did awful things, that you
empathize with them or sympathize with them, but you can understand them much better by
doing that kind of intimate reading of their documents, the things that they created that they had
no intention of us, a hundred, a hundred and fifty years later, looking at. Yeah, archival work I
think absolutely does change how you see the past, particularly from our—and I say “our” just
kind of generally speaking—our very earliest experiences with history, which is largely textbook,

and then as you progress academically you’re reading not just textbooks but you’re reading the

works of wonderful historians, like Jacquelyn, who have made use of archival materials, and
those are unbelievably valuable and they open new worlds to you. But, there’s another world too.
To be able to do your own analysis, to be able to make your own connections by using the
documents, I think is incomparable to other modes of understanding the past, 50. [Laughs]

VP: Well, is there anything I didn’t ask about that you would really like to talk about?

LCB: Well, you know, it’s really interesting for me right now because I am the mother of
two daughters and, as I was telling you, my husband was a 5tay-at-home father for them. I’m
widowed now and in taking on the challenges of being a mother alone with my two girls, and
stepping back and looking at them—my husband died about a year ago—and seeing how resilient
my daughters have been in the face of this tragedy. I mean they were very, very close with their
father, it was a sudden, very unexpected death, and it was devastating. But it’s not just their
resilience but also the way that they sort of are approaching life and seeing the world and seeing
the possibilities for themselves. It’s a really beautiful thing to see, and I credit my late husband
with a lot of it, but I’ve had some folks tell me, friends and family tell me, you’re 5hortchanging
yourself by not acknowledging your role in it. But they give me such hope for the future of
women in our community, and particularly my older daughter, the level of confidence she brings
to things, and it’s not overconfidence. It’s not arrogance or frivolity. It’5 genuine confidence in
herself that is just positively enviable, and I really hope that I can maintain this, or help nurture
it, because when I was growing up, despite many wonderful advantages and loving, supportive
parents, I still lacked confidence and to this day sort of have issues with conﬁdence and feelings
of being almost an imposter [Laughs] that I think are largely attributable to being a woman, and
being a woman growing up, and being perceived in ways that were diminishing, and made to feel

like an object or that a woman’s value is only in her appearance, or her sexuality, or something

like that. That gives you 5elf-doubt5. It causes problems with your body image and all sorts of
things, as I’m sure you’re well aware. I just have hope, and I hope it’s not a false hope. I hope
it’s not something where I’m deluding myself. But I’m actively working to nurture that
confidence in my girls 50 that they don’t experience that 5elf-doubt, that just because I’m a
woman means there are definite limits on what I can do and who I am and how I can feel about
myself.

So motherhood has taken on a lot more to me than simply raising happy, healthy
children, but I feel—. And it’s impossible for me to say, because I’m not the mother of sons, but I
feel that being the mother of daughters there’s that extra responsibility to really, really support
them in their confidence, in their 5elf-image, because they’re going to be women and because we
don’t live in that society yet where you can be confident that people are going to be perceived for
what they, you know, in the classic Martin Luther King quotation about the quality of their
character. There are always going to be people who judge you on whatever, and unfortunately
we’re still judged simply for our gender. So, yeah, I feel an extra obligation, without being—. It’s
not like I’m sort of preaching to them nonstop about [Laughs] women’s rights, but it’s those
things that come up naturally and addressing them and talking about them, or when we’re
reading together, and when something unjust happens because of somebody’5 gender or race or
class, talking about that and talking about why that isn’t right, and things like that. I take that all
very seriously because I want my girls to not only be good people but to be confident, happy,
5ucce55ful women, but successful as they deﬁne it, and I think that is very different from how I
have felt in my life, letting others define what success is. I want them to be able to define what
their success is.

VP: Thank you so much for sharing that.

LCB: Thank you.
