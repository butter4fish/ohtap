 Lemons  Lowry  We   re talking with Mrs. Robert Lowry today. It is the 8th of January, 2001.  We are in the Angie Debo Room of Special Collections and University  Archives at Oklahoma State University.  I was born in Oklahoma City and I lived my whole life until I came to  Oklahoma State, and graduated after four years, got married, and then we  started our teaching career.  You and your husband?  My husband, too. He was here at a graduate school, and the NYA had these  night programs for adults. We went to Wetumka for about six months. Then  we came back up here, to Stillwater. He went to teach in Vinita for a year, and  then we moved to Guthrie to teach for a year. At Panhandle State, he was  working on his master   s still. Panhandle State at Goodwell offered him a job.  When we went out there to apply, we thought we were going to the end of the  world, and we almost turned around and came back  laughter . But we went  on, and we enjoyed it out there. Now my first recollection of a dust storm was  at a teacher   s meeting that I suspect that was in the fall of    38.  I want to interrupt. What year did you move out there?  In    36. He went to teachers    meetings in Oklahoma City, and fortunately the  group he went with came home that night. In the little house we lived in, our  bedroom was just off the living room. There were two windows on the south  wall, I mean they were high windows. I woke up and I smelled dust. We   d  always heard of the Black Sunday, and I   m sure that was the Easter Sunday of  the year before. I looked around the corner and I saw that under the curtains  the dust was just flowing down. I thought, oh boy it   s hit. First we just kind  of cleaned it up with wet rags and put wet rags in front of the doors and stuff  like that. Then, eventually, we put masking tape every place. We started at  the floorboard and came up, and all the way up and around the windows. Any  place there was a possible opening we put that.  Did that seem to help?  It helped. Ed Morrison was the president. Incidentally, he came back to  Stillwater, and was the one that instigated the apartments that are just off of  Hall of Fame. He decided we could caulk the windows, so the university got  5  Lemons  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  caulking guns and we all borrowed it and started caulking. The same thing we  did with the masking tape. That helped a lot. We only left one window in the  house open. At times when the dust storms were really bad, you couldn   t even  see your neighbor   s house. It was just one of those things.  What we did for social life. The faculty had their men   s club and women   s  club. We   d have a dinner one month, and they   d have a dinner the next month.  We all went up to campus for dinner, regardless of weather. People just  tolerated that sort of thing. In fact, in the afternoon, we tied up our head and  went over to somebody   s house and played bridge, most women did. It was  just something to do. One time I was standing in the backyard hanging up  clothes and out here to the west the dust was rolling in. That was the way we  lived, but we got used to it, and just kind of went on our way.  Did you take your laundry in the house when you saw a dust storm coming?  More or less. In back of our house were just vacant little farms and stuff like  that. The dust was just blowing up there. You knew you   d better get the  clothes in because otherwise you   d have to do them over again. The town  didn   t have much. There was a grocery store, and when we first moved, there  was a pharmacy.  Now that was Goodwell? You were living right in Goodwell there.  Yes, right in town, and then there was a post office. Eventually Ed Morrison,  he was very innovative, built a men   s dormitory and a women   s dormitory, and  you couldn   t open the windows. Air conditioning in those days was just water  air conditioning, and he had those on the roof with fans and stuff. We didn   t  suffer too much, I don   t think. In town there wasn   t anything but the grocery  store and the pharmacy and the post office and a filling station and a garage. If  we didn   t have a garage, they   d store them in the garage downtown near the  filling station. At that time we had crank phones. You probably never saw  one.  Just in the antique stores.  That   s all we had. A lot of us said,    Why do you need a telephone when you  can yell across town?    I don   t think I really had one until   I have to think  about it. That was the year our daughter had Scarlet Fever and I was  quarantined with her, and he had to move down to the hotel and stay down  there during the quarantine.  And when was that?  I don   t remember what year it was, but it was during this period between that  and    47. I think I   m right on that. We came back during the war years. He  was what they call 4-F. My family lived in Oklahoma City, so we figured I  would go back there, and he was called in. We got this offer during these  service schools that were here on campus. They had some of the Air Force, I  think it was. He, of all things, was a business teacher, but he taught speech.  6  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Lemons  Harry Anderson   s speech department. He had been there in college. Harry  asked him to come back and teach. Eventually he taught some typing and stuff  like that to the service men. We came in the middle of the year, and we came  down here and stayed all that year and the next year. Then we got a chance to  go back to Goodwell, since he didn   t have a permanent job here, and we were  there for one year. I laughed when we went back. All this dust that was over  the fences and everything and all flattened out and there was a beautiful  breeze, and I said,    They should have paid us to leave.     Because it looked so much better when you came back?  They were so much better off. We only stayed there one year, and then he got  a permanent job here on campus in the School of Business.  When you moved to Goodwell for the first time, and you started experiencing  those dust storms and things, did you regret your decision to move out there?  Did you want to move back or leave?  I don   t think we did. We didn   t like it, of course, but we more or less made  our own entertainment and stuff like that. I don   t know that I ever regretted it.  You had to have a job to live on in those days. That was kind of a depression  era.  You said you almost turned around.  That   s when we were going out there to apply for the job. When you grow up  in Oklahoma City as I did, he in Okmulgee, you got out there and you thought  gee whiz. You got out to about Alva and you thought boy, this is the end of  the world.  It still looks like that, you know.  Yeah, I know it does, but the roads are better. It used to take us all day when  we   d come to see family for Christmas or vacation or something like that. Now  I think you can make it pretty fast because it   s all paved. We use to go to  Amarillo in the fall and spring to shop. We didn   t have a place to shop.  Guymon had some places, but not very much, at that point. I haven   t been out  there in a long time, but I know Guymon has expanded completely. It would  be a different place, as far as I know, now. It was an interesting life. One of  the grocery stores he used to go do his buying, and he   d buy some things like  gifts and things like that. When that all came in we   d all rush down there to  look through the boxes to see what we wanted  laughs . You can see we didn   t  have much to do.  I told you about the new dormitories. The new dormitory had an apartment  there for a house director, so we had a chance and we moved up there with our  daughter. It was just a living room and a bedroom and an office area. They  had a little day bed in there that our daughter slept on.  So you just have one daughter?  7  Lowry  Lemons  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Lemons  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Yes.  How old was she? Was she born already when you moved to Goodwell?  She wasn   t in school yet when we moved to Goodwell. I don   t know how old  she was. She was born in 1933. It was an interesting life, I thought. The  doctors we had to go to were in Guymon, and there wasn   t a hospital in  Guymon, we had to go to Liberal, Kansas. She had appendicitis one year, so  we went to Liberal, Kansas for that. They had the NYA during that period  also. I taught childcare and one class in clothing. We had kind of a nursery  school for the little children in town. There weren   t many. The president had  a son, and there was one girl, but she lived out in the country. Life for our  daughter wasn   t as interesting as it could be. Other children had lots of friends  and things like that. It was a different type of life. Obviously I   m glad we  went there, but I don   t want to go back.  Why would you say that you were glad you went there?  Because we just had a nice situation of friends and getting together. We lived  close enough together that we could be together. We had bridge parties at  Hooker and Guymon, with the women there. Since I had the dormitory I had a  big living room, and some groups would go together and we   d pay back our  debts by having women from these out of towns come down there. It was a  different social life. You had friends in Guymon and Hooker and places like  that. We just entertained ourselves.  Are you still in contact with those women that used to hang out with and play  bridge together?  Most of them aren   t living. In fact, the president and his wife are both dead.  Neither of the Morrison   s are living. My closest friend lived in New Mexico  after that, and she isn   t living. You know, time goes on.  Whether you want it to or not. Were most of your friends there at Goodwell in  the school? Was it an academic circle of friends that you had?  That   s what it was. That   s about all there was in town.  Right, just the school.  There were people in town. I wouldn   t say they   re country people, but they  just couldn   t do the things we did.  Was there animosity between the school people and the townspeople at all?  No. They were very friendly.  You just moved in different circles a little bit.  I imagine they played bridge or anything like the rest of us did. They had to  8  Lemons  Lowry  Lemons  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  do something. There wasn   t a movie theatre in town. I think there was in one  in Guymon, but we never did go up there. I think it was about ten miles away  from Goodwell.  Did you have to tell your daughter anything about when there was a dust  storm? Was she ever scared and you had to explain things to her?  No. I don   t think it bothered her at all. She just grew up with it.  School kids, they don   t really care.  The house we had was on a point. There was one road straight in front of us  and one in back of us. The school was right there   well the road went by the  school. She didn   t go there but about one year, I don   t think. I guess she was  just used to it because she was small and had just accepted it. Now if we had  been out on a farm, that would have been a different story. You see these  fences, where the dust was, you could drive over them if you dared. Of  course, you were libel to sink, and you won   t get up. I think my mother was  out showing my father something, and they got stuck in the sand, the dust.  The roads just piled up.  One of the things I remember most, my husband being a debater and that sort  of thing all through high school and college, he would make graduation  speeches. We were going to Boise City, and that was the end of the world, and  I said,    Oh, it   s going to rain.    We saw this dark cloud over there. As it got  closer, I thought,    That isn   t rain, that is dust.    It was one of those black ones.  With the highway being worked on, we just stopped because you couldn   t see  where you were going. We decided that since the highway was not in very  good condition, we   d go far enough to a crossroad and drive off, so we did.  As we went out to this intersection, somebody   s white chickens had blown out,  and they were all over the road. That was basketball country too. When we  turned off the road there was a hill down there, and this man came down with a  lantern and wanted to know if we needed help. That was the kind of people  you had out there.  Another man had been to a basketball game, and when he stopped and asked if  we had problems. We told him about the white chickens, and that was a  relative of his. When we finally decided we   d just come home because they  wouldn   t have graduation that night. That man was out picking up his  chickens. It didn   t seem to bother him at all. I think I   d have been angry, but  he didn   t seem to be. He just picked them up and moved on his way. I believe  that   s the most vivid memory of the dust storms that I have. That was really a  black one. We sat in the car for over an hour. We couldn   t see each other, and  we were side by side.  What time of day was it?  It was toward evening, probably seven or eight. It was black as night, but it  finally let up and we could get home. That was one of the worst ones. You  didn   t know whether somebody would come along and hit you or not. It just  9  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Lemons  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  amazes you, the people like that that would come down from the hill on his  farm and see if you had a problem. Another man had been at a basketball  game and he would stop. The man picked up his chickens, and they were  alive. You   d think they   d be dead.  Yeah, with all the dust blowing and the storm.  Just the wind. It picked them up. They always said it was that they plowed up  too much land, but I   m not an agriculturist, so I couldn   t say. Also, Mr.  Morrison decided they needed to irrigate. They had water underneath the  ground some place down where there was a stream of water. He pumped it out  and created a reservoir, and they irrigated the fields. They had some crops  there on campus, little acres that the university owned.  How did your life change when you moved from Oklahoma City to Goodwell?  Did it the quality of life go down because you were living out there at the end  of the earth, or did it go up because you had jobs and everything?  I don   t know that it did. Of course, I   d have died if we didn   t go home for  Christmas and see my family. I was out there by myself. My husband  wouldn   t have cared if he stayed there or not. I was a family person.  I would guess that you wouldn   t have access to grocery stores or food, that  aspect would change.  Well there was a very nice grocery store in town. Tom Rayburn had the  grocery store. He was a character. If you were going to make vegetable soup  and you wanted a soup bone, there was suet the man gave people to put in their  soup that they don   t sell anymore. It sure did make good soup. Nowadays, we  don   t eat that sort of food. People like that were interesting. He isn   t living  either. I don   t think any of his family is. He had several boys. They use to  work in the grocery store. They may not be living. You just don   t know when  you don   t go back. Now there   s one woman I talked about, Juanita, her name  was Reiswig, but right now I can   t get their name. I could have told you  yesterday. She grew up in, I don   t remember what town it was, but she had  lived there all of her life. So people like that probably know more stories than  I do.  I think that it   s interesting to see what you thought of going out there, rather  than being born there and living there the whole time.  They just grew up with that type of life, but farmers do get together I guess. I  never was a farm lady. That would not be my choice of activity.  You have a whole different perspective on it.  I was a city girl.  You weren   t afraid of them were you?  Oh no, I wasn   t afraid of them.  10  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Lemons  Lowry  Lemons  Lowry  Lemons  Lowry  A lot of people who move to Oklahoma are terrified of tornadoes. You didn   t  seem to be terrified of things like that.  When we   d come to Oklahoma City, you   d go downtown. Of course, that was  downtown. You didn   t have any shopping centers then. When you   d go down  there somebody would say,    Is the dust still blowing?    I   d say,    I don   t think  it   s blowing.    That was ornery, but to me it was not a dust storm. We may  have sometimes here when you see it a little dusty, but not like that, nothing  like that. As I said, I   m glad we went through it, but I don   t want to go back. I  think it   d be a whole different story now. The faculty   s larger and the school   s  larger. They built faculty houses, there was no housing. There was one house  we had, and I think two or three others were rent houses. We didn   t own a  house, we just rented it.  Was your house in Goodwell school-owned?  No. The lady who owned it lived next door. She was one of those people who  you didn   t want to cross her  laughter . It was interesting. It was a different  time in my life. When you grew up in Oklahoma City and came here for  college, Oklahoma A M wasn   t nearly as big as it is now. First I was down  on University, where the chapel is now. The president   s home was there. We  lived across from that. Then they built another one, and we lived across from  Theta Pond. You could see Whitehurst and everything. That   s a different  story. While I was here I wore high heels and silk stockings at school.  I grew up at an early age. Of course, I   m 89 years old, so I   ve been around for  a little while. As far as the Depression goes, it didn   t affect my family  particularly because my father was in charge of mail in the Oklahoma City  post office. They were the first ones to raise the pay and the last ones to lower  the pay so the Depression didn   t hit us too badly. Well those girls out there at  Goodwell, Panhandle   well, there were some young men, too   they worked  on the college farm and stuff like that. Even some of the faculty, during the  summertime sometimes, they   d be out there running the plow.  On the college farm?  On the college farm. As I say, we all knew each other.  Did you ever run the plow on the college farm?  No, I never did that.  Did you ever want to?  No  laughter , I don   t think I wanted to get on one of those things. One  summer, I did run the cafeteria. Of course, it wasn   t as big as anything we  have here. I can   t remember why I was doing it, but Mr. Morrison asked me to  do it. I did it one summer. He liked raising sheep, but the kids didn   t like  mutton. He decided to put it in meatloaf. I know people who don   t like  11  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lemons  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  mutton, and I don   t particularly like it myself, as far as that goes. You had to  do something. He always figured that the boys would be happy if they always  had plenty of beans. He   d have a big tray of baked beans or some kind of  beans, and those farm boys would come up there and just pile those beans on  their plate  laughter . These kids nowadays probably wouldn   t do that. Maybe  some boys would, I don   t know. You   d know more than I would.  I like beans.  They would just take a whole bunch of them and fill up on bread. You   d want  to have bread, too. Those were the two things he insisted that in the cafeteria  they could have all they wanted.  Beans and bread, and no mutton  laughter .  I don   t think they would eat it, but I know that was what Mr. Morrison wanted  to do was to cover it up.  Right. Make it into meatloaf and stuff.  He was a very innovative person. Like I said, he had those dormitories built  and sealed the windows.  He had air conditioning going for them. Or water air conditioning.  It was water air conditioning. We didn   t have the other kind of air  conditioning in those days. I don   t think I did. The very first one we ever had  was that kind, a big one that sat on the window.  They   d call them swamp coolers or water coolers. What else did you do out  there for entertainment besides play bridge? I know you had to do something  else.  That   s about all we did, frankly.  Cards and stuff.  Did you have any radio programs that you listened to regularly?  I don   t know if we had a radio. I don   t think we had a radio. I don   t think  there was a station anywhere near.  Who was bridge champion? Was that you?  No, no. Like I say, that was something to do. We didn   t have study clubs or  anything like that like other people had. There usually wasn   t but about four  of us that would play bridge. Some of the women didn   t play bridge.  What were the husbands doing?  They were teaching.  12  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  They didn   t do anything for fun?  No, they did. Like I said, we did have dinner parties in our homes for couples.  We   d have dinner and bridge. We had that type of thing in the evening  sometimes on the weekend, but we didn   t do anything during the week.  Are you sure you weren   t addicted to bridge?  Laughs  Did you have a  problem with addiction to bridge? Did you have a gambling problem?  Oh no, no. We never did that sort of thing. We just had fun. It was just a  social thing.  Sometimes some of the people that remember that era talk about tramps or  hobos coming through town looking for food.  I can   t think of anything.  Nobody hit Goodwell? You didn   t have any.  No. The train ran through town, but they didn   t have any tramps or anything.  At least not where we lived. They might have been out in the country or some  place, but they weren   t in town.  What about politics of the time? It was a pretty contentious period.  Not particularly. There was one gentleman   I can   t tell you his name now     that was a judge in Guymon. He was some place in the state legislature or  something. Of course, I   m sure that Mr. Morrison, the president, had to play a  little bit of politics that we didn   t know about.  Some strings being pulled here and there.  He would know those things   the rest of us were just ordinary people.  What about views in the academic circle about the New Deal and Roosevelt   s  actions, all of his government programs and things?  Well, like I say, there was one government program before we went out there.  They did have these things where the girls and I think the boys, worked on the  farm. They were NYA. Those are New Deal things. Those kids didn   t have  money.  Were you and your friends pro-New Deal? I know that divided a lot of people.  I don   t think they even thought about politics. Maybe some of them were  smarter than I was, but we didn   t talk about it.  It   s something they say you   re not supposed to talk about.  13  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  What do they say you shouldn   t talk about? Politics and Religion.  Right, it always gets fights started.  You don   t get those started, so they say. I don   t know. It was just a very  ordinary life, as far I was concerned. Now there may have been some that  were intellectual. I know that my husband did give a book review or two. I  don   t remember just for the campus or what. I don   t remember just what it  was. I guess there was somebody that wanted something intellectual.  I know now that area is pretty solidly republican.  Is it?  I didn   t know how it was at that time. Was it wavering or was it still  republican?  I don   t even remember voting. I   m sure we did.  You were probably too busy playing bridge  laughs .  No, I don   t think so. Really, there wasn   t anything else to do.  Shelly and I have a friend that just got a job out at Panhandle State. When he  got that job, I remember thinking,    Oh I wish I would have that job.    Then my  second thought was,    No I don   t think so.     I don   t know what kind of life they have now. This one woman that I  correspond with, at Christmas time only, she seems to just have an ordinary  life. She was a secretary to the registrar. I had another friend at the library,  but she isn   t living now either. Mary Leidigh, here in town, came out there  later. I don   t think she was there during the dust bowl. She was a home  economics teacher.  Were most of the people you associated with out there from the region or were  they brought in, like you were, from outside the area?  We were brought in from outside. In fact, when we went out there, the faculty  were probably all new. I think there was one man that held over. As I  remember, what happened was to get people out there they had to just take  what they could get. There was one man, but he didn   t stay very long, about a  year, the one that was left.  Do you remember the pay? Was it better out there to try and entice people out  there?  It was better than Guthrie. He went down to the capital and found out what  salaries they were paying or had paid before him. He found out that that  person had got more than they   d offered him. He told them he wouldn   t be  there, but they came up to each salary. At Vinita, I think he got  80 a month  14  Kite  Lowry  Lemons  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  for eight months, and didn   t get that all that time. Those days, teachers didn   t  get paid much. We got a little bit more at Guthrie, and thought we were rich.  I think we got maybe  1200 a year, and thought we were rich. Believe it or  not, you lived that way. You didn   t suffer. By today   s standards they might  think we had, but we didn   t think so.  When you went out there to Goodwell your pay went up even more.  It went up from Guthrie, yes. I don   t remember what it was. He might  remember. Like I was telling him,    Now what years were we out there?        Well, I don   t know.    I said,    Well, you could look it up.    Since he   s 91, he  doesn   t cooperate as much at times.  You mean he used to cooperate?  Laughs   He was head of the department of business, and he taught it all, accounting,  typing, shorthand. They only had one person that was head of the department.  It was a one-man department. That was the way that all of them were, as far as  that goes. I know that   s a lot bigger now. There   s one family out there, those  kids were straight    A   , they knew more than the teachers did. When he left, in  the middle of the semester that way, this one young man took his job. I think  he stayed on, and later got a master   s degree and maybe doctorate, as far as  that goes. He was one of those kinds that knew it all. He had a sister out  there, too, the same way. They were just straight    A    students.  Do you remember their names?  I can   t remember now. I know the young man was Frank somebody, but I  can   t remember his name.  So what would a typical day be like for you when you were living through the  dust bowl?  We   d get up and have breakfast, and he   d go up to campus. He would come  home for lunch most of the time. They did have a cafeteria. He   d come home  for dinner, and we   d either read at night or I don   t know. Maybe we had a  radio. It   s just one of things. I can   t remember that far back. One of the  funniest things was when they had a blizzard. We   d never been in a blizzard  before. Now this wasn   t dust, this was snow. We had a front porch. The  snow was about two steps up. It just covered that porch, and you couldn   t get  down without stepping in a snowdrift. He thought they wouldn   t have classes,  so he stayed home. He finally went up to campus, and they had had classes all  morning. To those people, it didn   t mean anything. They just got out in it   Laughs . We laughed at that several times. We weren   t used to that.  Stillwater didn   t have those things. Well, I guess they do now sometimes, but  Oklahoma City didn   t have them.  It   s pretty common out there, the blizzards.  We always said,    If a wind blows out there, there   s nothing to stop it.    It was  15  Kite  Lowry  Lemons  Lowry  Lemons  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Lemons  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  across the prairies.  Just barbed wire.  We   d had wind like that here, I   m sure, but there was something to stop it, like  buildings.  People  laughs .  I can   t think of anything else that was different.  What kinds of things that happened to you in Goodwell, do you think, that  changed the way you think about nature and your life?  I guess I just accepted the situation. I could be happy any place I was. I just  accepted that was where we were, we were going to make a living, and that  was what was important.  Do you think living out there helped you to accept adversity?  It could be possible. When we came here, of course, we gave up an apartment  in the dormitory. We were here about a year and a half. When we went back,  there wasn   t any place to live. They built faculty houses, I think they built  some before we left, but they built them there. They had a house that was a  former president   s house, and they made a partition and cut it in half, so we  had the front half of the house. It had a living room, dining room, and a little  kitchenette, a bathroom, and two bedrooms. Another couple had the backside.  That was the former president   s home and we decorated that. Marvin McKee  was president at that time. I think he found a painter some place, or else we all  painted, and I can remember that I wanted the living room and dining room  papered. There wasn   t anybody that did paper hanging, and Marvin McKee  and his wife and my husband and myself, you know how they fold paper up,  and we didn   t know how to do that. We just strung it out. The men would be  up on the riser thing, and Cora Belle and I would be stretching the paper across   laughter . They   d put it on the wall.  Got the job done.  It was a pretty good job. There was one church. The Methodist Church was  the main one, the biggest building. I think there was a small Baptist Church.  There probably weren   t many Baptists there.  Methodist is a big crowd.  Church sometimes had covered dish dinners. They were sometimes in the  evening on Sunday. When they had that period in there more people would go  to church at night than they ever went when they didn   t have food. People go  some place for food. They were social things, and some of the dear sisters  didn   t approve of some of the games we played. We had to stop those.  16  Lemons  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Like what? What did you have to stop doing?  It may have been bridge or other card games that the men played. I don   t  know. I don   t remember that. There are some people who just didn   t think  you ought to do that. My mother didn   t think you ought to play cards on  Sunday, and that was in Oklahoma City. She finally got over that. She lived  to 102. She had to accept some things in life  laughs .  You   d tell her,    Mom I   m playing cards on Sunday, and that   s the way it is.     Oh, she   d know. Those dinners were kind of fun. That was the town getting  together.  Do you remember any food in particular at any of those dinners that people  would bring?  Probably the same things we bring here.  Those things don   t change too much.  Just whatever you would like. Some people like to make certain things like  salads and meat dishes. It was something you liked to do. If they didn   t like  yours, they   d eat something else.  What would you bring?  Probably vegetables, maybe salad particularly. That   s what I do nowadays. I  have a gelatin salad I particularly like to do, and a lot of people like it. It   s just  one of those things that you just do.  Do you remember any events in the town that were aid or welfare for the less  fortunate, like collecting shoes or clothes or anything?  No. People in Guymon might have had that available to them, but I don   t  know. As far as Goodwell went, most of them were teachers. They could  manage those things. Maybe some of the farm people did that, I don   t know.  Since I wasn   t involved in that type of thing, I don   t know. I   m sure some of  the farms had a hard time.  Do you remember any of the students dropping out or the population of the  university falling because of the Depression?  I don   t think so. A lot of those kids were working. They found them some  jobs on campus or something. In the women   s dormitory, there were girls who  cleaned the dormitories. They didn   t get rich or anything, but it   s just one of  those things that worked out that way. It was an interesting life. I   m glad to  have experienced it, the closeness and everything, but since it   s all changed  now I don   t think I   d want to go back. Of course, my age wouldn   t have the  associations we had in those days. I think the faculty gave a play or two. The  choirs would put on programs and stuff like that once in a while. Those things  17  Kite  Lemons  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  were given in the university auditorium. There was a speech teacher and a  music teacher. I   m sure they had too. I forgot the band, but I think they had  one. I think most schools have a band. It was just events that we all went to.  Anything that went on in town, we went to it  laughter . They didn   t have  rodeo or anything like that.  Well, besides the flying chickens, is there a most memorable event of the dust  bowl?  Is there anything that sticks out as the mark?  Not particularly. Like I said, that one trip was the one I remember most, very  definitely. When you   re sitting side by side in a car and not see each other, it  was different.  I can   t imagine that.  The people just accepted it. At that time, they just knew that was the way it  was. They hadn   t moved on to go west or anything like that. Some did, I  know, because some of those farms were deserted. I remember those mounds  of dust that went over the fences. If you had a farm out there and you saw  your land blowing away, that would be a different story. When you had  income and really weren   t hurting too bad, it didn   t mean as much, it didn   t  bother you as much. Except you had to be careful you didn   t breathe the dirt.  I think that would be hard to do.  Like I said, when we went in places, even downtown to the grocery store, we   d  just tie our heads up with bandanas and put a bandana across our face, so we  didn   t breathe it very much.  That   s how you   d go outside, with bandanas tied around.  When Chris and I   d go together I   d tie her up too. That   s just the way it was.  In Goodwell you had crank telephones?  Yes.  So when you   d want to make a phone call you   d crank?  You   d crank it up and the operator would come on and then you   d tell her who  you wanted to talk to.  You had to go through the operator to get to the other person.  The funny part about it, it was in the front room of her house. It was  downtown. It was right in the main part of town. She knew where everybody  went. I know one friend tried to call me and she said,    No, I think she   s gone  some place. I saw her taking Christine over to the babysitter.     Laughter  She  18  Lemons  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Lemons  knew what went on in town.  She was the eyes and the ears of town.  Plus the fact, on those phones you wouldn   t have any trouble listening in if  you wanted to. I don   t really know nowadays. It   s a different world, I   m sure.  They built I don   t know how many faculty houses. In fact this young girl that  I sent the clipping to, she said they   d built several more faculty houses.  I think the town has gotten a lot smaller.  It   s possible it has.  Last I heard, there wasn   t much in Goodwell. There was a convenient store  and that was about it.  Have you been there recently?  Yes.  One woman went in and started a dress shop, and she was there for a while.  She didn   t have anything you really wanted much. The grocery store was the  main hub of society. If they had peanuts out, well stuff was out in the open  containers, except a peanut or two. Mr. Rayburn said,    That   s your grazing  rights.    You didn   t think anything about it, and he didn   t either. That   s just  the way he was. Maybe other storekeepers were different, but that was the  way Tom was.  And you said he would get boxes of gifts in and then you would go down and     Note cards. I don   t remember what all he had, but we   d just go down there  and browse around and see what we wanted. We   d open boxes and dig around  a little bit.  One thing that that brought up to me was, and I   ve never really thought about  this before so I   m really going out into Boise City so to speak, what would you  do for presents? Let   s say you   re out there and your husband   s birthday   s  coming up. What would you do for a present, or what would he do for you or  your children? Would you make things?  We may have gone to Guymon to pick up something. We had birthdays, I  know that much. I   m a birthday observer person. Now, we   ve come to the  point where you don   t need or want anything. These days you go and buy  anything you want anyway. Our daughter is 60-some odd years old now, but  she thinks there has to be presents. When she was a child it was boxes and  boxes. She ignored what was in them. She just ripped them open  laughter .  I   m sure it   s the same today.  I can   t think of anything else that we wanted to ask you.  19  Lowry  Kite  Lowry  Lemons  Lowry  Kite  Lemons  Lowry  I can   t think of anything else. I think I told it all. I think I covered all the  notes I made.  You covered everything very well, I think.  Now that   s the story from a person who wasn   t born there and didn   t live there  all their life.  That   s what, I think, makes the stories that you tell so interesting. You weren   t  from that area.  Just from that time. Like I said, when we went back there, the dust wasn   t  going over the fence anymore. That   s why I said,    I guess they should have  paid us to leave here.    But they didn   t.  Well, I   d like to thank you for coming in and helping us out with this project.  Thanks for talking with us.  You   re welcome. It   s just a life that I lived and enjoyed.  -------  -------
