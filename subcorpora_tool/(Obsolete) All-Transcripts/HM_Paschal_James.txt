Speaker 1: Tell me about your mother and father? Tell me about your mother? Did she share any stories about her growing up in McDuffie County?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, I was quite young when I had a lot of experiences with my parents. We were sharecroppers, we worked on the farm and my mother cared for the family of seven. She would also help with the crops and she would take care of the home, the household.
Speaker 1: Okay, did your mother--how much education did your mother have?
Speaker 2: I'm not quite sure about that to tell the truth.
Speaker 1: With seven children, did you have any special time with your mother?
Speaker 2: Did I have any special time?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, yes, in the afternoons, after we had finished our jobs or work, we would spend time together as a family. On Sunday we would all attend church together and my father and my mother both sung in the choir. They would have different church members to come back to the house on Sunday afternoon and they would rehearse the--their songs that they would sing in the church.
Speaker 1: Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your father? What type of father was he?
Speaker 2: Well, he was--I, I, I, I've always thought he was a very brilliant, smart man. Even though we were sharecroppers, but we, he had maybe four or five mules and a couple of horses and even at that time, he had some mechanical machinery that he would help with the farm. But I think he, he caused a good life for his family.
Speaker 1: So you ate from the land, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 507244
Speaker 1: Tell me about your growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, we moved from the country. We left the farm--when we left I was the age of ten and we moved into the town of Thomson, Georgia, that's T-H-0-M-S-O-N. And shortly after we moved into the town I, I began to get different jobs working in, in yards and paper route and I sold beauty cosmetics and shined shoes and, until I was--until I had earned enough money to go in business. And at the age of thirteen I bought out a store right across from the high school [McDuffie County Training School, Thomson, Georgia] that I was attending that had failed.
Speaker 1: Before you go on to that story, let's talk more about your elementary school days before we get to that part.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I want to back up just a little bit and, and tell me about your brothers and sisters? Can you name them for me and, and tell me where you fit in the progression?
Speaker 2: Oh yes. My older brother was Gilmer Paschal and the next oldest was Robert Paschal and the next oldest were Annie Mae Paschal, my sister; and, and then, then Gussie Paschal [Gussie Paschal Grant], my sister; and, and then Claudia Paschal, my sister. I believe that's seven children.
Speaker 1: No, that's five and you make six, so we're missing somebody.
Speaker 2: Myself.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yourself makes six. You told me, Gilmer, Robert, Annie Mae, Gussie and Claudia.

Story_ID: 507245
Speaker 1: Tell me about elementary school?
Speaker 2: Well, we was still living on the farm and we attended school at a one house classroom. And we had to walk about three miles to school, back and forth, the morning and afternoon. It was, it was what we thought in those days, was a good school. I enjoyed my elementary school days.
Speaker 1: You said it was a one room classroom?
Speaker 2: A one room classroom, sure.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes. Leola Paschal [ph.], which was my aunt. She was Leola Paschal.
Speaker 1: Paschal, okay. Did your mother [Lizzie Demmons Paschal] go to school also?
Speaker 2: Did she go to school?
Speaker 1: Yes. How much education did your mother have?
Speaker 2: I can't think, but I believe she, I believe she finished high school, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: All right, was there a name of the elementary school that you went to?
Speaker 2: Yes, Boysville [ph.].
Speaker 1: Boysville?
Speaker 2: Right. Boysville.
Speaker 1: And what grade did that go through?
Speaker 2: What, what, what ma'am?
Speaker 1: What grade did that go to?
Speaker 2: I can't remember right now. I believe it was the seventh grade, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Now did you attend school for ten months out the year or were you needed in the fields and didn't attend all year around?
Speaker 2: No, I think it was about nine months--
Speaker 1: Nine months (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) not for sure.
Story_ID: 507246
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me about some of the things that you and your brothers and sisters did after school besides doing your chores, or even you can tell me what some of your chores were?
Speaker 2: Well, as far as I can remember we have to realize I was only ten (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ten, okay--
Speaker 2: So I'm not sure--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --so after leaving the cotton fields in evening, it was almost time to retire and but I suppose we found a lots to do. I, I can remember I use to go hunting with my father [Henry Paschal]. He used to trap rabbits and squirrels, I can remember that; but I, I was quite young so I didn't do much in the afternoons.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you remember working in the cotton fields?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that experience?
Speaker 2: Well, I more or less worked pretty close besides my mother [Lizzie Demmons Paschal] and when, when time she would come to work in the morning in the cotton fields and when, when time to go to prepare the meals I would always go with her and have the, have the dinner meal ready when it was time for the rest of the family to come for dinner. We had a bell that we would ring that would alert them that dinner was ready. And after everything was taken care of, after the dinner meal, we would go back to the field and we'd work until the time to come, to leave the rest of the family and come home to prepare the afternoon meal.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you help your mother prepare the meals?
Speaker 2: Yes, at the, the times I wasn't, she would say, being in the way, I use to help as much as I could.
Speaker 1: I was wondering is that where you got the special recipe for the Paschal's [Paschal's Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia] fried chicken?
Speaker 2: No, that, the fried chicken was more or less handled by my brother, Robert [Robert Paschal]. He got the recipe from my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 507247
Speaker 1: So when you were ten you moved from the farm--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And where, and where did you move to?
Speaker 2: Where did we move to?
Speaker 1: To--that's when you moved to Thomson?
Speaker 2: Thomson, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. And tell me the difference; what was the difference in the community when you moved to Thomson, Georgia?
Speaker 2: It was a lot of difference. We moved into an area where--I suppose what I liked most of all it had pecan trees and we could go in the yard and get pecans and I really started work at a very young age and even after we moved into the city there was some farming done within the city limits, you know, you use to get involved with, with picking cotton and at that, at that time of year. That was my first job after I moved. Then I, I would work and clean off the yards for they, the families that lived around in the community and as I indicated before that there was a paper route that I acquired and used to sell beauty cosmetics, with the beauty cosmetics firm, the Keystone Corporation.
Speaker 1: The Keystone Corporation?
Speaker 2: Right. And then--
Speaker 1: What newspaper did you deliver? What was the name of the newspaper?
Speaker 2: The Augusta Chronicle.
Speaker 1: And how much did the newspaper cost?
Speaker 2: I can't remember, it must have been about a quarter a week; I don't know, I can't remember exactly. But, then other than the paper route, at that time I use to shine shoes on weekends at the white operated barbershops on, on Main Street. Then when we moved from the country my father [Henry Paschal] got a job with the Knox Hotel [Thomson, Georgia] and after I would finish the paper route in the evening, I would go to the hotel and work as a, as a bellman and after I got a little stronger I use to help him wait tables in the, at the hotel.
Speaker 1: And tell me the name of the hotel again?
Speaker 2: Pardon ma'am?
Speaker 1: What was the name of the hotel?
Speaker 2: Knox Hotel.
Speaker 1: And where did you go to school in Thomson?
Speaker 2: McDuffie County Training School [Thomson, Georgia].
Speaker 1: And that, that was the new high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was high school.
Story_ID: 507248
Speaker 1: What other activities--were you involved in any other activities outside of school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I, as I, as I indicated a little earlier I opened this business [James' Place, Thomson, Georgia]. I was about fourteen. I bought out the store across the, across the street from the high school [McDuffie County Training School, Thomson, Georgia] I attended with what I had earned from shining shoes and the beauty cosmetics and the paper route. And I was still in school so my mother [Lizzie Demmons Paschal] would come and operate the store while I attended classes. And I had a sister that would help out also. And at that time I, I played basketball. I was on the first team, so they would operate the store while I took some time to play basketball.
Speaker 1: How much did your first business cost you? How much did it cost to buy the grocery store?
Speaker 2: If I can remember I think I bought out the grocery store for about five hundred dollars.
Speaker 1: So you saved up five hundred dollars?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And this is in, in 19--what, '34 [1934]?
Speaker 2: Let's see, that must have been, yeah, yeah, about, about '34 [1934] exactly, about '34 [1934].
Speaker 1: And what did you sell in the grocery store?
Speaker 2: I sold canned goods and ice cream and candy and first of all ice cream and candy and canned goods, some, some other groceries.
Speaker 1: How did you know how to order the inventory for the store?
Speaker 2: How did I know how to order?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I would always see what I sold out of and at the beginning the, the, the shelves were pretty much empty, so we made notes of what we had called for so it wasn't long before we had, had a full stock of what we, well, what the community would buy.
Speaker 1: And who did you buy, buy your inventory from? They would, they would actually do business with fourteen year old?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, small towns you know, everybody know each other; the--much is downtown, so we, we bought our groceries from Thomson Mercantile Company [Thomson, Georgia], most of it. That was a wholesale grocery company.
Story_ID: 507249
Speaker 1: How long did you own the store?
Speaker 2: Well, we'll talk a little about while I was operating the store.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I, I was--also my father [Henry Paschal] became ill and I had learned his work, so I would work at the hotel [Knox Hotel, Thomson, Georgia] in his place until he was able to come back to work and I used to work there and then come by the store and close up after my sister and, and my mother [Lizzie Demmons Paschal] had gone for the day. The store was quite successful and the owners, since I didn't have a lease, the owners decided that they wanted it back for themselves, so they asked me to vacate, but I had convinced a few people around, in, in the city, that I, I knew how to operate a store, so I convinced a businessman there, which was a funeral director to construct another building for me not too far from this one and I was still in school, still in high school [McDuffie County Training School, Thomson, Georgia]. This was a much larger building and I expanded that. We had fresh meat and sandwiches and groceries and we had the only music box, which we were referred to them at that time, was a jukebox. Since they were ran--since they were outlawed in the city, then we were right outside the city limits, so we were able to have a music machine that would take quarters and dimes and nickels and so I had a place to dance and I also had slot machines and some race horse machines. I hope I won't get picked up now, but at that time they wasn't legal in the city, but since I was right outside the city, I did operate them, that--the name of that was James' Place and it got to be the number one place around Thomson [Georgia] at that time. And in 1991 [sic.], I was inducted into the [U.S.] Army, the [U.S.] Armed Forces and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In 1941?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-one [1941].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you graduated from high school what year?
Speaker 2: In 1941.
Speaker 1: So you graduated in 1941?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you went into the Army?
Speaker 2: In October of '41 [1941].
Speaker 1: So what happened to the business while you were in the Army?
Speaker 2: I sold out to the school principal and one of the other principals--and one of the other instructors who worked at the high school.
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you about the, the first grocery store, what was it called?
Speaker 2: James' Place [Thomson, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay, it was the same name?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And when the, the owners of that property wanted it back, did they pay you to take, to, to take over?
Speaker 2: For the stock?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: No. Well, we moved the stock into the new operation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, you took it with you?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: So you were paying them rent to, to, to use--
Speaker 2: I was paying them rent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But in those days you didn't think too much about a lease, so we didn't--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --have a lease.
Story_ID: 507250
Speaker 1: So tell me about your [U.S.] Army years?
Speaker 2: I was in service from '41 [1941], I believe until '43 [1943]. I got injured going through an obstacle course, so I was honorably discharged from service.
Speaker 1: But you were there from '41 [1941] 'til '43 [1943]?
Speaker 2: Right, and while I was in service, well, my mother [Lizzie Demmons Paschal] passed before I went in service. No, I'm sorry, my father [Henry Paschal] passed when I was in service and my mother passed shortly after I was out of service, so when I was discharged from the Army, I didn't go back to Thomson [Georgia], I came to Atlanta [Georgia]. My brother, Robert [Robert Paschal], was already here in Atlanta and he was the manager of a number of soda fountains with the Jacobs pharmacy company [Jacob's Drug Store, Atlanta, Georgia]. So, I couldn't get equipment because of the war [World War II, WWII]. There was--every all, all the firms were manufacturing army equipment.
Story_ID: 507251
Speaker 1: Let me go back to the [U.S.] Army because when we were talking off camera you told me that you were a, a good student, you got good grades--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and when you went to the Army where did you go for basic training?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: For basic--okay?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I went to Camp Gruber, Oklahoma [Camp Gruber Training Center, Oklahoma] for basic training and--
Speaker 2: And how as that? Was that the first time that you were out of, away from home?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was the first time I was away from home.
Speaker 2: Okay, and, and how was that for you? How was the transition to a different place?
Speaker 1: Well, I knew I had to perform a duty. It was pretty difficult after having a good business going [James' Place, Thomson, Georgia] and to have to go away and leave it, but I recognized the fact that there was a no choice and I could accept it as what it was, so I was--I trained for a communication section, that is with the telephones and the keyboards and we set up networks to file the large guns and that was interesting and anything you're interested in you know, you try to do a good job with it. So, I took the hikes and set up bush whack areas and so I think I was a pretty good soldier.
Speaker 2: Did you go overseas?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was, I was discharged from Oklahoma.
Story_ID: 507252
Speaker 1: So you told me that when you got out of the [U.S. military] service then you came to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your mother [Lizzie Demmons Paschal] had--and, your mother had passed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, let's (unclear) alone--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I came to Atlanta and I couldn't get equipment to go back in, in business, so I started looking around for a job, so I had a sister that lived back in Cleveland, Ohio, so I'd read a lot in geography and about foundries you know, how they make steel and--so I went to Cleveland and my brother was a foreman over one of the--was a foreman out at one of the steel mills, so I was, I was quite anxious to see if I could get a job there, so I went out and applied for a job and, and you know, was accepted. So they gave me a job cleaning up around the foundry, rolling the wheel barrel, so I, so I did that for a couple of weeks and went to the foreman and I said, "Look, I, I, I can do something different besides rolling this wheel barrel," so he said, "Oh, oh, you want something different?" I said, "Yes." So he gave me a job, not cleaning up around the furnaces, but to roll this mix out onto a platform and dump it off into where they made plane motors; so that was another wheel barrel and I wanted--I did that for a while and I went back to the office and I said, "I still have the wheel barrel, do you have something else?" And he said, "No." And I said, "Well, I'm sorry, I just, I just, I can't do this." Then he said, "Remember you are frozen to this job." And I said, "Oh, I am?" So I said, "Okay." But I, I got out of Cleveland, Ohio right quick and I came back to Atlanta and got a job with the Pullman Company. The Pullman Company as you probably know is the travel on the railroad--sleepers, you know, where you sleep overnight and they have beds where you go down, you, where, where you can go to bed like, travel from coast to coast for about three nights and two days. So that gave me an opportunity to travel all over the United States and to get familiar with restaurants and hotels and that was to a great advantage and that was in the area where I wanted to cast my bucket down. So I worked as a Pullman porter for a while and then I was promoted to a different position working with the Pullman Company. And I worked there until, until the war [World War II, WWII] was over.
Speaker 1: Now, your first job was, as a, as a porter and what were your duties as a porter?
Speaker 2: What did I do as a porter?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Pullman had berths where you would make down the beds at night for the guests to go to bed and sleep all night and then in the morning you would put the beds away and, and make the car back into travel like any other train. So, I did that on civilian trains and I did that on troop trains. So, as I said, my travel was all over the country.
Speaker 1: And when you got promoted, what was your position when you got promoted? What was your job then?
Speaker 2: I was assistant--let's see, what was I--position--traveling porter instructor. That is we would have to make sure that there were linen and supplies on the Pullman trains that would take care of us. It wouldn't be able to do enough linen. Some of the cars were cooled by ice and--why I had for whatever--I had particular movement than they did.
Speaker 1: You said one of the, one of the cars was protected with--was what with ice?
Speaker 2: Pardon ma'am?
Speaker 1: You said one of the cars was cooled with ice?
Speaker 2: At that time that had some of them were, were cooled with ice. A lot of ice and they had blowers, remember that we're going back quite a few years ago.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Most of them was air conditioned, but there were a few.
Story_ID: 507253
Speaker 1: How long did you work with the Pullman Company?
Speaker 2: I worked with the Pullman Company until the end of 1941 to '46 [1946] I believe. Yeah, then while I was traveling, during the time I was traveling, I met, I met my wife [Phyllis Johnson Paschal], my future wife and on a holiday she came down to school, well anyway, we, we, we can get back to that, but we were able to get equipment then to go in business. So in 1947, my brother Robert [Robert Paschal] and I formed a, a partnership and we opened Paschal Brothers Restaurant [Paschal's Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia] at 8- 830 Hunter Street [Martin Luther King Jr. Drive], it was Hunter Street then. We could seat around thirty guests. And we only sold sandwiches and sodas. And we had a lot of requests for lunch, but we couldn't serve lunch because we didn't have a, a stove, so we leased a house in the rear of that location and that give us another forty or forty-five seats. And before we had a stove, our food was prepared at my brother's house and we brought it up to the restaurant by cab because we didn't have a car. So, after we got the bigger space in the rear of that location, we were able to install a kitchen and then in 1949 we were able to buy cars and it, it could take care of the business.
Speaker 1: So you were able to put a stove in so that you could do the cooking on the premises?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So did you go to preparing other things besides sandwiches at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, we went to preparing four course meals, lunch and dinner. And we decided at that point we needed a special, a special of the house, so since my brother had watched the way my brother [sic.] prepared the chicken, we decided since that was a good food cost on the, on, on poultry, we decided to go with fried chicken as our house specialty. So, that's when we started pushing the fried chicken dinners.
Speaker 1: And that was the recipe that your brother got from your mother [Lizzie Demmons Paschal]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, still a secret recipe?
Speaker 2: Pardon ma'am?
Speaker 1: It's still a secret recipe?
Speaker 2: A secret recipe, yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: All right. Now, the location at 830 Hunter Street, what area of town is that in?
Speaker 2: That's right across the street from the restaurant that you knew, that you use to attend, on Martin Luther King. See, that was first Hunter Street, but the name was changed to Martin Luther King Drive, so that was directly across the street from that restaurant. And before we, while we were operating in that small restaurant we also got involved with the catering business, so we had a catering service going out for five thousand chicken dinners at one time. That was about the largest order we had.
Speaker 1: And, and who did you cater food for?
Speaker 2: This went to the (Unclear) brothers. It went to Lakewood park [Lakewood Fairgrounds, Atlanta, Georgia]. There was a food show every year and they--everybody that attended the show they gave them a lunch, so that was who we prepared the lunches for.
Story_ID: 507254
Speaker 1: Now tell me about the area of town that the restaurant [Paschal's Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia] was in? Who were the people who came to your restaurant?
Speaker 2: We had our greatest support from the Atlanta [Georgia] university system. They came every day and everyone around, we got support from the community period, especially after we moved into a larger restaurant and we haven't gotten that far yet. We got great support from the community and the Atlanta university system.
Speaker 1: All right, now during this time most of the African Americans are doing business on Auburn Avenue, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes, Auburn was popular still.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your restaurant was on another part of town, but it was just as popular, am I right?
Speaker 2: Well, I suppose so, we just tried to do a good job and by doing a good job we were able to really gain a lot of customers.
Speaker 1: Did you have white customers that came to your restaurant?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Story_ID: 507255
Speaker 1: Tell me about the transition to the larger store, the larger restaurant [Paschal's Restaurant and Coffee Shop, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: We opened our new restaurant Christmas of 1959. That was a restaurant--we had a coffee shop that would seat 125 guests and a dining room that would seat 150 guests.
Speaker 1: Where did you get the funds to construct this building because you actually built this building, is that right?
Speaker 2: Right. We got loans from, to do the building from Citizens Trust Bank [Atlanta, Georgia] and Atlanta Life. Citizens Trust Bank doing the construction financing and Citizens Trust Bank did the construction financing and Atlanta Life Insurance Company [Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia] did the long term financing.
Speaker 1: Okay. And who designed the building?
Speaker 2: Millkey and Associates, architects.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you have a hand in what you wanted to, to be built?
Speaker 2: Oh by all means, we were instrumental in it being designed the way that we thought it should and the kind of equipment that we thought we needed to operate.
Speaker 1: So you had a coffee shop and a dining room?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and, and what else was added?
Speaker 2: One year later we opened La Carrousel Lounge [Atlanta, Georgia]. That was a lounge that operated on the lower level. We only resorted to modern jazz music. That was artists like the nation's top jazz artists--Aretha Franklin, Lou Rawls, [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis, Jimmy Smith, and the Modern Jazz Quartet, you name them, all of the nation's top jazz artists.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was--
Speaker 2: And you ask something about did we have white customers--did you ask that?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes sir.
Speaker 2: Paschal's [Paschal's Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia] has always been a much integrated facility, even when there was segregation laws, we were serving whoever came to our restaurant; even when it was against the law we served other races. That's one law that we violated. First in our restaurant, in our lounge, we used to operate at about 60 percent white, if I may say, or other races, that went on for years. So, in our restaurant there was all nationalities since they attended school there. So, we decided that we wouldn't discriminate against any of those students. Whenever they would come for service, they would be served like anybody else.
Speaker 1: Where there any incidences with the law about you serving mixed races in your restaurant?
Speaker 2: No we didn't, they--we didn't have any problems. I think the word finally got around that we were, we were serving people, you know, not just African American people.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now in the 19- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And of course--I'm sorry, we'll, we'll go on and get to the hotel.
Speaker 1: No, go ahead and tell me what you were going to say.
Speaker 2: In 19--in 1967 we opened Paschal's Motor Hotel [Paschal's Motor Hotel and Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia]. We had 125 guest rooms with a number of suites and we added additional banquet rooms and meeting rooms to our facility and we had a total seating capacity at that time of about 1,500 people. And there again, we were, we operated a very integrated facility. A good many, a good percentage of our guests there all the time was other than African American people.

Speaker 1: Well tell me, since we are talking about the '60s [1960s] and civil rights; tell me about your involvement in civil rights?
Speaker 2: We were very much involved with the Civil Rights Movement and can, can we go off for a minute?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: We would meet with the other people.
Speaker 2: Right, well let's, let's talk about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we want, we want to know about that, about--tell me, tell me about that?
Speaker 1: Yes, well, yes we were very much involved with the Civil Rights Movement and you would probably want to know how that got started. Well, in the early days before there were certain civil right laws passed, the black elected officials wasn't able to hold meetings in the downtown area, so they would all meet at Paschal's [Paschal's Motor Hotel and Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia] and they would plan their strategy, what they would do the next day, or what they were going to do that day, so it got started then. And then after the Civil Rights Movement became, became active, the students use to meet at Paschal's before they would go to the downtown area to do the sit-ins for the purpose of being arrested. So hundreds of students at a time would be arrested and by the time they were fingerprinted and got released from jail it would be late into the night sometimes. The parents would come to Paschal's and wait until they had been released from jail. And of course my brother and I would always provide a hot meal for them after they had been released from jail. So, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had one of his headquarters at Paschal's. They met and planed several of their marches, like the Poor People's March [Poor People's Campaign] to march, to march across the E. Pettus Bridge [Edmund Pettus Bridge] in Alabama [Selma, Alabama] and the March on Washington. He and his lieutenants would meet there quite often. After a lot of the marches, a lot of the, the leaders would come back to Paschal's, to Paschal's Hotel and Restaurant to stay until they were ready to plan their next march. So, a lot, a lot, a lot of that, a lot of the Civil Rights Movement--and we, we bond a lot of people out of jail that, that was arrested. So--
Speaker 2: You personally, you and your brother?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Tell me a little bit about your brother, Robert [Robert Paschal]?
Speaker 1: My brother Robert was, if I have to say so, and not just because he was my brother, he was the most, one of the most interesting and kindest people that I've ever met. He was friendly towards everybody. He loved the kitchen. We couldn't--I couldn't get him out of the kitchen while he was doing anything. So, he left all of the executive type work to me. It was really pretty difficult to get him out to take a vacation once a year. If he would go out with a plan to stay for a week, after three or four days I'd look up and see him back again. So, so he just loved his work. He was a wonderful person.
Story_ID: 507257
Speaker 1: And you told me that you got married. What year did you get married?
Speaker 2: In 1947.
Speaker 1: Okay and tell me your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Phyllis Paschal [Phyllis Johnson Paschal].
Speaker 1: And did you have children?
Speaker 2: I have one son.
Speaker 1: And what is his name?
Speaker 2: Curtis Paschal.
Speaker 1: So your wife was with you from the very beginning of, of, of Paschal's Restaurant [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did she play a part in, in running the restaurant?
Speaker 2: She wasn't down to see it, but it was her support I think that really helped me through my business career. She was the kind of wife that understood. I, I, I worked most of my time and she was right there for me, understanding. She put everything on hold. If it was at Christmastime and we had planned dinner, or it was--if it was a birthday and I got tied up, she was understanding and--so it was her support as a housewife that I could do my job, could do a good job in knowing that she understood.
Story_ID: 507258
Speaker 1: So because you brother [Robert Paschal] spent most of his time in the kitchen and you both worked seventeen hour days.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about Mr. Sutton, Roswell Sutton [Roswell O. Sutton]?
Speaker 2: Roswell Sutton, he is a vice president of our corporation, one of our corporations, Paschal's Concessions, Inc. He has been with our company for I imagine twenty years or more. He, he came with our company from Citizens Trust Bank [Atlanta, Georgia]. He was the executive vice president of the bank and after we got involved further in business and he, he joined our firm.
Story_ID: 507259
Speaker 1: We were talking about, about how Mr., Mr., Mr. Sutton [Roswell O. Sutton] joined the operation--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) joined your corporation. Okay, and he came from Citizens Trust Bank [Atlanta, Georgia] is what you were, were telling me, but before he actually joined you, tell me about the time when, in about '73 [1973], '74 [1974] when Maynard Jackson becomes the mayor--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --of Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: You want to tell me about that time?
Speaker 2: Oh yes. We--it was '78 [1978]--that's right when he become mayor of Atlanta. He was instrumental in putting together Hartsfield International Airport [William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport; Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia] which involved--I can't remember exactly how much in, in dollars, but it was a big, a big project. He had indicated that if the airport was to be built, a certain percentage of what it took to do it would be--have to be minority participation and a certain percentage small businesses. So from the beginning in the construction that's what happened and there were certain clauses where if that was violated there, there would be certain, certain penalties. So I think I'm quoting right, I don't think there had been another airport in the United States or anyplace that had had the kind of minority participation that he had almost demanded would have to happen at Hartsfield International Airport, that's so far as inside concessions. So, the food and beverage concessions operation was let for bids. There had to be a principal concession there. So, the Dobbs House corporation [Dobbs House, Inc.] out of Memphis, Tennessee and Paschal's Concessions, Inc. [PCI] formed a joint venture [Dobbs-Paschal Midfield Corporation], formed a partnership and that partnership was to submit a bid to the City of Atlanta to bid on the inside concessions--food and beverage. There were other joint ventures which involved minorities and large business corporations. So, we were the highest bidder. We, we promised the city $240,000,000 over a period of fifteen years to operate as the principal concessionaires. So, that relationship brought on a 20 percent participation from PCI. And there was a percentage that was allotted to small business and to, I believe it was (unclear), but anyway, Maynard Jackson was responsible for that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I'm sorry--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: And he monitored that throughout his time in office to make sure that that happened.
Story_ID: 507260
Speaker 1: So actually you partnered with, with Dobbs House [Dobbs House, Inc.], so that you would have--they would have a minority partnership. It would be--you would be the minority that was needed to--
Speaker 2: I would be the minority. That partnership was Dobbs-Paschal Midfield Corporation. We were the principal concessionaires and we rented space to other food and beverage operators. Now, the Dobbs-Paschal Midfield Corporation was an umbrella. That was the corporation that leased all other operators operating on the operation level. Dobb-Paschal leased to Dobbs Houses. Dobbs-Paschal leased to Paschal's [Paschal's Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia] and to the barbershop and to other concessionaires that operated businesses who worked in the airport [William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport; Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: And all of the businesses that you leased to, did they have to have a partnership with minorities also?
Speaker 2: Pardon ma'am?
Speaker 1: Did the businesses that you leased space to at the airport, did those businesses also have to have a partnership with minorities?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No, the barbershop--for instance the barbershop, they leased from Dobbs-Paschal Midfield Corporation to operate their own businesses. The flower and the barbershop was a minority. The flower shop operators were a minority. They leased directly from Paschal's [Paschal's Concessions, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The, the other, the other businesses leased directly from--
Speaker 1: And you had a fifteen year contract you said?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and what happened after fifteen years?
Speaker 2: Our contract expired and we were bought out, well we, our contract expired. Then I formed another partnership and joint venture with Concessions International. They took over the contract. They won a contract to operate a portion of the airport. So, we were partners and the name was our corporation is Concessions/Paschal's corporation [Concessions/Paschal's, J.V.] and we still operate at, at the airport.
Speaker 1: And, and who were the primary, who were the primaries in that corporation that you put together, Paschal's, Concession International?
Speaker 2: Right, Concessions International. [HistoryMaker] Herman Russell is the owner of Concessions International and I am the owner of Paschal's Concessions, Inc.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. And tell me about Herman Russell, that's one of your friends, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, we've been friends for a long, long time. I, I served on the board of Citizens Trust Bank [Atlanta, Georgia] about fifteen years and that was quite a few years ago and even, even before that I knew Herman Russell.
Story_ID: 507261
Speaker 1: What other boards did you serve on?
Speaker 2: I've got many. I was the executive vice president of the Dobbs-Paschal Midfield Corporation. I served on the board of the Atlanta Restaurant Association [sic. Georgia Restaurant Association] when it was first organized. I served on the board of the Atlanta Hospitality and Business Association [ph.] and, and by, by the way, I was inducted into the hall of fame of the hospitality and convention bureau [Atlanta Hospitality Hall of Fame, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, earlier we were talking about different organizations or corporations that, that you worked with and you were telling me about Squibbs [Bristol-Myers Squibb] and Greyhound [Greyhound Lines, Inc.], tell me, tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Okay. Dobbs House [Dobbs House, Inc.] at the beginning was owned by--what medicine company that I told you about?
Speaker 1: Squibbs?
Speaker 2: Squibbs--was owned by Squibbs and through the Squibbs companies, I had several meetings and a lot of business association with the Squibb people. Squibb sold out to Carson Pirie and Scott [Carson Pirie Scott and Co.; Carson's], that's a corporation back in Chicago [Illinois] that owns--that operates department stores and they do a lot of other business out of Chicago. Then Carson, Pirie and Scott sold to the Greyhound Corporation and they operate out of Phoenix, Arizona. So in each of these entities, I, I, I was, I was associated and I did, I did do business with them.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did you do business with them?
Speaker 2: We had board meetings once a month and then in those board meetings we would determine what directions to go.
Story_ID: 507262
Speaker 1: Tell me what happens next with, you're still, you still have concessions out at the Hartsfield-Jackson Airport [Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia], is that right?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You still have concessions out at the Hartsfield-Jackson Airport?
Speaker 2: Yes, that partnership still exists.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With Concessions/Paschal's [Concessions/Paschal's, J.V.], that's the name of that corporation.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what year was it--in 1996, that you sell the motor hotel [Paschal's Motor Hotel and Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia] to the Atlanta (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We sold, right; we sold the hotel in '96 [1996]. And we sold--
Speaker 1: And tell me the reason for that?
Speaker 2: Well, my brother's health wasn't too good and we just thought that maybe we would sell the property there and we felt that Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia] would come right in and operate as Bob [Robert Paschal] and I had. So we sold to Clark Atlanta University.
Speaker 1: Okay. And tell me what happened after you sold it?
Speaker 2: Well, I thought that other than the airport operation at that time, which we were involved with, that I was on my way to retirement, but I soon found out that it wouldn't work. So, I got back involved with the restaurant operation and I am just as involved now almost as I've ever been in, in business.
Speaker 1: Okay, when you sold the, the motor hotel to Atlanta University, they renamed it the Paschal's Center [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes, they named it the Paschal's Center.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is it being used for now?
Speaker 2: It's not being used for anything. It's, it's closed down.
Speaker 1: Oh, it's closed down now?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was their idea to use it as a dormitory at one time?
Speaker 2: They used it as a dormitory and a restaurant and I don't know what happened, but there were--at one time they--there was ideas of taking it down, demolishing the building, but there was a lot of protests across the country and locally they thought it should remain standing and used as a historical site, so right now not anything is being done and I, I don't know just where it's going now.
Story_ID: 507263
Speaker 1: Tell me about the passing of your brother [Robert Paschal], that was in 1997?
Speaker 2: My, my brother, yeah he passed in 1997.
Speaker 1: So what were your thoughts now about Paschal's Restaurant [Atlanta, Georgia]? What was the future for Paschal's Restaurant after that time?
Speaker 2: The present one or the one before that?
Speaker 1: Well, you were still at the old location [Paschal's Motor Hotel and Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia] and you're getting ready to build a new building, is that right?
Speaker 2: Oh, when my brother passed?
Speaker 1: Well it's, it's after your brother passed, yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah. No, we sold the old building in '96 [1996] and we opened the new restaurant in 2002, no, yeah, in '96 [1996].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't only sell the hotel, you sold the restaurant as well?
Speaker 2: We sold the whole property, the club, the hotel, the restaurant.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. And so what did you do from '96 [1996] until the new facility was built?
Speaker 2: Well, I operated the airport operation [Concessions/Paschal's, J.V.].
Speaker 1: Okay, but that wasn't a day to day operation for you, you had employees out there, is that right, or were you out there also?
Speaker 2: Well, I was there but we were well-staffed and I, I, I, I, I wasn't becoming directly involved with, in much, in much of the day by day activity, so that's, that's the reason I got involved with the new restaurant.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and who finances the, the new restaurant for you?
Speaker 2: Who, who, who financed it?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, that also is a partnership--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that's Mr. Russell [HistoryMaker Herman Russell] and myself.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: That--Mr. Russell and myself were the partners there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. And who designed the building?
Speaker 2: Yes, Johnson and Johnson [sic.].  They're architectural people, Johnson architectural firm.
Speaker 1: And who picked out the area? Who, who sited this location for you?
Speaker 2: Well, Mr. Russell had owned that property for a long time, so we started talking about it, got some plans and took off.
Speaker 1: And this location is on Northside Drive?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right? And was it a plan to make it near the Georgia Dome [Atlanta, Georgia]? Was there a strategic plan when you picked this location?
Speaker 2: Well, yes we had cultivated so many friendships around the community and over at the university [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]. It's just that know, we knew so many of the people and so many of the people from the churches that were around in the community, so we thought that was a good, that would be a good location.
Story_ID: 507264
Speaker 1: So tell me about the facility? Tell me about the different rooms and just tell me about the whole facility (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Up at the restaurant [Paschal's Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, the main dining room, it seats 125 people. And, and the bar area will seat forty guests. The, the banquet room will seat 125. And the foyer will accommodate four--reception gallery number about forty people. And the loft area will accommodate about seventy people.
Speaker 1: And I know that you have a coffee shop, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And we have a private dining room that will accommodate thirty-five.
Speaker 1: And I notice you have a coffee shop, is that the--

Speaker 1: So tell me some of--well, tell me about the opening night of the restaurant?
Speaker 2: Ma'am?
Speaker 1: Tell me about the opening of the restaurant?
Speaker 2: The opening, well, we had a lot of people out for the opening, the mayor and the number of other dignitaries and our ceremonies went on for about a half a day and it was certainly a rewarding experience we had that day.
Speaker 1: And this is a beautiful facility. How much did it cost to build this facility?
Speaker 2: The cost to build a new facility?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I don't want to exaggerate; I can't remember right now the cost of that.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, but it was somewhere around maybe $5 or 6 million?
Speaker 2: I would, I would--since, since I can't think I wouldn't like to guess (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Okay.
Story_ID: 507265
Speaker 1: What else do you want to tell me about, about your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I will say that I think that I've been wonderfully blessed by the Almighty. I can't remember of any business venture that I have entered into since I was fourteen that has not been successful. I certainly have enjoyed meeting and cultivating friendships with a whole lot of people across the nation.
Speaker 1: Who are some of your friends? Tell me who some of your friends are, and some of the people that you have met over the years?
Speaker 2: Well, there are friends; I have so many, let's see. There was the Kendalls (unclear). There was the (unclear) and we had friends, just, we had--both of them. A lot of my friends that I met way back yonder have passed on, but I'm talking about, people, just I know by them coming into the restaurant [Paschal's Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia] saying, "Hello, I'm glad to see you," and I learning their names, that's a whole lot of those. But if you were going to think in terms of close friendships, ones that were cultivated years ago, it's sad to say, but a lot of them have passed on.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Tell me about church, what church do you attend?
Speaker 2: Curtis [Paschal's son, Curtis Paschal]?
Speaker 1: What church do you attend?
Speaker 2: Church?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I have two churches that I attend: Shiloh Baptist [Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] and First Congressional Church [First Congregational Church of Atlanta, United Church of Christ, Atlanta, Georgia]. My family is Baptist, denomination is Baptist. My wife [Phyllis Johnson Paschal] was, she attended the First Congressional Church. She served on the deacon board and she was very active in, in church, so I, I, I, I, I attend, I attend both churches.
Story_ID: 507266
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you about legacy. The Paschal's Restaurant [Atlanta, Georgia] is a legacy. How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: You know that's a good question. I would like to be remembered as a person that has operated in the hospitality business and a person that has always tried to treat people right, a person that has generated a lot of good friendships and I suppose that's it.
Story_ID: 507267
Speaker 1: We were the first restaurant to hire white waitresses in our restaurant [Paschal's Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia]. We were the first restaurant to hire white waitresses in our club [La Carrousel Lounge, Atlanta, Georgia]. So that, that didn't take to well with some people, so, we got a lot of telephone calls regarding that and, "Why do you do this?" And, "You should make a change in your policies." But we operated our business the way we thought we should. That was to be fair with everybody. To allow those young ladies that we hired from the college system--they needed help just like every college, just like the African American people. And we thought that if we were getting some support from around town that we should give that support to.
