 Finchum Today is November 9, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum     Bearer Hello Tanya   Finchum (Laughter)    along with Alex Bishop, and we   re with Oklahoma State  University. Today we are in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, to speak with Lou  Bearer, and this is part of our Oklahoma 100 Year Life. Thank you for  having us.  Bearer Hooray  (Laughter)  Finchum Did I pronounce your name right?  Bearer Bearer, yeah. It   s close enough. Up where my folks come from it was     Beer.    I drink beer.  Finchum And where did they come from?  Bearer Pennsylvania.  Finchum Okay, let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Bearer I was born 1915, August the 29th, in Trafford, T-R-A-F-F-O-R-D,  Trafford, Pennsylvania, Westmoreland County.  Finchum What did your parents do for a living?  Bearer My dad worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad, my mother was a  homemaker, a good one.  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  5  Bearer I had quite a number. One sister and I guess three brothers. Is that right?  Yeah. Robert, Ralph, and Paul, yeah.  Finchum And what was the sister   s name since we   re naming.  Bearer Dora. D-O-R-A, Dora.  Finchum And where were you in the lineup?  Bearer Where was I? Let   s see, Cubby, my eldest brother, then Ralph who  deceased at an early age, then I, so I was number three. Then Paul, and  then finally Dora.  Finchum Are you the first one to make it to 100.  Bearer I   m the only one. Did that answer the question? (Laughter)  Finchum Have any idea why that might be? Your secret?  Bearer Yeah, do you really want to hear it? Wine, women, and song, and  mastication. (Laughter)  Finchum In that order?  Bearer I think so, in that order, wine, women, and song. Yeah, I think so. The  mastication is really chewing my food, because I was taught at an early  age in public school, we had no parochial school, to chew twenty-one  times every bite. So I   ve practiced that, unconsciously, because I get  more nourishment from the food, it tastes better, I don   t eat as much,  and it takes time so that we at the dinner table can have a lot of time for  talk. That   s what the meal should be, enjoying each other. You can   t  enjoy when you   re chewing your food and making noise. Okay?  Finchum Okay. Well song, does that mean you sing?  Bearer We sang a lot. I sang a lot. We organized, three of us, four of us,  organized   a four people?  Finchum Quartet?  Bearer Quartet, in high school. We got a teacher to help us and do a little  training. We became a, I think, a pretty good quartet, which led us into  performing quite a bit on the stage, which then lead, I guess, to minstrel  shows where I was blackface along with my good friends, negroes,  black people. They get dolled up like we did. From that I was lead into  6  the Glee Club at the University of Pittsburgh, which I thoroughly  enjoyed. Had become an officer in that club. It   s strange because I think  about it, in the fourth grade the teacher, public school, patrolling while  we   re singing in class. She came up behind me and said,    Louis, you   re  not singing.    From that day on I no longer was afraid to sing, I had a  voice. It was fear of singing up until that time. (Laughter)  Finchum Did you have a favorite song?  Bearer Not then, but I have a favorite song now. Neil Diamond   s    Caroline         Sweet Caroline    .  Finchum You want to sing a little bit for us?  Bearer No, I don   t know it that well.  Finchum It   s    Sweet Caroline   , isn   t it?  Bearer    Sweet Caroline   , yeah. It happens that my physical therapist has the  name Carolyn. That   s why that song has come back in my memory,  because of her personal efforts on my carcass, and because I like Neil  Diamond. He   s my favorite singer. Is he still living?  Finchum I don   t know, is he?  Bishop Yes.  Bearer He is?  Finchum I thought it might be Elvis.  Bearer No, he   s a young man as far as I   m concerned. (Laughter)  Finchum Where did you go to elementary school?  Bearer Where? No, there was no elementary school in our system. First we  went to the first grade. I chose the name of the teacher to attend her  class, Ms. Lewis. Her last name L-E-W-I-S, you can see the connection.  It happened my daddy was a longtime member of the schoolboard, and  so he had an opening to get me in the class that was good for me, that  he thought that I wanted to attend. Ms. Lewis was my first grade  teacher, son of a gun.  Finchum What was the name of the school?  Bearer Trafford Elementary School I guess.  7  Finchum And then high school?  Bearer Same thing.  Finchum What year did you graduate?  Bearer Oh, Jiminy     Finchum In 1930-something?  Bearer Yeah, 1930.  M. Bearer In    33.  Bearer    in    33, thank you somebody.  Robin May 26, I have his diploma.  Bearer Oh, there you are  (Laughter) Nineteen-what? Twenty-six?  Robin Thirty-three.  Bearer Thirty-three, that fits. I guess the diploma   s right. (Laughter)  Finchum Did you have a favorite subject?  Bearer Not particularly. I had some I didn   t like, most because it was too much  routine. Also, I didn   t do well in them. That was history. That   s when I  got my first and only    D    and that set me straight, because I hadn   t     studied history. So I hit the books and I guess I got out of that course  with a    B    maybe. Maybe an    A   , but I made the grade. That was in  junior high I think.  Finchum Did you work any while you were in high school?  Bearer Work for pay? No. Work around the house, yes. For pay, no. I had three  meals a day (laughs) and a bed.  Finchum And what did you call those meals? Breakfast and what was the noon  meal?  Bearer That   s a good question. I don   t know if we did. Now it   s lunch, but I  don   t know if we have it a name. Now, the evening meal was supper.  My dad worked the night shift all his life, so supper was the big meal  when Dad could attend the meal with us, and it was one of  8  conversation. I didn   t have much to say, but somebody there did. I  guess it was Dad and the other brothers.  Finchum What was your favorite thing your mother made?  Bearer Her favorite, and I think it became our favorite, was angel food cake.  She would break the eggs by hand, make the separation by hand, no  mechanical equipment, and I guess a dozen egg whites, or maybe  twenty-four egg whites, beat them by hand, until they fluffed up and  became solid. You have to admire a woman who would put that much  energy into baking a cake for the family, but it became one, I think,  every week. We had chickens, so we got the eggs from them.  Finchum You lived on a farm then?  Bearer No, we lived in town, in Trafford. Had a chicken coop at the back in  those days. I collected the eggs on occasion. Great learning experience.  There was one rooster there that didn   t like intruders, and I was an  intruder, but he loved my younger brother Paul. They became  companions. That rooster would do everything that brother Paul told  him to do, but he would chase me and I didn   t like him. (Laughter)  Bishop Did he have a name?  Bearer I don   t think he ever   he had a name for him, but I don   t remember any  name.  Finchum Would some of the chickens end up on the plate?  Bearer Indeed they did. I think we had chicken every weekend. Sunday was the  big meal. I remember Dad chopping the head off in the yard. Dad had  come from the farm, a hatchet we used around the house. He took the  hatchet, placed the chicken   s neck over a block of wood and wham, and  then throw the chicken out, and the chicken and it   s death spasms would  jump all over the yard. It was a sight. I long remember   didn   t  understand why that chicken died that way. Anybody here have an  answer to that question? I guess     Robin It   s how they die.  Bearer It would dance, or growl, or prowl, whatever, throw itself around for  about five minutes until it was exhausted. I   ve often wondered what  happened to the head. I guess it went into the rubbish pile.  Finchum Would she fry it or bake it?  9  Bearer Predominantly baked. It was an experience. The chicken would be  dowsed in boiling water, the dead carcass, in boiling water.    What   s  that for, Mom?       That   s to loosen the feathers.    So then she would sit  down to the table, and we would help a little bit, and pluck the feathers  out of the dead carcass. Then we had natural gas fuel there. On the farm  they had coal and wood. The pin feathers, I think that   s what they call  them, would be scorched off by passing the denuded chicken carcass  over the flame to burn off those little pin feathers. It was quite an  experience. Mother did that.  Finchum It probably didn   t smell too good, did it?  Bearer I don   t remember. No, no smell. It was part of life, so you accept those  smells.  Finchum Sure. Did she have a large garden?  Bearer A large garden? Well, large, I don   t know, but a garden in which  Mother and Dad, to a certain extent, what she could get us kids to do,  would grow string beans, and corn, and tomatoes, and strawberries, and  I don   t think we grew potatoes. Those were too easy to get from the  store I guess, but all kinds of vegetables. I   m a vegetable-man although  I like meat, but the liking for vegetables came because that   s what we  had every meal. Fresh vegetables, cooked by Mom, plucked out of the  garden. If it was winter it came out of the jar because the food   the  surplus from the garden was canned by Mom and put into glass jars,  Mason jars, and preserved in the cellar where it wouldn   t freeze so we  would have that kind of food through the winter. We had vegetables in  winter.  Finchum She planned ahead.  Bearer You bet. You bet.  Finchum Did she make your clothes? Did she sew?  Bearer She sewed, but she didn   t make clothes. She mended clothes, and she  altered their size to keep up with growth I guess. We bought clothes,  and I don   t have much memory of the clothing we bought until I got  older, when I was old enough to wear a suit. I guess that was entering,  maybe, junior high.  Finchum Had hand-me-downs.  Bearer Oh a lot of hand-me downs. As long as they would last.  10  Finchum When you finished high school what did you do?  Bearer I spent the summer at Boy Scouts in Boy Scout Camp, but went then to  the university, University of Pittsburgh. I had a half-scholarship. I don   t  know how that happened, but I guess my grades were good enough to  get it, a half-scholarship. Tuition per semester was three hundred bucks.  So Dad had to come up with  150 twice a year. How he did that, I don   t  know.  Finchum Were you the first one to go?  Bearer No, all of us made the university. Everyone graduated from the  university. I don   t know how my parents did it. Well, I guess he saved  his money. I never thought the job paid that much because a lot of it  was spent rearing the family to begin with. We had one house change  that I remember. Moved from Sixth Street to Fairmont Avenue. Both of  these houses were brick. Sixth Street was yellow, the house on Fairmont  Avenue was red brick. The house on Fairmont, which I remember most,  had only two bedrooms, really, two bedrooms, and a tiny little room,  which as occasions came, I would occupy. We had an attic, so Paul  lived in the attic. He became an electronic, a radio man, and then used  that, when he graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, to take a  position with Bell Telephone Labs, where spent his career.  Finchum What was your major?  Bearer Chemical engineering. Chemical engineering is derived from  mechanical because it is taking machinery, pipes, and pumps,  centrifuges, and the rest of it, and putting a chemical process through  them to make that chemical process continuous rather than in a single  reactor which is what they had done up until, I guess, that time.  Finchum That was in the    30s? Mid    30s?  Bearer Yeah. I graduated in    37, 1937.  Finchum Let   s back up a little bit. Do you remember much about the Depression  years?  Bearer I remember a lot about the Depression years, because I had the good  fortune yesterday just to pass some of those memories on to one of my  grandsons who had to write a paper in his school on the Depression. I  knew more than he was able to take down. Yes, I remember a lot about  the Depression because at the Depression, and when it started in the  East among the manufacturing establishments, and Westinghouse,  which was the primary company in our town, couldn   t keep up with the  11  payroll. They would dismiss people and there was a lot of  unemployment, but there was no government aid. I must say, no  government aid. Those were the good old days  Government aid is a  mistake. It makes people dependent on somebody else whereas they  should grow up, be trained, live self-sufficient, which is really the  American scheme. Excuse the word scheme, the American plan.  Anyway, the Depression: people would come to our house, as they did  to many houses, they were in need of clothing, and of food. They got  handouts, whatever we had. Tramps would come to the backdoor, they  would eat on the porch. Cold winter days, they would come in and eat  in the kitchen. Mother would always serve the bums, the tramps,  something. We got acquainted a little bit with them, not by name, but  by the fact that there were unfortunate people in the world who needed  help, but on the Depression in particular, people would come to our  house and somehow or another   now Dad was working night turn. I  think he started at midnight, which meant he had to leave the house at  about eleven, so up to that time   in addition to all the other things he  did in charity work, he would receive the unfortunate people who  needed help.  Now we didn   t have the help, but people were contributing and I guess  there was a source from the city to distribute food and clothing. Hand  downs, yes, everything. Dad somehow or another was taking these  folks    names and writing up something about them so that they could be  given a ticket and go wherever it was to get the food. One incident I  remember in particular. I would help to the extent I could before I went  to bed and before Dad had to go to work. When a gentleman   I   d owe  him great credit. When a man came up and I greeted them and  welcomed them into the house. He said,    I   m here because the world  owes me a living and I   m here to collect.    He needed a handout, so I  had to usher him into Dad   s   where he was working. I guess in the  living room or some place. I don   t know what happened in there, but  about two days later somebody took a potshot at my father in front of  the Buick dealership in town, missed him, but I suspect it was this bird  who had probably been denied a handout because    the world owes him  a living,    but not the Bearers. (Laughter)  The Depression. I remember people   during the Depression I went into  college, into the University. We traveled, all five of us, got to the  University of Pittsburgh by rail. Dad worked on the Pennsylvania  Railroad, he got a pass, free transportation for the family. That   s how I  got to the University, through transportation provided by the  Pennsylvania Railroad because my dad was an employee. I presume  they did this for everybody. It was a ride of about fifteen or twenty  miles from Trafford to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where we disembarked  12  from the train at a station called    Shady Side    just outside of the  Pittsburgh Union Station. We walked there. That was probably a two or  three mile walk into the University. We did it twice a day.  Sometimes we ran there to catch the train, and every morning at  Trafford we ran down the hill to catch the train, because we were  always late. The train would pull out slowly because the engineer knew  they had a bunch of college kids running late, and we   d hop the moving  train. He   d toot the whistle to get us some extra speed. At nighttime  coming back from the University, always late, always at night, I would  fall asleep. The conductor, fortunately, would wake me and I would get  up, wake up, get off the train, and walk a mile back up the hill this time  to our house. Now that was the use of the train. For four years that was  my life.  Let   s see, we started talking about the Depression. Oh  In Pittsburgh  many a time I saw an unemployed person, I guess, standing on the  corner selling apples to make some money or getting handouts.  Nevertheless, that situation never affected my family to the point where  we ever were hungry or where we ever didn   t have some clothing   an  overcoat or warm clothing to wear in the wintertime. I do remember on  those walks of a mile or so, whatever, to the station and a mile down at  Pittsburgh of walking through the slush, which is the reason I decided I  couldn   t stand the Pittsburgh weather. But walked through slush, wet  shoes, cold weather, sitting all day. I don   t know why I lived with wet  shoes. They would dry out in class and we would do the thing all over  again and put on wet shoes in the morning. What a life. (Laughter) Talk  about sustenance. (Laughter)  Let   s see, oh  The University at Pittsburgh at that time was still in the  act of building what then became a skyscraper. I think one of the few  skyscrapers at colleges, universities, in the country. That became known  as the    Cathedral of Learning   . A very special building built as a gothic  church would   ve been, but high with proper stone carvings inside and  out, and a big room which was on the first floor called the Commons  Room. Around the Commons Room were a series of rooms called     well, I   ll call them Empire Rooms, I   ll think of it, equipped, decorated,  set up by various nationalities in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh was full of  different nationalities. Many of them Catholic. They would equip these  rooms   they called them Nationality Rooms. Every nationality that  wanted to, and could, equipped such a room, had the opportunity to  build a room at the   the room was supplied at University expense.  They paid for the rest, to honor their nationality and their people who  lived in Pittsburgh. I think that was a great thing to do.  13  The University in building the cathedral, it was underway when I was  there, so we were going to school in an unfinished building. The  elevators ran, but the rooms were not finished. They were just stone  walls, concrete stone, block, no hardware much on the doors, no  woodwork, still under construction. What a great time to go to school,  because you can remember those things. In a school where everything is  done for you by somebody else ahead of you, you don   t have these  kinds of memories.  Finchum So when you graduated from there in 1930     Bearer Seven.  Finchum And then what did you do?  Bearer I got a job with the Westinghouse Company in a department, which was  given the name of the product they were producing: Laminated Plastics.  The old style, formaldehyde heat-setting resin. So predominantly made  in sheets and cut up to fit a particular thing. My job was in the lab at  first, and then the cutback came and I was offered a chance to go to the  office and do cost-accounting work.  The great production at that time, I didn   t realize it although I knew  what was going on, was making pulleys. This was out of thermoplastic.  The planks would be made in molds with ball bearings, and then the  grooves and the pulley would be cut on machinery, by the machinist on  the floor, but these were aircraft pulleys for the control cables.  Enormous quantities of those were being produced. I didn   t realize that  we were getting equipped for the war. Now this was in    37. I graduated  in    37 and left there in    40. When I asked for active   I was a reserve  officer in the Coast Artillery, so I asked for active duty in 1940. Partly  because I was disappointed with my career in the office, and I wanted to  do something else, and I knew that there was going to be a war so I  asked for active duty.  The reason I knew there was going to be a war? Because F.D.R,  Franklin Delano Roosevelt, president, said,    I hate    wahr   .    (Laughter)  And I knew we were going to be in war. He hated war, but we were  making all kinds of plans for it. How is this possible? He lied. I don   t  know what he would   ve said, but he lied. I   ve always held that and  numerous other lies against him and others of like ilk. I   m a  conservative if you don   t sense it. (Laughter)  Finchum When you were active duty what did you have to do?  14  Bearer Oh yeah, let   s see   in 1940 I applied for active duty and received  orders to go to   oh gee. Barracks near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,  Carlisle Barracks. Named after Indians I think, Carlisle. Took my basic  work there. Now it   s not basic as an infantryman, because I was already  given the title of officer, but just to get organized to bring the troops  together. I think a mustering point for further assignments. From  Carlisle Barracks I was sent to Detroit, because in the Coast Artillery     the Coast Artillery was closed down because that was to prevent an  invasion, but I became a part of the Air Corps. Note: Air Corps, not Air  Force, Air Corps, Army Air Corps. So I was sent to Detroit in what they  called the Material Command, to make the parts of airplanes, not by us,  but by contractors. So I became a part of the military staff, sort of  supervising the contractor at work on his contracts for the government  to see that they were doing a proper job, that as it was. From  Detroit   shall I go on?  Finchum Sure   Bearer From Detroit, in due time, because that also was a mustering  point   sorry. I had an experience a couple weeks ago which is still with  me.  Finchum Do we need to take a break?  Bearer No, I   m alright now. Let me explain, one of the machines that they use  on my back   I broke my back on my birthday two months ago or  something. Annabeth can tell you why. They put a magnetic series of  pads on my back and by magnetic, electronic   it quivers. I guess it  does something to the muscles. The machine went haywire and went off  stroke, and I still have the effects. Only Annabeth and I, and now you  folks know this. I   m not going to sue anybody. Anyway, where was I?  Robin You were in Detroit.  Bearer From Detroit I was sent down to Fort Worth in Texas, a Yankee going  down to Rebel Land. (Laughter) A Republican going down to Democrat  Land in Texas. I was given the assignment of property officer for all the  material that was being shipped into the Consolidated Vultee  Bomber   Plant, who were making   well, putting together B-24   s, presumably to  assemble parts which were made by Ford Motor Company in Michigan.  They shipped down to Fort Worth for final assembly into an airplane.  My job, this is stupid and unreal, my job as property officer and all  property officers at that time are in this situation, had personal  accountability for all the supplies that came in. We were personally  responsible. We had to account for them  Isn   t that stupid? There were  15  millions of dollars of material coming in and I was responsible. I didn   t  have that much money. (Laughter) Anyway, that was the job.  I went from there because of a slight encounter with the commanding  officer. I said something to him one time that he thought was improper,  I guess.    I   ll have you transferred,    and so he did. There   s an  intervening action there I   ll come back to, so in one week we found  ourselves in Cheyenne, Wyoming, as far away from Detroit, the  headquarters, as they could get us. In the meantime while in Fort Worth,  one of the contractors to build the plant, the construction of the plant  not the operation of the plant, was a contractor in which a beautiful  woman, girl, worked. Through the glass partitions, I had an office there,  I saw a gorgeous head of black hair from the back. I said,    Who has that  beautiful hair?    Am I getting off base?  Finchum No, you   re good.  Bearer So I arranged to find out who she was. This encounter   not her  encounter   but with her boss, occurred in the restroom. Where else but  in a restroom? (Laughter)    Who is that person?    He gave me her name,  Priscilla Boyd, B-O-Y-D. I said,    Do you think I could have a date with  her?    He said,    Well, I   ll talk to her and see if it   s okay.    (Laughs)  Imagine  They knew I was a Yankee, they knew I was a Republican,  they were Democrats, white folk. So we met each other and our first  date was December the 20th of 19   Pearl Harbor month.  Robin Forty-one.  Bearer How much?  Finchum Forty-one.  Bearer Forty-one, okay. Her name was Priscilla, and she was to become my  wife. I didn   t know this, but somebody was doing the directing of this  episode. We went to a dance to celebrate, December the 20th, after  Pearl Harbor, put on by the Jaycees when they used to have Junior  Chamber of Commerce. I bought a ticket and invited her, it was our first  date, to go to this dance. I   m not much of a dancer, so after a dance or  two   she loved it and I didn   t do her well, but I said,    Let   s go have a  Coke or something in the caf  .    We went into the cafeteria and sat the  rest of the dance, the rest of the evening, just drinking a Coke and  shooting the bull   talking, because there was a lot to discuss. We were  getting acquainted.  I think the Holy Spirit was doing some work because in six months later  we were married. In six months she had become a Catholic. I hope this  16  doesn   t offend anybody, but she was just a graduate of Texas Christian  University in Fort Worth. She told me, because I asked her why she  became a Catholic, she said,    I took every religious course, every  theological course that the university offered and I had questions and I  wasn   t getting answers.    I said to her,    Maybe I can help that out.    I  took her to St. Patrick   s Cathedral. She was a Baptist. I was a Catholic.  I introduced her, for reasons I don   t know, to the priest with whom I  had become acquainted. I was a stranger, but I don   t know why and  how I became acquainted with four, or five, or six priests in this church.  I had dinner with them at their invitation, in the rectory. Who could be  so lucky?  I said,    Let me introduce you to the priest, and they   ll answer your  question.    There was a Father Langenhorse present, who was an  intellectual, properly suited for her, from Belgium. Perfect English. She  met up with him, and he gave her instructions in the faith. In six  months, after December the 20th, on June the 6th we were married.  That   s a fast-moving   the war is on. My folks, Mother and Dad, came  down from Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, to Fort Worth, to attend this  wedding. They came by rail of course, they couldn   t get an airplane.  There were no seats available, so they stood the whole time, in the aisle.  They were civilians, the GI   s had all the seats. Nobody, to my  knowledge, offered them a chair. I think it was probably the other way  around. They offered their seats to the GI   s. I don   t know that. Anyway,  they attended this wedding.  On June the 6th   we had, I think, a weekend pass, military pass, so we  went to San Antonio for what we would call our honeymoon, a  weekend, which was quite enough because I was still in the military.  We came back, it was shortly thereafter that we   the commanding  officer was too busy to attend the wedding. Which is okay, they had a  lot of things to do. Within one week of the wedding I found myself with  my bride in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in a new job, a new command, and  everything. So I spent the war as contracting officer in Cheyenne,  Wyoming, at a small plant ran by United Airlines then. I don   t think  United exists today, in what they call the modification center.  Modification centers were those establishments established by the Air  Corps to make last minute changes in certain aircrafts to fit them for a  particular mission someplace. All secret. Nobody talked about the work  they were doing. The plans were confidential. I didn   t know what they  were doing. My job as contracting officer was to approve the payments  if they were justified. It was a grand experience. United Airlines was a  good contractor. They knew what their job was, and they did their job  without too much unwarranted expenditures.  17  Anyway, I spent the major part of the war there, and then as the war  was winding down and the government knew that it was winding down,  they made it possible for reasons, their plan, to offer scholarships for  selected people to go to a university for advanced degrees in certain  engineering professions for which they saw a need in the future. I chose  ceramic engineering, so I was sent to the University of Illinois, along  with Priscilla, no kids yet, at government expense. We drove my little  old Chevrolet. I spent a year at the University of Illinois in a new field,  ceramic engineering, got a master   s degree, graduated, and was sent  there to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.  The war was obviously winding down and was concluding. They had  surplus officers. They were anxious to get rid of all they could so I  asked for termination and was granted my departure. Then I was in the  field looking for a job. We went to Trafford, Pennsylvania and lived  with my folks for months, until I found a job. We wrote   I guess  Priscilla must have typed forty or fifty letters of application, and I got a  whole series of job interviews. A couple of, I guess, offers. I couldn   t  make up my mind, because I was applying now as a ceramic engineer.  Got one from Phillips Petroleum Company in Bartlesville, Oklahoma   Whoever heard of it?  Oh  How this happened   my commanding officer in Cheyenne,  Wyoming, had come from Tulsa, knew about Phillips Petroleum  Company. He said,    When we   re done with this mess, if you   re looking  for a job, let me see if I can get you a connection with Phillips.    I said,     I don   t want to work for a magnesia company.    (Laughter) That   s what  I knew. He got me straightened out. So Phillips was high on the list for  a couple of reasons. On my letter of application to them, as it was  forwarded through the company, they sent me copies of their  forwarding letters, which I thought was darn nice, to the various  departments that might be interested in this bird.  I had a job and didn   t know it, but we finally decided we had to leave  Trafford, my folks, and get on the road and pick up some interviews on  the way and make a decision to go join one. Phillips had already  submitted an offer. En route, near the end of December, snow on the  ground, colder than Hades, we made up our minds to accept the offer  from Phillips Petroleum Company. This was about, I guess, the 30th of  December   the date is a little important. The 30th of December I sent  them a telegram and said,    I   m going to arrive down there on the 31st or  the 1st of January, I would like to accept the job offer.    We showed up  and resided in the Burlingame Hotel, which is now an office building  for Phillips   no, for the city. The city finally bought   this is a long  developing thing. They bought the building, which is the headquarters  for the city. At that time it was a hotel named the Burlingame Hotel. I  18  owned a room in that, because we stayed there one month while we  sought lodging elsewhere. There wasn   t anything in town because this  was still boom-territory.  Let   s see, we stayed in the Burlingame for a month, found an apartment  someplace, eventually. I eventually bought a house under, I guess, the  GI Bill, a house for about 7,500 dollars in what was known as the  Phillips Edition, because Phillips built a lot of houses and got them sold  to new recruits because they were looking for manpower too. They  were booming, which is why I got a job.  My job was working on a device which we named the Pebble Heater.  It   s a heat exchanger in which pebbles in an upper chamber would be  heated by combustion of fuel and go through a narrow neck into a  bottom chamber which became a reactor into which we emitted  hydrocarbon gas for thermos-cracking. This was to compete against  cracking and stainless steel tubing. Unfortunately we couldn   t solve two  problems. The pebbles would fracture, which is why I was there. They  were ceramic pebbles about yay big, half-inch or so. They would  fracture because that became a terrible thermos-shock in being exposed  to cold hydrocarbon gases, but we weren   t advanced far enough to  examine the fundamentals of what was the nature of the action of the  thermos-shock and the kind of material that would sustain it. We  weren   t that advanced.  The second reason that process didn   t work is because we could not  solve the problem of carbon buildup where the gas first met the hot  pebbles. It was decomposed instantly which left carbon. The carbon laid  down and restricted the flow of the pebbles. The stainless steel tubing  won out, it is the way to go. Ceramic engineering couldn   t solve the  problem. Now where was I?  Finchum You   re doing fine. (Laughter) You just bought a house for  7,500.  Bearer Oh yeah  We had our first child, not in that house. I was born at home.  All kids in my day were born at home. In those days we were born in  the only hospital we had then. Not we, Bob was born, our eldest, by Dr.     I   ve forgotten his name. He delivered the first and the last. I really  mean the last of five.  Finchum You were pretty busy with five.  Bearer Try it. (Laughter) It   s worth it, I   ve got five great kids. Have I used this  expression before? This is a happy home. I think A.B. (Annabeth) gave  it this name, because when this crowd gathers there   s nothing but talk,  talk, talk, talk. Everybody   s jabbering. There was a time when I could  19  understand and hear them, and participate, but it   s just talk, talk, talk,  now. It   s a happy home. Five kids, plus spouses, plus kids   Finchum And what were their names?  Bearer Bob (Robert) and   Jiminy. Don   t help me  Don   t help me  (Laughter)  Oh  There she sits  Annabeth, Ann Elisabeth actually, but contracted by  her will to Annabeth, which is okay. Then what is your name?  (Laughter)  M. Bearer Put you on the spot, didn   t we?  Bearer And then Susie     Robin Right.  Bearer And then Thomas. I know all those names, but I have difficulty making  quick recall. Five kids. Three boys, two girls. What a motley crew.  Finchum Bob, Annabeth, Susie     Robin Michael.  Finchum Michael, okay.  Robin Michael and then Thomas.  Finchum Okay. Did you stay with Phillips the rest of your career?  Bearer No. When I was fifty-five, because the company program for  employees allowed graduation or departure at age fifty-five, with  whatever you had earned in the retirement program, to leave the  company. They made the decision for me. I was terminated. This was  one of those times that the oil companies cut back ten percent. It   s  going on right now. For economic reasons they have to slice the  employment people. So I left the company and went out in business for  myself selling, of all things, high grade linens. Precious linens, but the  market for linens had gone. Nobody wants to iron a linen garment, or a  linen tablecloth anymore, for which they have paid four or five-thousand  dollars. They just don   t want to make that investment, so the  company went broke.  I went into another business in motivation, selling motivation plans.  That was exciting, worthwhile, but not profitable. I finally decided,     Darn it. I   m going to quit this business and go sell real estate,    because  I always had an attraction, as an engineer, in building houses. We built  20  this one. So I went in the real estate business. Not of building them, but  of selling them, as a real estate agent, and learned the game and became  halfway decent income. Raised the family from that, until I got too old  after what? Twenty-five or thirty-five years of real estate business and  sold the company and got out of that and retired on my vast retirement  program from the Phillips Petroleum Company, which is negligible.  (Laughter)  I had not been with Phillips long enough at a high enough salary to  make a retirement program really worthwhile, so it   s small. Our income  came from whatever I was able to earn in real estate and whatever  Priscilla was able to earn as a teacher, a first grade teacher. Not a first  grade teacher, a first rate teacher teaching English. She taught English  in a different way. Many times the outstanding kids sat in our den and  she was teaching them then, they thought English but she was teaching  them life support, how to live, the ethics of life. A lot of the kids around  here didn   t have that at home. They got it from my dear wife.  Bishop Did you ever meet the president or CEO of Phillips?  Bearer Oh yeah, let me tell you an experience. Which one of many? Well, one.  After I left Phillips and was trying to earn a living on my own, a  blustery day in the fall, I was downtown and wanted to see what was  going on in the stock market, so I went into the stock market and looked  at the board. Somebody behind me started to part my hair. I had long  hair then and didn   t wear a cap, so the hair had become windblown.  Somebody behind me stepped up and began to fix my hair. I said,     What   s going on here?    It gave me the willies. I turned around and it  was Boots Adams, the head man for Phillips Petroleum Company.  (Laughter)  Since then, for reasons I don   t know, I did have dinner at their house,  but that would be another story. I did visit their house up north of town,  very beautiful home, on acreage. They were raising cattle and didn   t  meet him, but got together with his two kids: Steven and Kenneth. Now  the reason I was there because I was in some kind of an association with  Kiwanis   s which these kids were participating in so we were up there  for our meeting with his two kids, which now leads me to why,  probably, some of this happened.  At the Kiwanis Club we had the opportunity to have students from the  school visit us as guests. I think we had one or two a week, if we could  get them and they would visit. The Adams kids had many invitations  and were there frequently because of their position, but also because  they were darn fine kids. One time I was asked to introduce Kenneth  Adams, who still lives here. Still get Christmas cards from him. One  21  time I was asked to introduce Kenneth Adams and I said,    Oh shucks   He   s been here a thousand times, he   s already known. Why does he  need to be introduced? What am I going to say?    So I sat in the den in  there and looked up over the   just happenstance, over the TV and saw  a     Robin Encyclopedia.  Bearer Encyclopedia, thank you  I said,    Ah, there   s my answer.    I looked up  the name Adams, and I made my introduction speech based upon the  findings from that encyclopedia, under the name of    Adams    starting  with the founders of this country. That was to be my introduction. So at  Kiwanis I stood up and gave the   it turned out to be a speech. I don   t  know if I had notes or not, but here Kenneth was sitting beside me and I  was standing giving introductions of all these Adams   .    Some of them,     I said,    were bartenders, some ran saloons, some were thieves, some  were robbers, some were working men. All Adams   .    Everybody began  to laugh, and they hooted and hollered, this introduction. (Laughs) I  guess I should   ve had a badge for the longest introduction. It probably  took fifteen minutes to get this whole string of Adams    out of my  system. (Laughs) Kenneth was laughing so much he fell out of his  chair. Kenneth Adams, the youngest son of Boots.  So that time in the kitchen, that evening in the kitchen, we were having  dinner and the kids were gathered around. I think they were all here at  that time. The telephone rang and Priscilla answered it. She said,    It   s  for you.    I said,    I   ll take it in the bedroom so you guys can keep  eating.    I go in and say,    This is Lou Bearer, hello    or something. He  said,    Lou, this is Boots.    I knew who Boots was. I said,    You   re  kidding me?    He said,    No. This is Boots Adams. I want to tell you     give you thanks. We   re sitting having our dinner and I guess you are  too, I won   t hold you long, but Kenneth   s telling us about your  introduction today at Kiwanis. What a grand and glorious thing you  have done for our family.    This is Boots Adams talking  I   m saying in  my mind,    This is Boots Adams talking.    I said,    Okay, thank you very  much. I appreciate your call,    and hung up. I said,    I wonder who that  was.    I thought (I   ve since forgotten the guy   s name),    I know who  played that joke on me.    One of my friends.  I came back to the table and sat down and all the kids said,    Dad, who  was that?    I said,    That was Boots, Boots Adams he said.    Every one of  them said,    Oh come on. Why would Boots Adams call you?     (Laughter)    That   s who he said he was.    I told them the story of the  introduction so the next day   let   s see, that must   ve been on  Wednesday. Next day, a Thursday, I visited the   Thornberry  That   s  the guy that I thought  called . He was jokester, head of the athletics at  22  Phillips Petroleum Company, and I went in and accused him for having  called me and pretended he was Boots Adams. He grew white in the  face. He says,    Listen Lou Bearer  Any time in this town anybody calls  and says he   s Boots Adams, he   s going to be Boots Adams. It wasn   t I  who made that call.    That   s the first time I really knew who he was.  Interesting story. So you asked the question,    Did I ever meet him?     Yes, I had.  Finchum So Phillips had an athletics director?  Bearer Well yeah, because they built the Adams building and equipped it with  a full-sized gymnasium floor because they were sponsoring the Adams  Basketball   not the Adams   the Phillips 66 Basketball Team. World  champions eventually. The only place those guys had to play and to  practice was in College High, the gymnasium there. Being of a proper  level they were able to get permission to have the team workout there.  So the building was built to accommodate them. If the offices were  needed, well that would be thrown in too. So the Adams Building was  built for that reason.  The Adams Building also had other uses for company meetings and  town meetings. It was used for that purpose, but it was a full-fledged  gymnasium. It was the Phillips 66ers played their national games, when  they were here in town. As I said, they became the national champions  and I guess the athletic champions too.  Thornberry was running this sort of enterprise. The company was  supporting it. It was good advertising. It was a blow to the town when  the Phillips Company shut down the Phillip 66ers. I think it was  probably economic or it may have been pressure for having employees  paid, employees paid as amateur ball  players . I think they began to see  that maybe this wasn   t quite right. They being the competitors as well  as the Phillips Company, which probably was the right decision. It was  a great time for the town, a great time for those basketball players.  Many of them, most of them, rose to high positions in the company. Not  because they were super basketball players, but because they could  make decisions like that. Athletes make decisions.  Bishop Did you ever play sports?  Bearer In high school, football, and I was manager of the basketball team. At  that time they had student managers. Football, I was 135 pound guard.  (Laughter) I was a guard playing beside the center trying to take down  180, 190-pound tackles, guards on the opposing team, who had all come  from the farm, husky guys. I was city-bred. They could toss me around  as they chose.  23  Oh and I was playing   the tackle next to me was Arnold Koepke. Why  I just suddenly remember that name   a student with me, Arnold  Koepke. He was a Catholic so I knew him through the church too. He  pointed out to me, my first game. He said,    You see that guy over  there?    A big tackle from a team, I think was Hurst. He says,    He   s  going to throw you as hard as he can. He   s going to cut you up, so be  ready for him.    By gorry, Arnold Koepke was right. That tackle threw  me down, broke my nose, bloodied it, and made me madder than hell. I  said to myself,    The next play he   s going to get it.    By gorry, a 135-  pound guard threw him on his tail as hard as could be done and down he  fell. Well, I had to get that out of my system. (Laughter) It was good  experience.  One other time, against an equally big team, one of the opposite players  happened to step on my little finger, and he picked me up. He said,     Gee, I   m sorry little boy. I didn   t mean to do that.    (Laughter) Talk  about putting a kid in his place  I became the captain of that team, lost  the game we shouldn   t have lost. We played on a field against a bigger  team, a bigger school, called Braddock, after General Braddock in the  Pittsburgh area. Unfortunately, they were playing on a field which had  no grass. So some bright guy thought that the way to handle that field  was to put down sawdust. Unfortunately, he didn   t anticipate that the  weather does rather peculiar things in that area. It rained and then it  froze, so sawdust became knives. All of them. We had to play on a field  with icicles, which cut us, both teams, up. That was the game that we  should   ve won. I couldn   t get the team   they were worn out. I couldn   t  get the team   we were close  A big team  Anyway, so much for that,  football.  Oh, I wanted to tell you. The star, I hope is interesting, the star on that  team was a halfback. At that time we called them halfbacks. Whatever  they call them now. He was the touchdown maker. I was the guard in  the line. I was the grunt. We were to make   run opposition form so he  could get through. Now it happened that he was a black kid. He was my  best friend, a black kid. He was the vice president of the class, I was the  president. He was the star of the team, I was the grunt. He got the  cheers and applauds. I just got,    Nice job there   . We grew real close.  Lex   his name was Lexy Carter. I   ve eaten meals at his house.  I don   t know if I   ve said this, he was among, in the Negroes  that   George Westinghouse brought to be janitors. Did I say that? Well, in  order to get the janitorial work done in the factories that he was  building, he brought in a bunch of, from some source, a bunch of  Negroes. I got acquainted through the school, because a lot of them  became champion players. All of them were good football players.  24  They were fast. They had that in their nature, and the American whites  are a little bit slower.  Anyway, I became well acquainted with Negroes and with their life, a  Yankee. Then I go to Rebel Land, which had at that time, Negroes in a  different situation. Sort of a caste situation of which my in-laws  participated, in which Priscilla, my wife, also participated, because  these were the handymen. These were the laborers, these were the  garbage collectors, these were the guys you called upon to get jobs done  you couldn   t get anybody else to do. You gave them work. There was a  good relationship among the blacks and the whites in Fort Worth. I had  only been exposed through my good friend Lexy Carter back East. So I  knew how to behave. I don   t know if I was leading up to something or  not. Next question.  Finchum That was an issue here in Bartlesville for a while, wasn   t it? Racial?  Bearer Oh, you want to get on the Ruth Brown subject. I need to tell you, don   t  be carried away by any part you think I may have had in that, because  mine was strictly, I think, best described as an observer. I was not a  participant per se. I did attend some of the meetings. What I   m talking  about is Bartlesville at that time was segregated. We   I guess I can say  we. We had schools on the west side for the blacks. And we had schools  on the east side for the whites. On the west side we would meet  particularly the wives, white wives, would meet with the black folk and  see what help we could give them in getting adjusted and I think that   s  the proper word, to white man   s ways. They ran their own school. We  met the principal and the teachers. We met the mothers and the dads.  They were fine people.  That part of Bartlesville   s history has never been described, that I   m  aware of, of the black perspective, of that segregation that I   m going to  tell you about. It was never described and it should be somehow or  another. They have a point of view which has not been expressed, is not  known, not understood, and not recognized. Maybe what I say will help  a little bit.  Let   s see, I got to know some fine people. They were segregated, they  did not participate in white affairs except as the help, as a maid, as they  were needed, which should not be frowned on. It gave them work, good  work, in surroundings that they never would have seen otherwise   Which was a help to them, a help to the whites of course. We had a  white person, of course, running the public library which was in a  building which has since been torn down and replaced by   gee, I don   t  know. What   s down there?  25  Robin A new library building.  Bearer Oh, of course  Thank you, my librarian daughter will know   a new  library building. Anyway, Ruth Brown, a city employee, white, was the  librarian and ran that library. It was predominantly for white kids.     After all, the blacks had their library in their school west of town. Why  should we have a library for them?    But Ruth Brown was a different  person. I don   t know where she came from. She thought that the blacks  should have some of the privileges and so she did the unknown thing of  having   I guess a black girl, in the library and borrowing a book. It  turned out the book   I think the book was something about Carl Marx,  but I don   t know. This was enough to inflame the town.    A communist?  In the hands of a black person?    Anyway, that fractured things here and  cost Ruth Brown her job. She was pilloried. She was condemned.  She also had some black kids in the Rexall Drugstore who had a lunch  counter and she bought them a lunch.    A black kid sitting in a white  restaurant? Holy smokes, we can   t have that.    So the town, I guess,  threw up in arms except for the group that was working with the blacks  to try to help them in their endeavors. So bad things went to worse and I  guess the situation got bad enough that Ruth Brown was called before  the city council and fired, and there were four of us who were doing  things similar to what I was doing with the black folk and their wives.  We four were given special   four or five, were given special handling.  People say, which I think is wrong, people say that I was sent to Waco  in what then became the rocket fuels plant because of my actions with  the blacks here. I don   t think that   s correct. I don   t think the company  did that, because I had a chance to ask for that opportunity. I was  accepted and I went down to Waco as the chief process engineer for this  new plant. What an opportunity. One of the other guys, of this five I  guess, was sent out to West Texas. Another one was sent to Belgium, in  patents work. There was another one and I don   t know what happened  to him, but the last one had a fairly high position in Research and  Development (R D) in Phillips Petroleum Company. Rumor tells me,  so I   m told, that he was called in by the vice president of R D and  advised that he should drop his work and his association with the  blacks. Should divorce himself from it completely because it was just  not the proper thing to do. He did. The rest of us went out of town, took  new jobs. He stayed here, which is okay. Nobody was   that I know  of   was mad at him or mad at the company for saving his job. He was a  valuable employee.  Anyway, someone   a friend of mine   years later after I had come back  from Waco and was reemployed by Phillips and then I took retirement,  or I was given retirement. That   s better. I was attending a meeting at St.  26  James, our other Catholic Church, and a lot of east-siders were there.  My friend, I almost mentioned his name, I guess was running the  meeting. He had a position with Phillips that was in the company  personnel department. I presume he knew a lot of the background of  what I   m talking about relative to company employees. He had the  temerity to announce publically that, to everybody now, that I was one  of the four or five that was sent out of town by Phillips Petroleum  Company because of my actions with the black folk. That I don   t think  is correct. I asked him,    How in the heck did he know that?    He says,     Well that   s his positon.    He knew all that stuff from his personnel  work. It   s too late, it was already said. That did the company, I think, a  disservice. You may say that they did a disservice to the three or four  guys that they sent away. Well maybe. Some things have to be done.  Next question. Where do we go from here? (Laughter)  Finchum I was trying to figure out the time period. Was that in the    50s or    60s?  Robin Nineteen-fifties.  M. Bearer In the 1950s was when she  Ruth Brown  was terminated.  Robin They were here from 1949 to 1952.  Bearer Okay.  Robin So it was during that period. Yeah, she was terminated in 1950.  Bearer Shall I   A.B.  Annabeth      Robin Yes?  Bearer Shall I say anything about my termination?  Robin It   s up to you. If you want to talk about     Bearer To some people, it   s a hard spot for them. It   s not for me.  Robin Actually it wasn   t because you then got four kids through college after  that.  Bearer Well, by hook or crook   Robin Exactly  (Laughter)  Bearer That   s right.  27  Robin That   s the part I   ve always been amazed at.  Bearer Let   s see, termination, Phillips    I came back from Waco after all this  that I   ve already told you. Let   s say I became surplus, which is probably  true in many ways, because there also was a cutback, but I had a job out  of Waco in the rocket fuels plant of being the last man on the totem pole  to get official secret documents signed by the manager which  represented proposals for new contracts which was our lifeblood. New  contracts from the Air Force, in Washington. My job, as the last man on  the totem pole, was to pull this contract proposal   all the money figures  and the designs, the mechanical designs, of the rockets that we proposed  into a compact message that would make a contract.  Then on a Sunday morning, this was Saturday work, on Sunday  morning my job became   of getting his signature on this document.  Otherwise it wasn   t official. So I had to go to his home on a Sunday  morning before he went to his church at some place either before or  after my church, before I went to mass, to get his signature. We never  discussed an item. I interrupted his day, I hated it. He probably hated it  too. I hated disturbing him. I should   ve objected. I didn   t, I should have.  My job then was, on Sunday morning, taking that document, secret, out  to Waco, a distance of something like thirty miles, in my car, and giving  it to the postmaster to take as a secret document, because he had been  checked out, to get into the mail so it could get to Washington by  special delivery the next day, Monday. What a burden. This was an  annoyance to this gentleman.  Then there were a couple other events that happened, too, in my new  assignment when I came back up here, which irritated him I   m sure. We  had, I   m sure, we had more than one falling out. The time came for  cutbacks and R D. I was now a low man, again, on the totem pole. See  the scene: I was one guy sitting in front of the desk of the Director of  Research surrounded by all of the supervisors, I guess. Why they were  there I don   t know. One or two of them had supervised me, and I was  given my walking papers. I was astounded, I was dumbfounded, I was  so shocked. I didn   t even have gumption enough or sense enough to ask  why and make him spell it out, so I don   t know today. I   m claiming it  was termination because they were cutting back, and I was the man they  couldn   t find the place for. They had to save the money. People think  that   s a sore point with me. It is to the point that I don   t understand, but  it   s not a sore point with me. It must be to other people who heard it.  Anyway, that   s my termination.  Robin That was in 1970 just to give you a frame of reference.  Finchum In 1970?  28  Bearer Yeah.  Robin Because it was when I went to college.  Bearer I had been with the company at (age) 55, 1970. That was the time by the  policy that I could be terminated with retirement and some other  benefits. The retirement is so small    (Laughter) I hadn   t been there  long in the program and I hadn   t been paid enough money to make a  retirement program of much worth. Anyway, I left the company and  then went into   oh, selling linens  Did I mention that?  Finchum Yes, and real estate.  Bearer And then     Finchum And you maintained a happy house through all of that.  Bearer Right, thank you  It was a happy house, in spite of it all. Next question.  Bishop You mentioned church and going to church, how important was that in  your family growing up?  Bearer Very important. Every Sunday we made it. Every kid went to church on  Sunday. They attended what we then had, poor, catechism classes, very  poorly done. That was before the Church got organized in the parishes  and in the dieses to put on a proper education program. I think they do it  better now.  Bishop Do you still go today?  Bearer Too old. I can   t hear what they   re saying.  Robin You go to church.  Bearer Oh, I go to church.  Robin Every week.  Bearer Every week, but before I got disabled, twice a week. Three times a  week, twice on Sunday.  Robin Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday is when you go.  Finchum These days, how early do you get up?  29  Bearer Would you excuse me for a minute?  Finchum Sure.  Bearer We only told you a third of what is there. (Laughter)  Finchum I   d say maybe a tenth   Bearer Maybe. (Laughs)  Finchum So what time do you get up?  Bearer Oh yeah, that   s where we left it. At twelve, two, four, six, and eight.  Finchum And at eight for the day?  Bearer Seven or eight, yeah, for the day. I try to get two naps in. I didn   t have  one this morning, but I   m looking forward to one this afternoon.  (Laughter)  Finchum How long is a nap?  Bearer About an hour.  Finchum And then you go to bed at what time tonight?  Bearer Oh it varies, seven-thirty to eleven-thirty. Sometimes midnight.  Finchum What do you do in-between?  Bearer Watch the TV, read the paper   the headlines. I can   t read the substance  anymore. And talk to whoever   s here, and gab.  Woman? And you do physical therapy.  Bearer Oh yeah, and see doctors  (Laughter) And get my toenails trimmed, and  get haircuts, it   s a mess. (Laughter) Boy   Finchum When you were a youngster what would you do for fun?  Bearer We played in the street, not done much anymore. We played ball, and  we played   I   ve forgotten the name of the game with a stick. The  neighbors, unfortunately, across the street didn   t like the fact that we  were playing ball and the ball would get in their yard. Our yard was up  a terrace. The ball didn   t affect us. That was a bad situation. They  30  complained. We enjoyed our game and the neighbor kids, a lot of kids,  joined in. Let   s see, that   s one thing.  We built the backyard from the chicken coop. I said we had chickens  and a rooster, Paul   s rooster. We built a rollercoaster on boards, as we  could find them, from a crabapple tree at the very back of the yard,  clear down the yard beside of the house down   I don   t remember now  if we went down the terrace to the street. I suspect we probably did. Our  carriage, that we rode, was a mere slab of wood with two runners on it,  and we used bacon grease to grease both it, the thing we rode, as well as  the slide, which had a lath   do they use lath these days? Lath in the  center of the board, which was the track, and then the carriage would  have two pieces of lath to keep it in, like a trolley car. That was fun, and  the neighbors all would crowd around.  My family has always been one with neighbor kids running everywhere.  I don   t know why we put up with them, but as A.B. said,    This is a  happy home.    So that was a game, and it was thrilling because it was  really speedy going down that track. Sometimes we   d fall off the     rider   and get bruised, but happy to get back on. Let   s see     Bishop Were you ever in Boy Scouts as a kid?  Bearer Oh yeah, let me tell you. At a very early age my older brother, oldest  brother   A.B., what   s the difference in age between Cubby and me,  about?  Robin Two or three or four years.  Bearer More than that   Robin Cubby and you?  Bearer Yeah, there was Ralph in there.  Robin Oh, you   re right because there was Ralph. Tell your story and I   ll look  it up.  Bearer Okay, anyway he was a member of the Boy Scouts as soon as he could.  He used the Handbook     Robin Four years.  Bearer Four years. Okay, so for four years of looking at his Handbook and  going through it endlessly, I just couldn   t turn it down. I read all about  the Boy Scouts and couldn   t wait for the time of twelve, at that time,  31  it   s now eleven, to join. I had to be a Tenderfoot  Boy, it was great. I  can   t right now recall some of the names that we used to talk about.  Anyway, when I was eleven I wasn   t admitted to the Boy Scouts, but  my oldest brother was helping run the troop. Dad was a commissioner  or something, helping run the troop and other troops. I had certain  privileges and I came to the Scout meetings and participated as if I were  a Tenderfoot, and I wasn   t because I wasn   t yet old enough. I became a  Tenderfoot at the time that I passed the age, in August of whatever year  that would be.  I made Eagle Scout. On the coffee table is that wood carving I made  during that time of the First Class badge. I was impressed with the  meaning of that badge, of the things that it meant, of pride, and loyalty,  and the whole Scout law.  Bishop He signed it too. (Laughs)  Bearer We lived that more than we did the Ten Commandments. By that I  mean in a loud awkward way. We were talking about the Boy Scout law  knowing that it was really the meaning of the Ten Commandments,  which we were getting in church. Yes, I was a Boy Scout, but we didn   t  have the Cubs at the time. I passed the merit badges, I don   t know how  many I earned.  Bishop I assume you went to camps and those things.  Bearer I want to tell you one incident of camp. I became an Eagle Scout, I  made the grades for that, but at camp I told you that my best friend, the  vice president of the class, high school class, was Lexy Carter, a Negro,  a black kid. We took   oh yeah, as a troop he had become a Scout also  and made Eagle, but joined the troop with my older brother Cubby,  Cubby Bear, Robert Bearer. We filed an application to take the troop to  camp, or they did, the leaders did. I don   t know what year this was, it  was denied. We couldn   t go to camp with a black kid. Now this was in a  part of the Pittsburgh environs, not Pittsburgh itself, but in the outlying  little towns. We couldn   t go to camp because we couldn   t have a Negro.  So Cubby, my eldest brother, and Dad said,    Well, I guess we don   t go  to camp. If we can   t take Lexy Carter we   re not going to your camp      So that   s the way the word was delivered to Scout Headquarters at  which time the rule was changed, and we took Lexy Carter to camp.  Now mind you, this was a likeable kid. He was funny. He was one of  the end men when we had minstrel shows. He blacked up like the rest of  us, but he was full of happiness and joy. On the Tuesday of the camp  week, the camp kids had an election to pick the most popular kid in the  32  camp and who won but Lexy Carter, and got the badge. The only black  kid in the camp.  Somebody, I remember this, I don   t remember who, some leader asked  me if I was going to go swimming. I said,    Oh, no.    He said,    Why  not?    I said,    Lexy   s going. Lexy Carter is going swimming and I don   t  want that stuff to rub off on me.    That was the limit of my knowledge. I  was straightened out. Don   t you frown  (Laughter) That   s the way it  was in those days.  Now, I went to camp. During holidays, in particular during the winter,  we would go to a camp of our own. Did I tell you that my uncle was  district forester? Pennsylvania was divided into two district forests.  Pennsylvania really is a forested and mountainous state, the east and the  west. He was responsible for the west half of the forest and waters, of  the west half of the state. This is important, so among his endeavors he  established what then became the CCC under FDR. The Civilian  Concentration   no   .  Robin Conservation.  Bearer Conversation? (Laughs) The Civilian Concen   darn it  Conversation     Bishop Conservation.  Bearer Conservation   thank you  (Laughter) See what happens when you get  older you guys? Anyway, and they built, at the Pennsylvania state  expense, a series of cabins up in the mountains and would rent them out  on weekends, or any time anybody wanted to use them, for parties to  come up   not a party, but groups that would come up and enjoy the  mountains. We participated in that frequently. Many and many a  weekend in the winter, snow and ice on the ground, we would go to the  Allegheny Mountains and stay in one of those cabins.  Among the other things that the Civilian Conservation Corps did was     yeah, thank you  Was to rebuild some of the streams, build dams, build  parks, build these cabins or these shacks, another was make the forests  habitable for people that didn   t have that experience. It was a great  endeavor. This was at Pennsylvania expense, whatever expense there  was.  Later on Franklin Roosevelt, President Roosevelt, took over and that   s  when it became the CCC under the federal hospices, and they granted  beaucoup money and helped a lot of young kids. It was for boys only. I  don   t think girls participated, and young youth, maybe up to twenty or  twenty-one. It helped them a lot. Taught them things from the city that  33  they would never have learned any other way: woodsmanship,  craftsmanship, fire building, outdoor cooking, indoor cooking, games,  fellowship, the whole schmear. They were a lucky crowd. So were we,  we participated with them.  Finchum What was that uncle   s name?  Bearer Valentino.  Robin Valentine.  Bearer Valentine, okay. I was giving the Italian version, Valentine. My family  had peculiar names. Valentine, district forester. He lived in the city  called Ligonier, which is where   no, which is close to   I   ll think of it  in a minute   where St. Vincent   s College   s located.  Bishop Is it Latrobe?  Bearer Where Arnold Palmer grew up     Robin Latrobe.  Bearer Went to college there, played golf there, and made his record in  Altoona. I never met him, but on weekends when we   d go up to visit the  folks in Ligonier, we would always go through the town and think of  Arnold Palmer. Nobody in my family, then, was a golfer. Now I think I  have golfers   uh huh, and Tom. (Laughs) Well anyway     Bishop Did you ever think you   d make it to 100?  Bearer No, I never thought about it.  Finchum How did you celebrate?  Bearer My thoughts on making 100   I live my time out and I die when it   s  time. The date has already been set. (Laughter) I just don   t know what it  is.  Finchum How did you celebrate your birthday?  Bearer Annabeth can tell you more than I. That was the day     Finchum Oh you fell.  Bearer I had my fall and was incapacitated. Broke my back and didn   t know it,  but it hurt. The house, we had what? Sixty people here or something?  34  Robin Fifty-five or sixty people.  Bearer Crowded. Here I was the host, more or less. I knew better than   I like  to say that. Did I take a nap that day?  Robin Yeah. That was the whole reason to have it here was so you could go  nap when you wanted to.  Bearer My organizer daughter. How did we celebrate? Well you can see the  vestiges of it. That stuff (gestures to cards on table), and the stuff in the  den. Take a look at it if you want. It tells more of my life than I knew  existed. (Laughter)  Bishop We were told you have a very interesting first memory. I don   t think  we   ve captured that.  Robin Oh, yeah   Bishop What   s your earliest memory of your life?  Bearer Now I may be confused. It was probably the Armistice Day Parade,  1918.  Robin Yeah, that   s what you   ve always said was your earliest.  Bearer Okay. I remember we lived at a different house then. I remember Dad  hoisting me up on the windowsill, and I stood in the windowsill on the  front room, watched the parade go by. They were carrying the effigy of  Kaiser Wilhelm, and much later in life I woke up to the fact that he, too,  was a Catholic. I couldn   t put that together, but he had subordinates  who were really running the country and running the war, so I don   t  hold him responsible. I think he was powerless. That   s the structure of  those countries at that time. Although, American   s hated him. They  really did.  Anyway, the parade went down the street, Sixth Street, and the effigy  was in front. They took it out to the ballpark and had a great time  burning it up. I think that was my first memory. That had to be in  November or December, because Armistice Day is November the 11th.  My second early memory is probably two or three fold. Now  summertime, oh yeah, in summertime as the son of German folk, we  scrubbed the place down. We scrubbed the front porch, we scrubbed the  sign    Walk on the Side   , we scrubbed the steps down to the city  sidewalk. We scrubbed the city-owned sidewalk and probably we  35  would have scrubbed the street if we had thought it, but thank goodness  we didn   t, but we scrubbed that much. We made it spic and span. The  house shone like a diamond.  So one time I   m out there, pretty young kid, helping mother hose down  the walk and doing the scrubbing. Learning how to do the job  eventually. I spied out in the middle of the street   oh, this was the day  before we had much fuel-driven automobiles. Much horse-driven  carriages including the hucksters and so forth. They, of course, patrolled  on the street. Out there in the street I saw a wad of used chewing gum. I  said,    It   s going to go to waste     I dashed out there, got it, then popped  it in my mouth, and started chewing. Mother saw this event and she got  me and shook the living lights out of me.    How dare you chew  somebody else   s chewing gum. Take that stuff out of your mouth      That   s what I remember. I quickly spit it out. (Laughter)  About that same time I think I fell off a curb or off a front wall and hurt  myself and probably passed out a little bit. Now Mother was a different  mother. Now she was the Jewish mother. She came out and said,    Oh,  Louis  Say you   re not dead, wake up my darling  I love you so much,  don   t die in my hands     Then when I came to,    You nasty kid      (Laughter) Far as I know we don   t have much Jewish blood. I wish we  had more. Let   s see     Bishop You were just thinking waste not, want not.  Bearer That   s right. I   ve never picked up a piece of chewing gum since.  (Laughter) I learned my lesson  Did I answer that properly?  Bishop What I want to know is when history   s written, what would you like for  it to say about you? How do you want to be remembered?  Bearer I lived my life.  Finchum In a happy house.  Bearer Oh  In a happy house, yes. Thank you  (Laughter) Both where I was  born   I was born at home. In those days we didn   t    go to the hospital. I  had diphtheria at an early age and I was in a crib at an early age in  Mother and Dad   s room. I had   when you go out of your mind and  have visions?  All Hallucinations.  Bearer I had delirium  I don   t remember what I dreamed, but I had delirium. I  remember that so much. In fact, I guess I almost passed away. That   s  36  the last time I had diphtheria. Since then we   ve had antitoxins. I guess  everybody gets them now.  Dad had a revolver in that room.    A gun-carrying Catholic?    You bet.  On occasion, when we   d go off to one of the farms where his brothers  lived, he would take that pistol along and have some target practice in  the smokehouse. I never shot that pistol that I knew of. That was a huge  amount of fun, to hear that pistol go off if Dad was shooting at the  smokehouse, at a target he had hung on the wall. That brings back one  other memory.  When I was in ROTC at the University of Pittsburgh, we went to Fort  Monroe in Virginia for six weeks of camp, training. Some of the  training of course is marching, in close   I   ve forgotten the words we  used. Anyway, we were taught how to shoot guns, and so I don   t     remember that we ever shot a mortar. The mortars those days were this  big. (Gestures) I don   t think they   re used anymore. They shoot up high  and intended to clear all obstructions and land on the enemy. We did  shoot sixteen-inch rifles, cannon. I found myself   shall I go on?  Finchum Yes.  Bearer I found myself being assigned   because people thought I was so smart  I guess. What   d they call me? A chief   I   ll think of it in a minute.  Where my job was to help   not help, but supervise the guys who used a  ramrod to ram the powder, the shot in first, sixteen-inch diameter, and  then back it up with four or five bags of powder packed in tightly as  hard as you could ram it in. This was World War I munitions by the  way. We were still using those supplies. Oh, I was Chief of Breech, my  job then. But before they put the powder in I had to inspect the cannon  to be sure that there was no smoldering after a shot, after the previous  shot, that would ignite the powder. Because they swabbed it down also  with a dab of water. You can imagine what that inspection was like, a  quick look, egads. (Laughter)  Then as Chief of Breech I had to lock the thing, close the breech, and  then lock it. Then out of a pouch take a, much like a rifle shell, an  igniter about that long, and insert in the hole in the breech, because that  was to be the firing mechanism, attach the lanyard, and step back. When  all is ready, when the spotters gave the signal that they had the target in  sight, and the gun was properly pointed, they would give the command  to fire. I would yell   I would yank the thing and yell,    Fire     The gun  now was elevated. These were disappearing guns because the recoil  brought the gun back down to its hidden position at which time we  would open up the breech, swab it out, load it again, and get ready for  the next shot. The target was a raft being towed by a small vessel, I  37  guess maybe a mile apart. I never knew, but we often wondered if we  miscalculated, set the rifle wrong, what would happen to those guys.  (Laughs) I never knew, it never happened. But boy, oh boy, those were  the days,    Fire     Chief of Breech. Boy  Next?  Finchum I think we   re about done.  Bearer Okay.  Finchum I think you need a break.  Bearer There   s much more we haven   t covered. You   ll have to come back if  you   re interested. (Laughter)  Finchum I am. Thank you for sharing today.  Bearer You   re quite welcome.  Finchum You did great.  Robin They   ll do the second century  They   ll do a project for the second  century   Bearer Oh, yeah  (Laughs)  -------  -------
