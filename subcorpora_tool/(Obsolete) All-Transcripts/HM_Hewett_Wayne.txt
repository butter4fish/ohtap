Speaker 2: Easy, summer.
Speaker 1: Summer.  Okay your favorite vacation destination?

Speaker 2: If it's, if you said total relaxation, Malaysia.
Speaker 1: Malaysia, nice.  And lastly your favorite phrase?  Do you have one?  Or saying?
Speaker 2: I think that, I chuckle 'cause I have a lot of different sayings that people give me hell for.
Speaker 1: What are some of them?
Speaker 2: You know, tough but fair.
Speaker 1: Do you consider yourself tough but fair?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Is that something you learned from someone? A mentor maybe?
Speaker 2: No, I wouldn't say I learned that from a mentor I think it's--
Speaker 1: Father?
Speaker 2: --no 'cause I wouldn't call my dad [Audley Hewett] tough but fair.  A lot of things I'd call him but not tough but fair.  But I think it's just one of those things that I've seen other people and I've always felt that and jobs I have I think it's very important to be fair.  Let me say differently.  I've learned about fair from my parents.
Speaker 1: And you've learned about toughness (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Toughness from fundamentally seeing people operate in a business environment, so the combination of my parents and business.
Speaker 1: Tough but fair.  I bet people hate hearing that.
Speaker 2: Tough but fair, I love it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I love it.
Story_ID: 581450
Speaker 1: So let's talk about your mom.  What's your mom's full name?
Speaker 2: Lorna Shelly Hewett [Lorna James Hewett].
Speaker 1: And spell Lorna.  L-O--
Speaker 2: L-O-R-N-A.
Speaker 1: And middle name was?
Speaker 2: Shelly, S-H-E-L-L-E-Y [sic.].
Speaker 1: And then Hewett of course.  And her date of birth?
Speaker 2: I, I know the--I--the year is harder for me.  It's actually in there somewhere but it's March, March 4th and I forget what year.
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-two [1942].
Speaker 2: Yep 1942.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your mother was born in Jamaica then?
Speaker 2: Both my parents were born in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What can you tell me about your mother's childhood?  Stories she may have related to you about her having grown up in Jamaica?--
Speaker 2: Well I, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) during the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah well I think that you know the thing that was the most impactful to her was the fact that she grew up with her grandmother (cough) in Jamaica.  She is the last of--you know my mom that is, is the last of three siblings and her, her mom immigrated to New York City [New York, New York] to Brooklyn.  I forget exactly when but it had to be in the '50s [1950s] or so and my, my two uncles are my mom's two older brothers also immigrated to, to Brooklyn with my grandmother and my mom stayed behind and was raised by her, by her, her grandmother so therefore my great-grandmother, and it was we grew up thinking our great-grandmother was actually our grandmother because we rarely saw our grandmother since we grew up in Jamaica and you know she grew up in, she grew up in, sorry my grandmother grew up in, in Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: And your great-grandmother stayed behind to raise your mother?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we're gonna get--let's just get those names in.  So your grandmother's name was?
Speaker 2: Carmen Bowen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last name spelling of that?
Speaker 2: B-O-W-E-N.  Well it's Carmen--it was Carmen James and then she got remarried and it's now Carmen Bowen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was your grandmother, your mother's mother?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Now your great-grandmother, her name is?
Speaker 2: Oh, I wanna say Louise Alberga [ph.].
Speaker 1: And you have no idea of their dates of birth do you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I don't.
Story_ID: 581451
Speaker 1: Well let's talk about then your great-grandmother [Louise Alberga (ph.)] that actually raised your mother [Lorna James Hewett] in Jamaica.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: She was Jamaican as well?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: What can you remember of stories about her childhood?
Speaker 2: Her--
Speaker 1: Because she must have been born you know during the really tough days in Jamaica.
Speaker 2: Ah yeah and I think it depends on your definition of tough in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I think if you take a look at Jamaican--you know I probably say the tougher days in Jamaica were probably in the '70s [1970s] and, and, and forward continuing through 'til today because you know prior to the '70s [1970s] Jamaica was yeah it was part of the British Commonwealth [British Commonwealth of Nations] but to a large extent was considered a paradise you know and if we go and take a look at the '50s [1950s] and '40s [1940s] you know James Bond movies you know Ian Fleming and all that stuff being done down in Jamaica, you know Jamaica was clearly considered a--if you go back in the '60s [1960s] Jamaica was considered to be on the same trajectory as Singapore.  Now we all know where Singapore ended up and where Jamaica ended up but I think when you look at that timeframe, Jamaica was clearly considered an island paradise in almost every regard.
Speaker 1: What would she have done for a living, your great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I, I tell you that, I don't know as much about the details.  I you know there is when I think of my great-grandmother you know what I remember her as going to her house.  Yeah she was a much bigger lady.  You know she was very strict, very, very much of a disciplinarian.
Speaker 1: What things was she strict about?
Speaker 2: Stuff like respecting your elders.  Stuff like making sure you're home in time.  I remember a very, very strict curfews on my mom, very strict curfews and strict things around dating you know it's, it's but at the same time you know very, very loving, clearly wanted the best for her grandchildren.  You know would obviously try her best to, to make sure that we all did the right thing and we kind of learned but you know, she did a great job raising my mom, especially when you step back and you think through the age difference being a, you know, a grandmother raising somebody who is that far removed from you.
Speaker 1: So she let her daughter [Carmen Bowen] go off to pursue bigger dreams let's say to move to New York City [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah well really she followed--my grandmother followed her husband [Alfred James].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandmother [sic. great-grandmother] wasn't too fond 'cause she, you know, she thought that my grandmother was having too many kids (laughter).
Speaker 1: How many kids did she have?
Speaker 2: About three.
Speaker 1: Three.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And my daughter, I'm sorry my mom being the last of the three so, so she was like I'm gonna just keep a daughter here.  You wanna go follow your dreams, go chase after you know, you know your husband, fine and the boys can go up and they ended up joining the [U.S.] Army, the Army or Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] or whatever, but the [U.S.] Armed Forces.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about her house and what it looked like?
Speaker 2: Yeah what I remembered about it was, I remembered it being, being a stone house which is very, stone construction in terms of very similar to Jamaica but for me what I really remember was, was all the mango trees.  And climbing and, and picking mangos, and eating mangos and, and fortunately I never fell out of the trees but I remember spending a lot of time climbing those trees in the back and trying to get the perfect mango and, and doing that stuff with my brother [Kevin Hewett] and, and, and when I, when I look at that house, that's what I remember.
Story_ID: 581452
Speaker 1: So moving forward a bit talking about your mother [Lorna James Hewett]--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --then actually moved to New York City [New York, New York] when she was how old?
Speaker 2: My mother never moved to New York City.
Speaker 1: No.  I'm sorry your [maternal] grandmother [Carmen Bowen].
Speaker 2: Yeah. She moved to New York City (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She moved to New York City when she was how old?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know directionally had to be twenty-ish early twenties.
Speaker 1: And then so she started her life here?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is that the reason that other family members came over is because they saw her doing so well?
Speaker 2: Nah.
Speaker 1: Or why did other people decide to?
Speaker 2: Now, now we're moving way forward.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But.
Speaker 1: Well then we'll move forward and back.  Just in case.
Speaker 2: Okay.  If you go back to the--you know my dad was very, very popular in Jamaica, both from a business perspective as well as a sports perspective.  And in the '70s [1970s] through political changes and so forth, his view was that you are losing your freedom of speech in Jamaica and you weren't able to speak freely.  He was very, very concerned about the future, not just for him 'cause he was pretty much set.  You know my dad was in the position in Jamaica to retire when he was forty so again this wasn't for him.  This was really for, for, for, for, for, for his children and just felt like he wanted to be in a country where people could say what was on their minds.  He felt more confident about the future and that's why he left and went to Miami [Florida].
Speaker 1: So your father was--your father's date of birth and your father's full name?
Speaker 2: Okay it's Audley--
Speaker 1: Audley.
Speaker 2: --Maylor, M-A-Y-L-O-R, Hewett [Audley Hewett].
Speaker 1: And Audley is spelled?
Speaker 2: A-U-D-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And his date of birth? Do you--let's just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah it's November--
Speaker 1: Okay it's written here.
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: Thirty-seven [1937].
Story_ID: 581453
Speaker 1: So your father [Audley Hewett]--let's talk about his childhood--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --in Jamaica--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --and you say your father was pretty prosperous from different standpoints as an adult?  Did that happen during his childhood?  Did he--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) come from a family that was prosperous?
Speaker 2: No, no.  He didn't come from a family of wealth.  Neither of my parents came from a family of wealth.  They--my dad was very, very involved in, in sports as a kid, represented Jamaica in track and field.  As you know Jamaicans do very well in track and field, but represented Jamaica track and field.  It's funny because my dad and mom [Lorna James Hewett] actually met in Trinidad, (laughter) of all places because he was there representing Jamaica, the track and field meet and she was there--Jamaica has what they call a national dance theater and they call it Pantomime [National Pantomime].  And she was actually there as part of the Pantomime dance theater in Jamaica, sorry in Trinidad, and that's how they met.
Speaker 1: Was she a Pantomimer?  Was she in the company?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, she danced, yeah she, she was in the company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was a performer.  Mostly dancing and yeah so forth but that's how they met.  So he was very active in sports and then after he, after he graduated from high school--'cause none of my parents went to college.  I'm actually the first person in my family to go to college.  But then again in Jamaica, college wasn't a big deal per se.
Speaker 1: How did your mother though, I just was picking up on something--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you said how did she learn to dance?  Where did that come from?
Speaker 2: Oh she's always loved to sing, great voice, church, very, very prominent in church, Coke Methodist [Coke Methodist Church] to be precise, downtown Kingston [Jamaica], sang like crazy, very active in dancing.  It was funny 'cause I go to visit my grandmother [Carmen Bowen] over, over Christmas and my grandmother, I didn't know that but she even danced in Cuba, my grandmother that is so my guess is some of the genes from my grandmother passed down to my mom and but she always loved dancing as a kid and was very active in that and.
Speaker 1: So her and your father met in Trinidad?
Speaker 2: In Trinidad.
Speaker 1: At one of the performances of the--
Speaker 2: No, no it wasn't a performance.  It was like anything else you had two different Jamaican delegations and you know there was a party that was held where all the different Jamaican delegations that were there were invited and you know kind of one of those parties at night where okay--
Speaker 1: People let their hair down (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Cough) Exactly.
Story_ID: 581454
Speaker 1: Exactly. (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So what was your, what was your father's [Audley Hewett] first business venture?
Speaker 1: Insurance.
Speaker 2: Insurance?
Speaker 1: He was an insurance salesman, life insurance salesman and--
Speaker 2: Door to door, how did it work in Jamaica at the time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Door to door, door to door life insurance salesman and worked his way up the ladder.
Speaker 2: What do you remember as a boy about him doing that job?
Speaker 1: As a boy?
Speaker 2: As you being a little boy as a child?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What do you remember of your father during those days?
Speaker 1: Yeah well the thing that stuck out to me about my dad was he was obviously very, very busy and as you know when you are door to door salesperson you spend a lot of time on the road.  But every time there was an event that I thought was important, I looked around he was on the sideline or in the audience.  So he was obviously being a life insurance salesman he had more flexibility because he could set his appointments and so forth but what really struck me was the fact that he found the time to be there whenever I was doing anything that I thought that was important.  I grew up playing you know what we call football in America you call it soccer.  And every game I was at, I looked up he was there.  Now he may leave the game and go back to work, may not be there for dinner, but he was at the game.
Speaker 2: Do you know how he got into insurance?
Speaker 1: (Cough) Yeah, he's always been a very, very outgoing personality, lots of relationships, lots of friendships.  So my guess is you know he heard about it, somebody told him you know this is a great way, leverage your skillset you know but I don't know the exact story but I think it fits his personality very well.
Speaker 2: So as far as being an athlete, how far did he go as a competitive athlete?
Speaker 1: He did not make it to the Olympics, but he made it to the level below the Olympics.
Speaker 2: Which is?
Speaker 1: He did the Pan American Games.  I'm not sure if you're familiar with the Pan American Games, but did the Pan American Games, it was the level he did.  So he represented Jamaica nationally but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the Pan American Games?
Speaker 1: --in the Pan American Games.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So then he and your mother [Lorna James Hewett] met in Trinidad--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and married in the '70s [1970s] or no met in--
Speaker 1: No they would have met--
Speaker 2: They moved in the '70s [1970s].  They met--
Speaker 1: Well, they, they moved to I can tell the date December 13, 1977, the day we moved here.  But I was born in '64 [1964] and so they were married like '62 [1962] or '63 [1963].
Story_ID: 581455
Speaker 1: What are your earliest recollections of growing up in Jamaica?
Speaker 2: Earliest.  It would probably be very carefree.  I talked to you earlier about you know climbing up and down (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The mango trees.
Speaker 2: --trees and mango trees and (cough) it was--I was very active in sports as a kid.
Story_ID: 581456
Speaker 1: Because of your father [Audley Hewett] or just because you were athletic (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, well, I think, I think it's a combination of several things.  I think in Jamaica, athletes are--athletics are very important.  Athletics are extremely important in, in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: And they're important because?  Is it like some sign of manhood or is it just something to keep the kids out of trouble?  It's important because--
Speaker 2: Well, I think, I think, I think he grew up competing and there's a whole system that goes up in terms of competing and as kids you're kind of expected to, to do some form of, some form of sports, be it boy or girl.  You're expected to do something.  Obviously as you get older and older people start branching off but as a kid you're you know sports is a very, very important part of the culture.
Speaker 1: Of the culture.
Speaker 2: Of the culture.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you're expected to participate and you just kind of do and then you kind of pick you know the kind of sports that you, you, you pick from or cricket you know track and field, football slash soccer and those were kind of the big three, and a whole bunch of minor sports after that.  But you're kind of expected to--if you're Jamaican you--you know.
Story_ID: 581457
Speaker 1: Before you moved to the states--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --what was daily life like in Jamaica?  Your father's [Audley Hewett] on the road a lot (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep.
Speaker 1: --your mom [Lorna James Hewett] did what at home?
Speaker 2: She stayed at home, took care of the kids, took care of the family.
Speaker 1: And what does that entail in Jamaica?  I mean, are there huge cultural differences there than there were when you actually moved to the states as far as what the daily routine be?  Was it like sticking with Jamaica, the daily routine was?
Speaker 2: Oh the, the, the, the daily routine, it's, it's again because I left here when I was thirteen so for me it was--
Speaker 1: So you stayed there to I mean thirteen years is a pretty long time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but thirteen so for me my daily living, with the exception of the summers, revolves around school by definition.
Speaker 1: First grade?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the in Jamaica, the way its set up it's you really have two levels of schooling.  You have primary schooling and then you have secondary schooling.  So secondary school is the equivalent of junior high and high school put together is the kind of way the two schools are set up. But--
Speaker 1: And for how many years do you go for?
Speaker 2: It's fundamentally the same in total (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Same number? Okay.
Speaker 2: --but then again instead of elementary to junior high, high you think--
Speaker 1: You just have those two sections?
Speaker 2: --of primary and secondary as the best way to think of it.  And unlike America where your school that you go to is determined by where you live unless you go to a private school.  In Jamaica, it's not determined by where you live.
Speaker 1: It's determined by?
Speaker 2: It's determined, yeah at the primary level by where you get into and--
Speaker 1: And you get into school based on some standardized test or?
Speaker 2: Well the secondary level yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The secondary level yes.  At the primary level it's more based upon--
Speaker 1: Where your parents decide?
Speaker 2: --no and all that kind of stuff.  But once you end the primary section so the equivalent of fifth, sixth grade you have to take a nationalized standardized test and that test you select which they call it high school but again it's the equivalent of junior and high but you select and you say here's my first choice, here's my second choice, here's my third choice.  And literally the way it goes is the person who scores the highest--
Speaker 1: Gets first choice.
Speaker 2: --gets first choice and then you know at some point they run out.  Now if your first choice is full you get your second, if your third choice is full and there's still slots available you get to select--you know you get to go to a school but not one of your three choices and then at some point run out.  And if you don't make the cut, it's kind of tough luck.  So it's really standardized testing that determines where you are.  So you know the school I ended up with which was my first choice was literally on the other side of Kingston [Jamaica].
Speaker 1: How did you get there?
Speaker 2: Your parents had to take you or you know very rarely would I take a school bus or I'd take a public bus home but you know it had to be at least half hour to forty-five minute drive.
Speaker 1: What was that community like versus the community that you lived in?
Speaker 2: Very different.  You know there are you know uptown and down--and you know uptown and we would call the uptown schools downtown schools but I lived in a more uptown neighborhood and all the things around an uptown kind of environment and the school which I selected on my first choice was not an uptown school.  But my whole family had gone to that school and it was a family thing to do.  It's--we don't care what you can afford to do.  We don't care if this is you know the, the, the not the uptown school, the bottom line is you're a Hewett and you go to this school.  You know so very, very, very different in terms of everything. So that's--
Speaker 1: So there was a legacy involved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: --in you going to this particular--
Story_ID: 581458
Speaker 1: Let me ask you what periodicals were coming into the home at the time--
Speaker 2: Well there were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) for the family to read.
Speaker 2: Again you obviously have all the Jamaican newspapers.
Speaker 1: Which were, which--what were they?
Speaker 2: The daily Gleaner [The Gleaner] the daily Star [The Star] but fundamentally local Jamaican newspapers.  You had a lot of black American magazines, be it Ebony, be it Jet those kind of magazines that would show up.  You know that was probably it.  You know back then there in Jamaica at that time yeah TV was on maybe six hours a day, black and white growing up.  So you didn't spend a lot of time watching TV.
Speaker 1: You said that your father [Audley Hewett] was--he left in the '70s [1970s] because he felt that he, he, was his voice was being squashed.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: His political voice (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I did not say political voice--
Speaker 1: No? His voice, his voice.
Speaker 2: --but just his voice period.
Speaker 1: Okay what voice did he have prior to that in the community?  How did the community see your father?
Speaker 2: Well again, he was, he was--my dad was again very successful.  He started off as I mentioned insurance realtist to the number two position in this company from the very bottom.  Was the president of the Jamaican Amateur Athletic Association [Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association]--
Speaker 1: What was that?
Speaker 2: --which is, is, in simple terms, the Jamaica track and field.  He was the number one guy at the Jamaica track and field association, which when you think of the Olympics and you think of Jamaica, the first thing you think of is track and field, he was the head of that.  He was the president of the KC Old Boys Association [Kingston College Old Boys Association, Florida Chapter] and you say what KC is, KC is Kingston College [Kingston, Jamaica] is a high school that we went to and in Jamaica to put things in perspective, in America, most people don't really know where you went to high school because all your allegiance is around college.  In Jamaica because you don't have a college or the college system isn't as strong, all your allegiances are to your high school.  So the KC Old Boys Association would be the equivalent of being the president of the alumni association of Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana] or the alumni association of Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] or--
Speaker 1: So he was the president of--
Speaker 2: He was the head of the KC Old Boys Association, but think of like again high school being to Jamaica (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) College yeah. Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --what college is to, to, to, to, to, to America--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --so he was very, very involved in that.  You know he was asked to, when the government changed, he was asked by the prime minister to actually take on a position in the parliament in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: And who is the prime minister?
Speaker 2: At the time?
Speaker 1: At the time?
Speaker 2: Michael Manley.
Speaker 1: Michael Manley.
Speaker 2: So, so again he was very, very well connected.
Speaker 1: Did you understand that as a child?
Speaker 2: (Cough) Oh yeah because you obviously saw that he got some benefits.
Speaker 1: Okay what benefits did you get?
Speaker 2: Well for example, when you'd go to a big sporting event, you got the best seats (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You got boxed seats or whatever, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Exactly.  So you would see that.
Speaker 1: Did you feel--
Speaker 2: You get, you get preferred parking when you go into the National Stadium [Kingston, Jamaica].
Story_ID: 581459
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And being the Hewett kid, did you feel a sense of responsibility of having to live up to your father's, what he had done--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --as far as athletics?
Speaker 2: Well I wouldn't say that it was because of athletics.
Speaker 1: It was because of?
Speaker 2: of him.
Speaker 1: Of him.
Speaker 2: Because I grew up and I was never Wayne Hewett [HistoryMaker Wayne M. Hewett].  I was Audley's [Audley Hewett] son.  So it was very, very clear who I was.  I was, I was never Wayne, I was always Audley's son.  And there is Audley's son and because he like you said he, he was extremely successful don't care how want to cut it, he was successful.  He could walk into any bank in Jamaica--
Speaker 1: And get a loan?
Speaker 2: --and get a loan on his name only.
Speaker 1: How did that reputation follow you through first-ary school, what was it called?
Speaker 2: Primary school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Primary school.
Speaker 2: Oh again I, I, I went to a prep school--
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: It's Mona Prep [Mona Preparatory School, Kingston, Jamaica].
Speaker 1: Mona?
Speaker 2: Mona Prep, but then again you have to think of a prep school in Jamaica, not the same as a prep school in America so it's not like you know you go there and everybody is wearing sweaters and all that kind of stuff, no this is, this is Jamaica, so think of it as again by Jamaican standards a private school, but fundamentally it's what we called a prep school.  And again in school nobody really cares right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know but because of where he was in life, there were a lot of individuals that you went to school with who their dads were also very successful.
Story_ID: 581460
Speaker 1: You were going to talk about some of the other successful fathers of the children of the you know playmates or friends you have (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep, Yep.  Like, like for example a very good friend of mine, a guy name Daryl Vaz whose dad [Douglas Vaz] was, was fundamentally one of the top people in politics in the parliament.  Another friend Yen Powell [ph.], his dad was the Dutch ambassador to Jamaica.  You know there's another kid whose dad was one of the two best tennis players from Jamaica all time even played at Wimbledon [The Championships, Wimbledon, London, England], his dad--
Speaker 1: What was that kid's name?
Speaker 2: Lumsden.
Speaker 1: Lumsden.
Speaker 2: Lumsden.  But his dad I wanna say his dad was Lance Lumsden.  You know so again it was these are people that you know their dads you know were clearly prominent in, in different ways, some in business, some in politics, some in sports, so forth.
Speaker 1: So are you born into a class system in Jamaica or can you--?
Speaker 2: Yeah I would say that I would say that in Jamaica, yeah by definition you are born in a class system.  It is possible to move from one class to another class.  But it's very difficult you know to move from one class to another class.  It's, it's not easy.
Speaker 1: What would you say your father was born into versus where he ended up?
Speaker 2: I think, again this is by Jamaican standards.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: By Jamaican standards I would--it was definitely no better than middle class.
Speaker 1: His start?
Speaker 2: His start.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he definitely ended up in the upper class.
Speaker 1: And being a part of the upper class what entitlement comes with that? In Jamaica? Those standards (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well yeah, yeah like anything else it's really no different in here in America its context, its network.  You know like I said earlier he walks into a bank and get a loan just because his name is Audley Hewett.  You know he makes a phone call and he says, "Hey I want this to happen" or "Can you help me out with this" and things happen.  You know that's just really access and networks is what I think that upper class entitlements are but that's no different anywhere in the world (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In anywhere, yeah.
Story_ID: 581461
Speaker 1: So when you started primary school [Mona Preparatory School, Kingston, Jamaica], were there any teachers that you can think of that stood out for you that helped to make you become who you are today?  With small lessons that have stuck with you for that you know that number of years?
Speaker 2: It's funny I think in primary school I had crushes on the teachers (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Who are the teachers you had crushes on?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Scott [ph.] (laughter). Actually Miss, Miss Scott I should say.  Miss Scott but I--but in terms of, in terms of you know teachers that stuck out you know it's probably, it's probably not in primary school but actually when I finished my high school [Miami Palmetto Senior High School, Miami, Florida] here in America and there are clearly one or two teachers in high school here that I was still amazed by in terms of what they were able to accomplish that have always stuck with me.  You know I had an English teacher--
Speaker 1: And this is here or there?
Speaker 2: This is actually here.
Speaker 1: Okay, but before we get to here?
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: There, were there any?
Speaker 2: There like I said when I look at the teachers I had, I learned a lot.
Speaker 1: But did you have anyone, any I mean because your father was so great--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was there any room for anyone to be a mentor?
Speaker 2: That's my main point my dad was my mentor.
Speaker 1: Yeah your dad was your mentor.
Speaker 2: My, my, my, my like I said I was Audley's [Audley Hewett] son and it was funny because it's, it's you know initially you take it for granted 'cause you're just used to that.  And then over time you evolve to well can I ever top this you know, to--I evolve to I wanna top this.  And I wanna break away from being Audley's son and I--
Speaker 1: And how old were you when that came about for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, I remember going, going, going, going to school in California.  You know I started Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] at sixteen years old.  Like I said earlier I was the first person in college.  I was living in Miami [Florida] 'cause when we left Jamaica we went to Miami.  So I went as far away.  I never been past Texas.  And I showed up in California day one to start school, this sixteen year old.  And I think part of my motivation was I wanted to get as far away as possible from my dad.  Not because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because?
Speaker 2: --not because of any negative--
Speaker 1: Of anything bad, yeah. Just the--
Speaker 2: --with my dad but, but I, I, it was important to me to say can I stand on my own two feet?  And if I'd, if I'd stayed and most of my friends I get--I finished high school with in America, they went to school in Florida, be it University of Miami [Coral Gables, Florida] or University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] were the primary two schools but I knew if I'd stayed in Florida, I would never escape my dad's shadow.
Story_ID: 581462
Speaker 1: Two things I wanna ask you about Jamaica--
Speaker 2: Yep (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) bef- and then we're gonna talk about moving to the states.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And one of them is--were the holidays.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Is Christmas as celebrated in Jamaica as was--
Speaker 2: Yep, well Jamaica, Jamaica is a very Christian country.
Speaker 1: Christian.  Okay.  So you went to a Christian church?
Speaker 2: I went to Methodist, Coke Methodist [Coke Methodist Church, Kingston, Jamaica].
Speaker 1: Coke Methodist.  And how often?  Was it a religious family or?
Speaker 2: Well my mom [Lorna James Hewett] was very religious, extremely religious.  My dad [Audley Hewett] I would argue differently.  His view was that religion is private.  So does he believe in all this stuff you know God and so forth, the answer is yes.  But his view was that going to church to prove that I'm religious, religion is between me and my, my, my own maker.  Yeah and so we went to and he was Roman Catholic by upbringing.  We clearly went to Methodist.  My mom was always there like I said singing in the choir all that stuff.  She forced us to come along.  Matter of fact at a very early age, this is in Jamaica, at one stage I seriously contemplated a life of the ministry.  You know for a couple of years if you had asked me what was I gonna do when I grew up, I was gonna be a minister.  But that was in around ten or eleven years old something like that.  But anyway my dad on the other hand you know he would go along whenever my mom give him no choice but for the most part he would say you know this is between me and the maker and you know the thing which, which really bothered him is my dad hates hypocrites, hates hypocrites and he saw too many people that were great in church from nine to ten or nine to twelve [o'clock] or whatever on a Sunday morning and then you see how they live their life during the week and his view was I, I, I totally--
Speaker 1: Hypocritical yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) dis- I just totally disagree with you live your life good for a couple of hours and therefore you're okay.  His view was you live your life every single day as good.
Story_ID: 581463
Speaker 1: So do you remember the family's decision to move to New York [New York]?  Was it traumatic for you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, we went to Miami [Florida].
Speaker 1: So you in '77 [1977] you moved to Miami?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Was that traumatic for you?
Speaker 2: Well again when I said traumatic, it was--
Speaker 1: Did you wanna come?
Speaker 2: --I had no choice.
Speaker 1: You had no choice?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had no choice.  It was--I was thirteen, I'm the eldest of my family, you know they didn't come and say, "Hey Wayne [HistoryMaker Wayne M. Hewett], what'll you think about moving to--?"
Speaker 1: Right, right.  There you had no choice but I'm saying did you have an opinion about whether or not you wanted to?
Speaker 2: Again, I would, again you're thirteen, you're in Jamaica being so close to America, even though we weren't part of the American commonwealth, or the American system or part of the British Commonwealth [British Commonwealth of Nations], there are a lot of ties to America and a lot of American influences, so it sounded to me like an adventure but I remember the day 'cause my parents never consulted with us.  We were in our front lawn playing and all of a sudden a truck showed up you know to move our stuff.  I was like what's this truck doing?  And you went in and talked to your parents and they're like, "We're moving to America.  And we're leaving in--," I don't know it was a week or two weeks but, "we're leaving" and you know you're like, "Okay." You know, "Fine."  Yeah but like hey we'd gone to America many times and my mom [Lorna James Hewett] loves Disney World [Walt Disney World Resort, Orlando, Florida] you know.  So it wasn't like we were moving to a foreign country, even though technically we were moving to a foreign country because in many regards we'd been to Miami so often that that part initially wasn't a--it wasn't like an oh, my god, I'm nervous. Now--
Speaker 1: What were the biggest cultural differences you notice upon arriving in America?
Speaker 2: Well I think when I arrived it became very, very clear because we went from living in a very you know by Jamaican standards well off home, as I said earlier upper class, to we went to living in an apartment complex right off of the mall and my dad [Audley Hewett] was driving a Mercedes-Benz, we're not driving a Plymouth Duster.  So you know we went from the upper class to you know I don't know lower class overnight.  You know we went from have to have not overnight.  I grew up as a majority because in Jamaica, the majority of the people look like me and overnight I'm not a minority.
Speaker 1: How did that feel?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was different.  You know 'cause you, you're struggling you don't know again when you grow up as a minority from day one you just kind of move into it you know because it's just kind of what it is.  When you just kind of come into it from the outside, you're like you don't know what to make of it.  And, and, and at that time you're kind of isolated (cough) from everybody.
Speaker 1: Yeah because you don't fit in anywhere.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Because I, I used to always say you know the, the, the you know the white Americans would look at me and they would assume I'm black American 'cause I look like a black American.  And then initially you know a black American will look at me and I open my mouth up and immediately know I wasn't black American.  So they just--it was like you become an island and, and the only thing you can--the only person you can latch onto is--
Speaker 1: Other islanders.
Speaker 2: --other islanders.
Speaker 1: Were there other islanders?
Speaker 2: A few.  A good thing about Miami [Florida], is Miami is a very, very large West Indian population, a very large Jamaican population so yeah what kind of happened, I tell folks is I went to high school [Miami Palmetto Senior High School, Miami, Florida] and I existed with Americans.  I existed with Americans in high school however as soon as I--I couldn't wait to get home.  'Cause for me school was just about school.  I'd get back home and I'd go back into my Jamaican lifestyle.  I'd have Jamaican food.  I would you know do my all my Jamaican stuff you know.  My parents had friends so I hung out with you know the, the kids of their friends who were all Jamaican, you know my weekends were very Jamaican lifestyle.  I did only Jamaican parties.  You know I never went to--I not went to I was never invited--I was never invited to a white American party.  I was never invited to a black American party for my whole high school years.  So it wasn't like I said no to anything, I just wasn't included.  Because like you said you're kind of this island in between.
Story_ID: 581464
Speaker 1: How does that force you to look at--like how does that force you to identify with race then? Because you know, you know what I mean race, you look black--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --and you're gonna de discriminated against as black but you know you don't feel American black.
Speaker 2: Yep.  Well again I think it depends on where you are.
Speaker 1: And in Miami [Florida] it's very easy?
Speaker 2: No, no, I think in terms of where you are in terms of my progression.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where were you then in terms (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Back then you're having this very, very hard time dealing with it you know because you're on the outside, don't care where you are you know.  Because your thought process back then is everything I've learned for thirteen years has been a majority thinking.  'Cause that's all I did for thirteen years.  I was a majority.  So every thought process I've ever had for thirteen years aligned with majority.  Yet the majority doesn't wanna treat you that way, right?  And then you go the other side and you say well I wanna be black or quote, unquote black American and you open your mouth up and you don't fit.  So you, you, you just struggle is what you do.  You, you, you, you're just, what you start doing you just shut, shut off and you start focusing on your schoolwork and you focus on, on the sports and activities that you're in and you can't wait to go home.  And you know you exist during school.  Like I said you just want to get home because when you walk through your home at night, it was like I'm back in the place that I'm understood and my evenings were great and my weekends were great.  So I never, I never had a negative problem on the weekend.  Well you go to a store and someone looks at you weird or whatever, but you know.  And by the way and during that timeframe you're spending all your time thinking about I just can't wait to move back to Jamaica permanently.
Speaker 1: Is that what you were thinking?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  'Cause again that's what you start to thinking because that's where home is.  Now if I fast forward to where I am today, 'cause I think you evolve through all that, at the end of the day I'm black (laughter).
Speaker 1: No matter where you are in the world?
Speaker 2: No matter where I am in the world.  I, I, I am black and I'm just as much a part of the black experience as somebody who you know spent the last two hundred years in America or spent the last two hundred years in Africa or you know like my family did spent it in Jamaica.  And then only over the course of the last twenty or thirty years I spent it in America, but the bottom line is I'm black and I'm very, very comfortable with that and I don't spend any time on West Indian versus African American versus Jamaican versus any of that stuff.  At the end of the day I am what I am.
Speaker 1: But that comes--
Speaker 2: With experience (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) with a lot of experience and enlightenment.
Speaker 2: --and over time and that's, that's why I said to you when you asked the question, I think it depends upon where you are in terms of your own thought process, but you know I was, I was I know I'm fast forwarding but we gonna back to it--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but on this whole discussion of me making the adjustment.
Story_ID: 581465
Speaker 1: High school I existed. Couldn't wait to get home, got into my Jamaican lifestyle.  I made the choice to go as far away as possible to college because I wanted to escape my dad [Audley Hewett].
Speaker 2: Well if no one else had gone to college before you, how did you set your sights so high to say I'm gonna go to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and I'm gonna major in engineering.  Like who helped develop that in you?  Where did that come from?
Speaker 1: Well, my, my dad, again my dad was very successful.
Speaker 2: Okay.  He just hadn't gone to school?
Speaker 1: He just hadn't gone to college.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So you know, we came from again well my dad retired at forty.  And when I said it was (unclear) retire at forty and then we moved to Jamaica and start all over again.
Speaker 2: You mean you moved to Miami [Florida].
Speaker 1: Sorry, moved to Miami, had to start all over again you know so you know coming from a family of, of high achieving so it was never, there was never a thought process of you're not going to college.
Speaker 2: Right, but where did that come from?  Because that must have been new versus what he had experienced in Jamaica?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what happened is because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Like when you get to America and you say education is the way for you to get to where I got to just working hard in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Well again, let me just go back to Jamaica.  You will recall my dad was the head of the Jamaican Amateur Athletic Association [Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association].  And as part of that (cough) process because he had track and field well, well as you know what do a lot of American universities where they want to recruit track and field athletes from?
Speaker 2: Right, gotcha.
Speaker 1: They come to Jamaica.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So my dad had--and by the way he wasn't the only one, but when people would come to Jamaica looking for Jamaican athletic talent, one of the people they would contact was him.  So he had track and field relationships at over twenty different universities in America and because my dad had been so good to all of these different track and field you know coaches, over ten maybe closer to fifteen or twenty had told him that you've done such a great job of giving us talent that if your kid wants to come to our university, we'll find a way to get him into the university.  Now we may have to give him a track and field manager scholarship if the money's an issue but the bottom line is if your kid wants to come to our college, don't worry.  So there was never a debate around--I did not do track and field, so I wasn't an athlete at all.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Because track and field wasn't my thing.  I loved to watch it but in terms of physical competing wasn't my thing.  So anyway track and field--sorry the university was not a--it, it wasn't a debate.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you've always known you had someplace to go.
Speaker 1: And, and I didn't lose a lot of sleep over like will I get into a university.  Your interest in coming out of high school--my soccer coach at the time who you would--I was a very good soccer player. To put in perspective, I was the MVP of my soccer team in, in senior year [at Miami Palmetto Senior High School, Miami, Florida] and I made all first team South Florida and I had several scholarship offers to go play soccer.  So I was a pretty good player and the, the soccer coach who obviously knew me well because I was on his team, was also the high school guidance counselor.  So I knew that I was gonna go to university, I had no clue what the process was because my dad didn't know that so forth.  I knew that I didn't necessarily wanna just rely on my dad's contacts because of what I said earlier.  So I remember going to my guidance counselor and saying, "I'm just curious, where do you think I should apply?"  And this was a, a Cuban individual and he looked at me and he said, "I think given what I know about you Wayne [HistoryMaker Wayne M. Hewett], that the best thing for you is to apply to a junior college, one of the local junior colleges in Miami."  That was the advice I got from somebody.  Now, I obviously ignored it and there were a couple of those coaches actually there's one coach in particular who at that time was a Texas, University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], who I was a big fan of because he had become very close friends, family friends of the family and always put me--he wanted me to come to Jamaica, would always put me under his wing and all that kind of stuff and (cough) so I was dead set on going to Texas until I got into Stanford.
Story_ID: 581466
Speaker 1: Engineering quite honestly wasn't because of anything particular except for the fact I loved math.  I had no clue what an engineer really did plus--
Speaker 2: Well what about--I mean you chose industrial let's say over (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well I didn't start off there.
Speaker 2: --architectural or you know.
Speaker 1: I started off as an electrical engineer and because my mom [Lorna James Hewett] convinced me electrical engineers get paid a lot more and there's always a need for electrical engineer because when I started school I had no clue what industrial engineering was.  Didn't know it even existed.  And then as I said earlier, I was never the individual as a kid that would tear things apart to figure them out.  My brother [Kevin Hewett] on the other hand would do that.  He's a more natural engineer than I am.
Speaker 2: Is he an engineer today?
Speaker 1: No, he is not.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Funny those things work out but. So anyway I did electrical engineering because I love math.  I figured my mom convinced me that it'd be great.
Speaker 2: The money would be good.
Speaker 1: Would be good and I'd always have a job.  Took two physics courses and said why am I doing this because I really don't enjoy this?  But because I love solving problems and industrial engineering was engineering but not as technical as electrical engineer and once I learned about it, this is me.
Speaker 2: Okay now explain industrial to me versus the structural which I know, electrical I know.  Industrial is?
Speaker 1: Think of industrial as optimization.
Speaker 2: And that's, and that's where you fit in.
Speaker 1: That's where I fit in.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So it fit me perfectly.  So anyway that's, that's what I ended up doing was industrial engineering.
Story_ID: 581467
Speaker 1: So you arrived in Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] as a very, very young man.
Speaker 2: Sixteen years old.
Speaker 1: And away from home, away from your parents [Lorna James Hewett and Audley Hewett] at sixteen (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As far as possible as I could possibly be.
Speaker 1: How did you do it?  I mean what did you learn, who taught you?  Who were your friends?
Speaker 2: Well again the, the, the, the going back to what I said earlier when I was in high school [Miami Palmetto Senior High School, Miami, Florida] I spent all of my time outside of school and just Jamaican lifestyle.  I spent my first year trying to find the Jamaicans.  And then after I couldn't find the Jamaicans--
Speaker 1: There were no Jamaicans?
Speaker 2: --I tried to find the West Indians.  And you started off with Stanford and then I was literally every other weekend going to places like Berkeley [California], Oakland [California] as a sixteen, seventeen year old not because I wanted to go but because I was in this massive search, I was on this quest everywhere I've ever lived has been this large Jamaican, West Indian population, I have to go find them.
Speaker 1: And what would you say is like the biggest cultural difference between being like now you know--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --that you're you're black no matter where you go--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but then what is it you were searching for that you realized it's you and wherever you are.
Speaker 2: Well again, again when I say biggest difference, I think it's an understanding you know.  It's, it's--you don't have to recreate anything.  You don't have to explain anything you know.  It's, it's you fit.
Speaker 1: So you spent all those weekends searching Berkeley--
Speaker 2: Just trying to fit (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Oakland looking for a place you can fit in?
Speaker 2: And, and again it just doesn't fit you know.  It's hey I tell folks it's like you know reggae music you know; I get it you know, that's what I grew up with.  It's, it's I still love it to this day.  But you know hey stupid stuff.
Story_ID: 581468
Speaker 1: What about dating (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I grew up, I grew up, I grew up with dominos.  You know you sit around in Jamaica and you sit around a big social part of it is dominos.
Speaker 1: Dominos.  Which is, I'm from the South and dominos are big in Mississippi as well.
Speaker 2: Okay but most black Americans it's not dominos, what is it bid whist, a card game?
Speaker 1: A card game yes.
Speaker 2: Card games.
Speaker 1: But dominos are huge in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that's what you sit down and you do and that's what you play.  That's how you relax and you know you grow up with soccer, football.  Most black Americans that's American football.  That's basketball, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's you know I, I, I remember my first year in--again this is, these are stupid things.  I remember my first gym class.  I remember playing baseball.  In Jamaica you play cricket, you don't use a glove.  And they're like you need a glove in the field.  I'm like this is in junior high this was like what are you talking about.  And they're like you can't be on the baseball field without a glove.  And I'm like, I'd never been on the cricket field with a glove.  And they looked at me like I was nuts and I remember I was standing for some reason at, at, at between second baseman position or whatever without a glove 'cause they gave me a glove I threw the glove behind me.  And they're all looking at me nuts and it just so happened the guy hit the ball to me, I caught my bare hand and I threw it to first base and the guy was out.  And they all looked at me like, is this guy, we love the fact he did this thing, we would never think about catching the ball with our bare hands.  And all of a sudden I went from this--I was still an alien, but now I went from a bad alien to a good alien.
Speaker 1: To a good alien. Like--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but then I went into the shower in Jamaica you don't take public showers.  So after gym class in America, you go take a public shower.  You're like why are we as guys all be naked together and you just don't do this.  You, you, this nudity is a very private thing in Jamaica.  You just don't do public showers.  You know and then you're sitting there and they're looking at you like, "Haven't you done this a zillion times?" like, "No.  I, I and I'm very uncomfortable doing this."  You know so again there's no one specific thing you can go point to but I was looking for a fit where people just, yep that's normal behavior or that's not normal behavior.
Story_ID: 581469
Speaker 1: But it's kind of funny because my evolution was I, I, I--so anyway my first nine months in college, I'm trying to find the Jamaicans, the West Indians, I couldn't find it.  And I finally said, well Wayne [HistoryMaker Wayne M. Hewett], this is stupid, you're in college, you've proven they don't exist, open up.  And now all of a sudden I stopped looking for that and said let's enjoy the people that are here with you.  And I started developing relationships with everybody.  Be it white American, black American--
Speaker 2: But there are more white Americans than anyone else at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but again you pick your groups--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you know so you become members.  I was also very, very active in the Stanford African Students' Association even though it was funny because that was primarily a graduate student association and I was undergrad at the time but because when I followed the Africans, the Africans were like me.  They were looking for the Africans.  Now it just so happen I was West Indian, you know so I ended up spending time with them so I ended up playing types to all these different groups.  'Cause okay I couldn't get my Jamaican stuff, so I go hang out with my African buddies who are graduate students to get my Jamaican, my quote, unquote, my Caribbean thing you know I need to go develop relationships with, with, with the blacks being black American so I did that.  I got to go develop relationships with people who are not black and I did that.  And what was funny was about my second year in to school, when I started hanging out now with my Jamaican buddies from high school [Miami Palmetto Senior High School, Miami, Florida], I could see a big difference because I made the jump and they didn't because you know they went to the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida], University of Miami [Coral Gables, Florida] where there is a very, very large Jamaican, West Indian community and they just stayed in those communities and then never had to branch out.
Story_ID: 581470
Speaker 1: So we're going to pick up, you went home and you said you saw a big leap that you had made--
Speaker 2: Yep
Speaker 1: --that they had not made.
Speaker 2: Yep (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That leap being?
Speaker 2: Again I, I, I, I could actually interact with people from all walks and they had a very, very hard time you know.  It was--they could interact very well within the Jamaican community.
Speaker 1: How did your father [Audley Hewett] adjust to being here?  I mean you seem to have been doing relatively well--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you were off at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California]--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --making necessary adjustments, what was happening with your family in Miami [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Well yeah they started over.  My mom [Lorna James Hewett] had to go back to work.
Speaker 1: So your mother did go back to work?
Speaker 2: She had to go back to work, worked in operating room as a nurse 'cause she's a nurse by training.  You know my dad you know supposed to be the number two guy was out there selling, selling back selling policies again.  Starting off going back to the salesperson and quite honestly I had to give both my parents credit 'cause you know at that age and they're probably in their early forties now, you know to really start all over again from the bottom especially when you've been living an upper class lifestyle, very, very difficult, very difficult.  And to, to, to, to do that and the only reason why you do that is for the future of your kids.
Story_ID: 581471
Speaker 1: Well you have siblings.  How--what were their--give me their names and then the birth order of the group (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well secondly--I'm the eldest.  The next one is Kevin.  Kevin Hewett, he was born in '66 [1966] and then Natasha Hewett born in '70, 1970.
Speaker 1: And what did Kevin end up doing?
Speaker 2: Well later on my parents [Lorna James Hewett and Audley Hewett] ended up starting up, starting, starting their own company, a home healthcare company.  So he now works in the business.
Speaker 1: In the family business?
Speaker 2: In the family business.
Speaker 1: And your sister?
Speaker 2: My sister she is pharmaceutical sales.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: She's a pharmaceutical rep.  Okay.
Story_ID: 581472
Speaker 1: So back to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California].
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: You join the African Association?
Speaker 2: Stanford African Students--African Students Association [Stanford African Students' Association]. SASA.
Speaker 1: What other organizations do you join?
Speaker 2: I was very involved in--I was actually a reggae deejay, a reggae disc jockey at KZSU [KZSU Radio, Stanford, California].
Speaker 1: Did you bring us any pictures today?
Speaker 2: Oh, we'll talk about it later.  I, I, I didn't know we were supposed to have pictures until yesterday.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause I'd like to see some of those reggae deejay pictures.
Speaker 2: I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I literally didn't know we supposed to pictures until yesterday but any way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were a reggae deejay?
Speaker 2: I was a reggae disc jockey for three years.
Speaker 1: On campus?
Speaker 2: On the campus stadium, campus, campus station.
Speaker 1: So you were on air?
Speaker 2: I was on air--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --every week for three years.  My nickname was the, Da Duke.
Speaker 1: Da Duke.
Speaker 2: Da Duke, the man from York.
Story_ID: 581473
Speaker 1: Now is it possible for you today to speak with a Jamaican accent?
Speaker 2: It's very, when I say difficult, it's--if I went to Jamaica tomorrow and I was there for two weeks--
Speaker 1: Maybe?
Speaker 2: --when I come back you would hear a much more distinctive Jamaican accent.
Speaker 1: How did you lose it?
Speaker 2: It was beat out of me.  It was--I never forget in junior high, my first year in this country, I was giving oral report and I got up there and I gave my report and the teacher said, "Thank you very, very much but you get an F."  The next person got up and did exactly the same book and said exactly what, almost exactly what I said and the teacher said, "Very, very good, you get an A."  And one of my classmates put her hands up and said, "Teacher we don't understand.  Wayne [HistoryMaker Wayne M. Hewett] said almost exactly the same as this person. Wayne got an F and this person got an A."  And the teacher said, "That's because I didn't understand a word Wayne said."  So and then when I first joined GE [General Electric], I had a job on GE's corporate audit staff where every six weeks you, you actually received a formal review and for the first three years of that, every six weeks I got feedback saying my diction's incorrect, I speak too fast fundamentally part of my accent.  So when you get feedback every six weeks like a hammer, you kind of figure out a way that you gotta get rid of it.
Speaker 1: Well how did you do it phonetically?  Did you take speech classes?  Did you listen to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no it was just a lot of practice and repetition and speaking slower and slower and slower and slower and you know--
Speaker 1: But it does sound I mean it sounds bad that we can't exist in a society with an accent that's not of this society in which we live.
Speaker 2: Oh I agree.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: I, I, I completely agree but like as they always say when in Rome, do as the Romans do.  So (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do as the Romans--so is that true today?
Speaker 2: I, I, I think that it's less true today than it was.  But--
Speaker 1: Because no one would have the balls to tell anyone today, "Oh you've gotta get rid of your accent."
Speaker 2: But, but no one says it that way.  They, they, they never say it that way.  You know they say it like, "You got to, you're not clear.  You know people don't understand you and you know you have to speak more slowly."  And nobody ever comes up and says, "Get rid of your accent."  No one ever say that, never did that back then.  But you know what--
Speaker 1: It helped you.
Speaker 2: --it helped and, and, and when I went to Asia, it was funny because I learned in, in Jamaicans speak very fast obviously with their accents and so forth.  I had to slow myself down to be understood in America from a business point of view but what I was always considering my slow down speed, when I went to Japan and China and living in Asia, that slow down speed was still way too fast.  So I had to slow down again to be understood in Asia.  Again nobody was talking to me about losing my you know my American accent or Jamaican accent or Jamerican accent whatever--
Speaker 1: Jamerican.
Speaker 2: --you wanna call it.  What they were all talking about was--
Speaker 1: Diction?
Speaker 2: --we don't understand you.  And you know when you talk to a Japanese or a Chinese and English is not their first language, you have to remember Wayne that everything you say, they're mentally hearing English translating to Japanese to make sure they understand.  So if you're speaking your normal speed by definition, they at best hear half of what you said, at best.  Now when someone explain it to you that way, it's very logical, right?  I don't know how many languages you know but you know I know a little bit of Spanish but when someone speaks to me in Spanish I convert it to English so I can understand exactly what's said because I don't think in Spanish.
Speaker 1: Right.  But it's funny because I greeted you in Spanish today.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I don't know why.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But, but I'm not a natural Spanish speaker so--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --again I look at these things and I always say that, that you know experiences you gain, you never know how they're gonna help you in the future and learning how to speak slowly to make me more effective in American business environment dramatically helped me when I moved to Asia because the concept of slowing down, not an issue.  But you know also learning to adjust from a Jamaican culture to an American culture, you know all of the searching and all the things I had to do that you could argue took me too long to do, but that whole process of doing that when I moved to Asia it was so much easier for me to make the adjustment culturally because I had already gone through a massive cultural adjustment to fundamentally exist in America.  Like going through a cultural adjustment to exist in China or Japan was like hey, I've done his before (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nothing.
Story_ID: 581474
Speaker 1: So you deejayed for a couple night--days a week (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Three. Well, it was one to two days for three years.
Speaker 1: And what type of a student were you at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California]?
Speaker 2: I was a 3.2, 3.3 GPA [grade point average] so.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your professors?
Speaker 2: Some of my professors?  I remember a guy named Holi [ph.] from China who was one of my professors.  (Cough)  There was a Pate-Cornell [Elisabeth Pate-Cornell], a French lady who was also very interesting professor.  Yeah, I had--it's funny in terms of father figures, it was actually the guy who was the track and field coach, kind of funny how these things kind of circle.  I chose Stanford to try to get as far away from my dad as possible and so we get to California not knowing anyone.  My dad's looking through faculty and sure enough the track and field coach--
Speaker 1: He knows (laughter).
Speaker 2: --he knows, guy named Brooks Johnson.  And he hadn't seen Brooks in god knows how many years.  Brooks last time they'd seen each other Brooks was coaching on the East Coast was now over at Stanford and sure enough we call him up and Brooks was like, "You mean your son's here?"  Like, "Yeah."  "Okay don't worry Audley [Audley Hewett], I'll take care of your son." (Laughter) You know so I was a track and field manager for a year or two but he obviously wasn't the same as a father figure but clearly somebody kind of help me make the transition when I was there even though I quote, unquote, wasn't being taught by him.  As well--
Speaker 1: He made it easy for you?
Speaker 2: --he made it relatively easy for me.
Speaker 1: Were there any professors that helped guide you or any to--I mean you discover industrial engineering on your own or through the help with someone else (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I'd say, I'd say, I'd say it was fundamentally on my own you know.  I would say the, the, the, the, the people that helped guide me were less about teachers and more about some graduate students.  Like for example this one guy Brian Westcott who was studying for his Ph.D., he's the first guy who ever told me about GE [General Electric].
Speaker 1: What did he tell you?
Speaker 2: Well he worked at GE before when he went and got his Ph.D., actually worked in Schenectady, New York.  And so I lived in Schenectady, New York which is one of the birthplaces if you will at GE and shared with me a lot of GE stories before I even considered working for GE, but because he'd worked in the business area, gave me a lot of business advice and okay think about things a little bit differently.  And here's a business perspective to compliment the practical perspective.  So I think from a guidance perspective, I would say more graduate students kind of helped me more than I would say any one professor that would say yeah that professor really got me on the right path.
Story_ID: 581475
Speaker 1: So before you graduated from Stanford University [Stanford, California], you had this series of jobs. Where you recruited to go into some sort of training, management training program through GE [General Electric] before graduation?
Speaker 2: No it's funny because I--GE does not or did not recruit very heavily at Stanford back then because it's a West Coast school and GE doesn't have--did not have a lot of strong presence on the West Coast from a standpoint of location.  So.
Speaker 1: Did they have a reputation for recruiting minorities?
Speaker 2: GE again at Stanford didn't recruit period.  It was just not one of their schools.  GE was very heavily on the East Coast and the Midwest 'cause that's where the locations are.  So I actually did my research about GE and came to the conclusion through my own research that GE had one of the best training programs in, in, in America and I sent them a cold cover letter to the standard you know send your application in here and sure enough a month later I get this standard rejection letter saying, thank you very much, we have nothing that fits your interests.  If we do, we'll keep you on file for a year.  And I was dating my wife [Simonne McDonald Hewett] at the time, my wife to be at the time, and she was living in Miami [Florida], so I had lots of friends at University of Miami [Coral Gables, Florida], University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] so on one of my trips back I actually went and I said I'd like to see who's recruiting you know at these different colleges and there was a GE guy and there was a name and I wrote same cover letter, same resume, only difference was I had a name.  I sent it in to this guy and I said I really want to come work for GE.  Here is why I wanna come work for GE, same letter.  A week later, call says, "We'd love to interview you."  So I wasn't really recruited at all by GE.
Story_ID: 581476
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now how did you meet your wife [Simonne McDonald Hewett] because she--you're in California and she's in Miami [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yeah one of the things about Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], Stanford starts school later because they're on the quarter system as opposed to the semester system.  So I would typically start--Stanford would typically start about a month after the schools in Miami and Florida would start so that first month of school when they were in school and I wasn't in school, I would hang out with my buddies at University of Miami [Coral Gables, Florida] or University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] and so forth and I was hanging out at University of Miami and she was--I think she was a year after me 'cause right after my freshmen year so she was starting her freshmen year and I had not started my sophomore year yet but that's how we met through friends.
Speaker 1: So just through mutual friends?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And that was in 19--
Speaker 2: Oh I can tell you exactly it been the summer of '82 [1982] (cough).
Speaker 1: And then you married in eighty--
Speaker 2: Seven [1987].
Speaker 1: Seven [1987]. Okay so almost like your high school sweetheart?
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't high school--
Speaker 1: Wasn't high school but right out of high school into college, she was a freshman.
Speaker 2: Yeah, although I, I--kind of hard to say sweetheart when you're on other coasts (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I think of a sweetheart, it's someone you're hanging out with every single day and so forth so I, I, I and because we were on other sides of the country, it was up and down you know.  We dated hot and heavy for, for a while and then not hot and heavy for a while you know, kind of in and out, so.
Story_ID: 581477
Speaker 1: Now is the organization the National Society of Black Engineers something that was started at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California]--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or something you just happened to join at Stanford?
Speaker 2: I joined it at, at Stanford but definitely not started at Stanford.  That's been around for a long time.
Speaker 1: And what's the history of that organization?
Speaker 2: It's been there trying to really help, help advance fundamentally blacks and African Americans in engineering and all different disciplines,  so.
Speaker 1: How many were on campus with you at the time?
Speaker 2: I don't recall.
Speaker 1: Very small?
Speaker 2: By definition, the black population at Stanford is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I'm talking about engineers.
Speaker 2: Engineers even smaller.
Speaker 1: Even smaller.
Speaker 2: So, yeah so it's, it's, it's you know I think including all engineering disciplines had to be less than a hundred (cough).
Speaker 1: Well I read that you said something about having personally benefited from the organization when you were pursuing your degree at Stanford. Is that true?
Speaker 2: Well it was actually, it was actually I benefitted from what they called the graduate--well two things.  I benefitted from NSBE just because you see other people like yourself and and I went to a conference and you see very, very successful people and that by definition motivates you to know that you're not, not, not, not alone and I was more directly benefitted from what they call the national GEM fellows [National GEM Consortium], which was a graduate engineers and minorities and, and they actually helped pay for me to go to graduate school so that was a very direct benefit.
Story_ID: 581478
Speaker 1: Now at the time you were at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] was you know there a couple of industrial engineering professors. James Adams [James L. Adams], was he there at the time?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was there.
Speaker 1: Did he teach you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did. I remember a course but--
Speaker 1: But nothing significant about him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what about there's another gentleman I wanted to talk about, Frederick Hillier [Frederick S. Hillier].
Speaker 2: I remember him too.
Speaker 1: But not much about him?
Speaker 2: There are a couple other people that stand out more to me.
Speaker 1: David Thomas [sic. David A. Thompson]?
Speaker 2: Don't remember him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Don't remember him.  Give me a couple more names, I'll tell you who really stood out.
Speaker 1: Those are like the only three I found (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, there's, there's--you see it's funny because some of the professors I really like and teachers I like, is I like folks that overcome adversity so I can, can--and I'll never forget my high school English teacher [at Miami Palmetto Senior High School, Miami, Florida].  This old frail lady who literally came to class every day with a walker and had this very, very--her voice would be breaking up.  Yet, she taught me about English.  And you looked at her and you saw this very frail lady and I remember that first day in class I'm like how's this lady gonna handle you know thirty high school kids?  But even with her cracking voice she was just so powerful and to me I, I--I'm a, I'm a sucker for those kind of stories you know.  I'm always a sucker for somebody who pulls them way up and overcomes adversity, overcomes odds and finds a ways to be successful.  You know those, those are the, the, the individuals that I step back and I say wow to.
Story_ID: 581479
Speaker 1: So in '85 [1985] when you graduated from Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], did you have a job immediately (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well again, well I stayed and got my master's [degree] so I graduated in '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: So in '86 [1986] okay so you just stayed straight through to get your master's (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I stayed straight through, got my master's.
Speaker 1: But at this time had you sent the letter off to the recruiter [at General Electric]?
Speaker 2: No, I, I, I knew I was gonna go to grad school.
Speaker 1: You knew you were going to grad school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well when did you send the letter off?
Speaker 2: Oh it would probably been oh it's probably I got a job before I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was probably--I don't know winter.
Speaker 1: Well who had taught you about business, the art of dressing appropriately, the art of the technique of interviewing appropriately to get a job?  How did you know those things?
Speaker 2: It's funny 'cause I don't remember anybody ever telling me that but again I grew up in a household where my dad [Audley Hewett] because of his business was always dressed appropriately.  So the thought of not getting dressed appropriately was like you know my uncle, bought me my first suit you know when I was between junior and senior year.  You know my uncle, I saw my uncle and he said, "Guess what we're doing today?"  I said, "What?"  He said, "I'm gonna buy you a suit today."  And I was like okay never thought of it but he was like, "You need a suit for when you interview."  (Unclear) said, "You can choose whatever suit you want." I chose this like flashy gray suit and I'd never be caught dead wearing today.  But he was like, "I don't care.  I'm not--I can't tell you exactly what color it is, but I can tell you I'm buying you a suit 'cause you're gonna have a suit when you show up for an interview."  You know so again there was never anybody who I would say would come to me and say, "Okay you gotta do this."  Now one of the things that I've always been pretty good at and still am good at today, I do very good what I call self-awareness.  So I do a lot of pulsing.  I do a lot of checking.  I do a lot of how am I being perceived.  What's my perception?  I look around me a lot.  And based upon what I see and what I hear, I make adjustments.  It's a trait I've always had.  And so you look around and you, you know you go on your first interview and you're like okay did I look like everybody else looked?  You know 'cause if I didn't then it's probably a problem.  You know and you did your first interview and you're like yeah, you kind of know when you answer the question the right way and you kind of know when you didn't.
Story_ID: 581480
Speaker 1: You know and 'cause I, I always believe you know it's like Japanese kaizen.
Speaker 2: What is kaizen?
Speaker 1: It's it's a Japanese word for continuous improvement but fundamentally I don't care what it is you can always get better you know it's like, it's like I remember someone, someone ask me early on in my GE [General Electric] career and they're like, "Why are you doing the job that you're in?" And I said, "Because it's the greatest learning opportunity for me."  And they said, "That's a corny answer," and I said, "It may be corny, but it's true because I love to learn.  And I love to make things better and I love to make myself better." And I feel you can always keep learning, you can always get better I don't care what you do.  So I do--going back, to bring it back, at early age, I was always aware of okay you know, even now, I know you know I look at you and I'm like what can I learn from Shawn [Shawn Wilson], is there a way he carries himself or is it a way that he asks a question that I can use that, I can make myself better.  I'm always looking to learn and--
Speaker 2: So did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that trait, that trait helped.
Story_ID: 581481
Speaker 1: Did you see yourself vastly different now--once you graduated Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California]--from your friends at the University of Miami [Coral Gables, Florida] and other places?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah but like I said I, I--when I went to work, I was no longer Jamaican first.
Speaker 1: What were you?
Speaker 2: I was a black kid who's working trying to make a living.
Speaker 1: Had you ever been considered to act white?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That comes with the territory?
Speaker 2: Like I, I, again depending on your definition I, I yeah I, I have dated black American females, I have dated white Americans, I've--but most of dating have been Jamaicans.  My wife [Simmone McDonald Hewett] is Jamaican.  And it goes to that fit thing, but you know I, I, I, I remember once this girl came up to me in college at Stanford and said, "We're, we're--all of us are convinced that you're gay."  I said, "Well, why are you so convinced that I'm gay?  Well have you ever seen me with a guy?"  "No."  "So how do you come to the conclusion that I'm gay?"  "Well because you don't chase every single black American female."  I'm like okay, that's factual.  I'll give you that you know, but that doesn't mean I'm gay you know.  Yeah considered white you know its--
Speaker 1: Considered white but?
Speaker 2: --yeah again people, people, it's funny because sometimes folks would say well--
Speaker 1: Assume.
Speaker 2: --yeah, yeah well because I have a majority mindset and I grew up with a majority mindset.  I grew up with a majority mindset.  I don't--
Speaker 1: With that majority being?
Speaker 2: --Jamaican.
Speaker 1: Jamaican okay.
Speaker 2: But, but, but you still if, if, if you think of as an example and I know this is a generalization so, so, so I always hate generalizations but when something bad happens to me I don't think automatically it's because I'm black.  Okay when 'cause when something bad happens to a white person, they don't immediately think it happened to them bad because they're white.  'Cause a majority doesn't think that way.  The majority says okay it happened because there was something unique to this situation that either I could have handled different or somebody else could have handled differently, but don't jump to oh it happened to me because I'm black.  And I always go through and allow my conversation I say hey guys, I'm not trying to say racism doesn't exist because we know it does.  But I don't start there as a first line of defense.  You know there is something else that probably happened or led to that being happened and when you start with that as a philosophy, there's certain parts of the population that say well you must really think you're white.  It's not because you think you're white, it's because again going back to what I said earlier about learning you're trying to figure out exactly what can I do better.  You know I can't change the fact that I'm black.  I don't care what I do.  I can't.  So trying to better the fact I'm black is a waste of my time.  You know I'll never be white so trying to become white is a waste of my time.  But if I carry myself differently, if I say something differently, will I get a different reaction, will I get a more favorable reaction?  Now is that considered being white?  Quite honestly I don't give a shit (laughter). Okay and if you want to consider me being white for doing that but I'm not trying to be white 'cause I, I, I can't be white.
Story_ID: 581482
Speaker 1: So in 1988--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --when you graduate--
Speaker 2: Eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986] was it '86 [1986] you graduated?
Speaker 2: College [Stanford University, Stanford, California].
Speaker 1: College '86 [1986].  Then why is it, what do you do between the two years before you actually join GE [General Electric]?
Speaker 2: I joined GE in '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: So you join in '86 [1986]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And do you join via this letter you'd written that said come to the interview--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --and what do you wear?
Speaker 2: I wear--
Speaker 1: That suit your--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Exactly with a tie--
Speaker 1: And a tie okay.
Speaker 2: --and everything else.  But I you know my hair is neatly groomed, probably too high, actually definitely too high, so I had those pictures, but definitely high.  But I come you know through (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you got the job.
Speaker 2: I got the job.  (Cough) And I remember what I focused on in the interview was always about accomplishments.
Speaker 1: What you had or what you were willing--what you were hoping to?
Speaker 2: No what I had, had accomplished.
Story_ID: 581483
Speaker 1: So to just go back a little, summer of '85 [1985]--
Speaker 2: Yep (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you're gonna talk about a life lesson that something that was very beneficial.  What was it Slumber- ?
Speaker 2: Yeah it was--I did a summer job at a company called Schlumberger [Schlumberger Limited] in Houston, Texas.
Speaker 1: First how did you get that job because you're in California?
Speaker 2: Well actually remember that, that graduate engineering minority fellowship [National GEM Consortium] I won, one of the things that came with that was condition to paying for you to go to graduate school; they also provided you with a summer job.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it could be anywhere in the country.  And it just so happened that Schlumberger picked my name and that's where I ended up.
Speaker 1: And it had no connection to your father [Audley Hewett]?
Speaker 2: (Cough) Zero connection to my dad--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --zero connection with my dad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you'll see that from this moment on, there's no connection to my dad.  I'm now on my own.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm now plotting, I'm now, I'm now in this massive race to be known for Wayne [HistoryMaker Wayne M. Hewett] and not be known as my dad's son.  This is, this is in the background everyday going.  But anyway so Schlumberger, I remember doing a job and it was funny because I was--there was like one or two other black individuals that were--
Speaker 1: Who were they?
Speaker 2: --oh a guy named Jessie Richie [ph.] was one guy's name if I recall, who were engineers in the same group I was in.  But I never forget, I don't remember--recall this guy's name but there was this one engineer, white guy, who was probably four or five years ahead of me and he made a comment to me that I've never forgotten.  He said, "Wayne, when I do a job, I don't care what the job is, I do it in such a way that five years from now I can still find my fingerprints."  He said, "If I'm doing software, I'm putting something in there that I know is me."  And it's like you know think of a painter and they put their little mark, if you ever seen any professional painter, they can go back, they can immediately know if the painting is theirs because there's a little unique mark that they did for themselves that only they know.  It was their--if somebody wants to copy it, that mark is not copied. And I'll never forget that engineer giving me this story about: "I don't care what you do Wayne and every job you do, make sure you do it in such a way that five years from now when you're long and gone, you're still remembered for it."  And that's something which has stayed with me my whole career.  Because I'd never done a job where I think about success just now.  My definition of success has always been if I left the job and I came back to it five years later, will I still be remembered?  Or said better, what will I be remembered for?  And that's the advice I give people all day long.  I say, I say and it came from this little engineer, I have no clue who the guy's name is, I don't know if he turned out to be very successful or not, but I said that's a good bar.  And advice I give, people ask me for advice all the time and that's advice I always say is whatever job you're doing, are you doing it in a way that you can walk back into that environment five years after you've left?
Speaker 1: And that's worked for you.  Because there's no way you could have done what you've done, I mean because your step, I mean you have literally climbed your way up through this same company [General Electric].
Speaker 2: But every job I've done, I can go back five years later and I know that there's something there that I'm remembered for.
Story_ID: 581484
Speaker 1: So let's start early on--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --with the management program.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: But you said it was not a management program.
Speaker 2: It was a manufacturing management. It was a manufacturing ma- GE [General Electric] has a lot of training programs so this was a program where you did four six month rotations in two different physical locations.  And you do it for two years and it's really a way to get your ears wet, you learn about the basics of manufacturing and then after that--
Speaker 1: What were they manufacturing at the time?
Speaker 2: Well it depends on--
Speaker 1: I mean when you were there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) you have two locations, the first location I was, I was at is no longer part of GE was they made simulation and control systems in Daytona Beach, Florida.  The best way to think of it is think of, of video games today.  These were not anywhere sophisticated as today's video games, but and by the way they take a, you know, a conference room full of, of computer chips and boards to actually do--but fundamentally it was for army training and naval training so that people would actually get experience in terms of operating these vessels and so forth while using computer simulation and computer controls.  And my second year was making aircraft engines.  I been right outside Boston, Mass [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: You know that's so funny because I didn't realize GE made aircrafts like but now they're doing the whole thing.
Speaker 2: Well, GE leases planes today.
Speaker 1: Leases planes.
Speaker 2: GE does not make planes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but they lease planes--
Speaker 1: Small jets or something?
Speaker 2: --no, no they lease planes, including small jets, but they make--GE is the largest aircraft engine maker in the world.  So they make the engines, but do a lot of leases, they buy and lease jets.
Speaker 1: Okay so from that four to six month interval, I mean or from that--
Speaker 2: For two years.
Speaker 1: --for two years--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you do that program that rotating, who mentors you during that time?
Speaker 2: Again my--
Speaker 1: Because now you don't have your dad [Audley Hewett].
Speaker 2: Right now the, the (cough) yeah there are a few individuals that really stick out from that time like clearly one a guy named Angel Mendez [Angel L. Mendez].
Speaker 1: Is he Hispanic?
Speaker 2: Hispanic, Puerto Rican.  He and I are still in contact today.  Matter of fact, he's done very well.  He's like the sen- like a senior VP now at Cisco [Cisco Systems, Inc.].  But he started off at GE and he was you know I don't know five or six years older than I was but considered a fast riser and he and I hit it off because I ended up working in his group and even though he was Hispanic and I was black the mere fact that we both had this Caribbean connection Puerto Rico and Jamaica, we kind of had this connection and, and you know when you just meet someone and just kind of--
Speaker 1: You click (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) you click, you know he and I clicked you know.
Speaker 1: How many other minorities including Hispanic were within that program?
Speaker 2: Well, again it's, it's, it's--I'm trying to recall the numbers.
Speaker 1: I mean just your program?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but this is at a GE wide program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So at the location I was at--
Speaker 1: And I'm talking about your location?
Speaker 2: The location I'm sorry, the location in Daytona Beach it was that year it was six, which two are minorities.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: It was me and this one other lady were the two minorities that started off in (unclear) but this is a part of a GE wide program three, four hundred people.
Speaker 1: Of the three or four hundred, how many would you say who were--?
Speaker 2: I don't know it's gotta be--
Speaker 1: Ten percent?
Speaker 2: --I'd probably say 10 or 20 percent somewhere in that range.
Speaker 1: Well that's a good number (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 581485
Speaker 1: So GE [General Electric] has I mean and I don't know if you noticed because you're young, but what has GE's reputation been on affirmative action?  Have they always reached out to minorities? Because 10 percent's a pretty high number.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think GE has and again I, I have more recent data not the '86 [1986] data but yeah GE has done a pretty good job of at least over the last ten years of reaching out trying to recruit minorities.  And you take a look at training programs which is the majority of the feeder system of new hires but between minorities and females over half of that would be either minorities or females that come in every year.
Speaker 1: Which is vastly--
Speaker 2: Which is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) different than 10 percent you saw in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Yeah so again it's, it's clearly been an area of focus and concentration. You know, that said, yeah there's still a lot of work still to be done and you know like everything else you kind of hit different road blocks.
Speaker 1: And when you say there's still work to be done, if the numbers are high, what else needs to be done?
Speaker 2: Well I think the issue you have is retention you know, it's, it's, it's you know when you start thinking about three hundred and fifty thousand employees you start with small numbers so you lose an individual it's still noticeable you know because en mass the numbers aren't that big and the retention has clearly been an issue.
Story_ID: 581486
Speaker 1: Well who's the CEO when you came on board?  When you started (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Jack Welch.
Speaker 1: Jack, Jack Welch.  Is he the same that wrote that book? 'From the Gut' ['Jack: Straight from the Gut,' Jack Welch]?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.  Matter of fact , then the last book 'Winning' that he wrote with his new wife Suzy [Suzy Welch], I've actually got a little section in there so.
Speaker 1: Nice.  So I read because on another job interviewing somebody else about him, that he said he'd rather work with--he likes for people to do stuff.
Speaker 2: Yeah he's a doer.
Speaker 1: He's a doer.  He wants to work with a guy who does ten things, nine of them wrong versus sitting in a room with a guy who's gotta ponder all day--
Speaker 2: Correct (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and do one thing.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Was that the philosophy he taught?
Speaker 2: He, he was a doer.  He's--let's go take some shots.
Speaker 1: What did you learn from him?
Speaker 2: I--what I, I learned from Jack, you learn a lot of things but a couple of things one, clarity of thought.
Speaker 1: What does that mean?
Speaker 2: Clarity of thought is focus on the issues at hand and be very, very precise in those issues and don't be distracted by minutiae.  And in the second thing I learned was once you got through clarity of thought you gotta focus on marshal resource to get anything done.  So you can have clear thinking but if you don't get resources focused on that, then nothing really happens.  You know you gotta move, and you gotta move organization by putting resources behind it.
Story_ID: 581487
Speaker 1: Who was it within the organization that saw you as someone to keep an eye on to pull you out of that management program to take you to the next level?
Speaker 2: Well I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like a rising star, who was it?
Speaker 2: Well I think, I think when you go into management program you kind of get selected early on as by definition you're in this group that's high potential.  And then I don't know if you'd call it a break but I move to the corporate audit staff which is considered the highest potential of all of the different management programs.
Speaker 1: And what is that--what do you do within that staff?
Speaker 2: You do financial audits, you do business--
Speaker 1: So now you're gone from manufacturing to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) to financial audits and business process reviews as well but I was--I heard about this and I thought it was the best way for me to learn about GE [General Electric] so I decided to take a shot at it, a shot at it.  So I took a shot.
Speaker 1: And you got it.
Speaker 2: And I got it.
Speaker 1: Now do the numbers start to dwindle down, do you see less people who look like yourself?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. And then I was there five--there're five levels and you start off, back then you started off as a staff auditor and the highest level was executive audit manager and it was the--just to give you a sense, maybe about forty to fifty people every year start out.
Speaker 1: At the corporate--
Speaker 2: At, at the staff auditor level.  Back then only three to five would make it to the fifth year.  So it's a very, very tight pyramid.  And I was--
Speaker 1: And you were one of the three?
Speaker 2: --I was the first African American to make it to the executive audit manager, which is the top of that pyramid (cough).
Speaker 1: And how did that feel?
Speaker 2: Say again?
Speaker 1: And how did that feel to you?
Speaker 2: I, I, I heard someone say this, well you always have very mixed emotions you know.  You, you, you're obviously happy and excited that you're the first because it obviously shows that you've achieved something.  But truth be told you also are sad that you are the first.  Because--
Speaker 1: Because this is the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: It was the late '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Late '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: So you know you--I was I think, I think that person kind of when I said it I can't take credit for saying it originally but I think that I heard someone describe it that way and I think that's a very, very great way to think of it as you're excited on one hand because you know how difficult it was and the mere fact that you're the first to achieve something is like you know you must have done something right.  But you're also sad that you're the first because you know that there are other people before you who are just as capable.
Speaker 1: So is your perception then becomes how much further you can go to keep putting these first notches on your belt (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's clearly, that's clearly there.
Speaker 1: Or do you think, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah again what's driving me in the background is I'm trying to get away from my you know--
Speaker 1: Your dad [Audley Hewett].
Speaker 2: --escape my dad's shadow you know.
Speaker 1: You've done that with being the first to--
Speaker 2: But--yeah, yeah but still, that level executive audit manager you know my dad's friends and people who know my dad well don't see me as I've been to what my dad is.  You know it's, it's, you know he is--remember he walked into any bank in Jamaica and got a loan just by his name.
Speaker 1: On his name alone.
Speaker 2: You know executive audit manager I don't do that.  You know I just don't do that yet.
Story_ID: 581488
Speaker 1: What year did you marry, get married?
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987].
Speaker 1: Eighty-seven [1987]. So this is happening during the time you're getting married, you're starting your career as well?
Speaker 2: Well I got married my first year I went to GE [General Electric].  I started GE in '86 [1986] so you know we now have one child [Jordan Hewett].  By the time I made executive audit manager, the first child that year that would have been 1992.
Speaker 1: Now after you--after that position, what comes next?  Because now you're one of three.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: You're the first African American to have made it to this level.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Who starts to groom you for what the next level is and what is the next level?
Speaker 2: Well, I--the good thing about the exec- in the audit staff is that you have a lot of people now who are in your camp because they know that if you made it this far, you must you know like someone said--
Speaker 1: You're worth your weight in gold.
Speaker 2: --yeah we, we know that you're no dummy.  You may not be perfect but you're 90 percent of the question we have about you there're no longer questions any more they're, they're given unless it's proven, they're not, we give you the benefit of the doubt.  So I had several.  But my next job was the guy who was the CEO of--I'll never forget 'cause I was on a conference call with Dave Calhoun who (cough) who recently left GE was a vice chairman and he was the head of the audit staff at the time.  And he, he called me and he said--at the end of the conference call he said, "I want to spend five minutes with you."  So I said, "Okay fine."  And he was someone who had been looking out for me before.
Speaker 1: Did you know that?
Speaker 2: About--he, if I recall he had start--he had become the VP of the audit staff about two years earlier, one or two years earlier and I never forget because he was actually in Albany [New York] and the Albany area on--and he probably been on the job three months.  You know when you have a new head you don't know where you fit because everything starts over and he sat me down in the lobby and he said, "Wayne [HistoryMaker Wayne M. Hewett], I've, I've decided that you're one of my guys."  And I said to him, "Well, why is that?"  You know because he used to play basketball a lot, I didn't play basketball 'cause Jamaicans don't play basketball. Well Patrick Ewing did, but I didn't as a kid.  But so we weren't hanging out buddy, buddies.  I'm not a beer drinker and that kind of stuff so long story short, yeah he says to me, "Wayne very simple, I was doing an audit review, meeting all the different business heads and so forth and this would have been the location I'd been to a couple years earlier so it wasn't recent."  And he said, "We're in this review with all these high level people and out of the blue someone says, 'We would have never made as much progress if it wasn't for this guy named Wayne Hewett.'"  I wasn't in the room.  This was at least a year before so I had no clue it was even happening.  And Dave says, "All I know Wayne is that when I sit in a room like that and people out of the blue proactively give me your name as the key person, that the thing is still going because of you, then you're the kind of guy I wanna be around and I want on my team."  So he said, "I'm making you executive audit manager because of that."  Now the thing, 'cause it wasn't anything that I'd done for him, it was stuff that he heard I'd done, goes back to what I said earlier--
Speaker 1: It was that advice you'd taken from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) doing your job in a way that five years later it still exists.
Speaker 1: Leave your mark, yeah, yeah. That's the advice you took.
Speaker 2: And that's what got him to take me on.
Story_ID: 581489
Speaker 1: So anyway so I'm now on his staff and he says, "Hey Wayne [HistoryMaker Wayne M. Hewett], I need you to call me [Dave Calhoun]." And he said--so I said, "Okay fine." Call my (unclear) what I did.  He said, "Well a senior VP," a guy who ran GE Industrial Systems [sic. General Electric Industrial Solutions] at the time, "has decided he wants you on his team.  (Cough)  And I can't really come up with a better job so it's hard for me to tell you no.  So he wants an interview tomorrow." I went to the guy's office and the guy said here are two jobs, which one do you want?
Speaker 2: And what were the two jobs?
Speaker 1: One was in the manufacturing, 'cause of my manufacturing background and one was in engineering design systems, which sounds fancy but it's nothing--it's, it's I had seven hundred drafters that are working for me and I chose that one and I still think I have the record for the least sexy job coming off of the audit staff at that level because you know I was giving presentations to Fairfield [Connecticut], I'm dealing with all the big knobs in GE [General Electric], giving strategy stuff and now I'm responsible for seven hundred drafters and the average age is like fifty-five years old, I'm less than thirty at the time.
Speaker 2: And AutoCAD and all that stuff had not--
Speaker 1: All that stuff was just coming in and so forth and least sexy as you possibly can but I wanted a job where I can roll my sleeves up and so I could, I could get something done.  So I decided to go do that and did that for a year.
Story_ID: 581490
Speaker 1: And about a year later, got a phone call from a guy named Dave Cote [David Cote] who is now the CEO of Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.] who's been a great mentor and friend to me still to this day.
Speaker 2: I know a couple of people at Honeywell.
Speaker 1: Dave is the new CEO there been there several years now with the CEO of Honeywell and Dave had just--actually Dave had just taken the job I currently have.  And was running GE Silicones [General Electric Silicones] at the time and got a phone call and Dave Cote is on the line and said, "I wanna interview you--I want you to come interview for a job."  I said, "Never--," and I said, "How come you called me?" He said, "I had dinner with Dave Calhoun and Dave told me you're a great guy and Dave tells me you're a great guy, guess what?"
Speaker 2: You're a great guy.
Speaker 1: "You're a great guy so that's why we're talking."  So went and did interview and that afternoon gave me an offer to join Silicones so I joined Silicones and--
Speaker 2: What is the biggest difference between like Silicones and, and I don't know is it plastics or what?
Speaker 1: Well Silicones isn't a material business but it's more like a plastics but it's fundamentally materials and chemicals operations.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Industrial systems are much more classical manufacturing in terms of assembly and metal cutting and metal melding and all that kind of stuff (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Engines and all that kind of stuff, okay. And then so the silicone was something you did for GE [General Electric] at the time?
Speaker 1: No, no, GE was one of the original founders of silicones--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but it's clearly GE doesn't have a lot of chemical operation, this is clearly more the chemicals side.
Speaker 2: Then I guess DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company] would have a market on the chemical (simultaneous) --
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, we don't compete with DuPont.  But DuPont being a chemical company think of DuPont, think of Dow Chemical [Dow Chemical Company]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --think of those kind of companies where this would be versus metal (unclear) companies (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 581491
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well how do you get to Tokyo [Japan]?
Speaker 2: Well I went through several different jobs and--
Speaker 1: And, and silicone management you still--
Speaker 2: No, no I move from Silicones [General Electric Silicones] over to GE Plastics [General Electric Plastics] and then my last job being the Six Sigma leader for GE Plastics.  So when Jack Welch was talking about Six Sigma as a future and so forth (cough).
Speaker 1: Jack Welch was talking about?
Speaker 2: Six Sigma as a future and he wanted the best and brightest in Six Sigma roles so I ended up being the Six Sigma leader for GE Plastics.
Speaker 1: Well you got to tell me what Six Sigmas are?
Speaker 2: Oh Six Sigmas, Six Sigma was really a management philosophy that started out of Japan, made its way over to Motorola [Motorola, Inc.], but fundamentally operational improvement using statistics as a basis for what's normal behavior and abnormal behavior and using that to help guide your management principles.
Speaker 1: Well how do you get those?  Who collects that data?  Where does that come from, what's normal and abnormal?
Speaker 2: Well you have to collect the data--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then data you have to analyze it.  And--
Speaker 1: And that was your job to collect and analyze?
Speaker 2: No, no my job was to oversee the whole program.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  And well you overseeing these six people?
Speaker 2: No Six Sigma program.
Speaker 1: Six Sigma program okay.
Speaker 2: That's the six in the leader for all of GE Plastics.  So I--
Speaker 1: And then that job must come directly from Welch himself.  He appoints who he wants to--
Speaker 2: He was clearly--approved it.
Speaker 1: Right.  So, obviously you met him and shook his hand and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --and in his presence all the time.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: What was he like as a person on a daily basis?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, I didn't interact with him on a daily basis--
Speaker 1: No, no but you when you saw him what was he like?
Speaker 2: --I, I like I said, it's, it's what I loved about Jack was his clarity of thought.
Speaker 1: Did he know that you'd been the first African American to be in some of the positions that you were in?
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: Probably.
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: And he never spoke of it?
Speaker 2: Well we had dinners and I know that one of the things he used to always say to me at dinner is he said to me once he said, "Wayne [HistoryMaker Wayne M. Hewett], I don't know exactly how you do it, but the mere fact that you've been so successful in the way you've done it is a great story that you've gotta find a way to make sure you share with other folks."  So he clearly was aware of the fact that--and I always say you know are you breaking new ground who knows?  But relatively new ground and the answer is yes.
Speaker 1: What did you take that advice to mean?
Speaker 2: Give back and help others.  And as a result of a lot of his--
Speaker 1: That's great advice.
Speaker 2: --I, I, I got very involved in the African American Forum for GE [General Electric].
Speaker 1: Was it something new or something that you helped to develop?
Speaker 2: It started thirteen, fourteen years ago but it started when I was still very junior in my career so I can't take any credit for developing it.  But as the thing evolved I became one of the leaders of the organization.
Speaker 1: And that organization's purpose is to do what? Cultivate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's fundamentally to help promote, retain, recruit but really enhance the African American experience within GE.
Story_ID: 581492
Speaker 1: Okay so from, from the what is it Six Segma?
Speaker 2: Six Sigma yeah.
Speaker 1: Six Sigma. You are then recruited then to go to Tokyo [Japan] first?
Speaker 2: I was, my, my, my--the senior VP or the CEO of Plastics [General Electric Plastics] came and said, "I want you go to Tokyo for me."
Speaker 1: Now was Tokyo, was Asia an emerging market?
Speaker 2: Well Japan--
Speaker 1: Or it always has been?
Speaker 2: --well Japan is not an emerging market.  Japan is you know second largest economy in the world so. But Asia (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I mean the fact that you guys are going there starting to do business with them?
Speaker 2: Well we'd been there for a while.  We've had joint ventures there for a long time so it's not emerging.  Now China obviously being part of--when I went to Tokyo, I had Asia responsibility.  So there are parts of that marketplace that were clearly emergent markets for example.
Speaker 1: So you arrive in Tokyo with your family--
Speaker 2: With my family.
Speaker 1: --and that experience is what for you?
Speaker 2: The best I ever had.  Just best--
Speaker 1: Where did you live in Tokyo?
Speaker 2: --I lived in a place called Roppongi [Tokyo, Japan], actually not Roppongi, but Akasaka [Tokyo, Japan] which is right--I lived right on the border between Roppongi and Akasaka which is you know they call it Roppongi they call it High Touch Town and I'll let your imagination fill that in (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you ever travel to any of the other vacation islands like Hokkaido [Japan] or anywhere outside of you know way out?
Speaker 2: You mean in Japan or in Asia (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In Japan.
Speaker 2: Well, we, we didn't--it's funny because we when we first got to Japan, my wife [Simonne McDonald Hewett] and I, we love to travel and--
Speaker 1: You had the children too.
Speaker 2: But we take them with us, so I'll never forget Thanksgiving 'cause we got there I don't know like I don't know August, September we got there so the real first time vacation would have been Thanksgiving and I, I said okay we're gonna go to Kyoto [Japan] which is you know used to be the former capital of Japan like most people consider it the cultural capital today of Japan and we were gonna there for two or three nights, take a train, get a hotel for, you know for five and come back.  And when I got the quote, the cheapest price I could get I forget how much it was, but I looked at the quote and my wife looked at the quote and we said we could fly to Hong Kong and be half the price.  So if we can go to Hong Kong for half of the price, why are we going to Kyoto?  (Cough) You know we're already in Japan, we're at least--so once we went through that 'cause you know Japan is very expensive--
Speaker 1: Very expensive.
Speaker 2: --once we got through that we did a lot of vacationing but I wouldn't say that we were vacationing in Japan, we vacated not vacated but we had vacations everywhere but Japan, but yeah.
Speaker 1: How long were you in Japan for?
Speaker 2: Two years, but I loved every minute of it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what were those two years?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Those two years were?
Speaker 2: Two thousand [2000], 2002.
Story_ID: 581493
Speaker 1: So you were there [Tokyo, Japan] when 9/11 happened.
Speaker 2: I actually--9/11 on September 11th [September 11, 2001] there was a I forget the name, typhoon in Japan on September 11th 'cause I was flying to a staff meeting in Pittsfield, Mass [Pittsfield, Massachusetts] that was supposed to start September 12th and I boarded, the plane was late because of the typhoon which is like almost like a hurricane, massive thunderstorm so we left about an hour late out of Japan.  Even in Japan time was September 11th, headed on a United Airlines plane, headed to New York City [New York, New York] and I, I, I tell everybody I left late because of a typhoon and I never arrived in New York City because of terrorism and we were in--and I still remembered it to this day because we were flying and obviously when you're in the air you don't hear anything, you don't hear anything going on.  And we're flying and you leave in the evening so most people sleep on that flight so I was sleeping and around 2:30, 3:00 that afternoon Mountain Time, the pilot comes on and he says, "You know ladies and gentlemen, very, very sorry to, to, to inform you but there have been a series of terrorist activities in New York City and the East Coast and as a result of that U.S. airspace has been closed down and we'll be landing in Calgary [Canada] in thirty minutes."  And I had been in situations where I'd flown on nights where there'd been crashes.  So you know I was in first class and I immediately took the telephone and I called up my boss' assistant in, in Pittsfield and I said, "Kathy [ph.], I have no clue what's going on but they just told me I'm going to Calgary in half an hour.  Get me a hotel room because I know when I land it's gonna be absolute chaos."  And she said, "Fine."  And I said, "Now what the hell happened?"  And she told me everything that happened and I was the very last person from her whole team that called in because I was traveling the whole time.  And this is now five o'clock or so East Coast time.  And she was like, "We're so happy to hear from you because we had no clue because you've been in the air the whole time."  And I said, "Okay send Simonne [Simonne McDonald Hewett] a note telling her that you heard from me," my wife Simonne, "and get me a hotel room."  And I remember telling the flight attendants in first class I have no clue what had happened.  Only the pilot knew.  And I remember telling the flight attendants and they just started bawling in the middle of the plane.  And we landed a half an hour later.  So I, I, yeah, yeah you're right, I was overseas for September 11th but I tell folks that I I flew right in the middle of a September 11th United Airline--
Story_ID: 581494
Speaker 1: After Jack [Jack Welch]--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --leaves--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --which is 2000--what, '2 [2002]?
Speaker 2: The day after September 11 [9/11] so 2001.
Speaker 1: Okay and that's so Jack left--
Speaker 2: Sorry day before, the day before the eleventh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: September 2001.
Speaker 1: Now tell me what was the nature of your job in Asia? You were sent there to do what?
Speaker 2: Well, I had two jobs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My first job was I was responsible for GE Toshiba Silicones [GE Toshiba Silicones Co., Ltd.], the joint venture between GE [General Electric] and Toshiba [Toshiba Corporation] but it's fundamentally Silicone [General Electric Silicones] for all of Asia.  Then my second job I had Plastics [General Electric Plastics] for all of Asia.  And that's when I went to Shanghai [China].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in Shang- you moved from Tokyo [Japan] to Shanghai?
Speaker 2: I relocated to headquarters of GE Plastics Asia from Tokyo to Shanghai.
Story_ID: 581495
Speaker 1: And where did you live in Shanghai [China]--now let me also ask this?  Were there any other African Americans in Asia at the time working with you at GE [General Electric]?
Speaker 2: At GE?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Because you were working for GE still?
Speaker 2: Yeah I was working for GE, I would say that in Tokyo [Japan], not in my division, but there was one guy in HR [human resources]--
Speaker 1: Who's American?
Speaker 2: Yeah, African Americans you talking right?  Then there was another guy in Hong Kong was African American.  At that time those are the only two within GE that I was aware of (cough).
Speaker 1: You moved to Shanghai--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you relocate to Shanghai, is it the same numbers?  Are the numbers still as low in Shanghai as in Tokyo?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  I--actually from an African American perspective the numbers are lower in Shanghai than they were in Tokyo.  Just because Shanghai--
Speaker 1: Still so new.
Speaker 2: --is still relatively new in terms of business environment and the business culture, where Tokyo all the business is there.  Whereas China you have a lot of different cities so it's much more fragment in terms of the business community so from an African American perspective, it's lower but that said you know one of the things that I found interesting was, was China I remember going to the Shenzhen, Shenzhen, if you're not familiar with Shenzhen, is this little town, not so little but it's, it's well in China every town is big so so it's this big town I should say, right across the border from Hong Kong and I was there, this was probably 2000, 2001 and I was there for a business meeting and I walk into the lobby in Shenzhen, China and they're black people everywhere.  And you very quickly realize they're all African.  And, and, and it was eye opening for me because what you realize is that you have China has had because of the Communist ties and so forth but even post some of these African countries being Communist have maintained these very, very long relationships with a lot of African countries and then you start seeing it and you see that there's a fair amount of--I can say fair still a very small numbers but still you see Africans who are actually studying in China and going to their university systems in China.  You know so I actually saw much more Africans than African Americans in China but again relatively speaking still small numbers.
Story_ID: 581496
Speaker 1: So you can't drive in China, you can't have a driver's license (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well you can, well no you can if you want to but you're, you're--
Speaker 1: You're not--are you allowed to have a driver's license?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the way, the way it works is, is, is a) you're allowed to have a driver's license; two, you have what we call international driver's license which is good for the first twelve months any way.  You can drive on an international license for the first twelve months but we would drive in Tokyo [Japan].  We didn't drive--we chose not to drive in, in Shanghai [China].  A good friend of mine who's American who got married to a Taiwanese woman told me very early on he said, "Wayne [HistoryMaker Wayne M. Hewett], you don't wanna drive in China for one reason."  I said, "What is it?"  He said, "When you drive in China and if you have an accident, the mere fact you're a foreigner, you're wrong.  And there's nothing you can do to fix that."  And it's so funny because in Jai- in China, whenever there's an accident in China, immediately you see hordes of people come and surround the accident and they literally debate it before a cop comes.  And when a cop comes, the crowd tells the cop what happened.  And, and my friend was telling me that, that, that, that don't care how right you are, when this process happens, you will be wrong and because you're considered a foreigner not only will you be wrong, but odds are you're gonna get sued.  And you know he said for the additional cost of a driver to avoid that--
Speaker 1: Have a driver.
Speaker 2: --have a driver because a driver costs you $150 a month back then--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --he said hire a driver for 150 bucks [dollars] a month because you won't have to worry about any kind of liability.
Speaker 1: Now--
Story_ID: 581497
Speaker 1: Now why would you--why did GE [General Electric] move and I can't remember what I read exactly, but I read something about them moving a big part of what they do from Tokyo [Japan] to China?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I moved the headquarters of GE Plastics [General Electric Plastics] from Tokyo to China.
Speaker 1: Moved because the labor costs were less?
Speaker 2: No had nothing to do with costs 'cause headquarters is not very large, but that it was--that's where the future market is and you have to start developing relationships and when--if you're not located there, you don't develop the relationships.  We had great Japanese relationships but we didn't have great Chinese relationships and there is no doubt that Chinese is a bigger market than the Japanese market, so.
Story_ID: 581498
Speaker 1: How do you then go about studying the culture to know the cultural differences between the Chinese and the Japanese?
Speaker 2: The, the, the like anything else, you have to live it.  You know because you can read about stuff you know but it's like someone you know, it's like somebody telling you what an African American is like.  You know the reality is that, don't care what they write, someone can argue it's right and someone can argue it's wrong because for some individuals what they write about is right and for some individuals what they write about is wrong.  So it's no different when someone--yeah so I remember when we first moved to Tokyo [Japan] I mean one of the things that you know GE [General Electric] recommended to do is to go do cultural assimilation courses and after you did one you're like oh my god this is horrible.  Yeah because all of the stereotypes that get reinforced through that you know and one of the things I learned is that the stereotypes--there're obviously some were there but I've always said I don't want you to stereotype me.  I want you to treat me as Wayne [HistoryMaker Wayne M. Hewett].  And you know what Wayne is different than Shawn [Shawn Wilson] and Shawn is different and Brian and don't care what we look like on the outside, if you treat me as Wayne as an individual, we're gonna be all better off.  And I learned the best way to learn about cultures is to just get yourself emerged and treat people as individuals.  And people will know when you make a genuine mistake.
Speaker 1: What were the challenges of living in Shanghai [China] developing and moving the office to Shanghai?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, think that the, the, the and the challenges you have when you move to China was that because of Chinese government laws and restrictions on travel, it's very, it's much harder to have Chinese who travel outside of China and when you're having an Asian/white office which is what we had, 'cause I had specific responsibility having Chinese that is much tougher for them to get visas to leave China is clearly a, a, a much more an obstacle or much more of a challenge than in Tokyo where getting a visa for a Japanese person to travel anywhere is not a big deal.
Story_ID: 581499
Speaker 1: So you, at this point, you'd outgrown, I mean did you feel you had outgrown living in your father's [Audley Hewett] shadow?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that you're now its Wayne's [HistoryMaker Wayne M. Hewett] world?
Speaker 2: --when I, when I, when I got to Japan and what became very clear to me was that I was now operating on the global level.  And my dad as successful as he was and still is was always on a Jamaican level.
Speaker 1: Do you find that there are many African Americans that have the opportunity to operate on a global level?  Specifically not Africans like African Americans?
Speaker 2: Yeah again, I, I think that it is and depending on your definition of many right--
Speaker 1: But what other numbers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) there, there, there, it's relatively small. Now one of the things I think that, that, that, that we don't do a good enough job at from a standpoint of society is to expose those individuals because reality is that there're more than you think of.
Speaker 1: Than are given exposure right.
Speaker 2: There are a lot more than you think of.  The answer is that it's a lot less than it should be but--
Speaker 1: More than you think there is?
Speaker 2: --there's a lot more than you think of and for whatever reason you know there isn't that much exposure given to those individuals, but.
Speaker 1: Is there a club of global African American business corporate businessmen who convene and talk about the issues or how to--
Speaker 2: Well there's something called the Executive Leadership Council, ELC which was based in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  Now it's not a global per se in terms of people lived overseas, but it's fundamentally an organization of African American businesspeople who fundamentally are based here in the United States.  Now some of you have had experiences overseas so it's not a global organization because contingent upon living overseas but it's clearly people who are doing very, very well in business and if you go to D.C. and you go to the annual conference, it's you know it's--and these are only the top tier, it's thousands of people in the room and again is it as many as it should be and the answer is no.  But is it more than people think it is?  The answer is yes.  And, and, and somehow I think that that I think this organization is doing a better job, ELC, of giving people more and more exposure to that but I myself and my travels overseas again part of ELC you realize that that network like anything else is slowly building.  Is it, is it too slow?  Yes.
Speaker 1: But it's building (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But is it building?  The answer is absolutely yes.
Story_ID: 581500
Speaker 1: Why do you think you were recognized with--what was the award?
Speaker 2: The globalization award? It's the Chairman's Award.
Speaker 1: Chairman's Award.  And, Jeffrey, what's Jeffrey's last name?
Speaker 2: Jeff Immelt [Jeffrey R. Immelt].
Speaker 1: Immelt. Why do you think you were recognized for?
Speaker 2: I think if you have a day's performance you know we have the best global performance in terms of global growth that year in, in GE [General Electric] and numbers don't lie you know.
Speaker 1: Tell me the numbers?  Do you remember what they were?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the numbers but I think that we, we--that year in China if I recall, we became the largest GE business in China--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --that year.  In Plastics [General Electric Plastics] we were well over a billion dollars in sales in, in Asia alone.
Speaker 1: But you go to Shanghai [China], it's, is it everything's under construction?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but this is not just China, this is everything in Asia.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Over a billion dollars and, and yeah it's funny because I always tell folks that when you live in America and you tell people you run a billion dollar business, they look at you like okay that's fine, but, you know there're a lot companies that are a hundred billion or 50 billion.  When you're in Asia you run a billion dollar company it's huge.  It's huge.
Speaker 1: So what were your strategies in Asia?
Speaker 2: My strategy in Asia was very simple, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You had a three prong strategy huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I, I, I had--I talked to folks it was, it was a three Ps, is what I talked about.  It was people, people, product and pole.
Speaker 1: What is the last one?
Speaker 2: The pole in terms of the, the Pacific pole and what well I tell folks was we have a product with plastics you can put it anywhere you can imagine and that's our job as to imagine that, imagine the possibilities of, of where plastics can go.  I talked about the fact that we're blessed by the fact that we've got Asia, the pole, Pacific pole and the fact that it's one of the fastest growing areas in the world and I talked about the fact that we have the people and the diversity of the people, as well as motivation of those people and we spent time on a three Ps, it was a three Ps strategy everywhere we went and one of the things that was you know going back to the beginning we talked earlier about building upon things you know one of, one of the challenges that we talked about earlier was adapting to cultures and you know figuring out a way to exist in multiple worlds.  And when you're successful at doing that you go to Asia and people think of Asia as one.  It isn't one.  Chinese are very different from Japanese and they're very different than Koreans and they're very different than Singaporeans and so on and so forth and different than Indians all with their unique strengths and their unique weaknesses no different than any other culture.  But when you become a product of having to deal with different cultures and navigate different cultures very successfully and you're now thrust in a leadership role where you got all the different cultures that are different than you, it's so much easier to navigate because you've gone through it and that's the people dimension, that whole thing was I loved all the different cultures that we had that I was responsible for.  I love the fact I could pick the telephone one morning and talk to somebody in Japan and the next time I'm talking to somebody from Korea, next time I'm talking to somebody from China and then on, and on, and on.  And all with their different unique ways of doing business and, and, and, and, and you don't look at it as a weakness and, and you learn very quickly that if you tell everybody to do the job exactly the same by definition, you're killing them because they think differently and they act differently and they get motivated as differently.
Story_ID: 581501
Speaker 1: So when you--I wanna talk about a couple more things before we wrap up.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You chose to work, do some charity work for the--is it the American West Indian?
Speaker 2: Well, there, there, there're several things I've been involved--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --I've been involved in the American Foundation for the University of the West Indies [New York, New York].  I've also been very involved in the Special Olympics New York.
Speaker 1: Why the Special Olympics New York?
Speaker 2: You know I--it goes back to what I said earlier that that story about my, my English teacher you know that frail teacher and seeing people who have so much going against them and seeing them strive to be better.  And trying to find a way to survive and, and, and, and, and, and, and make a difference so it's you know you truly realize how blessed you are.  You know when you cut through all of the noise and all that kind of stuff you know.  What I do, what you do for a living you know we're lucky, you know we're blessed.  Yeah seeing somebody who is a Special Olympics person and the challenges that they have each and every day to do basic things and find a way to survive those are real challenges.  That's you know that's real stress you know.  The people used to always ask me questions. Well when I was in Asia, I used to get that question a lot, "So Wayne [HistoryMaker Wayne M. Hewett] how do you deal with stress?  You know you're a high powered executive, how do you deal with stress?"  I just say, "Guys, you know what stress is? You know, stress is not knowing how you're gonna pay for dinner tonight.  That's real stress.  You know stress is not knowing how you're gonna pay for clothes for your kid.  I don't have stress."
Story_ID: 581502
Speaker 1: (Cough) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Explain to me what--we didn't talk about Lloyd [HistoryMaker Lloyd G. Trotter] at all.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: When did Lloyd take over?
Speaker 1: Well when did he take over?  Lloyd is now a vice chairman.
Speaker 2: He's the vice chairman?
Speaker 1: Of GE [General Electric].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He took over vice chairman of GE--
Speaker 2: From?
Speaker 1: --last summer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When Dave Calhoun left to go run VNU [VNU Group B.V.; Nielsen Company] private equity company.
Speaker 2: Now did you have a relationship with Lloyd?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lloyd has been a mentor of mine for many years.
Speaker 2: Now when did he come on as a mentor of yours?
Speaker 1: Well again Lloyd is the pioneer.  And we're talking about breaking ground, it is Lloyd.  You know, Lloyd is--you talking about my firsts, quite honest my firsts pale in comparison to, to Lloyd's firsts.  Lloyd is the first African American officer, the first African American business leader, the first African American CEO, first African American vice chairman just to name a few all within GE.  And I've know of Lloyd since really it's through AAF.  Okay one of the things AAF does is it gives you exposure to who's doing well and--
Speaker 2: And AAF is?
Speaker 1: The African American Forum, the GE African American Forum and so I've known Lloyd--I'm trying to think when I really started to know him well probably ten years ago.
Speaker 2: But how do you, how do you nudge your way into him becoming a mentor?
Speaker 1: You know I--one of the things I always tell folks is that people like to mentor people who are being successful 'cause it's easy.  You know when you come to me you tell me about the fifty things that are wrong and you ask me to mentor you, you're now creating a lot of work for me.  And if I'm now doing your job it's hard for me to do my job.  Now if you're doing nine things right and you need help in one thing, I--it's easy to be a mentor because I can get you over that next hurdle.
Speaker 2: What hurdles did he help you overcome?
Speaker 1: I think well, I think he, he helped me, he helped me understand how things are perceived at higher levels.
Speaker 2: And how are things perceived at higher levels?
Speaker 1: At the end of the day just the results that counts.  It's, it's, it's who cares about the pitch.
Speaker 2: It's just whether or not you get the business.
Speaker 1: It's, it's, it's all in the numbers.  It's you can have the best story in the world, who cares.
Speaker 2: But then that breaks down the whole idea of this old boys network or this old boys club.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, but you know what there are a lot of people have great numbers.  There are a lot of people have great numbers because with a company this size by definition--
Speaker 2: A lot of people are gonna have great numbers.
Speaker 1: --you have to have a lot of people have great numbers.
Speaker 2: So then it becomes important to have what?
Speaker 1: Well I think after, after you have the numbers then I think it comes down to a couple of things: a) when you're given unique opportunities taking full advantage of those like you really, really tough businesses, the stress business and so forth, secondly I think relationships and networks help.  And Lloyd has clearly helped me from a standpoint of, of, of networking.
Speaker 2: So he helps to put you in the right place at the right time or how--
Speaker 1: Well, I think, I think I'll give my perspective.  When I'm looking to fill an important job or whatever that job is, I call other people I trust and I say here's a job I'm filling.  Who do you know?  Whatever that trust network I have, being it black or white, male, female you name it, I have an established trust network that I call.  And if when I call that trust network saying I need a job, I need this person, so I need a person for a job, they throw me a name out.  That name gets ten stars next to it.  And any other name that comes up doesn't get ten starts.  So if I can go back to Lloyd, by Lloyd being where he is and being part of a trust network of other people more senior than myself, if he throws my name out, it helps.
Speaker 2: Ten stars?
Speaker 1: Whatever the number of stars are.
Speaker 2: Whatever the number of stars you get those stars.
Speaker 1: I get the stars because they go with Lloyd because the view is Lloyd won't throw my name out unless he's willing to vouch for me.
Speaker 2: And put his reputation behind it.
Speaker 1: 'Cause if somebody hires me and I turn out to be a schmuck--
Speaker 2: They're going to Lloyd.
Speaker 1: --they're going, they're going to--obviously I'll get fired but you know what they're gonna think long and hard before they ask Lloyd again.
Story_ID: 581503
Speaker 1: What about Art [HistoryMaker Arthur H. Harper]?
Speaker 2: Art's another one of my--Art's like my big brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is Art's job?
Speaker 2: Art, Art, Art Harper is my, the big brother I never had.
Speaker 1: What is his job at GE [General Electric]?
Speaker 2: (Cough) Well he was, he left GE (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How long ago did he leave?
Speaker 2: He left a year ago but he was, he was, he was a senior vice president so he was the second senior vice president African American in GE after Lloyd [HistoryMaker Lloyd G. Trotter] and he was running CEO of GE Equipment Services [General Electric Equipment Services] but he is the big brother I never had.
Story_ID: 581504
Speaker 1: Now is there a, is there a leadership style difference between white corporate Americans and black corporate Americans?  I know I'm asking you to be general but.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah again I hate generalization because I look and I say Art's [HistoryMaker Arthur H. Harper] style and Lloyd's [HistoryMaker Lloyd G. Trotter] style and my style (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are totally different.
Speaker 2: --are, are very different.
Speaker 1: Well what would be the common thread?
Speaker 2: (Cough) I think that, I think that one of the things that we always kid ourselves about is that we seem to get the tougher jobs.  You know when, when you, when you, when you take a look at any corporate, any corporation, there're jobs that have different degrees of difficulty.
Speaker 1: So you know your old saying like in the old segregated days your mom would tell you you have to be twice as good and twice as this and you know--to compete.
Speaker 2: We, we, we, we always say that we get we don't know if we're twice as good, but I think what we always say is that we seem to get higher degrees of difficulty jobs and well the good news is you learn a lot more and the more successful you are at those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The higher your rise?
Speaker 2: --then, then, then a) you get a lot more confident which is a great thing.  Nobody can ever really take that away from you.
Speaker 1: So--
Story_ID: 581505
Speaker 1: Do you feel the grooming you've had leads you towards becoming CEO of--well you're doing your own--just talk to me about what you're doing now?
Speaker 2: Well right now, right now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You are the CEO and president of?
Speaker 2: Of Momentive Performance Material [Momentive Performance Materials, Inc.] which is a standalone entity just acquired by a private equity company sold to the embassy.
Speaker 1: So they groomed you for that is what I should have said?
Speaker 2: GE [General Electric]?
Speaker 1: GE groomed you to become the CEO?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would say, I would say that they've given me the tools and the confidence to be successful in my role.  Now there're new skills I have to learn to be a CEO which I've been on the job now for a month so we're, we're, we got a lot of work to still learn.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Well how did they, what happened?  Why did Momentive--tell me what that is and what relationship did they have with GE?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well we were GE Advanced Materials [General Electric Advanced Materials] which is the second largest silicone producer in the world.
Speaker 1: And okay.
Speaker 2: And round number is $2.5 billion of sales.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of sales.
Speaker 2: And you know we were sold to Apollo [Apollo Global Management, LLC] a private equity company and we are now owned--
Speaker 1: And who's Apollo?
Speaker 2: It's a private--one of the leading private equity companies in the world and so we're now privately held actually 90 percent held by Apollo, ten percent by GE.
Speaker 1: Now why would GE sell off that particular end of their business?
Speaker 2: I think it has to do with growth projections. GE has talked about growing industries that--8 percent.  This is an industry that wants to grow 5 to 6 percent.  So by definition, the industry growth is not as high as GE stated goal of up growth.  So.
Speaker 1: How did you get the job, were you always being considered or were you?
Speaker 2: I was, I was--
Speaker 1: You were Momentive?
Speaker 2: --well I was the CEO of GE Advanced Materials so when I say got the job I guess Apollo had the choice not to take me--
Speaker 1: But they took you.
Speaker 2: Yeah and you have to ask them why they decided to take me but they you know their view was I was the right guy at the right time for this job and my job is to make sure that that was the right call on their part.
Speaker 1: And so now you sit in this position that Jack [Jack Welch] has sat in?
Speaker 2: Correct, much smaller scale but.
Speaker 1: But still it's the same position.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Anything he's taught you to prepare you for this?
Speaker 2: Again I think that it's all about focus.  You know well one of the things that I'm learning is when you're the CEO everything crosses your plate.
Speaker 1: Everything?
Speaker 2: Everything from the most minute thing to the most strategic thing.  And one of the things which I'm learning is, is it's even more important to stay focused.
Story_ID: 581506
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who can you call when you're in a bind?
Speaker 2: I can call Lloyd [HistoryMaker Lloyd G. Trotter].
Speaker 1: You can call Lloyd.
Speaker 2: There's a guy that I call over at Chemtura [Chemtura Corporation].
Speaker 1: Is he a CEO as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's a CEO of Chemtura.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Bob Wood [Robert Wood].
Speaker 1: I mean I guess I should ask who can you call that's African American?
Speaker 2: That's who I call.  He is.
Speaker 1: Okay he is also.
Speaker 2: He is, he is.  I call Bob Wood, the CEO of Chemtura.
Speaker 1: And what could you ask Bob that you wouldn't necessarily feel comfortable asking a white CEO?
Speaker 2: Well I think, I think it has to do with relationships and perceptions.  You know it's, it's, it's for example, if I was gonna make diversity a big focus, I'd probably wanna talk about that with someone like Bob first you know.  Is this the right time to do that, as an example.  If, if, if I was really, really--wait let me back up, (cough) the--part of the challenge that you have I think when you become a CEO is credibility and you know right now I don't have a lot of credibility with my new owners because it's only a month.  He was in that shape and I think one of the questions you have to ask yourself is, is it tougher to get credibility when you're unknown as a black CEO than you get more benefit of the doubt when you are as an unknown when you're a white CEO.  Now I don't answer that question.
Speaker 1: You said you don't want to answer?
Speaker 2: I do not know--
Speaker 1: You do not know.
Speaker 2: --know, the answer to that question but that's a discussion I could have with Bob.
Story_ID: 581507
Speaker 1: You could call Art [HistoryMaker Arthur H. Harper] and have well was it Art or Lloyd [HistoryMaker Lloyd G. Trotter]? You could have--or Bob [Robert Wood].
Speaker 2: Bob.
Speaker 1: You could all Bob and say and have that conversation--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --openly have that conversation--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and let me ask have you ever had a conversation with him like that?
Speaker 2: Well, our relationship is evolving and again I'm just now the CEO so it's, it's--
Speaker 1: But I guess what I'm asking is have you ever had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Something similar I have had with him, but not that subject.
Speaker 1: But I mean and generally speaking I mean a conversation about race with him or any other black CEO?
Speaker 2: Again, I've had a discussion with Lloyd many times, with Art many times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know 'cause we're pretty open--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --about it.  Yeah so the answer is, I've had those conversations with senior people many times.
Speaker 1: Well collectively how do you feel and I'm talking about all of you, how do you feel about the progress that's been made or what do you think needs to be done to bring other, to groom other people to take your place when you have moved on to something else?
Speaker 2: Well again, I think it goes back to what I said earlier. I think that we would all agree that there has been progress but the progress has not been as fast as we would like it to be.
Speaker 1: What can you do to ensure that more happens?
Speaker 2: Well I think there are a lot of things that we can do.  I think that the first thing that we can do is be even more visible.  The more visible we are by the definition, the more people see us, and then gets--we love things like this because it's a way to spread the word and show visibility to people of all levels that hey there is a future out there.  I think we gotta be giving back.  We've got to be out there mentoring and developing relationships and figuring out who the next Lloyds and the next Arts of the world are and the next Bob Woods of the world are and what do we do to pull forward.  You know it was funny I was just talking to Carl Mack recently who is the head of NSBE [National Society of Black Engineers] and, and one of the things that he mentioned which I was shocked at he said to me, "There's never been a black CEO present at the National Society of Black Engineers," and we had lunch and he told me this.  And I said, "You gotta be kidding me."  And he said, "Yeah in the history of the NSBE there's never been a black CEO that ever presented at the NSBE."  And I said, "Okay fine.  Guess what, sign me up."
Speaker 1: How can that be though?
Speaker 2: You have to ask Carl.  But I'm just giving you data.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: You know I was shocked, I was astounded when I heard that but to me those are things that you can give back to because again you have an opportunity to touch a lot of different people and give them hope and show them that hey there is a path forward and so on and so forth, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What do--
Story_ID: 581508
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What do you teach your children about the world that they live in?
Speaker 1: You know I think--
Speaker 2: I mean you grew up in, you grew up in a different position.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: I've never ever been to a place where as black people were the majority.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: You grew up in that place.
Speaker 1: I did.
Speaker 2: What do you teach them about?
Speaker 1: Again the only thing I can teach them and I, I force them to travel with us, is I teach them that hey life ain't perfect okay you are black.  Nothing they can do about that.  But at the same time, it's incumbent upon you to understand that it's all about individuals and treat people as individuals and I don't want you to ever assume that someone is something because of the way they look.  People will assume that of you but it's also of you to prove them wrong and you have to prove them wrong.  You know but hey I don't wanna see any of my kids around saying well someone is always this way.  Who care what they look like?  You gotta get deeper and deeper and deeper.
Speaker 2: Let me ask you this and I'm kind of trailing off, but I wanna know.  Do you accept the use of the N word from your children as (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They, they don't use it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I mean as a part of the culture?
Speaker 1: That's, that's not part of my culture.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not part of my culture, I don't use it.  If somebody uses it around me, I let them know it's not appropriate behavior.
Speaker 2: How do you allow them to dress?
Speaker 1: My kids?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well my wife [Simonne McDonald Hewett] and I fight over that all the time.  'Cause she believes that they're teenagers or soon to be teenagers and there's the kind of a teenager kind of a dress that needs to happen.  You know my view is hey I'll never forget.  A friend of mine this Indian guy, he told me he taught me this story.  You know we were--I don't obviously dress badly but when I go on the plane I don't necessarily dress up.  He would dress up to go on every plane ride.  And I was like his name was Vigia [ph.] and I said, "Vigia why are you dressing up?" He's like, "I get treated better."  And I thought about it for a second.  I was like he's right.  He said, "I--as Indian when I dress up I get treated better when I go on an airplane then when I don't dress up." And like you can't tell your kids exactly how to dress, but you got to reinforce different things you know and what I do with my kids is you know they see how I dress you know.  They see how I carry myself.  They also understand that they have more than a lot of other people and they got to put that in perspective and we made that very clear that we're fortunate and this is not an entitlement and this could easily disappear for you if you don't do well in school and all that stuff, but we have all those debates you know.  They're like yeah, yeah, we're sick and tired of the fact that that you're telling us that we are black and we are different and all that stuff (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do you let them listen to hip hop music?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They listen to hip hop.  My wife and I have a rule though which is--obviously they sneak it in and we know that but they can listen to the music however, we refrain from you know videos with scantily clad women and abuse and all that kind of stuff so so be it MTV Jams [BET Jams] or be it BET [Black Entertainment Television] or whatever (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, so--
Story_ID: 581509
Speaker 1: Well I mean, what are your hopes I should start with for the African American community and that's why I talked about your children so much?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: What are--what do you hope for us thirty years from now, fifty years.
Speaker 2: I, I, I, I, I--my, my only hope (cough) is to--for us to--there's really two opposing hopes.  One I think that we all have to recognize that differences are good.  And I think too often we try to become one.  And we assume everyone has to be alike.  I mean I truly believe that differences are good.  And the more different we can be by the definition the less stereotypical we are gonna be.  On the other side I do think that in spite of our differences in a way to actually simulate and highlight their differences we have to find ways to come together and help each other out more.  But you know, hey, something we haven't talked about, Clarence Thomas.
Speaker 1: Clarence Thomas, yeah.  What do you think about him?
Speaker 2: There are views that he has that I obviously disagree with.  However I love the fact there is a black person, a black man who can have his views and still be black because when a white person looks at me I want them to not say Wayne [HistoryMaker Wayne M. Hewett] is like that.  I want them to say I don't know if Wayne is like Clarence Thomas or if he is like Al Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton] or if he is like Ba--
Speaker 1: Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].
Speaker 2: --Barack Obama or Harold Ford. Those are four different personalities.
Speaker 1: But why is it that you think that Clarence Thomas stands out he seems so vastly different from other people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But to me, to me again, it's not for me to say right or wrong.
Speaker 1: Right or wrong.
Speaker 2: It's just talk about the fact that for me--
Speaker 1: There's a scale--
Speaker 2: --there's a spectrum and we can fall anywhere because all I ask for if you ask me my dream--
Speaker 1: Well do you know Clarence Thomas?
Speaker 2: I don't know him, never met him, so I--
Speaker 1: Because I'd love to, we loved to have him as a HistoryMaker.
Speaker 2: I don't know, I, I, don't know the man okay but I step back and I said and I look and I say all I ever ask for for our communities, our people is that we get treated as individuals.
Story_ID: 581510
Speaker 1: So do you feel more now black than you do Jamaican or it's the same thing?
Speaker 2: To me I can't differentiate.  I, 'cause I get this question asked a lot.  I, I, I and people who know that background of me and they say I don't know how do you even answer that question because the reality is I am black and you know what? I've been in this country for--in December of this year it will be thirty years.  I lived more in this country than I lived in Jamaica.  My experiences are of this country.  My experiences are black.  My experiences are African American.  I'm just as much an African American as you are and anybody else.
Story_ID: 581511
Speaker 1: Well I have one more question 'cause we have one minute left (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Go ahead. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
Speaker 1: And what is it you want to do next?
Speaker 2: What I wanna do next?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think, I think that--
Speaker 1: Because you're still so young (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm still young I think, I think, I think, yeah I think--
Speaker 1: I'm not even worrying about your legacy I wanna know what you still want to do that you haven't?
Speaker 2: Well I think that well I'm very focused on the moment at hand that's kind of where I am.  And my hands are full right now with this transition to a real CEO as opposed to a CEO of a division of GE [General Electric] now be my own style and CEO so I think that my hands are very, very full and I'm just trying to be a very, very successful standalone CEO and I think that you know being successful there will open up doors.  You know one of the things that is great about GE but also in some, some, some regards bad about GE is you become so focused on GE that you forget about the larger world.  Now I'm outside GE and I'm getting exposure to the larger world.
Speaker 1: Is it tougher, the larger world?
Speaker 2: I think it's tougher, but I think there's some advantages as well.  But, but when I say the larger world, it's not so much from a standpoint as toughness--I'm just saying--
Speaker 1: But a larger corporate environment?
Speaker 2: But just larger world period--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I think that, that, that there's a lot of things that I can do. Who knows, does it mean that you sit on boards, does it mean that you get more involved in charitable organizations, does it mean that you do something in universities?
Speaker 1: But you're only forty-two and you have so much time to think about.
Speaker 2: Exactly, but my only point is that I'm getting exposed now to this larger world outside of GE and I think that as I get down that and I get more and more insight into that, there're gonna be different things that I never thought are possible, that I would be very, very open to.  I--you know I look at what, I look at what Art Harper [HistoryMaker Arthur H. Harper] is doing today you know, you know private equity, and the way that touches so many different parts of business and you step back and you say, that has some, some attraction to it.  At the same time, you know being a CEO of a large corporation has its attractions and seeing how big can you make that you know instead of a two and a half can you make it five, can you make it ten billion [dollars] and how do you grow that?  So anyway I think I look at it and I say that my best years are still ahead.
Speaker 1: I agree.
Speaker 2: There's, there's no one thing that I say I have to go do this before I die.
Speaker 1: Well I look forward to seeing where you end up, to see what keeps evolving for you.
Speaker 2: And, and, it's, it's, it's been an evolution but I'll tell you that--
Speaker 1: And both your parents [Lorna James Hewett and Audley Hewett] are still alive?
Speaker 2: Just, just saw them over, over the, over the holiday and not only are they alive but their health is good, that's even better.
Speaker 1: Good, good.
Speaker 2: So but hey, you know I, I--they made me who I am and I'm thankful for that.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Shawn [Shawn Wilson].
Speaker 1: It's been awesome.
Speaker 2: Hopefully that was helpful.
