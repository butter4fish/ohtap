Speaker 2: No,--
Speaker 1: --Civil War [1861-1865].
Speaker 2: --I can back to my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: His name was Jack Glover. I'm sorry, Jack Glover was his name.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, what did your grandfather do in your, your?
Speaker 2: He was a entrepreneur.  He owned a lot of land that were left to him by his mother in which he had timber and oil on and this was his, as far back as I can remember, his job was maintaining that property, one hundred and ninety-two and one half acres of land.
Speaker 1: So he was fairly well off then?
Speaker 2: Yes he was.
Speaker 1: With that kind of a--
Speaker 2: He was well off.  There's a story behind that because most of it was taken from him and that's why we're having the time we are having today trying to get some of that property--that so well deserved--to us.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was gonna ask how he managed to keep it in Arkansas in those days?--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --So they actually took--
Speaker 2: --Well back then he, he lost his mind. He signed some papers, unbeknownst of the family. Therefore they had s--the mineral rights were taken from him. He only got a percentage of the mineral rights which was oil and timber.
Speaker 1: So he signed over the mineral rights to the property?  I would suppose--
Speaker 2: To, to--
Speaker 1: --To some--
Speaker 2: --To oil--
Speaker 1: --White people.
Speaker 2: --Companies claiming--
Speaker 1: --Some white people--
Speaker 2: --Right.
Speaker 1: --Was that what you're saying?
Speaker 2: We never--
Speaker 1: --Business people who--
Speaker 2: --Knew how long he gave them that right because later on when my--our parents passed away, we had to sign papers giving, still giving them rights for the mineral rights.  Right now it's in court.  My sister is the curator of the, of she's the one in charge of all of this and, but our land and our mineral rights have been taken, taken from us mostly by the things that happened back when my grandfather signed some papers that he didn't even realize what he was doing.
Speaker 1: So, it's, from what you were saying, if I g--have this straight, that he, the family thinks he didn't have his right mind when he signed 'em or?
Speaker 2: We--right, they know he didn't, cause they were not aware that he had signed this. He, he, u--he was, he was put in the hospital later on, but apparently he signed these papers during the time when he was really sick because they had no prior knowledge of it until it was, they were confronted with it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, and so this is like back when would you, would you say this--th--th--this took place?
Speaker 2: This was back in the early '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 128262
Speaker 1: That's quite a story that--is there a story about how he acquired the land in the first place?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was handed down to us that his [Biddle's grandfather, Jack Glover] mother was white, his dad was full Cherok--Cherokee Indian, and his dad was taken from the family by five white men and never returned.  His mother raised him and his brother and she bought land for twenty-five cent a yard--
Speaker 1: Acre.
Speaker 2: --Acre.
Speaker 1: Okay, now let me go back to that for a minute.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You said you, your, his, his father was black and Cherokee, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes his father was black and Cherokee.
Speaker 1: And the mother was white?
Speaker 2: Was white, right.
Speaker 1: And some white men came and took him?--
Speaker 2: Took him for something--
Speaker 1: This would--
Speaker 2: This was handed--
Speaker 1: --Be your great--
Speaker 2: --Down to us--
Speaker 1: --Grandfather?
Speaker 2: --From his daughter who was the oldest daughter that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --He told her what happened.
Speaker 1: So this would be your great grandfather right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And some whites came by and took him and they were--
Speaker 2: No, this wouldn't be my great grandfather.
Speaker 1: Wouldn't be?
Speaker 2: This my grandfather, my mother's father.

Speaker 2: When you get on my gra--dad's side, I've got some great--I have a great grandfather--

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm talking about Jack Glover, no, no,--
Speaker 1: No?

Speaker 2: G-R-A-N-D-S-O-N, Grana--son--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Grandson.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright now we got it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's the great-grandfather and he was--
Speaker 2: Grandson Glover.
Speaker 1: --Taken, I, I take it that--now because this is history, we have to make sure that things are clear 'cause people try to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Distort history sometimes.
Speaker 2: --They try to restor--
Speaker 1: --And so, no, no, I'm and so I'm asking--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I, I said that--
Speaker 2: --I.
Speaker 1: --In, in preparation for this question, were the people that came to get him friends of his or were they trying to hurt him?
Speaker 2: No, they was, they--okay let me give you what was handed down to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let me change that Grandson, because I don't remember his real name.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: All I know his mother was married to him and her husband was taken away--was taken away by five white men and never returned.
Speaker 1: And they took him, they didn't--
Speaker 2: They took him away.
Speaker 1: --They didn't just invite him--
Speaker 2: --He followed them down,--
Speaker 1: --They took him.
Speaker 2: --They were walking down--the last time she saw them was walking down this road.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what his mother told her grand kids.
Speaker 1: Now, did she suspect that they hurt him?--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Or did something to him?
Speaker 2: She suspected they, they hurt him.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: He never returned.  She raised her two boys and she bought adjacent land to their farm that they had already obtained at five--twenty-five dollars an acre.
Speaker 1: An--and this is how they acquired the one hundred ninety-five and a half acres?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, all right, so that's, that's quite a story.  So th--this goes all the way back I guess, to the, your great grandfather's story, that would take him back to the 1880s or something--
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 128263
Speaker 1: So any other stories on your mother's [Percilla Glover Biddle's] side of the family?--

Speaker 1: Historical stories?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather [Jack Glover] before he died, before he lost his mind, left word with his oldest daughter that if anything happened to him, his part of this royalties that he get from the estate would go to my mother. It never happened.
Speaker 1: So who kept those part--that part?
Speaker 2: It stayed in the family.  It stayed with the four daughters and one son. The daughters only revealed this to my mother just before she died.  My mother died real young, forty-six years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This were revealed to her by her sisters that this was supposed to happen. It never did.  My sister who's in charge of it now was put--was put in charge of the whole estate by this sister before she died, but everything was so messed up until my sister right now is fighting it in court and it'll probably never be straightened out because of those papers he signed.

My grandfather's mother was black and the father was white. That's as far back as I can go and they obtained a lot of land too back in those days. They had a lot of timber and stuff on the land. They was well to do.  I guess you can say that as far as I can tell they were well to do to the point that wh--when my grandfather died, he had no formal education, my, my grandfather, my great grandfather had no formal education, my grandfather had no formal education, but his niece, his brother's niece did have an education. Sh--Ella was her name.

She had no formal education. She was sweet talked by some people that wanted that land and she sold us out for his mineral rights.
Speaker 1: And her, her last name--
Speaker 2: She and her--
Speaker 1: --Was Dansby?

Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess it was a small place--
Speaker 2: Yeah, small.
Speaker 1: --They ran into each other--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It would be hard not to meet.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --It just, everybody was, you know family and everybody knew each other and so, how he got that young woman I, we talk about that now, my brothers and I about that (laughter), but he was eleven years older than ma, mamma, my mother,--
Speaker 1: That's not as bad--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --As some,--
Speaker 2: That's not as bad--
Speaker 1: --I've heard stories,
Speaker 2: --as some.
Speaker 1: Yeah, eleven's not that bad.
Speaker 2: Matter of fact, my first wife and I was the same age. She was a month older than I was, but then the next wife I had was eleven years--nineteen years younger than me and then the next wife was eighteen years younger than me and then I had a, a Samsonite wedding.  You know what a Samsonite wedding is--
Speaker 1: A Samsonite we--

Speaker 2: They all went too--oh, they went to the Church of God in Christ.  They all went to the Church of God in Christ.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --That's where my dad apparently met her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 128267
Speaker 1: All right.  Now when you think about your parents' personalities and their talents and their dispositions, who do you think that you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I take after both of them and I say that because my mother [Percilla Glover Biddle] was a fighter.  She was the one that she would go to the end.  My dad [Dezzie Biddle] was more or less the disciplining one. He would look at the situation, study it and then make a decision, but my mother would get on something. If it was something she knew, she stayed with it until the end and that's the way I am today.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have brothers and sister?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.
Speaker 1: How many?

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then we had Denver Biddle who have since passed away. Then my--then Bobby Biddle and my sister's was named was Mary Biddle. Mary was named after my--Spencer's wife was named Mary.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather's wife was--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--All right.
Speaker 2: --named Mary.
Story_ID: 128268
Speaker 1: Now what's--do you have an earliest childhood memory in the family?
Speaker 2: I was always active, I know that.  I could run faster than any of them. I was the only athe--well first athlete in the family then my younger brother became on to play football. We all were, grew up in a very religious family. We was at church most of the time, as I, as I, as being youngsters.

Speaker 2: It was a--
Speaker 1: --Did you like it?

Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a--
Speaker 1: --Of God in Christ [Magnolia, Arkansas].
Speaker 2: --First church orchestra was a--I was a drummer of the first church orchestra and I, I, I said it because this is a part of history.  There was no such thing as instruments, orchestras, bands I should say in church at that time and we organized a band called Austin Christian band at the Church of God in Christ in Magnolia, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there's a five, five member band. I was a drummer, my oldest brother Charles, he was a trumpet player, then I had a cousin who was the saxophone player, my daddie's sister's kid and then two kids came from other areas.  But that was the first church orchestra and we traveled, we traveled and played at different churches and it wasn't long after that before you start seeing church orchestras.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this was back in the f--early '40s [1940s], '40s [1940s], late '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Late '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: So, so the church provided a lot of things for people to do--
Speaker 2: Right, back then yes.
Speaker 1: --Back then is what you're saying.
Speaker 2: Yes, it really did.
Speaker 1: So d--what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights, well sights as I can remember was a drive-in theater (laughter) that was, I used to sneak away from church and go watch the drive-in movie.  I was intrigued by Tarzan and Cheeta at that time. As a matter of fact, my--one of my punishments, biggest punishment I got was from missing church, going to see, see Tarzan, Tarzan and Cheeta back in those days.  I was intrigued by that monkey, (laughter) that monkey.
Speaker 1: So they had a drive-in?  Okay--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --So this is in the '40s [1940s], I guess?
Speaker 2: No, this was--yeah, this was in the late '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Okay, that was a--I've never heard a story about a drive-in before but, since it's in Arkansas, I have to ask you, was the drive-in segregated?
Speaker 2: No. Oh yes, it was segregated.  We couldn't go to the movie. I had to stand outside the fence and look at it.
Speaker 1: Okay, I wondered.
Speaker 2: I couldn't hear it but I could see it. I knew what was going on.
Speaker 1: So if you, if you had a car even?
Speaker 2: If you, no, if I had a car I couldn't go.
Speaker 1: You couldn't go.
Speaker 2: Back then.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right--
Story_ID: 128270
Speaker 1: I grew up in a segregated city [Magnolia, Arkansas]. I mean, I went to a segregated school. Black and whites did not go to school together.  And I talk about this in my autobiography, about my first baseball glove was--came from the white school and, and everything we had came from that school. All the books was hand me downs from the white school.  This is typical southern city in the South at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay, and so when they would get finished with them--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well we--
Speaker 2: You used what was left.
Speaker 1: --They would progress on to another and then we would get what was left.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that, that even went for equipment and stuff too?
Speaker 1: That, that went for everything--consisted of school at that ti--during that time.
Speaker 2: So all the equipment, the desk and the chairs and the--
Speaker 1: Everything we had was hand me downs from the other school.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  Now what was the name of your school?
Speaker 1: The school that I went to was Columbia County School [now, Magnolia High School, Magnolia, Arkansas]--high school, we went to grade school, middle school and high school all at one time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All at the same time.
Speaker 2: Well did they call it Columbia County (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Columbia County High School is where I graduated from.
Speaker 2: Okay, high school.  So they didn't call it colored school or?
Speaker 1: Oh no, no, no, no no.
Speaker 2: Okay,
Speaker 1: It was just Columbia County--
Speaker 2: High school, okay.
Speaker 1: High school.
Speaker 2: All right.  Okay, I was asking you about sights and sounds and smells so, we--
Speaker 1: Yeah, sights I gave it to you. Smell, I don't remember much. It was not a, a farm town but not on the farm. It was a little city.
Speaker 2: So you lived in town, you lived at?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we lived in, in, in, in, in the little city, we didn't live out on a farm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But, all right, so we--
Speaker 1: But wait, they--
Speaker 2: --In this, in the town--
Speaker 1: --Didn't do farming in the city, even though there were a few little pastures and so forth and, but farming was done further out of the city limits of Magnolia, Arkansas.
Speaker 2: --So I take it, it was a black side of town and a white side of town?
Speaker 1: It was a white side and a black side, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, and was there something that separated the two?
Speaker 1: Well, uptown separated. We called it uptown.  The little town, the little square, the courthouse was sitting in the middle of the square, goes around the courthouse. We were on the south end of the--we, the black--most of the black people lived on the south end and the white lived on the north end--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Of town.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that's kind of how it was separated--
Speaker 1: Yes, how it was separated.
Speaker 2: Okay, what about smells, anything smell different?  There, there does it smell different than it does in, up here in--
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: --Wisconsin?
Speaker 1: --It, it, it, I didn't never detected the difference of smell other than just the flowers during the summer time. You would get the sunflower smell and, and the, and the tree smell from--it, it, it was a little different in the North 'cause up North you got congestion and down there you had open air so, the smell was different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 128271
Speaker 1: So, well, you like to play sports and, you, you said you were the fastest of the kids in your family--
Speaker 2: Well?
Speaker 1: --And you--
Speaker 2: I grew up during the time when black people did not have the opportunity to progress in sports--true progress in sports. We played stick ball. We couldn't afford a baseball. Even though we knew about baseball, we couldn't afford one so we played with a tennis ball and a broomstick.  And I often said, if you learn to hit a tennis ball going a hundred miles an hour with a broomstick, you gonna be a pretty good baseball player. This is how we grew up.  We grew up playing stickball until I got into--this was way before Jackie Robinson now. We already knew there was no way we could play in the major leagues. I always felt that that's what I would like to do, play in the major leagues.  But I knew I didn't have a chance until I, till Jackie opened that door.
Speaker 1: So, when Jackie Robinson came in, you were about ten or eleven, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1946.
Speaker 2: Right, '46 [1946], when Jackie came in and I didn't know anything about Jackie Robinson, I--matter of fact, I didn't know anything about Jackie until word came down that, this black man is playing in the major leagues and I, oh my, now I got a chance to live for, do what I wanna play in the major league.  So, as I can remember back then, I put everything I had into baseball, even though I lettered in four sports in high school. I was a gifted athlete I guess you could say that.  I, I, I, I played baseball, basketball, football and track and I loved baseball. It was something about baseball that intrigued me to, you know, wanna play in the major leagues, even though I was a, a all-star basketball and all-star football player, but I wanted to play baseball.
Speaker 1: Yeah, when those days in baseball had a higher profile nationwide right?--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Than any other sport.
Speaker 2: Well once Jackie opened the door see, as a youngster back in those days, every time, when word got out that Jackie had opened the door, everybody wanted to play baseball.  And, and, and I often talk about this, the schools in the South and most of 'em was segregated, all of 'em was segregated.  Baseball was the lowest sport on the ca--on, on each school because it was too new.  Most of the team didn't have but one or two players that could hit the ball, (laughter), you know, it was just starting then, catching on.  I was very successful during that time 'cause I had been playing years before and I had developed a, a curve ball, I call it a drop and those guys couldn't hit it, (laughter). I would get two strikes on 'em by throwing the drop and strike 'em out, you know, and I was very successful all through high school with that and even when I played professional, with that, we called it a drop, but it, in, in, in--later on they called it a sinker, now it's a split finger and, it all did the same thing.
Speaker 1: So it kinda come at you and then--
Speaker 2: Come up--
Speaker 1: --Just drop.
Speaker 2: --And drop straight down to the ground.  Ninety percent of 'em are balls, but they look so good the batter swing at it before it, you know, get there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so you're playing, pl--played, you like baseball better than the other sports that?
Speaker 2: Well, I loved them all because I, I, I lettered in all four of them.  I was fast in track. Matter fact I was--the hundred yard dash was my specialty and that helped me in the football because I could run real fast in football. I was a good quarterback. I had a good arm. I was recruited by Mr. Eddie Robinson out of high school for football scholarship to Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] and, and, and, and then I was recruited to play basketball, I was all-state basketball player, Arkansas AM & N [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical, and Normal College, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], which is now the University of Arkansas [at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], to play basketball--
Story_ID: 128272
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's [University of] Arkansas at Pine Bluff [Pine Bluff, Arkansas] right?
Speaker 2: --Yeah,--
Speaker 1: That's what it is right.
Speaker 2: --There's a book out and they sent me one of them because they interviewed me about my high school days with Willie Davis and in there, Willie talks about me and him and how, you know, we came involved.  But Willie were recruited at the same time I was at Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Now where was Willie from, he was, he was?
Speaker 2: Texarkana [Arkansas].
Speaker 1: Okay, Texarkana.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the lions, the lion's den, I'll never forget that.  Willie, you kn--they was in a different classification for football than we were, they beat us fifty-five to nothing. I never will forget that game, but Willie he was highly recruited as a football player.  I was kinda disappointed when I graduated from high school because, you know, the, the baseball scouts could not talk to the players. They could only talk to the parents and the family.  Well, the coach had notified my parents [Percilla Glover Biddle and Dezzie Biddle] that the Saint Louis Cardinals was gonna make me their number one draft pick.
Speaker 1: Now this is a--I don't wanna get too far--
Speaker 2: --1953.
Speaker 1: -- Ahead now, but--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay we going too far ahead--
Speaker 1: --Maybe we--
Speaker 2: --I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: --We might be going too fast--
Speaker 2: --Okay.
Speaker 1: --But, I don't know.  Fir--
Speaker 2: --I may be.
Speaker 1: --First thing, let me ask you like, I read that you pitched in the Negro leagues when you were fifteen.
Speaker 2: No.  That's a lie.
Speaker 1: That's a lie?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I was only--
Speaker 1: So how old were you?
Speaker 2: I was seventeen years old.
Speaker 1: You were seventeen. Okay, all right, seventeen--
Speaker 2: My first game, it's in the book.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: The program is in the book and the contract I signed is in my book.
Story_ID: 128273
Speaker 1: Okay so, so when you were in, so you played in high school [Columbia County High School, now Magnolia High School, Magnolia, Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I graduated from high school in nine--in May of 1953.
Speaker 1: Okay May, 1953.  Okay, let, let me ask you this before we leave high school--
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: --Did you, were there any special teachers there or coaches or--
Speaker 2: Yes, there was--
Speaker 1: Mentors--
Speaker 2: --Some special teachers.  I don't know if any--now let's see, I don't even know if any of 'em still living today. It could be a few but there was a special teacher named, we called him Professor Brown. Professor Brown who passed away a few years ago.  But he was the one that was--he was like a counselor, but he, he taught al--agriculture, agriculture, farming and he taught that but he was like a council to, counselor to us younger players, younger guys because he fa--saw something that had possibilities, I believe that.  And that's why he stayed on us, we, we looked up to him. We, we, we, we were involved with him in different things and I'll never forget the things that, that he talked to me about, he also was the coach, assistant coach in basketball and he would always talk to me about getting my college education paid for 'cause he knew my family was poor and couldn't afford to send me to college and he would always talk to me about a scholarship, using my athletic ability to get a college education, that which he had to work hard to get.  He didn't have, he didn't have that opportunity. He would stay on us, especial--especially us athletes about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was very instrumental in my life. There were others too. There was some, my high school teacher, this happened later on after she found out that the Saint Louis Cardinals was gonna make me their number one draft pick during the time I was recruited by Eddie Robinson to play football and also Arkansas AN & M [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical, and Normal College, now University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] to play basketball.  And she came to me and said, "Dennis, get your education first so you'll have something to fall back on if you get injured playing sports."
Speaker 1: Okay, so did--she did, she was--was she urging you to go to--
Speaker 2: Her name was Ms. Adams.  She was a--
Speaker 1: --Collins?
Speaker 2: She was, she wasn't telling me. She was just talking to me about it. She said, "If you, if you, if you, if you took those scholarships and got an education they would still be wanting you."  Th--this is what she was relaying to me.
Speaker 1: So she was trying to advise you to go to college instead?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Of going to baseball, right?
Speaker 2: --She said I would have something to fall back on in case I got hurt.
Speaker 1: 'Cause if you got a, if you were recruited by a baseball team, they wouldn't send you to college, right?  They wouldn't (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, this, that never came up.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But the thought of that never came up but she was telling me I should, since these college was offering me a scholarship, I should take that scholarship and get my education. I would still be able to play sports and if I did get injured in sports I would have something to fall back on.
Speaker 1: Sure.  Okay, all right, I'm just being clear for those who don't know that baseball--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Recruiters don't send you to college--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --You don't--
Speaker 2: --Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --That never came up but that's what she meant.  And, and you know I relived that when I was with the [Chicago] Cubs training camp.
Speaker 1: Well we'll get to that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we'll get to that.
Speaker 1: --I'm just, so were you a good student?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was not a "A" student. I was "C", high "C", mediocre student because I had to really study to get a grade, especially, I had to study very hard because of my sports activity and at home, I had nobody at home later on when I got in high school to help me.  My brother was in college, John.  So I had--my mom and dad couldn't help me--so I had to rely on the teachers, other kids were relying on the teacher also, so my time was limited together.  So I was not a great student.  I, I was, I passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 128274
Speaker 1: So, now so, so in your senior year then, what did you, what did you choose to do?  They, they're trying to, Eddie Robinson's trying to recruit you to Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] and then they're trying to recruit you to--
Speaker 2: Well in high school--
Speaker 1: --Play basketball at A & M [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical, and Normal College, now University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] --
Speaker 2: --My life was pretty well set.  I had a brother in college who was, we was doing everything, sending him everything trying to help him--
Speaker 1: --Where was he?--
Speaker 2: --He was going to Angola College in, in Angola, Indiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --And he was scuffling, trying to make it, matter of fact he m--he would make president of the class. They put it in newspaper, my hometown, that my brother had made president of the student union in Angola, Indiana, and my mother [Percilla Glover Biddle] used to make reference to that.  When it came to me, they wrote about me score--scoring three touchdowns in high school and they wrote about my brother, and to her that was more important than what I was doing but, you know, I, I weathered that.  But, I was, I was thinking, "What should I do?" I knew Jackie [Robinson] had opened the door for blacks to play in the major league, but no major college, no college had offered me a scholarship to play baseball and that's what I wanted to do.  But after talking to momma and people around me, I decided to at least go down to Louisiana and see what it was all about--to visit the college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I did that, and that was when I met Willie [Davis], being recruited also, but I had met him in high school, but he was being recruited also by Eddie Robinson.  And we spent the night together in the dormitory. We talked about old times, but that morning, Mr. Robinson came to me, came to the dormitory and said, "Hey Biddle, I hear you're a pretty good baseball player." And I said, "I love baseball." And he said, "We can't, we can't offer you a scholarship in baseball." He said, "But if baseball is what you love, maybe you should go for it. Jackie Robinson has opened the door." 'Cause he had heard about the [St. Louis] Cardinals was gone draft me too. Nobody knew if they were or not.
Speaker 1: So then you, you hadn't really talked to the Cardinals?
Speaker 2: I, no, Cardinals never did talk to me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --They talked to my coach and, and, see the only way they could talk to me was after they draft me, so I sat by the phone all that day, draft day and they never called my name and my momma, my mother often talked about that time, the look on my face. She said, you know she often talked about the look on my face and I sit there all day long. I was very disappointed, I was very disappointed, and I was, I was getting ready to make my mind up to go to Grambling and I got a phone call that Sunday morning--just getting ready to go to church--from Chicago [Illinois], from a guy named Frank Crawford. Frank had played in the Negro league and he was some kind of executive for the Chicago American Giants.  I didn't know anything about the Negro baseball league [Negro American League], but he asked me, how would I like to play some--they had scouted me, and one of my--I pitched a no hitter for the NF--National Farmers' Association, NFA--that was high as blacks could go and this was in high school. I'd pitched a no hitter in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Somebody from the Negro league had saw me pitch and notified the Chicago American Giants, because they notified me, asked me how would I like to play in a Negro baseball league and I knew nothing about the Negro baseball league.  But when they said, you gone get paid. What?  (Laughter), Get paid?  That's what really made my mind up for not going to Grambling 'cause I had just about made my mind up to take the scholarship to Grambling when they called me.  And I will never forget it. I write about it in my autobiographer, in a book called, 'Voices From the Negro League' by Brent Kelley. I, I talk about that there because that day is when I made my mind up to go to Chicago to play in the Negro baseball league.  I thought they were gonna be coming through my hometown, but they meant for me and I--sometimes I still hear they voice, "Be in Chicago, Tuesday morning, Washington Park, diamond number seven." I still hear that.  And, my ma--we didn't have any money. I didn't know how I was gonna get to Chicago, although I told the man I'll be there.  My momma borrowed the money from som--somewhere, it cost fourteen dollars from Milwaukee to Chicago, I had six dollars left in my pocket.
Speaker 1: From Milwaukee?  You me--mean from, from--
Speaker 2: I mean from Magnolia, Arkansas--
Speaker 1: Yeah, from Magnolia--
Speaker 2: --To Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It cost fourteen dollars.
Story_ID: 128275
Speaker 1: This is like 1950--
Speaker 2: 1953.
Speaker 1: --Three, okay.
Speaker 2: Two weeks outta high school, a week and four days out of high school, I just say two weeks.  But anyway, my mother [Percilla Glover Biddle] borrowed the money and I'll never forget my dad [Dezzie Biddle], all of my life, I never saw him cry, tears was rolling down his face when I told him I was going to Chicago [Illinois], to try out for the Chicago American Giants.  He had re--in return told my grandfather, Spencer [Biddle] who was, who I had to go by his house on my way to the bus station. I had my little bag in my hand and my grandfather started crying and that was the first time I saw him cry.  They begging me, "Please don't go, you don't know, that's a big city, you don't know nobody up there."  But you know, when I think about that time, reminisce back, my mother?  She never cried.  When I got to the bus station that--she hugged me and she said, "Baby, good luck."  And I think about that now sometime, I've shed a few tears. My mother had faith in the Lord or me that I would be okay.  She hugged me and she said, "Baby, good luck."  And I got on that bus and, and it was like, you know, sometimes I run across a poem called 'Footsteps' and that poem was, it was four set--sets of footsteps, but a lot of times during that journey, there was only two sets of footsteps and the moral of that story was, when you saw two foots of steps--two footsteps, that was the Lord carrying me, because that's what happened all the way to Chicago.  I knew nobody, no one but the people that I was supposed to meet at Washington Park. I didn't know how to get to Washington Park. I got to this Greyhound Bus Station. I saw all those people, I saw those, I got my bag and I got up in the lobby of it and I saw these--I call 'em rolling steps--I'd never seen anything like that, 'cause in my hometown, there was nothing higher than two stories.  And here I am, this rolling steps going way--and all these people were getting on there and I'll never forget, I fo--I, I was afraid to get on those steps. I walked up the ss--the other steps, all the way to the top and, and I got outside the door, look like something just pushed me on this bus. There was a bus stop, Randolph [Street] and Clark [Street], that's where the bus station was in Chicago. You can put that down Randolph and Clark, I'll never forget that.  Look like something pushed me on that bus and this bus driver looked at me and I said, "Sir, where is Washington Park?"  He said, "Oh, you a long way from Washington Park. You gotta transfer." I don't even remember how much--I don't think he even charged me. He must have knew, known I was, but he said--he gave me a transfer and he said, "Get off--I'll tell you when to get off." He told me where to get off and I got off and he told me the number of bus and I stood there looking at the numbers and I got on that number bus and that guy took me all the way to Washington Park, so I don't, should I tell you all of this?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: 'Cause it's in my autobiography. I got off the bus on 51st, on 51st street, 51st and, at that time they called it South Parkway, but it was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, now it's King Drive.
Speaker 2: --King Drive now.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I got off on 51st Street and the bus driver said, 'cause I had asked him where was Washington Park, he said, "That's it over there." He says, "It's about thirty-five blocks around." (laughter).  Oh man, I got off, and I didn't know where I was going. I just walked across the street and I walking down the sidewalk on 51st Street and, and there was a gentleman that was sitting on his sun parlor and, you know, I'm from the South, everybody speak to everybody, I was speaking to people, they were looking at me like I was crazy.  And this guy was sitting there and I walked up to him, I said, "Sir where is Washington Park, diamond number seven--diamond number three." It was number three--I'm sorry, diamond three. He said, "Boy that's Washington Park over there, but you have to go over there to find out where the diamonds at."  I said, "Could I leave my bag here with you?"  And he said, "Yeah."  I said, "I got a try-out with the team this morning over there."  I left my bag and I walked across the street into the entrance of the park, walked through some hedges and there was diamond number three.
Story_ID: 128276
Speaker 1: Diamond number three [Washington Park, Chicago, Illinois], okay.
Speaker 2: So I, I, I went over there and I sit down. It was a little bench over there. I sit down 'cause nobody was there but me. I was supposed to been there at eleven o'clock.  So finally one guy came and me and him started throwing the ball at each other, his name was Clyde McNeil. He was a--later on I, I, I learned a lot about him, but he was a--had been to the minor leagues and had left. He told me, he said they treated him like a dog down there where he was at, say he wasn't gonna take all that pressure. He came back to the Chicago American Giants. This was 1953 now.  And so, pretty soon another guy came and then anoth--van--Dick Vance came, a old--older guy he was a catcher and then [HM Ted] "Double Duty" Radcliffe came and it were about fifteen of 'em and there we were.  So, they had me pitching batting practice to the guys and I were very impressive I guess because they had a contract already typed out for me to sign. Craw--Mr. Crawford had the contract and so he said, "We got a room for you on 47th [Street] and South Parkway." Say, "Where's your bag?"  I said, "Oh, it's across the street over there." He said, "Where?"  I said, "Cross the streets," and I noticed he looking at me awful funny, so I said, "I'll show you," and we went across the street and then all them houses look alike, you know?  And, and, and I was walking across the street and this lady said, "Are you the young man that left your bag here?"  Out of the clear blue sky, she just asked me that and I said, "Yeah." She said, "Well Mr. Washington"--that was his name-"he had to go to work so he said you'd be back for it." I said, "Oh ma'am, thank you." I said, "Could I have his telephone number?"  And she gave me his telephone number, so I went up to the little room they had for me on 47th and South Parkway, and it was the worst night of my life, I can remember.  As a seventeen year old, in this big city of Chicago [Illinois], didn't know no one and all night long, I could hear people walking and talking. I could hear sirens and, you know, I, I grew up in a little town man, lights out at eight o'clock, you ain't seen nothing, heard, hear nothing but crickets.  But here I am with all these sirens going all night long. Oh, I didn't sleep at all. I had that number sitting on that little, little table in the room and I couldn't wait 'til that morning. Telephone call was a dime. I walked across 47th at the corner and put my dime in, in the thing and he answered the phone.  He said, "Where are you?"  I said, "I'm the gentle--young man that left his bag with you." He said, "Where are you?"  I said, "I'm on 47th." I looked, 47th and South Park. He said, "You stay right there. I'll be right there."  He came, he picked me up, took me to his house. He lived on 51st and South Parkway, I mean 51st and, and, Champagne [sic, Champlain Ave]. He took me to his house and you know?  Twenty-eight years later, I buried him.  The Lord put him in my life that day. I became his son. When I got married, my wife was his daughter, my children was his grandchildren. Twenty-eight years later, I buried him.
Speaker 1: What was his first name?
Speaker 2: His name was McKinley Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay, McKinley Washington.  And where, you were living--
Speaker 2: He stayed at 620 East 51st Street in Chicago, Illinois.
Story_ID: 128277
Speaker 1: --Yeah, where you were at in the beginning on 47th [Street, Chicago, Illinois] and Lake Park [Avenue], that's over by the Regal Theater and all of that. I mean, that was like the heart of the black community.
Speaker 2: Let me tell you that came on later. Yeah you right--
Speaker 1: 47th Street.
Speaker 2: --That was right, right in the heart of things.
Speaker 1: Those days, that was the heart of--
Speaker 2: --That was the heart of it, and I, but I didn't know I was there. I didn't know nothing about all of that stuff. All I knew--I found out later what it was, you know.  But Mr. [McKinley] Washington took care of me.  He took, he cooked for me when I'd come off of the road. I stayed with him. He took care--he showed me how to open up a check, savings account, 'cause I had no idea how to do none of that stuff.  He bought, he helped me purchase a ring that I got married, my first wife. He was a father to me. He was someone that the Lord put there in my life as a seventeen year old.
Speaker 1: Now where was he from?  Did you ever?
Speaker 2: He was from a little city in, in in the Meridian, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Meridian.
Speaker 2: That's where he grew up. He had a sister that was supposed to have been living there.  I wrote her several times and the letter came back so she must have passed away. He was married. His wife left him after his daughter died. His daughter died of rabies and she left and went to Saint Louis [Missouri] and he never heard from her since. I was his family. My family was his family 'til he died.
Speaker 1: That was really a lucky kind of a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Yeah, a lot of people in Chicago [Illinois] in those days had just come up from the South so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --You know.  I guess everybody saw it as being so different but in some ways everybody's life--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Had started on a farm someplace in the South--
Story_ID: 128278
Speaker 1: --Yeah, it was, it was, you know, it was different, very different to me.  But my life was spent mostly on that bus with these old men.
Speaker 2: So, so let me just--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Paint the picture, so the Chicago American Giants [Chicago, Illinois] in 1953?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  Now, basically consisted of the old guys that used to play for them back in the--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --And young guys or what?
Speaker 1: There was a bunch of young guys. I would say, I was the youngest one at seventeen but there was a lot of eighteen, nineteen year olds--
Speaker 2: --Okay.
Speaker 1: --On there.  I never will forget a guy by the name of s--they called him Superman. His name was [Arthur] Pennington. Superman Pennington they called him.  He had been with the [New York] Yankees farm club and he came, he was training us too, but he was playing with us. He was playing first base. He was a big tall--I never will forget him, big tall guy.  I think his name was Arthur Super--well Superman Pennington is what they called him. Superman, that's what they called him, Superman.  He was one of the guys that was traveling with us on that bus, but you know, they talk about the Negro [baseball] league. After 1950--and this is what was handed down to me--they called it a league but most of the team was (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Okay now--
Speaker 1: --They was traveling around--
Speaker 2: --I just wanted to--
Speaker 1: --Oh okay--
Speaker 2: --And just establish another thing here that you told me earlier.  James "Cool Papa" Bell became a friend of yours--
Speaker 1: --Yeah.
Speaker 2: --And he was at that initial--
Speaker 1: --He was--
Speaker 2: --Tryout.--
Speaker 1: --He was, he was with the Chicago American Giants, but Leonard, Dick, Dick Crawford, that wa-- I'm not too much with names. Back then I was good. I was a great baseball player and I knew that.  But I also knew that I was makin' a lot of mistakes and the old men would jump all over me and it wasn't the men that was on the Chicago American Giants. It was the men on, on the other team.  Like the first game I pitched was the s--Memphis Red Sox, and those guys, they, not only me, but he other young guys. They see 'em doing m--making mistake, they'd be all on them and I, you know, they was training us. When you really look at what was hap--they were preparing us for the Major Leagues and, and I know that's why I'm doing what I do today because those old men prepared us for li--I knew nothing about life. I knew nothing about survival.  These men, Mr. [James] Bell used to make us put a suit and tie on after every game. He said, "You're professionals and you're gonna act like professionals." It'd be so hot. I'll never forget that.  Mr. Bell passed a lot of history down to me.  He, he was one of those ball players--I knew nothing of his legacy but it was something about him. He took a, a liking to me--well we'd go somewhere and play and after the game, these guys would go to bars and stuff. They wouldn't let me in the bar. I was too young and Cool Papa, he didn't drink or smoke. He stayed back with us and he, he would tell me about things that happened in the league. Things that happened before I was born. He was the one told me about all that--what happened after that, the team got back together during the depression [Great Depression, 1929-1939]--
Speaker 2: --Now that's--
Speaker 1: --'Cause he was there.
Speaker 2: --Now see, now th--that's why I stopped you 'cause I wanted to establish--
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: --That "Cool Papa" Bell was a, a person that's a source for a lot of the information--
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: --That you have.
Speaker 1: He was, it was, it was, I can think of three, four guys. Cool Papa Bell was one. We couldn't call him Cool Papa. We had to say Mr. Bell, but he was one. [William] Bobby Robinson was two. [Walter] Buck Leonard was three. [HM Ted] Radcliffe, he was my coach, the first coach, so he was four and there was some more too, but those three name--those names I, I, recollect that were very instrumental in passing history down to me.
Story_ID: 128279
Speaker 1: So, so then tell us the history.  You were getting ready to tell us before I stopped you to get [James] "Cool Papa" Bell in, you know, so, just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but Mr. Bell would, he would stay back during the, you know the guys were going to the--me and him would go to the movie sometime, but he was telling me things that happened in the Negro [National] League before I was born. Things, you know--and I didn't understand at the time when he was telling me this, but I never forgot it. It's always stayed with me and the part that really stayed with me and what happened during the depression [Great Depression, 1929-1939] and he was there and he said, most of those teams, the Negro League broke up during the depression.
Speaker 1: Now just, just to set this up--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --W--when did the Negro League start?
Speaker 2: The league started in 1920.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's, that's written down, that's a part of the history. 1920, [Andrew] Rube Foster started the Negro Baseball League.
Speaker 1: And how successful were the--
Speaker 2: It was very successful.  Mr. Bell told me that during the time that they played, the little parks that they played in could not hold the overflowing crowds that came to see them play.  And I used to ask him, "You know, why?  What, what, what was different about the baseball?"  And he told me.  He said, "The baseball that they played, the Negro League Team played was more exciting. It was different." He said, he told me it was different than that of the Major Leagues. He said, "It was more daring," said "and they did things that the Major Leagues didn't even at that time, know what to do."  He also told me something many times, he said, the scouts, the managers from the Major Leagues would be at their games and he said they must have been studying our techniques because it wouldn't be long before you saw them doing that in the Major Leagues.  He said a lot of things they're doing in the Major Leagues today, came from the Negro Baseball League.
Speaker 1: For--
Speaker 2: He told me that.
Speaker 1: --For instance, g--give me an example of one thing.
Speaker 2: One of the thing he said was a hit and run. He said but when they played it was the bunt and run. It was the bunt and run 'cause they could run so fast and he would describe how they did that.  And, but in the Major League it was the hit and run, but it was the same thing and it came from the Negro Baseball League.  He told me about the helmet back in the day and that was the sad part because he said a guy got hit on the head by a ball and he died and his friend was saddened by the fact that he had died from being hit.  He said back in those days a lot of injuries occurred like a guy get hit on the arm and get their arm broken or get hit on the head or get--he said a lot of injuries occurred during--back in those days and--
Speaker 1: Y--yeah, just to set this up too, the, those days people didn't wear batting helmets right?
Speaker 2: No, no, they didn't wear batting helmets.
Speaker 1: Or wore those elbow protectors or any stuff?
Speaker 2: Nothing. He told me that this guy showed up one day with a hub that was cut out of a miner's cap and put on his head for protection and they laughed at him. He said they laughed at him. It looked funny.  He said just to go to show--he called me kid, he said, "Kid, just to go to show you how things get around." He got hit on the head one day and that hub he had on saved his life. He say, "You know?  When I look back and think about it, it wasn't long before I saw them hubs all over the league." (laughter) He told me that.  He said, and apparently from that, they developed that batting helmet, he said but that came from the Negro Baseball League.
Speaker 1: And the batting helmet really didn't become standard equipment in baseball until the mid '60s [1960s], I think, right?  It didn't--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --I remember the early days, Frank Robinson wore--
Speaker 2: --You could wear it if you wanted too.
Speaker 1: --Yeah, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: You could wear it if you wanted too, but now they have to wear 'em. Back in the '60s [1960s], you talking. Even the base runners have to wear 'em now.
Speaker 1: A hardball could actually split one of those helmets.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I've seen it happen, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 128280
Speaker 1: But that was some of the things he [James "Cool Papa" Bell] told me about and he said they played a lot of games. The Negro League All-Stars would get together at the end of the season and play the Major League All-stars and he, and he, he mentioned one game to me and I been looking to see if I can find it in the record books anywhere in the Major Leagues, but you can't because I was told they did not--those games were not, you know--they, they, they treated those games as just a game, was a makeup game or something--
Speaker 2: Exhibition?
Speaker 1: --It wasn't a--yeah, a exhibition game.  He said but, one game, Babe--It was Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and [James] Jimmie Foxx and he named a whole lot of other guys that was on that team and he said that pitcher was [Leroy] Satchel Paige, and he said he remember Satchel Paige striking out Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Jimmie Foxx in a row in a game, and I been looking to see if I can find that somewhere but I couldn't find it anywhere but he told me that.  And he said they played a lot of games, every year.  One time he said they were playing and they won so many games the, the commissioner told 'em to stop, don't play 'em no more (laughter) 'cause he see y'all got everything to, to, to lose and they got everything to gain.  But later on Mr. [William] Bobby Robinson told me that they recorded eighty-six games that was played between the Negro League All-Stars and the Major League All-Stars and he played in some of 'em and he told me--he said, "That's a lie." He said, "They played more games than that and they won more than eighty." (laughter).  So, I don't, you know, that's, they didn't record that stuff back in those days. I, I, I guess, I don't know, I couldn't find anything on it, but this is what was handed--they told me this, you know, and they told me about great players and, and, and, and, and, and I guess the guy that was most hated, played for the, what was that, the one used to file his spikes.
Speaker 2: Oh, Ty Cobbs [Tyrus "Ty" Cobb]?
Speaker 1: Ty Cobbs.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Bobby Robinson told me that him and Ty Cobbs were friends and he said in Detroit [Michigan], he played with the Detroit Stars, he said whenever they play, said the [Detroit] Tigers would come in and play on a Saturday night and they be playing Friday night, and said that he would come down and sit in the dugout with them and he said, he told him, said, "If you was a different color, you'd be playing in the Major League right now."  But you know, there weren't too many people at the funeral, when Ty Cobb died?  And I didn't--Bobby told me this, he said, he was there. He went to the funeral. He had letters that he used to get from Ty Cobbs when he was on the road playing and he said, it wasn't too many people at the funeral.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's--
Speaker 1: And now you would think that a star player like that, there would have been a lot of people at his funeral.
Story_ID: 128281
Speaker 1: Well you know there's a famous book, that a writer followed him [Tyrus "Ty" Cobb] around for a couple of years and wrote a book about it.
Speaker 2: Oh really?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Basically they made a movie starring Tommy Lee Jones about Ty Cobb where they claim that his--all those stories about his personality being so bad were really true.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter), well--
Speaker 1: And he, he, he made like racial remarks and stuff too, but he, he was a peculiar--like, like Americans in general, their attitude towards race was so crazy, it's hard to tell what, what their--'cause, you know, they hate black people--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Then they pal around with 'em and, and George Wallace's best friend was black or so, so you know.
Speaker 2: But you know, I met Jackie [Robinson] and this is going too far, I'm a, I'll wait.  In the Negro [National] League, there were, in the beginning, Mr. [James "Cool Papa"] Bell told me. He said, "Do you know the Negro League didn't get nothing for Jackie Robinson?"  And he said they didn't get nothing for [Lawrence] Larry Doby either.  He said, "Well let me tell you something kid, Those owners that own the team, and he said, most of them was white, he said they had those fronters. Men that they had hired to run the team, had all, every team to sign every young player, not the old players, to long binding contracts so if Major League were interested, he said, "We gon' get 'em ready for the Major League and if they are interested, they gon' have to pay for it. They gon' have to purchase that contract."  That mean the team that he's on gon' get enough money to pay the older player to keep them training and keep the league going. He said, "That's what happened."  I couldn't figure out, if you look at my contract, it was for four years, but they was doing that to younger players because they knew th--they had a chance to go to the Major Leagues and by--long contract would mean they would get more money.  I don't know how much they got for me. Do it-[HM Ted] "Double Duty" [Radcliffe] told me, he don't remember. [HM] Ernie Banks, I don't know if he had a long contract.  Hank Aaron, Willie Mayes, all of us had them long binding contracts and the team we were on got money and that's what the historians and I say this often, because that--our history is messed up, they don't know when that league ended.  The old timers say, it never ended. It died by the end of 1960, but there were a few teams even after 1960, that continued on trying to get it together, trying to keep it going, but it was too late. The league was gone.
Story_ID: 128282
Speaker 1: Now, let me just, let's get back to your career and see--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Th--then we'll pick this up a little later. I mean the rest of the story of the league [Negro American League]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --But, so you're seventeen years old, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --From what I read, I read that you set a record for the number of wins?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had five straight wins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the Negro [American] League.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The first loss I had was from the New York Black Yankees.
Speaker 1: And it's a record for somebody your age, right?
Speaker 2: Well?
Speaker 1: --From somebody seventeen years old?
Speaker 2: I don't know some writer probably did that, I didn't--
Speaker 1: --Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --See, we didn't, we didn't--it didn't mean nothing, that much to us at that time.  I was playing ball, I was getting paid and I knew I was good enough to be in the major leagues, so, the record itself wasn't important to me. Somebody ask me now, how many homeruns you get?  I wouldn't know, I think I got one or two inside the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think--
Speaker 2: --Park.
Speaker 1: --In those days of the major leagues, I guess the youngest player to, as a pitcher who, who won like a another game was Bob Feller--
Speaker 2: Yeah they can--
Speaker 1: --That's what they--
Speaker 2: --They compare me to Bob Feller?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Well, I won five straight games--
Speaker 1: So they making you the black Bob Feller (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well I didn't do that.  But you know, my first game against the Memphis Red Sox, that, to me that was my historical game because of the things that happened. [HM Ted] "Double Duty" [Radcliffe] was catching. I was winning the game, three to one, and a guy by the name of--the guy that wrote my autobiographry found out the guy's name, I--they called him Big Red [Wilmer Fields] that night, but his real name was Red Lonely, I didn't know that, that night, Red Lonely?  They called him Big Red, and, and, I struck Big Red out twice and with that drop, and I never will forget, every time Big Red swing and miss, look like I could feel the vibration out to the mound from the bat. That's how big and strong he was, and the fans, "Ooohh," 'cause he was known to get homeruns apparently 'cause they was looking for him to do this and I struck him out.  So, in, in high school, I was taught to hit a curve ball. You, you go up far as you can get in the batter's box and wait there, you know, to hit it, get it before it curve.  And I saw him that night --I struck him out twice. The last time in the seventh inning he came up, and look like he st--got up in front of the plate, gon' hit my--Double Duty called for the curve, for the sinker and I said, "Nah," 'cause I saw him step up. I'm gon' cross him up this time, you know, and Double Duty called time out, he come out there he said, "What's the problem?"  I said, "You see him setting up?"  He said, "I don't give a da"--and he curse word, "You throw what I tell you boy." That's what he said, and he gon' back behind the plate.  And look like to me Big Red stepped up further and Double Duty still calling for the sinker and I shook him off, you know?  I said no, and he said (waves his hand) that mean throw what you want and I did and I never will forget that night. I threw what I wanted and Mr. Lonely hit it and I think it's still going today.  I never seen a ball hit that far in my life (laughter), and I'll never forget the tongue lashing I got that night, a seventeen year old. It was embarrassing to me with all those people there in the stand. Double Duty came out to the mound jumping up and down calling me all kind of names and I been in this league fifteen years, boy if I tell you to throw something, you throw it.  I'll never forget that, I went on back and I won the game three to one, but I'll never forget that tongue lashing I got that night, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I bet Double, Double Duty could do it too, he can--
Speaker 2: Oh well he, he, ah man could he do it.  He hit the homerun that night to, was it, he hit a two run homer that night, yeah.  He was a great player and you know?  I didn't see him in his early years, but from what I saw in his older years, he should have been in the hall of fame.  I don't know about some of those guys that got in the hall of fame. I didn't see 'em play but, you know, they couldn't have been too much greater than what I saw from him.
Story_ID: 128283
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well tell us about, you were telling us off camera about Gerald McGinnis [sic, Gread "Lefty" McKinnis].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Gerald Lefty McGinnis.
Speaker 1: Lefty, okay, and, and he was a man who beat the man--
Speaker 2: No, no he's, yeah, he's the man who beat the man.  Satchel Paige--
Speaker 1: --And you became--
Speaker 2: --Was known as the man.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you became the man who?
Speaker 2: I won a game that night, so I beat him and they nicknamed me the man who beat the man, who beat the man.  (Laughter), so that's what, that came back years later to me somebody say, "Hey there's the man who beat the man." You know, but, that's how I got that name that night.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you were telling us that he tried to give you some advice that night that you beat--
Speaker 2: He did. He showed me what I was doing wrong by--I wa--back in those days we wine--winded up and each time you wind up, you showing the ball and he said, "Less time they have to pick up that ball, more effective you'll be," and you know, it really made sense later on but, that night it didn't. I'd won the game, but every game since then, I'd, I used that technique he showed me and I was more effective and even when I'd teach young players how to pitch today, I use the same techniques that he showed me back then, then, that night.  And, this man became a, a figure in my life because I used to go down on 30-38th [Street] and State [Street], I think it was 38th and State, it was on State Street--he had a hotdog stand he ran for many years after his baseball career, and I used to go there and sit there and talk to him all day sometimes and he would tell me about things that happened in the Negro league and things that he had gone through and, and players that he had played against and, and, and, I, I, I, I got a lot from talking to him about the history.  And then one day I went, I missed a few months going back there and when I did go back, there was no more hotdog stand. I really don't know what happened. He must have passed away, 'cause he was of age then, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he played for the--he, he was playing for--
Speaker 2: He played on a lot of different teams. That night he played with--he played with Chicago American Giants, but that night, he was playing with the Philadelphia Stars--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --I think they was paying him to--I'm moving again, am I okay?  They was paying him to train the young players, I think he was one of those players that was being paid, too.
Story_ID: 128284
Speaker 1: Okay, you mean Major League Baseball?  'Cause you--your theory was that Major League Baseball was, was actually paying some of the--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --Older Negro league players?
Speaker 2: --I really believed that.  No one never told me that but, you know, and I saw a lot times I saw what Mr. [James "Cool Papa"] Bell was paid, his check was less than mine, so I'm saying that the Major League must, must have been contributing something to them because you would see them on different teams at different times and apparently they were put there as a player that was signed, and they were put there to get him ready.  I hope I'm not wrong about that but that--it seemed like that was what was happening back in those days.  Those guys were preparing us for the Major League. I know I was and I'm sure Hank Aaron said the same thing. Hank Aaron came into the league batting cross-handed and I'm sure there was other players that could say the same thing, you know?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I heard that story that he batted cro--cross-handed and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he came in batting cross-handed.
Speaker 1: Yeah okay, well, so now, about how many, how many years did you play for Chicago American Giants?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was, I was only there for two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: '53 [1953], and '54[1954].
Speaker 1: And how, how many games would you play a year?
Speaker 2: Ah man, you see you, we would play sixty or seventy games. We would play at least thirty, thirty to forty games for money and the rest of the game was played--were league games.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We called it a league, but it was really barnstorming. We were all barnstorming. Some of the guys called it a league, you can say it was a league. We played each other every once in a while, but we would play anybody that would play for some money. Anybody that would--the guy that made the money was the booking agent. You got some guys, "No it was a league. It was a league." They call it--they can call it what they wanna. A bunch of teams got together and they called it a league but everybody was barnstorming. We would play anybody that would play for some money. That's why the history is so s--distorted--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --That's why most of it's not even written down, you know--
Speaker 1: --'Cause so there--there's a fuzzy ground between where the actual league play ended and the barnstorming picks up--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Right, right.  See what happened is that the booking agent, after the league start taking all the young players, the booking agency got busy going around scheduling games of players like [HM Ted] "Double Duty" [Radcliffe]. Like lot of those players that, that had made a name for themselves are coming to your town to play, okay?  Same thing they do now.  But people, thousands of people would come out to see us play and pay a dollar to come in. Well that was a big payday for us because if you won the game you got sixty percent. If you lost you got forty. The booking agent had already got his ten percent and gone to the next town to set up the next game. That's how the game was set up.
Story_ID: 128285
Speaker 1: So for one game, what would you make, for instance?
Speaker 2: Thirty dollars.
Speaker 1: Thirty dollars, okay.
Speaker 2: Thirty dollars, highest I ever got.  And it was probably eight, eight to ten thousand people at the game.
Speaker 1: About how, how many games did you play, let's say in a week?
Speaker 2: Five.
Speaker 1: Five, okay.
Speaker 2: Five, sometimes six, rest of the time we was traveling.
Speaker 1: That's not bad though if, if you think about the average salary in those days, a guy working at General Motors [GM] or someplace on the assembly line may, may make ninety dollars a week in those days.
Speaker 2: We made--
Speaker 1: And, and you guys playing ball, you'd make 350 if you got paid at that level.
Speaker 2: We made what the average working man was making in those days sir, if you wanna calculate it, about--
Speaker 1: --About that--
Speaker 2: --The average of a working man was making.
Speaker 1: --Okay, yeah, I guess so, but just a little bit higher.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A little higher.
Speaker 2: Yeah, give or take a few--some games sir, we'd play, if it was a rain out, we didn't get paid that day.  So when you calculate games that, you know, were rained out, and there were some rain outs--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --We had to play sometimes some inclement weather just to try to make a payday.  See all this was a part of our history, you know?  Many times, many times we were traveling and the young players on the bus was, we were like the kids. We had to do all the dirty work--carry the bats, cover up the mud holes, go around and stand in the hot sun for an hour to get sandwiches 'cause they wouldn't let us come in the restaurant.  I went through the end of this. I went through it, I saw it, but I can imagine what those guys played ten years before me were going through. I could imagine what they were going through if I had to do that.
Speaker 1: So, what did you do in the, s--so, okay, so the average guy is making about eighty to ninety dollars a we--if he's working a factory--
Speaker 2: If he's, right.--
Speaker 1: --If, if, if he's got a good job.
Speaker 2: --If he's got a good job.
Speaker 1: And he's got benefits.  D--did you all have any benefits?
Speaker 2: No, no benefits.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you wer--you're making maybe about $150 in a good week if you,--
Speaker 2: We didn't--
Speaker 1: --You know--
Speaker 2: --Sir, highest I ever made in one week--now, this outside of my contract now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My contract was setup I'll get five hundred dollars a month. I didn't get no five hundred dollars a month sir.  None of us did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Highest I ever got in one week was $112.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's highest I ever got in one week.  Now, remember a lot of things went on in the Negro league back then that's going on today. There was a lot of bitterness, enviousness, trifleness, that was going on then.  Players envying other players thanking he making more than he done making, thanking he getting a better shot at something that he's getting, that all went on back then and it's still going on today.  There was some player probably making more than that. I don't know. I didn't get into that.
Speaker 1: Because every contract was different?
Speaker 2: Yeah, everybody had a different con--but the contract wasn't honored no way.  The only thing the contract was setup to do was for the major leagues so they get more money from the major leagues. They would get more for me then they would another guy 'cause I was younger and they were paying me more--supposedly paying me more than the other guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what it was based on.--
Speaker 1: I, I remember going to the baseball game when I was about nine, 1959, in Cincinnati [Ohio] and I could see the salaries. They had the salaries of the players in, in the book--Vada Pinson and Frank Robinson. Frank Robinson was a all-star, he was making like forty thousand dollars a year, in 1959 or '60 [1960]. And that was considered, you know, pretty good--
Speaker 2: That was considered a lot of money back then--
Speaker 1: --Yeah.
Speaker 2: --You know, and maybe some--the money that we were making were considered a lot of money but--
Speaker 1: But for the average guy, about seven thousand dollars was considered pretty good money.
Speaker 2: Oh my God, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Five thousand dollars was tops. I mean, that's why they had that thing in me, five hundred dollars a week they figured major league calculate that, they gon' get a pretty good penny for me and I was only on free agent.  See when you--you, you're not a Cub [Chicago Cubs]. You're a free agent to try out for the Cubs. If you make the team, then you sign another contract with the team. That's how that was done back then.
Story_ID: 128286
Speaker 1: Well, well tell us what happened with you now, you were invited by the [Chicago] Cubs to camp for their?--
Speaker 2: Yep, Cubs purchased their contract. Which made me a free agent for the Cubs.  First day of spring training, 1955, I cracked my ankle in two places.
Speaker 1: Now how did you do that?
Speaker 2: Sliding into third base. I was running at--a running exercise.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what--
Speaker 2: And since then, you know, I went to the Cubs and tried to get some records on that. You know what they told me?  We were not keeping records of free agents in those days.  'Cause I really wanted to know, have me some proof.  You know, very seldom you'll find anything written down about the Negro [American] League. Very little was written down. I'm sure there were some thing written down about me. I'm still trying to find some of it, but back in those days they ain't write--they wo--you know, if I played in Omaha, Nebraska, you know, we played against a team and, and, and they may have something written down, and most of the time they didn't, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --Like today y--you can look in the paper, you see this, the sta--stats of all--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --The pro games and in those days you wouldn't see?
Speaker 2: No, after 1950, you gonna find very little, and if you find some you better study 'em real good because a lot of stuff was being put together just to make them, you know. A lot of players today, and I hate to say this, a lot of players, because there was no pictures, and nothing written down, are coming up with stuff just to prove that they played.  But, when we started our organization, yes, well we didn't get to that yet, but that's--
Speaker 1: Well, okay le--let's just go from this point--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Now, now you, you had at the Cubs try--now who else was there with you?  And that we would know, anybody else?
Speaker 2: [HM] Ernie Banks was supposed to report the next day. I was a pitchers--pitchers and catchers always reported first. Ernie had been signed, [Eugene] Gene Baker had been signed. I don't know any others. Only player on the team was Big Eddie Ochs [ph.], and Ted Kazuski [ph.], I mean.  But those guys was report--we was there a week, a few days before they reported. By the time they got there I was back in Chicago [Illinois] with a broken ankle.  You know?
Speaker 1: So did they, did they pay your bills, your medical bills or anything?  Or did you have to--
Speaker 2: All that was taken care of. I don't know who paid it, but it was taken care of. It could have been the [Chicago American] Giants paying it. I don't know.  I don't know who paid it.
Speaker 1: So now, this just wasn't an ordinary--
Speaker 2: No, Cubs must have paid it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They must have because this was in Mesa, Arizona.
Speaker 1: Oh okay. This was all the way in Arizona, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I don't remember having any other insurance myself, unless they had me insured and I didn't know it, you know, probably did have the players insured, or something, you know, to that affect, probably did--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --When you really think of it.
Speaker 1: So what wa--what happened with the base where you broke your ankle. What, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, people that follow baseball back in those days the bases were square. They was stationary to the area and you slid into it, you slid into it.
Speaker 1: Was it solid, was it made out of wood or what was it?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Made out of hard plastic, hard, not plastic but material, that was hard. The same material they make 'em out of now.  The only different now--they are tampered, tempered?  Or tampered?  You slide into now, you slide right over it. Back then you slid into it. That was that was--that stopped you.  And a lot of players got injured that, during that time.  That's how I brok--I was an excellent slider, all through high school, and in the Negro league, I could slide and stand up on the base.  But somehow I cut my slide short that day and jammed that bag, yeah and that really ended my career, because it never healed and even today I walk with a limp.
Speaker 1: So it didn't heal, heal right enough to play ball--
Speaker 2: Right.  Now they wanna operate on it now. Back then if they had had the knowledge of medical, back then, they would have operated on my leg and I, I would have been playing, back playing in a few months.
Speaker 1: Okay so, well what did you do?--
Speaker 2: But they just put it in a cast.
Speaker 1: --So, so you're out in Arizona with a broken ankle?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And, did they, how, how did you get back home?  Did you go back to Chicago?
Speaker 2: They flew me back home--
Speaker 1: --Or did you go--
Speaker 2: --First time I ever was on a plane.
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: I flew, I went down there on, on the train 'cause I, I had never been on a plane before, but they flew me back on a plane.
Speaker 1: Did they fly you back to Chicago or to Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Chicago.
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: Chicago.  My old man [Dezzie Biddle] picked me up at the airport, yep.
Speaker 1: So you--was your family still in Arkansas basically or, your parents?
Speaker 2: My parents was down there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Yeah, everybody was there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --They didn't--I didn't let my momma [Percilla Glover Biddle] know that until months later--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --That I had broken my leg.
Speaker 1: So you were still staying with Mr. [McKinley] Washington?
Speaker 2: Oh, Mr. Washington had me all the way, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 128287
Speaker 1: So what'd you do?  You couldn't play ball to earn a living so what did you, wh--what did you end up doing?
Speaker 2: Well, for, for six months I got my little money from the Chicago American Giants and I started playing. I started--I would go to the Cub [Chicago Cubs], to the Cub Wrigley Field [Chicago, Illinois] and pitch batting practices, but the little money I, I was making--my old man [Dezzie Biddle] was taking care of me. I had no regular income coming in at that time.
Speaker 1: So you did try to--from what I read, you tried to pitch again but just couldn't do--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --What you used to do.
Speaker 2: The [Chicago] White Sox picked me up. They took me somewhere up there, tried me out for a week, they released me. That wa--that was when I decided my baseball career was--as far as professional, was gone.  But you see, during that time I had gone to college. I had gone to Grier Engineering College in Chicago fo--for electronics and I knew how to repair radios and televisions so I did a little of that in Chicago [Illinois], you know, during that time.  And other times my old man was taking care of me, you know. He was taking care of the business stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when I came to Milwaukee [Wisconsin]--see I got married during that time.
Speaker 1: Okay about what time did you get married?
Speaker 2: I got married right after, right after I got my leg broken, I mean, before, right before I got my leg broken--
Speaker 1: So this is '55 [1955]--
Speaker 2: --In '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: --Okay, right.
Speaker 2: And, my wife and I, we were living in Chicago. We were living with him, Mr. [McKinley] Washington. I think I had a job. I got a job at American Motors, what is, General Motors [GM], I'm sorry.  General Motors, they were making these box cars and I worked there for a little while in the cafeteria, but I really thought that I had a chance to play baseball again but the White Sox, they tried me out and finally they released me and so that was it.  I went to repairing televisions, went to Milwaukee, opened up me a TV shop, (unclear) television, enrolled in ca--University of Wisconsin [-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Now, now wh--what brought you to Milwaukee instead of staying in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Well, I had been to Milwaukee during my playing days. I had a daughter. I did not want to bring her up in Chicago. I could have stayed in Chicago and maybe and made a living out of it but I moved to Milwaukee because it was something like my hometown, twenty years behind time.
Speaker 1: (Laughter), that's really flattering to Milwaukee.
Speaker 2: Yes sir, twenty years behind time.  I moved there, I moved here because of that and I had a brother living here then who helped supported me until I got started.
Speaker 1: Now what, what year is this when you moved to Milwaukee?
Speaker 2: '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: '58 [1958].  Okay, all right.  So this is the time, I guess it wa--was Hank Aaron here by that time?  Was he?
Speaker 2: Henry [Hank Aaron] came in, in '53 [1953], with me, '55 [1955], '54 [1954]. Henry came with the [New York] Giants in '54 [1954].  The reason I'm saying that because the day w--we played the Indianapolis Clowns at--they had just built--this was '53[1953]--they had just built County Stadium [Milwaukee, Wisconsin]. They hadn't even, the [Milwaukee/Atlanta] Braves hadn't even started playing there yet. We was playing a exhibition game between the Indianapolis Clowns and the Chicago American Giants.  That morning Hank Aaron signed with the Braves and they sent him to Eau Claire, Wisconsin that morning, so he never played there then, with the team. I remember that.
Story_ID: 128288
Speaker 1: So you moved to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] and you went--
Speaker 2: Went to the University of Wisconsin [-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --And became a social worker.
Speaker 1: --UWM [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now was it easy to get into UWM?  Or, did, I mean?
Speaker 2: It wasn't easy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had to take the college exam and all of that, entrance exam.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were there any people that really helped you out at, at UWM?  Or, or teachers that you remember that?
Speaker 2: There were some. I don't remember n--names anymore, there, they helped me--
Speaker 1: I'm guessing there weren't many black students at UWM in those days. I mean, I don't know.
Speaker 2: In--that knew me?
Speaker 1: No, that--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --Were there at all, I guess, I--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a lot of black students going there--
Speaker 1: Were there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See I, I, I didn't go to school right outta my baseball. I worked a while and then I went to college. I was taking courses at UWM and were leading up to going full time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so this is like, this is in the '60s [1960s]?  Or?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I started, I started working for the State of Wisconsin and I was still going to school during that time and I got my degree. I started work--I, I, I started being a social worker for the State of Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: About what year was this?
Speaker 2: '58 [1958]. I mean.
Speaker 1: '68 [1968]?  Or, what's oh, you looking at the ring.
Speaker 2: I had to look at my ring.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: '78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay so that was a considerable time--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --About twenty, twenty years--
Speaker 2: --That was long--
Speaker 1: --After.
Speaker 2: --I had worked all those years as a social wo--well not a social worker. I was a counselor, job counselor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So that's makes sense--
Speaker 2: --And I was--
Speaker 1: 'Cause I was saying--
Speaker 2: --Going to school all the time, but then I started going full-time to get my degree.
Speaker 1: --Okay, that makes sense 'cause I didn't think there were many black students there in '58 [1958].
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There were some but--
Speaker 1: 'Cause '78 [1978]--
Speaker 2: This was--
Speaker 1: --There should be, yeah.
Speaker 2: --I didn't, I started taking courses, one course here and a course there, you know, leading up to this.
Speaker 1: Okay, so 1978.
Speaker 2: 'Cause at that time I couldn't afford to go full, you know, straight, full-time.
Speaker 1: So, wh--when you were here in Wisconsin, were you involved in sports as a coach or anything?--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --Or, do like that?
Speaker 2: --All through those years, '60s [1960s] I was a little league coach, on through, all the way up. I played, I played in the lot--on a lot of teams.  My baseball, I played baseball cleanup until four years ago.  Four years ago I was in the old folk's league and I was the oldest player on the team (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you pitch? You still pitching?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I pitch.  Won the only game we won that year (laughter). We won one game and the team that won--see you could have it thirty to fify--thirty to s--the youngest had to be thirty years old.  Now it's different. Back then thirty year old could play with the sixty year olds and it wasn't fair 'cause the team that won had all them thirty year olds on there and they beat us. They beat us, they won the championship.  But I, we won one game that year. I played with the Yankees. I still got my uniform that I wore (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 128289
Speaker 1: So, as you, during all these years did people ever talk much about the Negro leagues?
Speaker 2: No.  It was sud--I played baseball and that was it. Only the 1990, 1990 they started talking about the Negro baseball league and looking for the players that played in the Negro baseball league and that's when I was contacted.  I was contacted by the museum in Kansas City [Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, Kansas City, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay, so the, you that--you have any idea of what sparked the interest in the Negro league?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were a guy in New York--in Maryland named Ed Shalder [ph.], and you'll read about it in my book ['Secrets of the Negro Baseball League'].
Speaker 1: What is his name?  Ed, Ed--
Speaker 2: Ed Shalder. He was a musician.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: I don't know how to spell it. It's in the book. Ed Shalder.
Speaker 1: Shalder?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a musician. He also, he also was involved with some millionaires 'cause this how it happened and this what was passed down to me 'cause at this time I wasn't even involved in it.  He found two or three of the older guys and those two or three found three or four more older guys 'cause these guys after the baseball, they did keep in touch with each other.  That's how we got together with 314 in '95 [1995], by the word of mouth.  But they got together when they had about fifteen of 'em and they brought 'em all together up in new, New York--Maryland, and they had a big reunion. Now these millionaires--
Speaker 1: Clear, wh--what in Baltimore [Maryland]?  Or?
Speaker 2: In Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, all right.
Speaker 2: These millionaires bought together these guys to get--to make money for them. They had no idea they were bringing us back together 'cause the Negro league wasn't even talked about before then.  But they thought about making more money and they brought 'em together and they made--they had 'em to sign hundreds of bats, hundreds of balls, and pictures that are yet being sold around the country making millions of dollars.  But what they did, they brought the name Negro league back in play.
Speaker 1: Okay now, at some point Major League Baseball got interested right with?
Speaker 2: That's another thing.  Major League Baseball got interested 'cause these people had connections and you gotta remember most of the people that run the major leagues, they wasn't even born when we were playing, so this is history to them.  And being a part of history and being baseball, they did something, not much, but something. Like I said, some of these racketeers got in touch with, with some of these owners and, and used the excuse of bringing back the history but, just to make money for themselves. They could care less of the players because remember at that time it still was three hundred and some of us still living when it started.
Story_ID: 128290
Speaker 1: We were talking about when Major League Baseball got involved in this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you said that I guess around, 1979, or '80 [1980]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, around that time.
Speaker 1: The museum in Kansas City [Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, Kansas City, Missouri] came and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the idea of a museum came up. The idea was to preserve our history which was a good idea, but sadly to say it's gone beyond that now because it's a money making industry.  That museum over the years have made millions and millions of dollars off of our name and our likeness.  None of the money that they have made went to those men who, mind you, were still living at that time. Only [John] "Buck" O'Neil got the job out of it.  They took Buck and put him on a pedestal. They used him to make money for themselves. Their, their reasoning was to preserve our history in which they did some of it, but you have to remember it was a money making industry.  The museum used Buck many times. If you look at--Buck is gone now, but before he left us, he came in with us, the players, but before then he was Buck with the museum and making money. They paid him a lot of money to stand out front and if you listen to him talk around the country, he was the ambassador for us, but not one time in that ten years span did he mention there were players still living.  He only talked about [LeRoy] Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson and the other player. Never mentioned the fact that there was a Sherwood Brewer, [William] Bobby Robinson, not even [HM Ted] "Double Duty" Radcliffe. Not one time did he mention their name in any of those interviews that he had. They was always stories about him, Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson and those guys, but that was to make money for the museum.  The museum fought me after I organized the foundation [Yesterday's Negro League Baseball Players LLC]--
Speaker 1: --Now, now, well let me ask you a question.
Speaker 2: --Okay.
Speaker 1: Now who started the museum?
Speaker 2: It was my understanding the museum was started by a young historian named Larry Lester. They ousted him because Larry was someone that wanted to do the thing the right way and these crooks had got in there, saw a way, means to make money for themselves. They ousted Larry.
Speaker 1: Now is it--so--
Speaker 2: So it was my understanding, Larry's trying to get back in there now.
Speaker 1: What?  They form a not-for-profit corporation for the behalf of the--
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: --Museum?
Speaker 2: --Yes sir.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --Yes sir.--
Speaker 1: --And then the, the, the museum, the purpose is to promote the history of--
Speaker 2: --Pre, was to--
Speaker 1: --The Negro leagues--
Speaker 2: --Was too p--preserve--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Our history.
Speaker 1: --And to pro--promote the history of the league.
Speaker 2: --Right.
Speaker 1: But you're saying a lot of merchandising has taken place to the point where you, you, you think it's more about raising money than it is about preserving the history?
Speaker 2: It was, it, it is now, but then it wasn't.  See, in order to get this money, you got to show a cause and their cause were to preserve our history, so many people and organizations around the world including the Major League and including some of the players that played in the Major League.  Sir if you research the players that put a lot of money into that museum, stopped because they found out the real truth of what it was all about.  The museum made millions of dollars. The museum talked about me because I told the truth. I told the truth to the world.
Speaker 1: Okay now, what truth is that?
Speaker 2: The truth that they did not represent the living players.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the truth and they hated me for it. They discarded me. They say I didn't play in the league. They did everything they could to dishonor me.  I'm the one that started the organization to represent the player, Yesterday's Negro League Baseball Players Foundation.
Story_ID: 128291
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now what is the--I mean, so the contention is over who represents Negro league baseball players?
Speaker 2: Right, the money that was coming to them, a lot of it stopped because of what we did. We told the truth. People were donating millions of dollars to that museum thinking it was going to help the players that was still living.  The word about the players that was still living, the players were living without medical, and no kinda benefits at all and these people out there making all of this money and none of it going to the players. That's what started it.  When the truth got out there a lot of the people that were donating to that museum stopped because of that.
Speaker 1: Now the formula that I read about, we discussed it prior to the interview, was that proceeds, they'd go to the museum, fifty percent was supposed to go to help the players, twenty percent was--
Speaker 2: Well that's, that's another thing that came into being. Major League [Baseball] got involved by estabing--establishing Major League Properties.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Making this a part of Major League Properties and where the proceeds from the sale of Negro league memorabilia, whether it was autograph session, whether it was memorabilia or replicas of our uniform from our playing days, whatever it was, proceeds from this would go in a fund to help the living Negro league ball players, that was not to be because the same people that started that museum got involved in this.  They felt that, somebody felt that the museum should get thirty percent of that money that was being made.  The Jackie Robinson foundation should get ten percent--twenty percent and the fifty percent should go to the living players.  This is where I came involved because I, to the press, I made it clear, that all of that money should go to these players that are still living out here and once we are gone, then it should go to those institutions that's keeping our history alive.  That was my suggestion in the media to those people, but they kept on to Major League Property, ma--
Speaker 1: Well, so--
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: So how does that, what does that fifty percent of, of revenue represent in terms of--
Speaker 2: --They took fifty percent--
Speaker 1: --Money for the--
Speaker 2: --Right.
Speaker 1: --In, in terms of money for an individual player, versus your, a Negro league player, a former Negro league player, how much money would they get, you know?
Speaker 2: --The last check that we got sir was thirteen dollars a piece--
Speaker 1: --And that's across the board, that's for everybody?--
Speaker 2: --Sir, this went across the board. This money was split among the players.  The first check I got was three hundred and somethin' dollars. Next check was one hundred and somethin'. It's in the book. The last check in which I misplaced, I don't think I even cashed it, twelve dollars and somethin'.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But this is when it was on its way out. This is when we got involved--
Speaker 1: Now, now--
Speaker 2: --With the truth.
Story_ID: 128292
Speaker 1: Okay, now does Major League Baseball--now I've read somewhere that they provide a pension for Negro league players--
Speaker 2: That's, that was on our, my behalf and I--that's a long story too.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you were able to get that for the players?  You said--
Speaker 2: I was instrumental in getting that--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --Our organization [Yesterday's Negro League Baseball Players LLC].
Speaker 1: --And that was from Major League Baseball?
Speaker 2: That was from Major League Baseball.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But sir, when y--you know, when you read the book, you gon' see how it transpired with letters and documents all the way up to where it started and, but see what happened, is some of our own players got involved later on.
Speaker 1: Well, let me just ask this question, before we get into that end story.  So, ho--how much do the former Negro league players get from Major League Baseball?  Is there a monthly check or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they get the same amount the major leaguers get.
Speaker 1: How much is that?
Speaker 2: Eight hundred and some dollars a month. Ten thousand a year.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That adds up to ten thousand a year.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, the qualifications, the, the, the, the criteria to receive this money was set so high by the Major League until most of the Negro league ball players did not qualify under their guidelines.
Speaker 1: Okay, wh--wh--what were the guidelines?
Speaker 2: The guidelines was you had to play in the Major League. The first guideline was you had to play in the Major League two years and the Negro league two years to qualify.  We fought that.  We fought that because at that time it wasn't but three or four players, thirty-six players at that time still living and four of them died before they even got a dime.  We fought the Major League. You know, everything has been documented and shown in letters and things that transpired between the Negro league.  Yesterday's Negro League [Baseball Players LLC] and the Major League, meaning myself and the Major League, because we changed their philosophy. At that time we started, the Major Leagues was six years to get a pension. We changed it to four years. We made them change it to four years. Now it's one day, but that's because of us. It will never be documented, but we fought the Major League, our organization did. We fought the Major League, I did for thirteen years to get to that point, but when they, when they made the criteria, two years in the Major League and two years in the Negro League, the Major League players union that played two, three years, filed a grievance, and out of the ten million dollars that were put up for us, they tied up three million dollars.  You didn't see it in the paper nowhere. We know that, we was involved in it. They tied it up, it stayed that way until two years ago--three years ago when the [United States] Supreme Court finally dismissed it and those guys, that money had to go back into the thing. Nobody never talked about it. Nobody never said nothing about what happened to that money.  Now, a player, they lost, those two year players lost. They didn't get nothing, but the money they had tied up went back into the ten million that was supposed to go to the players, but it's a lot going on behind that and it's in the book how they did all of that, how it was setup and everything.
Speaker 1: So, just for the record, what's the name of your book and when did you--
Speaker 2: Name of my book is 'Secrets of the Negro Baseball League.'  That book contains documents and things to prove what the DVD that was put out, and I'm gon' give you a copy of that called, 'Secrets of the Negro Baseball League.'  But the DVD is the history from the beginning of baseball of the Negro--from the beginning of baseball to the ending of the Negro Baseball League, to the dying of it rather.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And even what I'm doing--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --Today--
Speaker 1: --And the book was published when, wh--when did you publish it?
Speaker 2: --Two years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, so 2006?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Story_ID: 128293
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, now there--we were discussing, I think when I came in that in 1995, you said there was a big meeting of all the Negro league baseball players--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --And people that, that claim to be, you know. Everybody can't be--
Speaker 2: That meeting was--
Speaker 1: --And there was a discussion about who was and who wasn't.
Speaker 2: --Right.  Well, it, it wasn't who wasn't. It was a question of who played in the Negro league and, and, and, and, and, and the few older guys felt that they, they, they should be the Negro league and not the younger guys that played up to 1960. They claimed the Negro league died, ended by the end of 1949, '50 [1950].
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said there were like seven guys that, that qualified under that criteria, about seven?
Speaker 2: Seven guys.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Voted.  We had a meeting in Kansas City [Missouri] to establish the, the, the history of the Negro Baseball League because more, from 1950 to 1960, most of our history was not written down and at that meeting, in which [John] "Buck" O'Neil ran, we had a vote and only seven players voted to end the league in 1950. The rest of the players voted, end it in 1960.  So, there was a part of record was made that anybody, any player that played on a Negro league team, that meant whether he was in the League, what they called the league or not, any member, any ball player that played on the league that can be verified now, he got to be very, anybody can't jump up and say they played, is considered a Negro league ball player and that's what our criteria and our foundation was built upon and that's what we go by right today.  Every once in a while, we get a call or find someone that in their eighties and nineties, with newspaper clippings or a picture of him playing in the Negro Baseball League.
Speaker 1: Someone that you didn't know about before?
Speaker 2: Somebody we didn't know about.
Speaker 1: Oh, all right, okay.
Speaker 2: And he too was put on the record, but at the mas--present time, we have a record. We lost one last week. We got seventy-nine players that's still living.  Now, now there could be less. There could be a little bit more, because sometime a player, we say, he's passed or he's still living and he pass a few months--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Before we get the obitua--obituary.
Speaker 1: And I guess likewise, there's some that played that you don't know about.
Speaker 2: Right, right, and they'd come in another way.  But we keep a record. Our office is located in Youngstown, Ohio. We got the records. We got a secretary that's being paid to keep this record.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Being paid by one of the players that's able to play her because the foundation don't have any money.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, this is the office of the, of Yesterday's Negro League (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Negro League Baseball Players Foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 128294
Speaker 1: The newspaper reporter, when he was interviewing me, went to the records here in Wisconsin, found out we had never filed taxes. We haven't filed any taxes because we don't have any money to file any taxes. No one have given us any money.  The Milwaukee Brewers is the only Major League team, only one that have given the foundation anything and that's because of my efforts here in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] with them.
Speaker 2: Okay, and you have been honored by the Milwaukee Brewers? Several times I think.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  I've, I've been honored by the Brewers. [John] "Buck" O'Neil and I was honored the same night.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: As players that played in the Negro Baseball League.
Speaker 2: And yet, there are people that claim that you didn't play--
Speaker 1: Well that's--
Speaker 2: --I mean, there's, there's some that say you did--
Speaker 1: --That's, that's--
Speaker 2: --And there's some that say you didn't.
Speaker 1: --You know, my contract is there in the book. There are programs that-- games that was played that says Chicago American Giants didn't play.  But my understanding, the Giants played up in 1956. The team, you know, I don't know, I wasn't there. I don't know what happened to the team, but--
Speaker 2: [HM] Carl Long who we interviewed, he, he's, he's one of the supporters. He said that you definitely did play.
Speaker 1: Oh Carl, Carl played against me, right there in Comiskey Park in Chicago [Illinois], and there was some other players that's still living out there. There was a couple other players say they played with me, [Arthur] "Superman" Pennington played on the same team with me, but you see, there are some players out there that enviousness, enviousness have set in.  I don't know why they envy me. I never, I, all I've done--Mr. Sherwood Brewer passed away--all we ever done was try to help the ball players and yet for someone to come on and say, "He didn't play, and he didn't play," and, you know, it's ki--ki--you know, it's really--but I don't pay that any attention because I know I did. Other players know I did. I got a job to do. I'm the president of the foundations [Yesterday's Negro League Baseball Players LLC] and my job is to, to make sure that this history pass down to my young people, and that's what I do sir all over the country.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I'm sure there are things on the internet, people saying about me, I have to overlook it because I got a job to do and I'm doing the will of God, and I know that.
Story_ID: 128295
Speaker 1: Okay, so what, what, what's the status now of what's going on?  What, what are the biggest issues now in terms of--
Speaker 2: Biggest issue now is benefits for the rest of the guys that are not getting. See, if you read the book ['Secrets of the Negro Baseball League'] you'll find out that even in the last three or four years we have gotten benefits for twenty-seven players. They drop they benefits from four years to three years and twenty-six players-twenty-seven players qualified under those guidelines, but that was put in there--it should have been all the players, but we have a player living in, in Florida. His congressman kept pushing the Major Leagues to give benefits to, to all of us and the way it was done, his wife works for Senator [Clarence William "Bill"] Nelson's office, so he had access to Senator Nelson, but instead of him turning what he had over to the foundation, where all the players would have qualified, he turned in a list of names to the Major League who adhered to the list he turned in--the players that he knew would get benefits and give him benefits back for stamps. He called it stamps.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's, that's another thing. So that's, that's, that's a part of the history that's nasty. I mean real nasty, because this guy have used his ability, first he had to disqualify me, say I didn't play.  Then, he had to use players that has already died to get benefits through another player who say he played with them, that was still living.  Another player, ninety-six years old, he would, he was call this player and say, "Look, I'm gon' send you a letter. I want you to sign it, saying you played with this guy."  That's going on now sir. Some of the old players are getting benefits right-- I don't know who they are--that's the Major League benefit to find out that, 'cause they adhered his list instead of my list.  I sent a list to the Major League, saying this is the list of, of qualified players. They dismissed my list and used his list because Senator Nelson fought this from Florida.  And the Major League used his list. I have notified the commissioner several times of this, and yet they ignore the foundation that represents the players. They ignore the foundation that represent the players and go by the list that somebody else turned in about players.
Story_ID: 128296
Speaker 1: So, so does your foundation [Yesterday's Negro League Baseball Players LLC] have membership in terms of the?--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we got members, we got membership and we also--sir, before I found the papers to represent the living players, there was nothing on record about who represented the players.  Even those players that are out there saying those things about me are represented by this foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A lot of the players, including those older players, that most of them have died now, were represented by us and didn't even know it because there was nothing on the books representing the living players of the Negro Baseball League before 1996, when we filed the papers right here in the state of Wisconsin to represent the players.
Speaker 1: So this is like a--so, your foundation is kinda li--represents the players in a sense that they--do they, they, do they pay a membership dues or do they just register--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --Or, wh--how are they do?
Speaker 2: --There's no dues.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It didn't work.  We tried that, but you see, it's such a discrepancies here. Two players over here, one over there, and going against each other. You can never get 'em all together, but we got most of 'em together but it was a conflict 'cause there're a couple players over here, don't want to be involved over here but they are 'cause without this it was, they had no representation, but they feel they don't need no representation.  It's very difficult to get everybody together.  And I often said this to all of 'em and I have spoke to all of 'em in a group and said, "Fellows if we work together as one, we would be a force to reckon with, but they are controlling us like they did the slaves. A group over here and a group over there. This one telling on this one. This one telling--therefore, nothing'll never get done."  That's what societies going on today. That's why we don't have money in our foundation today because of that.  Nobody donate money to the foundation, only the Milwaukee Brewers. Nobody take the time to look, let me see your papers to see who really represent the players.  The Major League got it. They got documents of who represent the players, and yet, they turn their back on the organization, on me, because of some of the other players, some of 'em saying the same thang you saying about me playing and which doesn't even come into play.
Speaker 1: Okay, well it sounds awful complicated.
Speaker 2: It is, it's complicated. It'll be that way until we die, but what I have done, and I've done it in that book ['Secrets of the Negro Baseball League'] and that DVD that I'm gon' give you a copy of. I have made sure that the true history, the documents to prove its passed down to my young people and they gonna know the true history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what Mr. [Sherwood] Brewer wanted me to do and [William] Bobby Robinson wanted me to do and [HM Ted] "Double Duty" [Radcliffe] wanted me to do and that's what I'm doing.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when, are, are you considering wr--writing another book at all?
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What I do now is I travel around the country. I ask my young people, I'm going to give you this history and I want you to research it much as you can and I want you to write about it and my next book sir is gon' be based on what my young people thought of this history after learning about it.
Story_ID: 128297
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know of anything.  I can't think of anything right now that I could have done differently because I contacted the, the, the commissioner of Major League Baseball. I contacted major corporations around the country asking them to help because we have the true history. We have the documents to prove it, but they have been out shadowed by these organizations claiming to represent us, who got the insides on how to get the things.  We, we were the players. We don't have that expertise. We can only go to Kenny Griffin, Jr. [Ken Griffey, Jr.] or to Barry Bonds or to some of those guys that say look, your grandfather played in the Negro [Baseball] League. We still have players living today that played in the Negro league and you know what they say to me?  "We, we have given. We give it to the museum. The museum, they don't give--?" " We don't get nothing."  "What?"  This is the kind of talk I get from talking to them.  1998, only thirty of us went to New York. We was, it's in the book. We were brought there by this organization. We don't--I done forget the name of the organization. They brought us there but they got in touch with Kenny Griffin, Jr., Barry Bonds, six or seven Major League players that donated thirty thousand dollars or more, and brought us to New York. They wined and dined us. They, they, they had a banquet, five hundred dollar plate. They brought us there, put us up for the night and flew us back home the next day.  They made millions of dollars. We didn't get one red cent.  So, if you went to Kenny Griffin, Jr. today and said, are you doing anything after (unclear), "Yes we did, I gave,"--he really think or thought he was doing something for the players or those players (unclear).  And that's why when I go now and ask them, they say, "We've done it already," or they don't do nothing because of the controversies.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, I'm gon' just ask another quick question and then maybe this'll--and that's about the all and detail about controversy but, when you look back at the history of the Negro league baseball players in this country what do you think is the most important, important thing I guess about that history?
Speaker 2: It was baseball. It was the--the Negro league made baseball what they are now calling America's greatest pastime.  I can truthfully say that from the experiences that I had, and from the talk, the information that was passed down to me.
Story_ID: 128298
Speaker 1: All right, go, go ahead and tell us about the monument.
Speaker 2: Well, a few years ago, I went to the Milwaukee Brewers on the idea that we would put up a historical marker representing the 1923 Milwaukee Bears that played in the Negro baseball league [Negro National League]. They were very receptive to this, and they worked with me on it and we do have a marker now. The marker is located on 5th [Street] and Burleigh [Street]. This marker represents the parking lot of the field, parking field where the Milwaukee Bears played and old Borchert Field [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] back in 1923.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the field?
Speaker 2: Old Borchert Field.
Speaker 1: Borchert Field.
Speaker 2: Borchert Field, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were telling me off camera that the Milwaukee Bears left town and moved to Dayton, Ohio.
Speaker 2: Dayton, Ohio, yeah.
Speaker 1: Where they became the Dayton Marcos?
Speaker 2: Marcos, right.
Speaker 1: That's in 1923?
Speaker 2: 1923, when they moved.  No they moved in 1924--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --They played here in 1923.
Speaker 1: Okay became the [Dayton] Marcos. That's, that's interesting. I, I'm from Dayton [Ohio] and we were talking about the Marcos--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --And you were telling me the history--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Of it, but, so is, is that the only Negro league team that played in Milwaukee [Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: No, not the only one that played. That was the only one that, that, that was the only team here.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I meant.
Speaker 2: See a lot of the team played here. You know, I asked the question like you. I said now, 1923, it couldn't have been too many black people in Milwaukee and I was told that whenever the Negro league team played at old Borchert Field, they drew the overflowing crowds.  So, Mr. [Andrew] Rube Foster thought by putting a team here, they would support it.  But you see, they could only play when the, the other team was out of town which wasn't too many games, so it wasn't enough games to support the team.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the name of the old minor league team here was the [Milwaukee] Brewers right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Milwaukee Brewers.
Speaker 2: The Brewers and when they was out of town is when the Negro league Bears played.  And it wasn't enough game for them to survive, so they only played one season. The last three games was played--they didn't have enough players to--because back then the contract were not binding so another team would offer a player more money and that's where he went, so they didn't have enough players to finish out the season so the Chicago American Giants came over here and played one game and the Kansas City Monarchs played the other two games to finish out the season, 1923.
Story_ID: 128299
Speaker 1: So what you're also saying here is that, the Negro league baseball teams had free agency I guess, in a sense--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Before the Major Leagues--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --'Cause the Major Leagues, if you sign a contract you were owned by the team.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And you couldn't play anywhere else.
Speaker 2: That's right.  But back then--see that's how, in contrary to what they say about [LeRoy] Satchel Paige and this is something else that was handed down to me.  Satchel got his name--Satchel played on over two hundred different teams, and he got his name because whatever team would offer him the money, he picked his satchel up and he went, so he got the name of Satchel Paige.  Actually, LeRoy lost money by going to the Major Leagues because he was getting more money barnstorming around the country. People wanted to see him.  They heard about him, read about him--the greatest pitcher ever lived so they would come out just to see him play.  Matter of fact, the mil--the Atlanta Braves used that to their benefit and this is another thing you ain't gonna find written down, that was handed down.  Satchel, they gave him at age of forty-two when he went to the Majors, so at nineteen--when he was sixty-five years old, he needed three months of playing time in the Major Leagues to get his pension, so the Atlanta Braves took advantage of that.  They hired him and they had heard about the barnstorming days when they would put a rocking chair by the dug out for him, 'cause this, you know, his age. They didn't know how old he was, so the Atlanta Braves took a rocking chair, hide him for three months, took a rocking chair and put it out by the dugout and that's where he sat until he got his three months in.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Thousands and thousands of people came out to see that, see, just to see him sitting in that rocking chair.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but just for the record, I just wanna tell anybody watching this that he actually played for the Cleveland Indians in '48 [1948]?  I think it was, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: I got--
Speaker 1: And then for the--
Speaker 2: --I got the program where he signed with the, with the Saint Louis Browns.
Speaker 1: Okay, that would--
Speaker 2: He went to Cleveland in 1948.
Speaker 1: Okay so he signed with the Browns first?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And th--then he--
Speaker 2: He went to Cleveland.
Speaker 1: The old Saint Louis, where they now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the old Saint Louis, right. He went to, I think, Philadelphia [Stars] wasn't it?  But anyway, he went to Cleveland and, you know, it was said, Mr. [James "Cool Papa"] Bell told me, (laughs) he said old Satchel, he called him old satchel, he said, the owner of the Cleveland Indians said, "Hey Satchel, we gotta put something on here. How old you are."  So Satchel said, "I can't tell you how old I am. I never knew how old I was."  And they said, "Well we gon' give you a age Satchel. We gon' say you forty-two." He said, "Okay."  So he accepted the age of 42 with the Cleveland Indians and that's how that started.
Speaker 1: Now, what's, what's interesting is that he came back twenty years later or so, well, I guess 1966 or between '66 [1966] and '68 [1968] and played for the Oakland A's [Athletics] for [Charles] Charlie Finley out in Oakland [California].
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah.  Mr. Finley, I--he must've had somethin'--
Speaker 1: No, no, in Kansas City [Missouri], I'm sorry, in Kansas City--
Speaker 2: --Yeah, he must've had somethin'--
Speaker 1: When the A's were there.
Speaker 2: To do with the, with the Cleveland Indians back in that days, wasn't it?  I don't know, I--
Speaker 1: But he's with the Indians in the '40s [1940s], and then I don't know how long he stayed but he came back and played for Charlie Finley's A's.  I think they were in Kansas City then.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: In the mid '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --He played a season or two with the A's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he probably--
Speaker 1: --And he struck people out.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was still good, yeah.
Speaker 1: Interesting.
Speaker 2: I never--I saw him play, pitch but I, I can imagine what that man was like when he was twenty years old, twenty-five years old.  I do know Mr. Bell told me that, I think it was 1930 somethin', Bob Feller and him pitched against each other in the, one of those games or in the Negro league ball player and Satchel beat, beat him--no [Jay] Dizzy Dean--he beat him one to nothing in eleven innings and Dizzy Dean still talked about him bef--, I don't know if he's still living or not but he talked about it for many years about, only three great pitchers, that was him, his brother and Satchel Paige, (laughter) yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Satchel was, he was, you know, they, they talked about him calling the outfielders in. He didn't do that in the Negro league, only when he barnstorming around. In the Negro league, you got some players living now, hit home runs off of Satchel like they own him, living today.
Speaker 1: And what you're referring to is him actually--
Speaker 2: He would--
Speaker 1: --Telling his outfielders to sit on their gloves while he pitched to somebody cause he knew he could get them out.
Speaker 2: --He would tell 'em to come into the infield, but he was barnstorming around the local teams like we were when we played, you know.  They couldn't touch him, you know (laughter. He knew that, yeah.  Satchel would walk over to the dugout and tell the opposing team, "Hey manager, I'm gon' strike out the first six you send up to the plate," and then he would go out there and do it (laughter).  Yeah, that was Satchel.
Speaker 1: He'd give the seventh guy a break, huh?
Speaker 2: Yep, (laughter), yeah.
Story_ID: 128300
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now we always ask this question. What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community in general?
Speaker 2: Well my hope, being an ex-ball player is that more young black would participate in the game of baseball. More.  There has been a decline in recent years.  There's no one reason why, but I'm hoping, and I'm wishing and I'm trying to come up with a, a way now to start before we all gone, the, the living Negro league ball players, this is something I'm getting ready, I'm gon' let you in, on a little somethin'. I'm getting ready to present this to the Major Leagues.  Four year olds now can go to the Little League.  I wanna setup a program where the living players of the Negro league around the country can get together and come up with a program to train four year olds and get them ready for t-ball.  That's my next program, project.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but my hope is that more black would participate in the game of baseball.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, 'cause basketball, football, you know seem to be all the--
Speaker 2: That seem to be the leading--
Speaker 1: --Preferred sports of the--
Speaker 2: --At this time.  But if we can come up with some program. See baseball is different than basketball. Basketball you can start playing in high school. Baseball is somethin' you gotta start out t-ball, or Little League, I should say because there were a time when there were no t-ball or Little League. Little League was start at twelve years old, or eleven--nine years old. Now it's start at four.
Speaker 1: Now is it because of the skill level required in baseball?  You have to have a higher level of skill to play?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think that's got nothing to do with it. I think it's the interest. I think they started that because of declining interest of baseball.  If you can remember a few years ago, a Little League were declining all over the country and the reason wh--for that was that the interest wasn't there.  So they felt by starting t-ball and four year olds, getting that interest that early it would continue on.  This is what my belief that it was the reason for it.  This is my reasoning for wanting to continue in, with the four years ol--four year olds.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Get them interested and hoping that would carry on.
Story_ID: 128301
Speaker 1: All right.  Now when you look back at all your activities as a player and as an organizer of--player of Negro league players later on in life and as a social worker here--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --What today do you see to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that I, I would think that being disciplined, having the right understanding about life at an early age will prepare you later on for things you're gonna come involved with to make you a better person.  But then again, the family structure, the way it is today, there's gonna have to be programs put in effect to kinda help this along the way.  I've always said that a family consists of a man and a woman. Raising a family consists of a man and a woman. This is what I mean when I--you got a lot of broken homes out there where the women they don't have the time to, to, to put with the kids 'cause they gotta work. Programs are put in force to kinda help along the way but, you know, I just hope in time that I will live--well the first thang, I lived long enough to see a black president--I hope I live long enough to see a program, effective program put in force to guide our young people in the right direction.
Story_ID: 128302
Speaker 1: Well tell us a little bit about your family. I know earlier, before we started, I met your grandson and one of your sons, I guess and so--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: How--how--how many children do you have and how many grandchildren?
Speaker 2: --I have nine bi--I have seven biological children and I have two adopted.  Out of the nine, I got twenty-three great-grand--I mean twenty-three grandchildren. I got seven great-grandkids at this point.  My two sons--out of my three sons--four sons, only two of them played baseball. Out of my granddaughters, I got one in college now, at the u--at the. She went to school on a scholarship to play softball, but she'd gotten out of it. Now she gon' be--last I heard she gon' be a F.B.I. [Federal Bureau of Investigation] (laughter) She was going into the F.B.I. field, but of all my grandkids and my son, I had one son do, be drafted by the [Milwaukee] Bucks as a free agent playing basketball. He would have been a number one draft pick by the Pittsburgh Pirates but he quit and signed the thing, but that's all in the past.  My grandson, now, the one you saw this morning, is my ho--only hope at this time. He is a star athlete even at four years old and he will be participating in the program that I'm designing for my young people.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, is there anything I have not asked you that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Well, I was married three times, four times. Twice to the same woman that I'm with now.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Ho--how does that happen?  I mean, you know. I've heard that before but that's, that's something that--
Speaker 2: Well, my first wife she brought, she bought--she went with me through baseball. She bore five children for me. She died. She passed away. Then I got, I went into a Samsonite wedding. I told you about that. I had one daughter out of that wedding. I packed and got a divorce. Then I got married again and I had one son and adopted two kids and one son, had one son. Then I got divorced from that marriage and I married the woman that I'm with now, who was with me when I went through all of this at the Kansas City [Missouri] thing and then setting up with this organization [Yesterday's Negro League Baseball Players LLC] who knows as much about it as I do now because she was with me, but she got so, I got so involved with it, so she said, "I'm gon' have to go another way now."  But then she finally came back later, a year later.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So we remarried again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I don't intend to get married anymore or divorced anymore.

Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And, well the last question is similar to legacy, but it's a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a person that stood for change.  A person that wanted to and tried to make sure that a true history, American history was passed down to my young people.  That's what I want to be remembered as, a person who worked hard to make sure that the true history and I, I, I emphasize the word true history was passed down to my younger generation so they would have the opportunity to keep this legacy alive forever.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well thank you sir.
Speaker 2: Thank you sir, it's been a pleasure, it's been an honor.
Speaker 1: Okay, same here.
Story_ID: 128304
Speaker 1: You're looking at a DVD that was put together by the players that are still living.  This DVD contains the complete history of the Negro league from the beginning to the end.  It also has a segment on how the baseball started, how blacks started in the, in baseball and how the Negro league started. This document--this, this a documentary. This is one of the items that's being put into the school system because this also contains a document, and the true history that we talk about of the Negro baseball league.  A lot of our history has been destroyed and misquoted. This straightens it out.
Speaker 2: That's good, that's good.  Okay, here you go.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me when I played. I was seventeen years old and this is a picture of me when I started playing with the Chicago American Giants in 1953 or '54 [1954]. This is the only picture that I could come up with and my wife had this picture along with the contract pasted in a scrapbook and I had the chance to get, to get a copy of it and this is what, the best picture that, that we could find of me when I played.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: Good, this is the book that I wrote. This book is called 'Secrets of the Negro baseball league.'  This book coincides with that DVD that was put together by the players. This book contains documents, pictures and things to prove what the documentaries said and this is why--one of the reasons it's being put into the school system, so our young people will know the true history of the Negro baseball league.
Speaker 2: Okay, tell us about this?
Speaker 1: This is an award that was given to me when I was put on the wall of honor along with [John] "Buck" O'Neil and James Sanders from the Birmingham Black Bears. We were put on the wall of fame with, with many other great ball players in the last thirteen years that was put on this wall of fame.  This wall of fame is now located at Holy Redeemer Church of God in Christ in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Speaker 2: Okay one second, let me try to get another.  Okay, I'm ready.
Speaker 1: This is an award that was given to me as a, as a black history maker that lives in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  I'm wearing the jacket that I wore when I played in the Negro baseball league. That's one of the few things that I own from my playing days.
Speaker 2: (Unclear), wait, wait--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --Wait just a second. Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: This was a photo taken in 1995, at--in Kansas City, Missouri, at the Satchel Paige Stadium.  They brought all of us together for the first time in seventy-five years. It was called the Negro league 75th Annual Reunion.  I felt pretty privileged to be there among such great athletes.  This is me here. I am located in Kansas City at the museum [Negro leagues Baseball Museum, Kansas City, Missouri] there as you look at those little white tags that we're holding, all of us. It's a number and that number is, contains the name, this picture--this photo is blown up really large at the museum and you look at the number, then you can see who the player was that got that number.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We have one more, okay ready.
Speaker 1: This is a drawing that was taken from one of the photos that I don't longer have. I don't know. They never did send me my photo back.  This lady wanted to do a portrait of me and this picture was given to her and she did this photo from the picture, which I never got back but, this is the only thing I have from my playing days. A photo of me when I played.
