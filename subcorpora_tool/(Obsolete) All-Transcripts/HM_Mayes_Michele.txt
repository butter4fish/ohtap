Story_ID: 605944
Speaker 1: I want to ha- start talking about your family because you were born in Los Angeles [California], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: But I saw--let's start with your mother.  Can you give her name and her, you know, what you know about her background?
Speaker 2: My--both my parents grew up in Memphis, Tennessee.  And my mother was pretty much raised by a single parent.  She didn't really know her father.  She ended up finishing high school and, shortly after finishing high school, she married my dad [Wilbert Coleman].  My dad had moved to Los Angeles by then and she followed him there, and they got married in Los Angeles--not in Memphis.  She worked through most of my life for medical people, doctors, so she worked for a husband and wife team from the time I can honestly think I knew she worked. So she worked for a surgeon and a pediatrician.  They owned the building.  We all lived in the same building, so the two doctors lived with their two children.  What would now be called a nanny (laughter) was in the middle, she took care of the kids.  And my mother and [maternal] grandmother [Emma Jordan], and my sister [Greta Coleman Moore] and my dad, we lived in the last unit, and we lived like there for probably five years.  So, she worked for them in one form or another.  Eventually, they separated their medical practices, but she ended up working for them for most of her medical career.  She was a lab technician.  She didn't go to formal school except for lab school, but everybody that I can think of called her for medical advice every night almost.  So, they got to get free medical advice which was always right.  I always wanted to get her off the phone.  She was disturbing me, but she was always on the phone, telling people what they should do for the fever, or the rash, or whatever else was going on.  And sometimes she would say, "You need to take the baby to the hospital," and that's what they would do.
Speaker 1: Now, she--her name was Geraldine.
Speaker 2: Geraldine Hooker Coleman [Geraldine Coleman].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did she talk about growing up in Memphis at all?
Speaker 2: Neither of my parents talked about growing up in Memphis, although I'd go back with my--my dad--I never can remember going back south with my dad, ever.  I would go back with my mom because she had family.  In fact, there's still family in Memphis on both sides, but my dad never went back.  He never seemed to want to go back, but they would never talk that much about issues beyond family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she--can you describe your mother, what kind of person she was?
Speaker 2: Very smart, very outspoken, opinionated, and I'd say strong willed.  And she kept a hand on my shoulder and my behind and my back (laughter), depending on what the situation required (laughter).  And so, she was very involved in going to parent teacher conference.  My dad would never go--it was always my mom.  Part of the reason was, my dad would work two jobs.  I didn't realize it then, but that's what was really going on.  She would be very much into what my grades were like, and what was I doing in school, and she would be talking to my teachers.  So, I thought of her as someone that I had to pay close attention to because I knew she was watching me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who my friend were, what my grades were, et cetera.  So, I think of her as somebody that let me have my space in a way, but was very consciously hovering.
Speaker 1: Monitoring what was going on.
Speaker 2: Monitoring what was going.  She would come home from the office.  She--they, they had evening hours because many, many of the parents would bring their infants in, in the evening.  So, she would come home.  That was one of her stipulations with the husband and wife team.  She'd come to work at nine, leave around four [o'clock], come home, and have dinner with me.  I didn't realize what was hap- and then go back to the office, and she required that.  This is after we had moved out.  When, when we lived in the same unit, it was easy.  She just had to walk up the stairs because the office was right below.  But when we moved to our first home, she said, "I must have dinner with my kids every evening."  And she did that until I went--probably until sometime in high school [David Mackenzie High School, Detroit, Michigan].
Story_ID: 605945
Speaker 1: How far back on, on her [Mayes' mother, Geraldine Coleman] side of the family can you go back?  Do you know, know about her, her parents, and--
Speaker 2: I don't.  My [maternal] grandmother, who lived with me, she came to California and never left (laughter), so she stayed with me from the time I was about six months old.  So she raised me because my mom was always working.  I never knew what it was for my mother not to work.  At the same time, though, my grandmother was not highly educated, (clears throat) excuse me, she would fix--I was royally spoiled.  I didn't do anything.  She did all the cooking, the cleaning, the washing--everything was done for me.  I just thought she was supposed to do it because she was my grandmother.  But she was, she was really someone that gave my mother the flexibility to work outside of work.  My grandmother, though, she never really knew what I was doing when it came to homework.  It would be my mother that played that role.  If you go back to Memphis [Tennessee], which again, is where many of the folks still are in my family, I don't know a whole lot except my grandmother's sister was very unlike my grandmother.  My grandmother never had a job that I know of--in her life.  She was with, she had three husbands at one point, and then she came to live with my mom.  So, her sister was the extreme opposite, very worldly, very much into the current events.  She knew enough about our background because one day I interviewed her before her death, and just sit down and talk with her informally.  She said, "Well, I can trace this all the way back to the Carter family." Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.].  So she said, "If you go back to Georgia," she said, "I don't know quite how," she said, "but I can go all the way back, and show you the genesis is at least that far," but I never knew any more than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember them talk- you know, how adults talk, do you remember any conversations between your mother and grandmother or--
Speaker 2: You know, actually, because my grandmother was very sheltered, I always felt that my mother was the mother.  She would tell my grandmother what to do (laughter), which was sometimes tense moments.  But, no, I never can really recall. She would say--her name was Emma [Emma Jordan]. "Emma, I want you to do this when the girls come home today," or "Emma, make sure this happens," but she was really taking direction from my mom.
Speaker 1: Was your mother the oldest of--
Speaker 2: No, she had a sister--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --excuse me, who actually lived in Chicago [Illinois] until what--she died in 1995.  She was the older sibling.  But my mom--I think it's interesting you should ask me that.  My mother's sister, Fay [ph.], was more like my grandmother.  She didn't work outside the home, was very much taken care of by her husband.  My mother always worked outside the home.  She was most like my aunt.  In fact, they said they mixed up the kids, that my mother should have belonged to my aunt (laughter).
Story_ID: 605946
Speaker 1: Now, your father, his name?
Speaker 2: Wilbert Coleman.
Speaker 1: So, can you talk about him?
Speaker 2: Very quiet man, didn't talk a lot, and--I guess that's what it means to be quiet.  He ended up--he had two sisters, both of whom have college degrees.  One was a teacher--well, they both were teachers ultimately.  One is dead.  The other one still lives in California.  And my grandfather [William Coleman] had enough wherewithal to send all of his kids to college which was unusual, but he had a stipulation.  He picked their careers, so he told his two daughters--my dad was the baby--, "You'll be teachers."  And they went off and became teachers.  He told my dad, "You will be a dentist."  And my dad looked at him.  I can imagine my dad now 'cause he was a man of few words.  So, he went off to college, and he realized he didn't want to be a dentist, so he spent two years in college and left, and moved to California.  So, he refused to become the profession, the only profession my grandfather said he would support him in reaching.  My dad was extremely mechanical.  We had a funny state- we have funny comedy he would always make.  He said, "I can fix anything but a broken heart." But he could do anything.  We would, we never had to take the car to the mechanic.  We never had to have anybody come fix the house.  It may take him forever, but he could do it all.  He was, he was very good artistically.  My sister [Greta Coleman Moore] is very artistic.  He could do--he could draw, but he never really did much more than work in skilled labor.  He came back from California.  The reason we left was to work in the auto industry because you could make a lot of money without a college diploma, college degree.  So, that's why (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In Detroit [Michigan]. In Detroit then.
Speaker 2: In Detroit.
Story_ID: 605947
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe your fa- now, what, what do you know about your father's [Wilbert Coleman] family?
Speaker 2: A little more, although it's curious because I was never as close to them geographically.  My grandfather [William Coleman] was a porter on the railroad until he retired, and he did live until his mid-seventies.  I think it was mid-seventies when he died from cancer.  And he would only come up to visit us every other year or so, and it was always an event because he was a disciplinarian although my sister [Greta Coleman Moore] got away with murder.  So, my grandfather would come in the summer, and maybe spend two weeks with us, and then go back to Memphis [Tennessee].  My grandmother--and I don't know, he was born in Mississippi, up, and he was one of many, many, many children.  I'm not sure how many.  I've forgotten now because I did go to Mississippi with him once.  But he, again, worked on the railroad.  His wife, my aunt [sic. grandmother], I never met, Sadie, she was Creole, and that was a very strange union.  My grandfather was very, very dark, blue-black.  My grandmother probably could have passed for white.  Now, to have those two people marry--she was Catholic, he was Baptist--I don't understand what they had in common except they were both, obviously, humans.  She died, as I understand it, two months after I was born.  They say she drank a lot.  That's all I know about her.  I do know that the family tree was traced.  Her name was Sadie Ricard [Sadie Coleman], so she was Creole.  She was raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and if you trace the family tree that I still have, it's--I didn't look at it before I came today.  I do know that the family went back to Jamaica, and that at some point, there was a union between the islanders and French people.  And that's how, and eventually, they moved to Louisiana, but I don't know much more than that about my dad's family.
Story_ID: 605948
Speaker 1: Now, you said you went to Mississippi with him [Mayes' paternal grandfather, William Coleman].  Can you, do you remember that trip, and how old you were?
Speaker 2: I do.  I would venture to say I would have been in elementary school, and I find it very strange.  Going to the South, I felt was a bit odd because I'd always been in the North, either California, but I don't remember California because I was less than two when I left.  But I was always in Detroit [Michigan], and there were never any restrictions on my freedom that were discernible.  They were there, but you didn't feel them.  And I ended up going south, as I said during the summers with my mom [Geraldine Coleman].  And when I went south this one time, maybe I was ten, eleven.  My, my grandfather wanted to go visit his sisters and he had one sister who was a pistol.  I remember her in my head.  I can't even think of her name right now.  He wanted us to go but he said, "We'll just drive there and spend a couple days."  It was bizarre for me 'cause I went to a farm, and I wasn't using to going to a farm.  And it was--I would imagine it had an outhouse if I had to speculate.  And with an old stove, and she was cooking up a storm.  That's what I remember, but I don't remember much more about that visit.
Story_ID: 605949
Speaker 1: Now do you, your fa- well, let me ask you about your parents.  Who do you think you're most like?
Speaker 2: My dad [Wilbert Coleman], and people will probably pause when I say that because I told you he's very quiet and I don't seem very quiet, but if you know me at all, my innate sense is to be an introvert.  I've learned not to be because you don't get very far being an introvert.  At least, that's my opinion.  So, my mother [Geraldine Coleman] will tell you I'm most like him, that if I'm under stress, I become more and more quiet.  And he would quietly get things done.  My mother said I'm sneaky (laughter) somewhat, that I quietly get done what I want done with a lot of--without a lot of drama, so I'm most like my dad.
Story_ID: 605950
Speaker 1: Now, did your parents tell you how they met?
Speaker 2: You know, my mom [Geraldine Coleman] did--not my dad [Wilbert Coleman] again--you never would have any information if you waited for him to tell you, although he became an officer in the union.  I'll come back to that in a minute.  My mother said she hung around with all the older kids.  I should go back--my grand- my great-grandfather on her side, bought up all the property on one street, so everybody had a house.  All of us kids had a house, and he expected them to all live there.  This is a bit unusual as well.  And so, the kids had a very strong bond even though there was a large difference in age.  So, one of her first cousins, Jean [ph.], Jean just died fairly recently.  My mom especially liked hanging around Jean, not her sister, Fay [ph.], but Jean.  And as a result of hanging around Jean, my dad noticed her because she wasn't--my dad was five years older, so they wouldn't have been in the same social.  And that's how they ended up meeting because she was hanging around older kids.  That's what I remember.
Speaker 1: So, your grandfather had a compound before there were compounds.
Speaker 2: He, too, and they just broke it up because the--most of the family no longer wants to live there.  And my [maternal] grandmother [Emma Jordan] had her own house.  She, I said she never worked.  He gave her the house.  That's where she lived with her various husbands, I guess (laughter).  Nope, never, she never had to work, but she had a house.
Story_ID: 605951
Speaker 1: Now, let's take you--well, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: That's a, that's a question I've not thought about before.  I think more around elementary school time, I would say around the time I started school 'cause we moved as I--and the reason I'm pointing to that is I remember at some point, living with a relative of my parents [Geraldine Coleman and Wilbert Coleman] when we moved from California.  I can remember that 'cause I remember being in a crib.  And we lived in that house for a little while, and it must have been when we first got back from California 'cause, otherwise, it would have made no sense.  And that must have been to give my parents time to get their financial resources together, so they could rent their own apartment.  And then, I really remember the next transition would be this apartment building that the two doctors [Natalia Tanner Cain and Waldo Cain] owned, so I remember that.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--your, your sister [Greta Coleman Moore] is two years young--
Speaker 2: She's two, just twenty months apart.
Speaker 1: So, that's really around the sort of same time.  Do you remember her being born?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't even remember my mom being pregnant, so I don't recall that.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Well, you were young, you know, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was really young.
Story_ID: 605952
Speaker 1: Now, where did you live in Detroit [Michigan]?  Where was the first house?   Do you know the address?
Speaker 2: Oh, 12th Street [Rosa Parks Boulevard], 12th Street was in the so called riots, so the building is no longer there.  And we had moved out many years before that because we left that building when I was about nine years old.  So, let's say from the time I was maybe three until nine or so, we would have lived in that building, somewhere in that vicinity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you describe that house?
Speaker 2: It was small (laughter).  It had a kitchen.  My [maternal] grandmother [Emma Jordan] had her room.  My sister [Greta Coleman Moore] and I shared a room.  And my mom [Geraldine Coleman] and dad [Wilbert Coleman] had a room, so three bedrooms.  The dining room would be the only place we would have eaten, and a living room.  That's all.  And you had to walk up the stairs, there were no elevators.  It was one flight of stairs, but it had its own door, and its own back door, and a communal back porch where everybody could come out and you'd see one another.  So, and then down, you'd go down the stairs to the backyard.  And I had a swing set, so that was like a magnet, a kid magnet (laughter).  Everybody would come into the yard to do, to swing on my swing set.  So, all the kids in the area would be congregating in that space.  And then, behind there, was the back door to the medical office, which I frequently took advantage of because I wanted a sucker.  So, my mother had to threaten me on occasion not to knock on the door because I had not had an injection.  The suckers were for, were for little children who had injections (laughter).  But if I really wanted to bug her, I would stick my head around the corner and peek to see if I could get her attention and go (makes sound)--and I frequently got my sucker.
Story_ID: 605953
Speaker 1: You talk about the fam- you know, that really a lot of the focus was really in the family unit.  You had mentioned that earlier.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which is, you know, sort of normal, of that, that, you know, of that age and everything.  I'm just wondering if you, you know, what strikes me about your family unit is it's small--
Speaker 2: Very small (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, when, when there are, you know, it's a time when there are very large families.  Was there a sense, you know, from your point as a young person about the, the smallness of your family unit?
Speaker 2: I didn't notice it, probably because my sister [Greta Coleman Moore] and I were so close, so I always had a playmate.  I think you notice things when you're somewhere by yourself. And because I lived in a community with this gym set.  I never had to move so I'd have--in fact, sometimes even my mother [Geraldine Coleman] or my [maternal] grandmother [Emma Jordan] would come down and say, "All right, too many kids in the yard right now," you know, I'd have a flock.  So, I never thought about the fact that my family was small.  Also, the two doctors that my mother worked for, also had only two kids.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, and, so, we didn't stick out.  Then, if you go to my father's [Wilbert Coleman] two sisters, one never had children, and the other one only had two.  So, I'm a family of duos for some reason or zero.  And if you look at my mother's only sister, she only had one child.  So, I don't know what it was about our family because, again, it isn't as though we all lived in the same vicinity.  No one had a large family among my immediate family members--absolutely no one.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what struck me as you--you even were talking about, you know, that there were a lot of twos and ones, you know, the, the--
Speaker 2: That's it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) right, that's right.
Story_ID: 605954
Speaker 1: Now, tell me, what was the neighborhood like that you lived in?  Do you remember it?
Speaker 2: When the, the one where we lived with the two doctors (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 12th and--
Speaker 2: --on 12th Street [Rosa Parks Boulevard, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Very working class.  That's--people had jobs--everybody, except my [maternal] grandmother [Emma Jordan] (laughter).  She took care of us. But everybody else had a job, so people were going off doing whatever is they did.  I guess, if I had to speculate, my mother's employers, Natalia [Natalia Tanner Cain] and Waldo Cain, C-A-I-N, they may have been one of the few folks with advanced degrees in that neighborhood.  And I think that was because they owned the building.  Most of the other units, as I think back, would have been rental.  So, you had people who rented whatever space they were in.  And they were working class very, very much, like my parents [Geraldine Coleman and Wilbert Coleman] and my sister [Greta Coleman Moore], so there was no distinct--really no big distinction among us economically.  They'd have one car.  People wouldn't have a lot of cars.  They wouldn't have fancy cars.  And they were really doing the basics, trying to buy food, clothing, but not fancy things.
Story_ID: 605955
Speaker 1: Now, I want you to, I wanted to take you back to that time period, and I'd like to have you tell me what sights, smells, and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: When I think about smells, my [maternal] grandmother [Emma Jordan] was always cooking although she was not the best cook, but at least, I didn't have to do it (laughter).  So, just fried chicken.  My dad [Wilbert Coleman] was a superb cook, but he could out cook my mother [Geraldine Coleman], so we always liked it when he would cook, so he would do pizza casserole.  I don't know where he got that from.  And so, I remember those things.  There was, there was no such thing as fast foods.  On Saturday night, I remember my mother doing hamburgers from scratch, and peeling the potatoes for the French fries.  That was a big, big deal.  So, those are the things that--particularly when I lived on 12th Street [Rosa Parks Boulevard].  It was the one, few occasions when my dad cooked, and then just the food that was comfort food for us in many, many ways--not fancy, but comfort food.  I don't remember the sights and smells.  We never did big vacations or I didn't go to camp.  I wasn't a Brownie or a Girl Scout.  I never did--my cousins were--the two that I mentioned, Ivanetta [ph.], who, she's still alive, she's my oldest cousin.  I think she was a Brownie.  She was far more into what I would call the professional class of kids because, remember, her mother was a school teacher, and the man she married also had a college degree.  So, my father and mother were always not in their social strata at all.  They would get together, but they didn't socialize.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's the distinction.  So, I don't remember anything big about having vacations other than going to visit family and amusement parks.  I remember roller coasters and Ferris wheels--that's it.
Speaker 1: Where was the amusement park?
Speaker 2: Nearby, it was Edgewater [Edgewater Park, Detroit, Michigan].  I haven't thought about that name in so long.  I don't even remember where it was.  It was somewhere near Detroit [Michigan] because you could get in the car and get there and get back.  And so, we would beg to go to Edgewater and spend the entire day there.  That's what I remember.
Speaker 1: Now, you didn't, you don't--no, no smells?  Well, you mentioned smells (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sights, you said no sights.  You don't--nothing strikes you.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Sounds?
Speaker 2: They--again, nothing other than thinking about the amusement park when I went.  But in the house--oh, the TV, because you're always--the TV was always on.  We had a TV.  It was in black and white and it went off at a certain time (laughter).  But you remember the TV being, being on, but nothing in particular.  It was a fairly quiet neighborhood, even though it was on a busy street, it wasn't as though it was active all the time.  So, nothing, in particular beyond what I've told you.
Story_ID: 605956
Speaker 1: Tell me what you were like as a little girl.
Speaker 2: I think easily, easily bruised.  I could get my feelings hurt.  My sister [Greta Coleman Moore] couldn't.  She'd make things up as she went, still does, but I was easily bruised if someone said something I didn't like, or I didn't get the best grade I could have gotten.  My self-esteem was just not anywhere near where it should have been.  And my mother [Geraldine Coleman] noticed that.  In fact, again, my father [Wilbert Coleman] wasn't the one making these observations.  I would not say hello to someone when my mother introduced me to them.  I would just stare at them.  She said, "This is my daughter, Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes]." My middle name was, is Yvonne.  I know, I've stopped using it.  Yeah, "This is Michele," and she would call me Michele Yvonne, and I would always know I was in trouble.  And she'd say, "Would you please open your mouth?"  And the more she insisted, the more I would do this--my eyes would go--and I would look at you like this--I still do that.  And she became infuriated with me.  And she would take me home and say, "Why don't you say hello when I introduce you?  What is your problem?"  And, of course, I had no intelligent answer.  This went on all the way through elementary school.  When I got to junior high school [Tappan Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan], and by that time, we had moved into our first house, which was on Kendall [Street] on the northwest side of Detroit [Michigan].  She went to my junior high school, one of my junior high school instructors, Mrs. Siegel [ph.], and the two of them plotted about getting me into a speech class, and making me stand on my two feet, and open my mouth.  And that was the beginning of that.
Story_ID: 605957
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about some of your memories, you know, in those early years, you know, while we're on 12th Street [Rosa Parks Boulevard], just, you know, things that may be around, you know, holidays, it maybe around school when you're school age.
Speaker 2: I was very focused on getting good grades.  It would now be called a teacher's pet, which was not necessarily a good thing to be known for, because the other kids would tease you.  I was very skinny (laughter), so that was another thing.  Of course, I haven't developed much beyond that, but I would say, I was not the most popular kid, and not the least liked--probably right in the middle.  I ended up, as I said, I think before, really trying just to get along, I think, and it would be because of my shyness.  I didn't want to stand out one way or the other.  And my sister was such a--we went to the same schools, even though we were slightly apart and never in the same class.  Everybody knew my sister, even though she was twenty months younger than I am.  And she is just one of these gregarious, outgoing folks who she, as I said, she's an artist.  And so, I, sometimes I had to come to her aid, so she didn't get beat up.  And I have a very bad temper, a very bad--as quiet as I am, I have a temper I have to control, and I learned that early on.  So, when my sister would get in trouble, she would come looking for me (laughter) to protect her.  And I would say, "What have you done now?"  But I love her dearly.  I was, it was just something, she was a challenge to, for me to be around because we were so, so not alike.
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about that because you're so close in age.  Her name--
Speaker 2: Greta [Greta Coleman Moore].
Speaker 1: Okay, right.  And you're close in age, so that's what I want to ask you.  And I, I want to go back to that a little bit because you said, you know, you were naturally shy.  I'm wondering, what were you thinking.
Speaker 2: (Sigh).
Speaker 1: Because people, you know, there are sometimes a lot of thoughts going on inside.
Speaker 2: I think, I think a lot 'cause I'm always looking at people.  I learned early on, although I didn't know it, you learn more about people, watching what they do than hearing what they say.  And so, I was, I was very observant.  That was not the problem.  It's just that--and this is probably something that I had to watch.  Many times, I would bite my tongue because what came out would not be welcomed.  I'll give you an example.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: When my [paternal] grandfather [William Coleman] remarried, he remarried a woman who was the mother of the famous coach at Grambling [Louisiana Negro Normal and Industrial Institute; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana]--Robinson.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: This was his mom.
Speaker 1: I think, Eddie Robinson.
Speaker 2: Eddie Robinson.  And so, she had, you know, that was a big deal.  And they would talk about it, and so, she was trying to get to know the family because this is many, many years after my grandmother's death that he decided to remarry.  So, he brings her to Detroit [Michigan], and she gave me a gift (laughter).  And I said, "I don't like this."  You can imagine how that went over.  I don't mask, even to this day, very well what I'm thinking, and so sometimes I choose to keep my mouth closed.  Not a bad idea sometimes because it's very, very hard to take back words.  People have to speculate what you're thinking.  And so, I was not one who would rapidly blurt out things because I knew there was a penalty sometimes for doing that.  I don't know if that's everything was ruminating, but I remember very clearly telling people what I, what I didn't like about things.  And it wasn't because, again, I was outspoken.  It was--well, you asked me what I thought, so I'm now telling you.
Speaker 1: Now, what--your parents [Geraldine Coleman and Wilbert Coleman] whipped you?  Were you--
Speaker 2: No, I'd have to do something.  My mother, again, would go after my behind when my sister and I fought.  My sister and I would fight.  Mostly my sister would provoke me and she knew I had a bad temper.  I don't know why she did that.  And so, most of my encounters with my mother were over something I'd done to my sister--not externally, very, very, very rarely 'cause I didn't do most things externally that would have gotten me in trouble.  But at home, my sister and I would go at it--again, very, very different people.  We never socialized really.  Even growing up, she had her friends, and I had my friends, and then we would meet up in our bedroom (laughter), at night, but we didn't, we didn't play with the same folks that much.
Story_ID: 605958
Speaker 1: So, who were your friends?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had the same woman that is my friend to this day.  I met her when I was maybe eight years old, Valerie [ph.].  And Valerie and I have remained friends to this day.  I got an email from her the night President-elect Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] announcement came out.  She said, "We lived to see it," and then she made this comment, "Too bad both our dads didn't."  And I said, "They might have been speechless, but it would have been hard for yours to be that way."  Her dad never stopped talking and neither has she.  So, I stayed very close to a childhood friend through all these years.
Speaker 1: That's nice (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And her daughter--I have no children--is like my daughter.  So, I was always very--in fact, her daughter now lives in New York [New York] which is where I just left.  So, I've stayed very, very close to her daughter through all these years.  We call her my goddaughter, so that--I figure she's half mine.
Speaker 1: That's nice 'cause it's not often that people have friendships that long a lot of times, you know.
Speaker 2: From the time I was eight or nine.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, when you, but you said she was very talkative, and you weren't talkative, so what was the bond?
Speaker 2: I've always, and, and again, I don't think I thought about this at the time I was growing up.  I always gravitor- gravitate toward people that seemed to have the same values I do.  So, she was never superficial, you know, who's got what--I've got more than you do.  The minute I hear somebody talking like that, I pull back probably as far as I can.  And so, as I think about it, when we get together to talk because she never went to college.  She's in college now as she nears sixty.  But Valerie's parents, for some reason, it didn't work out that any of her siblings--she had three kids in her family--again, not a big, big family.  None of them went to college.  And I think Valerie is smarter than I am in terms of innate ability--always was.  But she never got that break, so she decided to go to college many, many, many years after.  But what was interesting about her is that she had--and this is, again, I'm thinking about it much later in life--she's got positive energy.  I don't like to be around negative people.  I don't like somebody who saps what I've got, and I like to be able to give as much positive energy back.  So, we played off each other.  We were different, but different enough to have something that was, some synergy between, between us.  And she talks--sometimes I'll say, "Valerie, I've had enough, I'm hanging up the phone now."  She's very fine with that.  She knows I've had enough.  And she doesn't get offended by the fact that I'm direct because here goes that directness again. "Okay, I'm tired of talking now."  But I've always liked the fact that she was kindhearted, a good heart, and that's how I think of the people that I'm closest to.  I think they have good hearts.
Story_ID: 605959
Speaker 1: Were you a churchgoing family?
Speaker 2: Well, that's another interesting--kind of. My dad [Wilbert Coleman] never went to church in his life, never.  You could not pay him to go to church.  My mom [Geraldine Coleman], on the other hand, was, still is, but she wasn't super religious.  We didn't talk about the Bible in our family.  My [maternal] grandmother [Emma Jordan] read the Bible, but she wouldn't be talking about it to my mother.  So, we were in Sunday schools, and we did do events with the church, so I joined St. Mark's Presbyterian Church [St. Mark's United Presbyterian Church, Detroit, Michigan] when I was in elementary school.  And we stayed with that church really all the way until I went to college [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], but I wouldn't say that we were super, super religious.  Sometimes I'd drive my grandmother to church and drop her off (laughter), and come back and get her because she was adamant that she had to go to church every Sunday.
Speaker 1: Do you, do you know why you chose the Presbyterian--your parents chose that or your grandmother?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't, I've always, I've thought about that a lot because there was no Presbyterian in our family.  It was Baptist and Episcopalian, and the reason it was a Episcopalian was my father's sister [Katherine Coleman House (ph.)], the one he was closest to, left the Catholic church--go back to what I told you.  My grandfather [William Coleman] on his side was Baptist, and my [paternal] grandmother was Catholic.  I think there was a lot of tension between them if I had to speculate.  The two girls--one became Catholic, one became Episcopalian.  The one who was a Episcopalian is the one my father was closest to.  She's the one that moved to Detroit [Michigan].  That's why we came to Detroit.  My mother put us in the Episcopalian church initially.  And, and all of a sudden, one day, she came and got--she said, "Well, well, we're switching churches." And I never asked.  And I ended up in a Presbyterian church that I, to this day, have never inquired why we did it.  She said something about it was closer to how she viewed her faith.  That's all I knew.
Speaker 1: Fallout with the church (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What, I mean they're all fallouts with the church.
Speaker 2: They are.
Speaker 1: I mean, I think, we switched church- you know, you switch churches.  We, we went from--well, anyway, we went from Baptist to Methodist to, to make them, and then they went to Episcopalian, so I understand.  Let me, do you think, what did you learn from the church experience though?
Speaker 2: It wasn't all--it, it's funny 'cause it wasn't all positive.  I'll tell you what I--I'm not a, a very religious person.  In fact, I'm really not.  I, I have not been to church since I left high school [David Mackenzie High School, Detroit, Michigan].  The minute I got out of my mother's house, I stopped going, very consciously.  And part of it was, I've seen in too many ways, how religion, and maybe I sense this in my family.  It seemed to, it seemed to divide people and I couldn't understand--probably if I did more study, I'd be more open minded--how something that is supposed to be so core to people be such a divisive entity to folk, you know, you, you don't talk about religion or politics.  And I, and I sensed that when I was growing up and many, as I said, my father would never go to church.  And, interestingly, one of the things I noticed in the church that I joined is I felt and I would--and it's interesting because I'm not close to any of the people I met in church.  I don't know where they are to this day--never asked.  What I sensed among the, the younger people that had a youth fellowship, where you did things in the evening to keep yourself out of trouble, there seemed to be petty competitiveness, and that's how I described it--very petty competitiveness.  And I've never liked pettiness, or what I sensed is meanness.  I don't join in it and I don't relish other people engaging in it.  So, I didn't find any of those individuals that I met is folks that I wanted to be around long term.  And so, that may have led a lot, maybe not, maybe I was looking for an excuse, to decide not to belong to a church.  The other thing I noticed was this, and this was probably the icing on the cake.  There was a lot of gossip about the pastor of the church, a tremendous amount, about whether there was a little affair on the side.  And it turned out, I think he might have been gay, oh, yeah.  And it was--they were more, I've never liked people who, who get all caught up in somebody's bedroom.  And so, I decided they weren't really talking about the things that I cared about, that the sermon was a one event, on a one day, on a Sunday, but where did it carry through the other six days of the week?  And so, I chose to divorce myself from organized religion.
Story_ID: 605960
Speaker 1: You said school was where you, you know, you've shined.  I'm wondering, besides your mother, who was the motivation for- motivating force behind, behind your wanting to get good grades 'cause you said that was very important to you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  It was important to my dad [Wilbert Coleman].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Even though (laughter), he didn't go to any parent teacher conference in my recollection, he always--when, when he came home, wanted to see the report card.  And so, he would confirm with my mother, "So everything is okay, right, Gerry [Geraldine Coleman]?" (Laughter) And she would say, yes, and we would then, you know, go back to business as usual.  But the other person that had a big influence on me was the sister that my dad was closest to--Katherine.  Her name was Katherine House [Katherine Coleman House (ph.)].  She died now twenty, twenty-one years ago.  I was very close to her.  So, I would frequently, especially after I got my driver's license, and even all the way through college [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], I would always go visit her and just sit and talk to her.  And if she needed something--she was ill most of her life, she had debilitating arthritis from the time she was thirty years old.  So, I would frequently go over there to help her do whatever she needed to have done, drive her any place she wanted to go, and we just became very, very close.  And because she was a school teacher, she would always engage me. "So how are you doing in school?  And what do you think you like?  And how was this going?"  So, I probably had an invisible hand that way because I knew that it was important to her, and she would always brag, which was a problem, to her children about how well I had done.  So, I was not exactly their favorite cousin, especially the boy because I was closest in age to him.  And he told me, "If my mother compares me to you one more time," I said, "Not my problem." But there was a little bit of competition between the two of us.
Speaker 1: Now what, how, how similar were you in age, you and, and him?
Speaker 2: About maybe fifteen months apart, so it was just enough that my mother would--his mother would throw up at every opportunity what I had excelled in.  And his father had died very, very young.  His father had kidney failure when we were maybe ten years old.  He might have been eleven, I was ten, something like that, so he grew up surrounded by women.  As I think about his poor life, he didn't have any male role model except my dad, and my dad didn't talk a lot.  He would only get called, and I remember this, when my cousin, Billy [ph.], had done something really, really bad.  My mother would call my dad to come over.  But he grew up around all women, so that had to be very tough for him.
Story_ID: 605961
Speaker 1: Now, the, the practice, the, the medical practice there, how--you talk about, you know, getting, you know, a, a suck- sucker, but what--how aware were you, and you talked about your mother [Geraldine Coleman] consoling people, you know, at all the time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep.
Speaker 1: But how aware were you of who was coming and going, you know, medical issues or things being discussed or people dying?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, I was aware of it because my mom would, again, she, she could have been a doctor.  I am thoroughly convinced in another point in time.  And so, I knew when things were very, very serious, she typically would try to shield me from that.  I could tell because the whispering would start.  I think the more--less stressful concerning emotional things, she would discuss openly, but they didn't necessarily sit around and talk about, you know, So and So is dying tomorrow.  They, they--I think, sheltered from us that but, remember that the two practices were pediatricians--a pediatrician and a surgeon.  The surgeon was performing operations in the hospital, so I wouldn't necessarily see those patients.  If they died, they might have died in the hospital, I guess, so I don't really remember Dr. Cain [Waldo Cain].  The male was the surgeon; the wife was the pediatrician.  I remember all the babies 'cause I loved the babies.  To this day, I love babies.  I don't want to watch them grow up, but I love them when they're little.  So, I remember hearing the babies cry, and sometimes my mom would come back and say something about the baby is really seriously ill, but I never knew the patients. They weren't necessarily folks that I played with in the neighborhood [in Detroit, Michigan], so I didn't feel any real emotional attachment.  I just knew that's what they did.
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother like the people?  Did she like the couple or was there tension between the family (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, yeah.  Let's see, how do you talk about that?  Eventually, when they separated their practices, my mom went with the surgeon.  There was too much tension between her and Dr. Tanner [Natalia Tanner Cain].  Dr. Tanner was the pediatrician.  And I used to tell her, even as I got older, I'm really not interested.  You choose to be there--tell that to somebody else.  She would come home venting, and I said, "Mom, I'm going to my room."  But she was very comfortable with working for Dr. Cain.
Story_ID: 605962
Speaker 1: She retired--my mom [Geraldine Coleman] got lupus. Took a long time for them to diagnose it, so she was very, very ill for a long time and, but she worked until--I guess, maybe her late fifties.  And then, it just became too debilitating to try to struggle to get to work every day, so she retired early.
Speaker 2: See, okay.  So your mother then, but how long did she live, live after that with the lupus?
Speaker 1: She's still alive.
Speaker 2: She's still, oh--
Speaker 1: My dad [Wilbert Coleman] is the only one who's dead.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: My dad died in 1999 from--everybody in my family has kidney failure.  My dad was on dialysis from kidney failure.  He had high blood pressure that was uncontrolled.  He didn't like going to doctors--isn't that ironic?  Never, I never knew when he went to a doctor unless it was something very, very bad, but he eventually died from the after effects of being on dialysis 'cause it's a huge drain to be on that machine constantly.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: My aunt [Katherine Coleman House (ph.)], the one that he was closest to, his sister, oldest sister, she also has kidney failure.  And my mom had, had kidney failure from lupus.  So, I've been around, as I think about it, very, very sick people because I said, as I said to you, I think, earlier, my aunt was sick from the time she was thirty.  She was on steroids trying to control the pain because she was a single parent for most of her two kids' lives because her husband died when, when they were ten and maybe twelve.  So, she was the sole breadwinner.  So, she struggled, and I watched her struggle to get up every day to go and teach, and she had a very, very high pain threshold, as does my mom.  My mother defied lupus.  She got up, she had shingles, and she had, she was on steroids--everything you can imagine, and she kept going to work.  And, eventually, when they diagnosed it, it was so--had progressed to the state where it had destroyed her kidneys.  And even then, she refused to go on dialysis, so she had a kidney transplant.  My father would not.  And her kidney transplant now is twenty-one years ago, twenty-one years ago (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wow.
Speaker 1: --and she's still kicking.
Story_ID: 605963
Speaker 1: So, I've been around sick people.  And I, I will tell you something else that probably really informed my view about people and their worth.  When I moved to Kendall [Kendall Street, Detroit, Michigan], which is where I spent most of my formative years, I guess, what, from nine until eighteen, there were two disabled kids on my street, severely disabled.  One was physical, and I don't even know to this day what her illness--she died not that long after I got to know her, maybe three years after.  And then, the other one had a mental disability, and I would go play with them.  And I was one of the few kids on the street that would go play with them.  So, and Donnie [ph.], I remember her name, and Rosalind [ph.] was the other.  Donnie, her upper body was the only thing that developed.  Her lower body was like that of an infant.  So, she would call me, so I'd pick her up and take her outside because her mother didn't want her to go outside by herself, so I'd go spend time with her.  And it never bothered me to go spend time with her.  But the other kids, it was like, I'm not going over to her house.  And then the other playmate I had was Rosalind, and I actually became very protective of her because she did come out, and people would taunt her and I've never liked people who did that.
Speaker 2: Now Rosalind, what was her disability?
Speaker 1: I think she was born with some mental defect.  She has the capacity of about a twelve year old, I would say, not much more than that, just enough to get in trouble, but I spent time with her and I saw her.  I went home for some reason.  This would have been when I was in my late, probably I was around thirty.  And her mother said something, she said--and Rosalind, Rosalind came over to me just like it was when she saw me last which was many, many years earlier.  And we hugged and it was as though Rosalind remembered me from when I was a kid 'cause that's how, that's how she thinks.  And her mom said, "Well, you always would play with her."  And so, I find people that are trying to find differences among you, that's where I probably part company.
Story_ID: 605964
Speaker 1: So, now, when you moved over to--
Speaker 2: Kendall [Kendall Street, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: --Kendall, can you describe that neighborhood?  How was--you said you have a house now, right?
Speaker 2: Yep.  We're all the same family unit--my [maternal] grandmother [Emma Jordan], my sister [Greta Coleman Moore], my mom [Geraldine Coleman] and dad [Wilbert Coleman].  It was predominantly--not exclusively--predominantly single family homes.  Ours was one of the smaller homes on the street.  There were homes that were much, not much larger, but noticeably larger, and there were rental units.  So, Donnie [ph.], the woman, the little girl who had this deformity of her lower body, lived in a rental unit and, eventually, that's why she moved away.  But most of the homes were single family homes, very much non-professionals, white col- not white collar, if you use that phrase, but blue collar, I would say.  So, the couple across the street, the husband was a chauffeur.  I don't know for whom he worked to this day, but he was a chauffeur.  I never figured that out.  It took me a long time to figure out what he did because he had a suit on every day, but he never put the hat on.  And once I saw the hat one day, and I said, oh, it's a chauffeur's hat, so I don't know for what family he worked.  The other people were just various bus drivers, everything.  In fact, my dad was a bus driver for a while, but they were every day.  Now, the one couple that lived next door to me, the husband was--I don't know what he did.  He worked in a factory, but I'm not sure what he did.  And his wife was a school teacher and so, she was a bit of a taskmaster, too.
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember what your parents were saying about the move when you, you made the move, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I do.  First of all, they were really, really proud about going into this house.  Of course, I was thinking about leaving my friends behind, and they're talking about we're going to a new house, and I wasn't that happy about it.  Valerie [ph.], my childhood friend, for example, was not coming along with me.  I guess, as I think about it, it was predominantly a white neighborhood.  That quickly changed, very, very quickly, but when we first moved in, there were not that many blacks on the block.  And I can't tell you over what period of time, but it eventually turned to all black families.
Story_ID: 605965
Speaker 1: Now, this is about 1957, you think?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Um-hm, um-hm. Now, with--so can you tell me your schools?  That's what, like--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when you were on 12th [12th Street; Rosa Parks Boulevard], what was the school there and when you moved, you know?
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, Thirkell [Thirkell Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] was my elementary school, if I'm not mistaken, that was on 12th Street.  Then I went to the elementary school called MacCulloch [MacCulloch Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] when I moved to Kendall [Street].  Then I went to Tappan Junior High School [Detroit, Michigan], and Mackenzie High School [David Mackenzie High School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tappan is T-A-P-P-E-N?
Speaker 2: A-N.
Speaker 1: A-N, okay.  Now, teachers. Who was influencing you in those schools? Like was there someone, you know, in the elementary school that inf--
Speaker 2: I don't remember that many of my teachers--I remember two in particular.  One was my speech teacher, but that would have been junior high.  But in elementary school--and I don't even know why I remember this one because I don't know what she taught me.  And she died before I graduated from elementary school, but for some reason, I just gravitated toward her.  And I'm struggling again to remember what the topic was that she taught, but I missed her terribly 'cause I remember she went out ill and she came back for a second, and then she left again.  And I just don't recall why she stuck out in my mind.  The other teacher that I do remember--there's a third one--was my Latin teacher, my language teacher.  And why do I remember her?  She was Irish, and I heard her talking about just things about the Northern Ire- you know, the Ire- the whole thing about Northern Ireland, and the war over there and how divisive it was, and she spent a lot of time on that, talking about that war.  I don't know if this, if she was first generation American, but it always stuck out in my mind how she was talking about Ireland.  And the other thing I remember in her class, and maybe it's because of where he sat, is that's the first time I ever remember a classmate who died young.  So, one of my classmates died when I was in elementary school.  And that was a big deal because most of us had never suffered loss before and how we--there were no grief counselors or any of that.  But she was very willing to talk about that, and that was important to us as children.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, what's--so junior high, you said was--
Speaker 2: Tappan.
Speaker 1: Tappan.  So, did junior high start in sixth or seventh grade?
Speaker 2: Seventh.
Story_ID: 605966
Speaker 1: Your best friend, though, is she, she's in a different neighborhood, right?
Speaker 2: She eventually moved--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --closer to where we were because I think blacks kind of move in clumps or (laughter) something.  And so, eventually, she did move and--well, wait a minute--let me go back 'cause I'm confusing this.  That's when I met her.  I met her when I was around eight or nine, so it was when I moved--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that the friends that I left behind, though, they also moved, the ones from 12th Street [Rosa Parks Boulevard], they moved to the neighborhood as well.  But that's when I met Valerie [ph.] is when I moved into my first home with my parents.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you remember, would you guys go out to Belle Isle [Belle Isle Park, Detroit, Michigan] for picnics and thing?
Speaker 2: A little bit, but Bel- we moved to the, that's the northwest side--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and if you know anything about Detroit [Michigan], it's very divided.  I'm from the east side, I'm from the west side, and you didn't--Belle Isle was a little bit of a hump for us, so we didn't go out there that often, every once in a while.
Story_ID: 605967
Speaker 1: What about holidays and family gatherings?  What were those like?
Speaker 2: Big deals because the family was small enough to fit in one place.  And we always went to my aunt's [Katherine Coleman House (ph.)] house because my aunt, that was the school teacher that lived in Detroit [Michigan], had a very big house.  They eventually moved to Boston [Massachusetts]--big home.  I don't, in my mind, are huge homes.  It's probably not as large as it, as I think it is. But it had upstairs, basement, big dining room, and they had moved there before my uncle died from kidney failure.  That's another person who died from kidney failure was her husband (laughter).  I don't know what the thing is about kidney failure in my family.  In any event, we would all congregate in her house.  And everybody would bring food and there would be gifts, and then we, would invariably get into a fight as kids (laughter), comparing each other's gifts.  But we would spend that time together as a rule, Christmas and barbecues.  My dad [Wilbert Coleman], again, was a fabulous cook and he did barbecue, so everybody would come to our house for barbecues 'cause they wanted the meat.  It was not my favorite.  I did, I could tolerate it.  So, those are the days that I remember, the summer when my dad would barbecue, and then Christmastime when we always shared dinner together.
Story_ID: 605968
Speaker 1: I lived near Central, and Central High School [Detroit, Michigan] had one of the worst reputations in terms of not graduating people--
Speaker 2: But it was a black high school.
Speaker 1: --and it was a black high school.  And my mother [Geraldine Coleman] went, "Oh, no, you will not be going to Central."  And I was terrified of going there just because of all the rumors about what it was like.  So, she had one of the--one of my childhood friends, who lived with us on 12th Street [Rosa Parks Boulevard], had moved to the neighborhood, but far enough over.  She lived in a different school district, so I lied for all of my high school days giving that address.  And every time they called me, "Where do you live?" And I had to think, okay, it's Santa Rosa [Drive].  I don't remember the address, but it was Santa Rosa, and they tried their best to break me.  They said, "Are you sure you live on Santa Rosa?"  "Yep, I live on Santa Rosa" (laughter).  So, I, I did that because my mother wanted me to go to Mackenzie [David Mackenzie High School, Detroit, Michigan].  And Mackenzie was a diverse high school, working class whites, but diverse, so, that's where I went to high school because of that.
Story_ID: 605969
Speaker 1: So, now what subjects are you good in at this point?
Speaker 2: I'm very good at English and creative writing, which is somewhat the same; civics, not good in math, struggled with math constantly.  And my dad [Wilbert Coleman] was superb in that (laughter), but I didn't get any of that gene or at least I've never found it.  It must be recessive.  And I was pretty, pretty athletic.  I played, I, I played field hockey, varsity field hockey, varsity basketball when I was in high school [David Mackenzie High School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Field hockey is not what you hear a black people thing.
Speaker 2: I told you it was a diverse high school.  So, I learned to swim, and that was a big deal because when you're a black person, you do not like getting your hair wet.  It was like, I had people who never got in the pool.  They always claimed it was that time of month, and the gym teacher would say, "Do you ever get off?"  They did anything they could to stay out of the pool.  But I learned to swim, so I could do--I was fair at athletics, not a star by any stretch of the imagination, but good enough to play on the varsity team.
Speaker 1: So, now, how are you maturing?  What is--you know, who's influencing you during this time and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, who's influencing me (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and what are you aware of?  Are you like, you know, 'cause Motown [Motown Records] is happening also--I mean, big, big time.
Speaker 2: Oh, big time.  Well, I can't sing, so there would have (laughter) been no attempt for me to be a singer.  What I did do, and I forgot to mention this.  I started taking classical ballet from the time I was in elementary school [MacCulloch Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], after I moved to Kendall [Street].  Maybe, it was even before, I think it was, but my mother [Geraldine Coleman] put me in ballet, so I've always been able to dance, so my, my one artistic outlet--and I took fairly, fairly seriously--was to always in some way get that type of, of discipline and exposure.  So, I would go to, I would perform classi- you know, the little concerts they have for kids with their little short things going on--my little skinny legs sticking out.  That was a bit embarrassing 'cause I don't think the tights ever fit, but I was always in my ballet classes, and I did that for a very, very long time.
Story_ID: 605970
Speaker 1: In terms of who influenced me, I don't know.  My mother [Geraldine Coleman], again, very, very big presence because I announced when I was eleven that I was going to be a lawyer.  I announced it to the world.  It's very good when you say things out loud because it's hard to go back, and that made me and if you say something stupid, you may do it.  But I announced when I was eleven years old and in junior high school [Tappan Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan], I am going to law school. In this order, however.  First, I will be a, I will be a stewardess.  They were called stewardesses then because there were no flight attendants, so I can fly around and see the world.  And as soon as I do that and get that out of my system, mom, I'm going to go to law school.  That sounds good to me.  So, my mother said I stuck with that plan (laughter) until a huge airline crash happened, and I never talked about it again (laughter).  But I went to law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan]. And I have to laugh.  Several years ago, I was interviewing a candidate who'd been a flight attendant and gone to law school.  I said, "You're my role model" (laughter). But in any event, that's what I'd set my sights on.  People ask, did I have any lawyers in my family?  Nope, nobody I knew, although my mother tells me, and I don't--he's in a book somewhere that very early on, one of my relatives in Memphis [Tennessee], a gentleman, was a lawyer.  But it's not anybody I ever met, so how could he have influenced me.  But who, I think, influenced me the most are two people.  One was Perry Mason, don't know him either, but the other was a judge.  Go back to my aunt [Katherine Coleman House (ph.)], she's sort--her circle of friends are very professional people.  And one of the individuals that I always was around, particularly all the way through high school [David Mackenzie High School, Detroit, Michigan], he eventually acted as the person who married me, was a black Republican which was also a bit unusual back then.  He was very much a black Republican.  So, he didn't exactly mingle with everyone in the black community because he was dubbed a bit odd for being a Republican, but because he was, he got a lot of appointments, different things, because he was one in the few.  He was competent and good, but still, he was one of the few.  So, he got appointed to the bench and was a judge for--well, for--until he died, and he didn't die until not that long ago.  So, I was around him.  When I announced I wanted to go to law school, my aunt, the one, again, that had all these friends, helped me get jobs.  She knew who ran the different legal aid offices and the law firms, and she knew all of these black folks in the profession.  And she would say, "You know, my niece wants to go to law school.  Why don't you let her work in your law firm?"  I hadn't even gone to college [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  I was just getting into college, and they, they let me do it.  So, I was running errands, doing very pedestrian things since I was not hardly qualified to render anybody any advice--didn't have any training.  But thanks to her, she was constantly opening doors for me like that, that I took for granted.  It was like, "You know I'm down, you call them up and see if you can get me a job."  And she would say, "Well, let me see what I can do."
Story_ID: 605971
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Riot.  Where were you when it happened?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I do.  I had come back from my first year at college, I think, 'cause it was 1968 [sic. 1967], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Eight [1968], right, and you graduated in s- --
Speaker 2: And I graduated in '67 [1967]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I'd done my first year in Ann Arbor [Michigan] at the University of Michigan.  And I'd come home to work for the summer because, again, my aunt [Katherine Coleman House (ph.)] would get me jobs with various people that she knew.  So, I think I was working at a law firm as a summer clerk running errands for them, filing papers.  And my dad [Wilbert Coleman], remember he started out at the auto factories.  He left them because they were so cyclical.  They would do layoffs, and he wasn't on the line.  I told you he was very mechanical.  He fixed the equipment, but he was very, very disappointed and frustrated that he couldn't count on a steady income because all of a sudden, you'd be off because they had a changeover.  They didn't need as many cars being made.  So, then he went to work with the City of Detroit [Michigan].  He stayed working for the City of Detroit until he retired as a guard, and that's when he got involved with the union.  But, importantly, when he was working for the City of Detroit in 1968 during the riots, he worked in the projects.  They had guards, city guards that were always patrolling the projects, not normal police officers, but guards.  He had a gun and could, you know, do whatever that means.  And he saw, I think, some of the worst things going on, from patrolling in those projects.  And he continued to go to those projects throughout the entire riot.  So, he would come home, sometimes working almost twenty-four hour shifts, because it was just mayhem, chaos, and he didn't want us to know what he saw.  So, once again, when we talked about did I know about death from my mother [Geraldine Coleman]?  I never knew from my dad much about drug use, or prostitution, or people getting shot.  He wouldn't bring them--he was very quiet, but you knew something was going on there just by how tense and concerned he looked.  So, he didn't want me going out during the riots.  He tried to tell me, he said, "You know, they're shooting people."  I said, "Well, you're going out, what makes you special?"  He said, "Yeah, but that's my job.  This is not your job."  So, for a while, I had to stay away.  But, but come back to something we were talking about earlier, I was trying to understand why there was so much hate, and it isn't because I don't understand racism.  I mean, I do.  You can't grow up in this country--I think we have varying degrees of exposure to it because I didn't grow up in the South, although in some ways, the North is more deceiving.  But I couldn't really grasp--because what I saw, which was really concerning, was that they were burning down black businesses.  That's what was really happening, so when all the smoldering stopped, we had to live in what was left, and that's what was very puzzling to me.
Story_ID: 605972
Speaker 1: What I hear is always sort of an inquisition, which makes being a lawyer a natural sort of thing, but I want to go back to Mackenzie [David Mackenzie High School, Detroit, Michigan] to University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  What were your choices?  What were you seeing as your choices as you looked at schools and, you know, what was the, you know, how soon in advance did you make the decision?
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was it a guidance counselor?  Was it a family member?
Speaker 2: I had a--I was very close to my guidance counselor, but don't ask me to tell you who the woman is.  It was definitely a woman.  And I was also close to my gym teacher, very interesting, Ms. Carol Wack [ph.]--why do I remember her name?  And a lot of those people started saying to me, you can go to Michigan. And Michigan was the best school in the state.  I had gotten accepted for sure in the honors college at Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan].  I remember that because it was the honors college.  And, and my dad said, "Well, that's good enough." That's what he told my mom [Geraldine Coleman].  And she--this is my mother and her, her outspokenness.  She said, "Wilbert [Wilbert Coleman], let me explain something to you.  If we have to sell that car--," we had two cars at the time--, "if we have to sell that new car we got, that's what will happen.  She is going to Michigan," she said, "end of discussion."  My dad didn't open his mouth again.  It was far more of a struggle for me to go to Michigan in terms of the financial drain on them, but my mother just said, "It will be done."  And so, that's where I sent.  So, my guidance counselors wanted me to go.  I got in, and there were from my high school--I think there were seven or eight of us that were black that got into Michigan--all at the same time.
Speaker 1: So, it was a good class then?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, there were at least eight of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is a time, though, too, you know, in the early '60s [1960s] that the schools are opening up their doors to, to students, right?
Speaker 2: Timing is everything.  And so, there were on the campus, there were many, many people, faces of color.  It's a big campus though.
Speaker 1: Now, how large is that?
Speaker 2: Thirty something thousand.
Speaker 1: Wow, okay.
Speaker 2: It's a--and the concern, I think my dad had, is that I was going to get lost.  Now, I wanted to go to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California]. Ha, ha, 'cause my uncle taught there.  My aunt [Mattalyn Coleman Pitts] who lives in California--my uncle became regional director of HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development].  He was a big deal.  In fact, there's a building named after him.  He was extremely well known in the community out in California, and he was teaching at Berkeley.
Speaker 1: What's your uncle's name?
Speaker 2: Robert Pitts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, I got the bright idea that I would go to Berkeley, and my mother--that's where she put her foot down.  "You will not be going out to California."  I said, "Okay." I didn't fight it, but that's where I wanted to go.
Story_ID: 605973
Speaker 1: Now, how was Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] as a experience for you?  What was that like?
Speaker 2: (Sigh) Hm.  Overall, I think it was a positive experience and the reason I say that, I got exposed to people I never, you know, very wealthy people, people from different parts of the world, people with very, very different experiences from mine.  They couldn't, they couldn't understand where I grew up.  They would not have understood that.  And, and the comment I make here when I talk, when you talk about race, and how complex it is, and I don't want to be defined just by race.  I never have wanted to be defined just by race, but I do remember something very, kind of biting, that happened to me when I was in high school [David Mackenzie High School, Detroit, Michigan].  Because I lived so far away, I didn't have a bus I could take.  That's one of the penalties I had for living outside the district.  There was no easy way for me to get home, but I would walk home--probably why I never got overweight because I had a long haul.  And so, one of the young women who was Asian, would walk home with me, and it was a long walk and so, we would talk.  And all of a sudden, I said something about, "Well, you could come over to my house, or I could come over to yours," and all of a sudden, a wall came down.  And she eventually said, "Well, I can't come to your house."  And that, I couldn't understand that. And then it was like, duh!  Her parents will not let her associate with you.  It's okay to walk home together, but, no, you cannot.
Story_ID: 605974
Speaker 1: So, when I got to Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], I see all these diverse faces, you know, Asians, Hispanics, you name it, and it was pretty freeing, 'cause, number one, I lived away from home.  This is the first time now I'm totally away from home.  I didn't even hiccup.  My parents dropped me off.  I waved and I walked back.  My mother [Geraldine Coleman] apparently had, you know, her flood of tears.  I never saw them--I kept going.  So, I was never somebody who called home every day.  I doubt if I would have texted message if I had a phone.  I was pretty--again, independent.  I--it was very, very competitive though (makes sound), very competitive.  I thought I was competitive--well, when you're around people where everybody is, you're like saying, oh, my god, am I going to flunk out?  It was a very trying first semester because the young woman they put me with, I never saw.  She never came to the dorm room.  She dropped off her stuff and disappeared.  Her father was a professor at Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan], yet who--I'm thinking about things now.  She, I think, she was into drugs, quite frankly, and living with some guy.  So, she, she drops off her stuff, and I get the phone calls from her parents. "Why, well, I don't know where she is.  In fact, I don't even know her" (laughter).  And, eventually, in the middle of the semester, her parents show up, pack up her room, and I never saw her again.  So, I'm sitting there trying to study.  I loved having a single room, but not for that reason because I couldn't understand--how can you come to this university costing all this money, and have all this opportunity, and you're kind of this mystery student squandering this opportunity?  But that was my first semester at Michigan.  And then, I got mono [mononucleosis]--I mean, very bad case of mono.  And I was--oh, I'm, I'm going to be too sick.  Again, I would just keep working.  But my mother's, my mother's, again, around doc- she said, "Something is wrong with you."  And, sure enough, I had to literally come home.  I was--they almost hospitalized me, it was so bad.  And, eventually, I said, "Okay, but I can't miss this semester," so my mother tried to get me back in health, and then she shipped me back to campus.
Story_ID: 605975
Speaker 1: So, that was the other thing that happened my first semester, but otherwise, I would say I found a cluster of people in my dorm.  I was in Mary Markley Hall, and there were enough people from my background--blacks, some people far less well off financially that we found a common bond, and we would support each other, and that's what happened.
Speaker 2: Now, did University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] have a large black population at the time?
Speaker 1: It was noticeable, but I don't know if they would characterize it as large; it was noticeable.  We weren't just a rounding factor, at least not in my dorm, not in the--it was a freshman dorm.  So, you were, there were only first and second year students there.  And there were enough of us to share meals together, go out and socialize together.  There was a lot of pledging.  I don't belong.  I just, you know, I never wanted to.  I got a lot of pressure from the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], and who's the other group--you're going to kill me.
Speaker 2: AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority].
Speaker 1: AKA--and I went, not interested.  All my friends pledged--I was the only one who didn't.  And I said, you know, what?  I like you both.  I don't--because there was, again, a lot of competition among the fraternities and sororities, and that didn't appeal to me.  But I said, you know, what, I'm not registered, so to speak, I'll just play with all of them.  But other than that, I think people were trying to help folks get through the experience, and it was harder for some than others.
Speaker 2: You mean, in, in school?
Speaker 1: (Nods head).
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 605976
Speaker 1: But do you think all the students came in at the same level academically as you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.  Oh, in fact, I had to start the summer before, three months before, and take some, like (gesture) remedial classes.  I remember that.  I said, "Okay, whatever."  I didn't feel stigmatized.  I just said, "Tell me when to show me up and I'll be there," so I took--I don't know what class it was now, a couple of classes, and then, went into the school year after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the mono [mononucleosis], how long did that keep you keep out of school?  You didn't say the--
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I just know it was a painful experience and quite unexpected.  I don't remember, but it wasn't enough that it interfered with my making it through the semester.  I didn't have to drop any classes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think I ever dropped a class the entire four years [at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], so it wasn't that serious, but it was serious enough that they almost hospitalized me, but I was a very strong little person.  That, I get from my mother [Geraldine Coleman]--high pain threshold, so that's why she was stunned that I didn't show up at her door one day looking at--I was dead sick by the time they got to me.  If they had probably diagnosed it sooner, I probably would have healed sooner, but it wasn't enough to stop me from finishing my classes.
Story_ID: 605977
Speaker 1: So, what are your favorite classes, and who are your favorite teachers there?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, let's see, what are my favorite classes? Oh, speech. Can you believe it?  I took--it wasn't debate, it was actually public speaking.  And this is now going to tie back to something we talked about because I ended, ended up in a speech contest and almost won it.  I came in number two.  And Roger Short, whose name I will never forget, beat me.  After my mother [Geraldine Coleman] got me interested in public speaking, I became rabid about it.  I was like, oh, I like this 'cause that's the one time--it's like going on stage--okay, I'm on, and then I go back.  So, after the riot took place, I come back to school [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] from that summer, and I enter this speech contest and it was about the riot.  I don't remember, but I remember very vividly what I chose to focus on and 'cause I remember seeing this.  My dad [Wilbert Coleman] drove me around.  I was dying to see the devastation.  I was just curious and so, I said, "Dad, will you drive me around just so I can see it?"  I said, "I want to go back to our old neighborhood," which was really, really impacted.  This is 12th Street [Rosa Parks Boulevard].  I said, "Did our building burn down?"  I think it might have been burned down then; I'm not sure.  So, he puts me in the car, and we drive over to the worst part of that area, and I'm mesmerized.  The, the police were still in the corner.  And what I remember is this.  I said that while you can focus on the negative, I choose to remember this vision, which was a small boy, seven years old, who walked up to a white police officer, and gave him an ice cream cone.  I said, "That's the image that I choose to remember."
Story_ID: 605978
Speaker 1: So, I liked public speaking.  I liked English, loved to write fiction.  Of course, when you go to law school, that kind of has to be beat out of you, so I did a lot of, a lot of writing in fiction stuff.  I performed with the dance, the dance team.  I took African dance, now going from more, the ballet to modern and African with Vera Embree [Vera B. Embree].  She was really, really well known.  She was one of the few black teachers I had at Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  I don't think she was a full professor though.  So, I took classes, creative dancing classes, almost all the way through undergrad.  And I loved the freedom of doing that, and I did some acting as well, so those were the classes that I grav- I, I stayed away from math, not anywhere near them, a lot of classes on constitutional law and political science.  Those were my favorite classes.
Speaker 2: In undergrad?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I knew I was going to law school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 605979
Speaker 1: So, now, who, now, where did you apply to law school then?
Speaker 2: I knew I wanted to go to Michigan [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  Let me tell you how I knew that.  Oh, this is the funny--oh, my goodness.  In my second year at Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], I get a guidance counselor.  He says to me, "We want more blacks to go to dental school."  Maybe he thought I was my dad [Wilbert Coleman] (makes sound).  I said, "Dental school?"  He said, "Yes, you can be a lawyer and a dentist."  I said, "That's not on my dance card."  He said, "Well, you shouldn't decide that rapidly.  We're having, we're trying to increase the enrollment of minorities in dental school."  I used to walk past the dental school every day and that's all I did.  I said, "I know where it is," I said, "but why are you asking me?"  He said, "Well, this is the plan--come here this summer," and they paid me, "and learn to become a dental technician."  This was hard work--I mean a certified, licensed--I said, "A dental--." I never put that down 'cause I forgot.  I said, "A dental technician--how much?"  It was a lot of money.  I said, "Really?  Okay."  So, I go, (laughter) and become a dental technician.  I take all the training, and, and I studied, take exams.  They--okay, they said, "Okay, you're ready."  So, I get my little uniform (makes sound), with my little hat, and I go to the dental school, and I work there how many--did I work there a year?  Probably about a year or a little more after class.  I would finish my classwork up, and work there in the afternoon in the pediatrician clinic with kids.  Oh, they were the worst 'cause they were petrified when they came in to have their mouths opened and have these instruments go in them.  So, I did that, and then I said, you know what?  I really, really, really don't want to go to dental school.  I said, I am more convinced than ever I don't want to go (laughter)--but I did do that for a while.
Story_ID: 605980
Speaker 1: But after I did that, I said, now where am I going to make up this kind of money? Because the money was quite good.  I went to the same guidance counselor.  I said, "You know what, I'm tired of being a dental assistant."  I said, "Is there anything else you can help--?" I said, "I want to go to law school."  He said, "Well, let me see if I can get you a job in the law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan]."  I said, "That would be perfect."  This is a little bit like my aunt [Katherine Coleman House (ph.)] getting me jobs in law firms before I knew how to spell L-A-W.  So, he got me a job in the law school.  So, from my junior--'cause I worked in the dental school my sophomore year, I worked in the law school my junior and senior year at Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And I got to see some pretty depressing things--the students who were worried about failing, the stress.  I'm, you know, if the bar was here, an undergrad, it just went up incrementally, so--for law school.  And there were law students from all over the country--New York and California, Africa, so it was a very, very diverse group of minority students.  They weren't all African American by any means, but it was quite diverse.  But the thing was, you could just smell the stress.  And I was the administrative secretary for the Black Law Students Alliance.  So, I did all the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) BAL- BALSA.
Speaker 1: The forerunner of that--
Speaker 2: Of the- okay.
Speaker 1: --this is the local.  So, they had a group of law students that they gave money to, but you--the law school did.  It's like an affinity group.  So, they had newsletters and all this, and I did all the typing.  I could always type 'cause my mother [Geraldine Coleman] made me take typing.  It's another thing she did--I really resented.  I told her I didn't need to know how to type because I was going to college and be a lawyer.  She said, "That's nice, now go to summer school, and take typing."  I thank her every day.  So, because I could type, I got hired to be their secretary, so I used to work on the same floor as the dean.  I also worked on the admissions committee.  They had decided they wanted to increase the minority enrollment.  I reviewed every application of every applicant, organized it, and then gave it to the committee to see which--I did it all.  I didn't realize how great that experience, so I worked with the dean of admissions, and all the little people that were on this little committee, and I helped them organize every application that came in.
Story_ID: 605981
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, in law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], let me ask you this 'cause you said that was--you had upped the game in law school, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What did you, what, what is the course?  You took civil procedure--
Speaker 2: Your required courses (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Contracts, negligent--
Speaker 2: Criminal law--
Speaker 1: --torts.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  Were there any--do you (laughter), okay.  Well, you said that Perry Mason was your motivation for what?
Speaker 2: It--litigation, right.
Speaker 1: Right, litigation, okay.
Speaker 2: But there's nothing called litigation in law school (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.  So, did you, but there's civil procedure which is (laughter) (unclear), okay, well it's, you have to know (laughter).  There is civil procedure, okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But most people don't like that course.  I had a very good guy who taught it, but most people don't like that, you know, they--it's sort of a dull course.
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: But, but what, what course, what course did you--let me ask this.  Did you find law school or did you feel you were on a battle camp or did you, were you engaged?  I mean, did you find that, you know, I loved contracts or I loved, you know, torts, or I mean--
Speaker 2: Did anything really.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I say this and, and, again, it's reflecting.  In some ways, the fact that my [paternal] aunt [Katherine Coleman House (ph.)] and mom [Geraldine Coleman] made sure I got exposed to law as practiced was an impediment.  That's not what you see in law school.  And so, here I worked at law firms and legal aid and, and I even did interviewing of people that had murdered people because I was going to see if they could qualify for bail.  So, I was going into the bullpen with people that had just been arrested.  That was so real world that people were afraid because I was only nineteen or twenty when I was doing it, and I was never afraid of the people.  This was all criminal at the time.  Some of them were deranged.  Now they usually, the detectives would tell me, they say, "Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes], you can't go and interview him.  He--there's something wrong with him." But for the most part, they didn't shelter me.  I'd show up with my ID.  I'd say, "Okay, I'm here, and who did you arrest last night?" (Laughter) And I would go in and start interviewing.  When I got to law school, and this textbook, Socratic [Socratic Method], and I went, what is this?  Again, I heard about it.  I never sat in a classroom when I was acting as the secretary [for the Black Law Students Alliance].  I only heard the students bemoaning they didn't get a good grade, or they didn't like the professor, or they stayed up all night, but I never really saw how the subject matter was taught.  So, I now show up, and they all knew me in the law school, right. "Hi, Michele, (makes sound)."  And I show up there and I go, oh, my god, this is really boring (laughter).  Most of my classes, I did well in contracts and real property, interestingly enough.  I did not like civil procedure.  And I had a criminal law professor.  By the time he got through, I wasn't even sure what murder was.  So, they--I found it somewhat detached from what I had experienced for almost four summers.  Having said that, I said, okay, shake it off.

Speaker 1: Although I forgot, I did drop out my first year [at the University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Of law school?
Speaker 1: For two weeks (laughter), I'd forgotten about that.  Why am I remembering some of this stuff?  Yeah, I did.  I decided it wasn't relevant.  Remember the Black Power movement is raging.  It's like, what is this now?  This is such establishment, and I dropped out.  And my dad [Wilbert Coleman]--this is the only time he's ever been vocal.  He was really, really stunned 'cause I didn't tell them in advance.  I just announced it.  I think I might have done it by phone (laughter).  And my mother [Geraldine Coleman], for once, didn't know what to say.  And my dad couldn't stop talking--what a contrast.  And, eventually, I said, and I don't even know who or what persuaded me to go back.  They took me right back.  I don't even remember this now.  It's a blur to me 'cause it happened so fast, but at some point, I started to second guessing--did I want to be there?  I didn't know what else I wanted to do, but I didn't know if I wanted to be there.
Speaker 2: So because is really, that was sort of a disappointment, right--
Speaker 1: I think it was.
Speaker 2: --because you, you know, you were prac- in your thinking, all its action and now, it's all theory and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The drama, it's drama, it's tense, it's unrelenting and how, how demanding it is, and it was just probably frightening and intimidating, and the fear factor.  Am I going to fail--if you stop and really think about it.  Why should we know?  Why don't I get out before I fail?  And so, I went back, I went back to the dean of admissions.  He said, "Come on back."  He said, "We're delighted to have you." So they didn't even put me through any changes whatsoever.
Story_ID: 605983
Speaker 1: I was asking about how you met your husband.
Speaker 2: I met him when I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) His name?
Speaker 2: Jean, J-E-A-N, Mayes [Jean Mayes].  That's, I kept his name which he quibbled about when I divorced him.  I said, "Well, you insisted that I take it--I'm now going to keep it."  So, we ended up meeting in 1969 when he was an exchange student from Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] had various exchange programs, not just with Tuskegee, so I met him because we lived in the same dormitory, and that's how I met him.  And over the course of time, he left, and moved back south because he's from Columbia, South Carolina and school at Tuskegee, but decided to go to the University of Alabama [University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama].  And we kept up our relationship (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you said in econo- in economics?
Speaker 2: Economics.  And we kept our relationship long distance.  It became long distance almost our entire marriage 'cause I was married twenty-two years, but I bet you I lived with him no more than three.  So, we ended up doing this commuter thing.  If I'd known it would be, it would be an example of how our marriage would have been, maybe I wouldn't have done it.  And he ended up then graduating from the University of Alabama at the same time that I graduated from law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  We decided to get married on the same day that I graduated from law school.  And he was debating which Ph.D. program to join to study economics.
Speaker 1: And you got married on the same day, did you have a, a regular wedding-wedding or was it--
Speaker 2: Hm, what's a regular wedding-wedding (laughter)?
Speaker 1: What, I mean, was it a civil ceremony or was it a--
Speaker 2: The judge who, the judge that I told you influenced me, and helped me also get jobs, he was a criminal court judge.  Recorder's Court is what it's called in Detroit [Michigan], so I called him up.  His name was Henry Heading.  I said, "Judge Heading, I'm getting married, and I'd like you to marry me."  He said, "Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes], I have never married anyone in my life."  I said, "That's okay because I've never been married before."  So he came to my mom's house.  I refused to have a big ceremony.  I didn't want any ceremony, quite frankly, but it was in my mom's house, my mom's small little house.  And I invited all my friends from Michigan--white, black, green--it didn't matter.  And they all converged on my mom's little house on the same day I graduated from law school.
Speaker 1: Wow, so you had graduation ceremony and wedding at the same time.
Speaker 2: Well, the, the graduation was at ten [o'clock] in the morning, so I said okay, by the time we drive back, and I change clothes, people will be ready for the wedding, and then they can kill two birds with one stone.  Then, come for my graduation, they can see me married, and then they can go home. 'Cause people came from all over the country.  And it worked.  My mother [Geraldine Coleman] thought I was slightly insane, but she was accustomed to that by now, so she went along with it.
Story_ID: 605984
Speaker 1: So then, my husband was debating--should he go to Tufts [Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts], or the University of Alabam- not the University of Alabama--the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], or some other university?  I said, "Jean [Jean Mayes], figure out where you're going, buddy."  In the meantime, I had to take a bar exam somewhere, so since I was living in Michigan, I took the Michigan bar.  He then says, "All right, we're going to Boston [Massachusetts]."  I said, "Okay." I was pretty pliable.  The next thing I know, three days later, he says, "Nope, we're going to Champaign-Urbana [Illinois]."  And I said, "Where might that be?"  "Well, it's in the middle of Illinois."  I said, "Oh, okay." But I didn't have a license to practice.  I had nothing except my certificate showing that I'd graduated.  And I did pass the Michigan bar, but what good was that?  So, I then scrambled trying to figure out, what am I going to do while you're in grad school?  I tried to get a teaching job at the University of Illinois.  It just didn't pan out.  Eventually, I got a job teaching at Illinois State University [Normal, Illinois], which was a very interesting experience, because it was white kids that were from Farm Belt and black kids from the South Side of Chicago [Illinois]--a little bit like nitroglycerin sometimes.  But it was a very, and that was the first time I had ever taught, so I was scrambling to figure out, well, what does it mean to really teach?  And, at the same time, culturally, my classes were very, very different.  One of the classes I taught, which was very interesting, was legal foundations of corrections, prisoners' rights, and I had prison guards in my class.  And they had very strong views about the people that they were guarding and the things they were saying, and why do prisoners have to all, have all these rights?  And then, I had some kids from the South Side of Chicago who were defiant, saying how dare you say prisoners don't have rights?  And then, I had kids that got arrested, and were sent to prison.  So, I had it all.  And one of them who came to me--there were two who got into serious trouble--I said, "Well, it would seem to me if you understood my class, you can write your own script now and you will do time."  And that's what happened--he went to prison.
Speaker 2: So, so this, you like that experience teaching?
Speaker 1: I did, I did.  Teaching I did like because you know what?  It exposes you in a, in a very personal way because you're trying to resonate, and get someone to absorb something, maybe their own way, but they've got to learn it and be exposed to it to even have that opportunity to have the knowledge.  And they were challenging.  They keep you as--like, on your toes.  They ask you hard questions.  So, I did like it.
Speaker 2: So, you did that for two years?
Speaker 1: Just shy of two years.
Story_ID: 605985
Speaker 1: And then, my husband [Jean Mayes] decided not to get a Ph.D.  He got a master's in economics and we moved back to Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: So, you moved back to Detroit, and that's when you got the job working as the assistant in--
Speaker 1: Assistant U.S. attorney (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Attorney.  So, now who was your, who was the U.S. attorney at the time?
Speaker 1: A person who's still on the bench.  He is on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit].  Ralph Guy [Ralph B. Guy, Jr.] was, he was, he had just been appointed to the federal district court bench [U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan].  And the new U.S. attorney had not been confirmed because you got to go through the president's office to do that.  And so, I interviewed with both of them until they could figure out where the dust would settle.  So, I interviewed with Philip Van Dam, who eventually became my boss.  And that was because--go back to my black Republican.  These were, this was in a Republican administration when I got out, when I came back to Detroit, but Judge Heading [Henry Heading] was a Republican, remember?  So, he picked up the phone and said, "I want you to meet someone I think you might be interested in considering for a position," and that's how I got in the door.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was going to say now, this is sevent--
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-six [1976] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) seventy-six [1976] and let's see, who's president in 1976?
Speaker 1: Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Ford, okay--
Speaker 1: Ford.
Speaker 2: --so you have, okay, so this, so, you know, because I was going to say, was it--you might have had a difficult time, you think, finding something?  Well, you had Michigan background.
Speaker 1: I did (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Would you have had trouble finding something with the two years having taught?
Speaker 1: It was, it was off the beaten path.  First of all, I didn't teach at a law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I taught in an undergrad capacity.  Even though it was legal topics, it was not exactly a road map for a resume to give someone comfort.  Oh, yes, you, you should come in and do this.  I think I would have struggled, quite honestly.
Speaker 2: So, you liked working there, I take it?
Speaker 1: At the U.S. Attorney's Office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I had a ball.  I am still friends with people from the U.S.--to this day.  We literally on email together.  That includes now, my--one of my dearest friends died, the last U.S. attorney I worked for died at the age of forty-two, but Lenny and I were very close--
Speaker 2: What's his name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Lenny Gil- Lenny Gilman [Leonard R. Gilman].  So--
Speaker 2: Gilman?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So I, I started out on the Republican administration, then it became Democrat (laughter).  I was kept on because I wasn't in a supervisory capacity.
Speaker 2: Now, what area?   You were working in--
Speaker 1: Civil.
Speaker 2: Civil, okay, in the civil division.
Speaker 1: In the civil.  And so, Jim Robinson [James K. Robinson] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, what kind--oh, go ahead.
Speaker 1: --he started as, he was appointed to be the Democratic U.S. attorney.  And I did almost everything--a lot of social security disability cases, although they're not the most exciting.  But Detroit, because of the cyclical workforce in the auto industry, always had a large number, the largest in the country of disability cases.  We also did a lot of work for the [U.S.] Postal Service, tort, someone got hit by the Postal Service or in some way injured.  We had swine flu--you forgot the Guillain-Barre.  That also took place during my tenure at the U.S. Attorney's Office.  And then, I also did some criminal work because I chose to, and they let me, so I did some.  And a lot of drug seizure cases, where you forfeit the proceeds if they believe they can tie it to drug money.  And so, I did a lot of those cases as well with the Drug Force- Drug Enforcement Administration, so it was a little bit of everything.
Story_ID: 605986
Speaker 1: Now, how was the U.S. Attorney's Office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan] structured when you came in 'cause sometimes you do rotations?  I've heard that--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) sometimes you're, you know, assigned to a unit.
Speaker 2: I think that's probably more the, more recent way in which they manage those offices.  When I went in, in the late '70s [1970s], mid, late '70s [1970s], you were assigned to a division, criminal, civil, and the two really didn't cross.  The reason I got impatient is the Speedy Trial Act [Speedy Trial Act of 1974] passed, and all of our civil cases kept getting bumped.  So, I went to the civil, to the criminal division.  I said, "You guys keep knocking me out."  I said, "So, let me try some criminal cases since you always seem to get first dibs at being in trial."  And I didn't particularly like it--I'll tell you why.  One of the first cases I got, I was never, I'm reading the file.  It's two classmates from Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], and I knew them.  I think that dampened my enthusiasm for doing criminal work.  I went ahead and did the arraignment, but it was most uncomfortable.
Speaker 1: Now, was it because you knew them?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: But why would that dampen your enthusiasm?
Speaker 2: You know what?  It just reminds you of something that, in many ways, I, I said this.  And I went to the Aspen Institute [Washington, D.C.].  And I was in a room with twenty people from all over the globe.  And there were about four blacks in the room, and we were having a very serious philosophical debate about self-determination and the role of society.  And I said, "I would venture to say that every black in this room has a relative that has gone to prison."  I said, "I doubt if the white folks can say that."  And none of the white folks raised their hands, and all four blacks did.  It's very hard when you see that.
Speaker 1: So, it was too close?
Speaker 2: It was too close.
Speaker 1: It was too close, okay.
Speaker 2: And I even, I even saw a high school.  I wasn't handling the case, but I saw high school classmates.  I didn't like it.  And I, you know, if you have a job to do, I'll tell you one of the, I'll tell you one of the hardest things that happened.  And, eventually, this person did go to prison--very, very successful.  He--I was in the U.S. Attorney's Office, and we were close.  And he did something he realized he shouldn't have done.  He was, he was, he was laughing when he had a fantastic sense of humor.  He said, "Mayes [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes]--," he would call me by my last name--he said, "you ought to see this prosecution memo from the [U.S.] Department of Justice."  They had done a wiretap.
Speaker 1: Now, now Lenny [Leonard R. Gilman] worked, he worked at the--
Speaker 2: He was the U.S. attorney.
Speaker 1: --attorney, okay.
Speaker 2: And he said, "It's written, using Motown [Motown Records] songs."  He said, "Whoever did it at the Department of Justice is going to get creamed for this, but it is hysterical."  So, they had taken all these songs and woven the, you know, the lyrics through this prosecution memo because they had the wiretaps that nailed this guy.  He said, "You got to read it."  I shouldn't have been reading it.  He obviously trusted me.  I was chief of the civil division.  I was not going to do anything inappropriate.  I take the memo, thinking it's just going to be, you know, a little levity, and then I see it's somebody that I went to school with, that I was going to be at a party with that night. (Gesture) So, that's why I talk about, within our community too often, we know people that have gotten into trouble.  It's a much smaller group of people.  That was unusual.  Some of the other people I saw were not just the people that had gone to school.  They were in high school, not college, but this happened to be someone who had a graduate degree, not just any degree (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now was it, what was the charge?  Was it drugs or was it--
Speaker 2: No, it was not drugs.  It actually turned out to be accepting gifts from--as a, as a public official.
Speaker 1: Bribes, okay.
Speaker 2: Bribes--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and it wasn't even a good one (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 605987
Speaker 1: Now, when you, when you're there, Coleman Young is mayor, right, when you come back, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you come back to a Detroit [Michigan] that is--well, I can't say it's different 'cause you've just been gone two years, but Detroit was in a--I mean, it has been in a stagnation mode for a very long time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For many, many years, many, many years.
Speaker 1: So, you know, and I'm just thinking, you know, the neighborhoods and things like that.  So you, where are you living when you, you and your husband [Jean Mayes], where are you living? Because there, in this time period, there had also been some, starting to be, migration even to the suburbs of people, you know?
Speaker 2: Now, you're--so when I moved back initially, I lived with my mother [Geraldine Coleman].  That didn't last long (laughter).  And then, we moved to Dearborn [Michigan].  And I mention Dearborn because that was a very much known as a white enclave that was basically hostile, not just you don't live there--you'd better not live there.  And I kind of defied that.  I said, I'm moving to Dearborn because my husband was working at Ford Motor Company, so he was two feet from his job.  And it was easy for me to get downtown to the U.S. Attorney's Office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan], and I liked the complex.  It was a gated community, very--it was a townhouse.  So, everybody said, "Have you lost your mind?"  "No."  So, I did move there, but I was very conscious that if I ventured into certain neighborhoods, I was not welcome.  It didn't really bother me.  I just stayed out of those neighborhoods quite frankly.  I had no reason to be there.  Every once in a while, I'd find myself in an uncomfortable situation, but for the most part, you're right.  Those communities were opening up, and it was--they didn't think twice about having me live there.
Story_ID: 605988
Speaker 1: What I will tell you, talk about moving with my husband, I spent one summer in Birmingham, Alabama.  It was my, let's see, junior year in law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Your second year?
Speaker 1: Second year, not junior, second year in law school, and I went to work for legal aid in Birmingham.  Now, that was an experience because Birmingham, if you think about the church bombing [of 16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama], that's all people could think about.  It didn't intimidate me--it just didn't.  First of all, that is, what was that--1963, and I'm talking about 1973, so it was about ten year span of time, but my relatives thought I had lost my mind.  And the reason I went to Birmingham, I was dating my then to be husband.  He was in school [University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama], and I said, "Well, I'll go down there and work for the summer," so I did two jobs.  I worked for a private law firm and I worked for legal aid.  I did both, but I worked for legal aid, and it wasn't legal aid.  It was the Jefferson County opportunity program [Jefferson County Committee for Economic Opportunity], it was the poverty program.  I taught dance, so I did those two things, but I very much knew I was in the South.  So, when I went to rent, I'm just thinking about where I lived.  Birmingham, somewhat has a divide, and the very, very affluent white community, I can't tell you right.  If I could remember, I would tell you, was on that side of the Vulcan, that big statue.  And I said to Jean [Jean Mayes], "Well, why don't we live there?"  I'm just probably sticking my finger in somebody's eye.  So, we go into the complex to rent.  Oh, they didn't know what to do.  They really, really wanted us to go away, but they couldn't figure out a way to say that politely, and I wasn't going away.  So, I rented an apartment there.  The minute I moved in, whoever lived next to me, moved out, and then there was a black woman who also, but her apartment caught on fire.  I left shortly thereafter.  I just decided, you know what, I'm only here for the summer.  I don't need this aggravation.  So, I eventually went to live with his family for the rest of the summer.
Story_ID: 605989
Speaker 1: But coming back to Dearborn [Michigan], I lived there for about two years before we bought a house and I never, you know, felt intimidated living (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, where did you buy the house?
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy--
Speaker 2: No, but--
Speaker 1: Where?
Speaker 2: Where--location?
Speaker 1: Southfield [Michigan], and Southfield was more of a black suburb.  It was Jewish turning black.
Speaker 2: So, now, you bought this, you bought the house in what year?  You said nineteen se- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seventy-eight [1978] or '79 [1979], somewhere around that, excuse me.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, tell me--(unclear) your, your time in the U.S. Attorney's Office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan], so you were there like--
Speaker 1: I jumped around. It's a little confusing.  I went in '76 [1976], five and a half--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, you--
Speaker 1: Five and a half--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --five and a half, all in.  I went under Philip Van Dam, then Jim Robinson [James K. Robinson] became U.S. attorney.  I then left and moved to New York [New York].  My husband then was working for General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company].  He was in the car industry.  He moved to New York City.  I'd always loved New York.  I said, "Okay, I'm coming to New York."  The problem is you can't transfer offices.  It is irrelevant whether you're a U.S. attorney in this office.  You don't get to just walk into another one.  Every U.S. attorney is autonomous, so I had to interview.  So, I went to the Brooklyn [New York] U.S. Attorney's Office.  That's the Eastern District of New York [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York], and I, I reinterviewed--from scratch.  They hired me.  Now, this is the part where I wanted to strangle Jean [Jean Mayes].  I joined the U.S. Attorney's Office in February of 1979.  In September, General Motors transfers him back to New York--I mean back to Detroit [Michigan].  I said, "Jean." So we lived together that six, six months when we were and when he was at Ford [Ford Motor Company], he was not living with me.  I meant to tell you that.  He was living--
Speaker 2: Who was--
Speaker 1: Jean.  He was living in East Lansing [Michigan].  He lived with me for six months after we moved back from wherever we were in Champaign [Illinois].  And then, he was taken to a remote office for Ford, so we commuted then, that whole time.  We started commuting in 1980, and never stopped from then on.  So, he then switched to General Motors.  They transferred him to New York.  He lived there for several months.  I then followed him.  They then moved him back to Detroit.  I was then ready to jump out a window.  I said, "Okay, I can't live in New York by myself.  It's too expensive," so I went back to Detroit.
Story_ID: 605990
Speaker 1: Would not have gone back to the U.S. Attorney's Office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan].  I said, you know what?  It's time to get out.  But I got a phone call from my old boss, Jim Robinson [James K. Robinson].  He said, "I hear you're moving back to Detroit [Michigan].  Do you want your job back?"  Well, that was just too enticing, it was too easy.  I didn't have to interview.  I just had to show up.  So, I went back to the U.S. Attorney's Office.  And at about that time, he left being U.S. attorney, and I was made chief of the civil division.  We then had a Republican administration change, and everyone said, "Why would you take the chief job?  You know you're going to get kicked out."  I said, "It won't be the worst thing that's ever happened to me," because I was in that interim period when I was made chief.  When the new U.S. attorney took it, it ended up being one of my best friends who happened to be Republican.  So, I stayed as the chief of the civil division under him.
Speaker 2: So now, how large was the civil division?
Speaker 1: How many lawyers did I have--not really large.  It's probably much, much larger now.  I would say there were about ten lawyers who reported to me, and then the support staff and various people.
Speaker 2: Now, are you saying still the--'cause managing a division like that, you have to be able to determine the--it's sort of like a law firm in some respects, so you have to determine the caseload, you know--
Speaker 1: You do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and the--
Speaker 1: --who gets assigned cases.
Speaker 2: --who gets assigned cases and things like that.  Now, who is coming into the U.S. Attorney's Office at that time?  You know, and what schools are they coming from and, and--
Speaker 1: The U.S. attorney who appointed me as chief was Rich Rossman [Richard A. Rossman].  I think he had gone to Michigan as well--I think, Michigan, I think he had gone to Michigan Law School [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  So that, but if you look at the class that the people, the different universities or law schools that the staff came from, it was, it was pretty diverse, but all Michigan based, except for a couple of Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] people, a couple of Harvard, but I don't remember any Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut].  But at Harvard, I remember very vividly.  But most of the folks were either University of Michigan, Wayne State [Wayne State University Law School, Detroit, Michigan], or Detroit College of Law [Detroit, Michigan], which has since merged--I think, with Cooley Law School [sic.], and the University of Detroit [sic.].  I'm just trying to remember--those are the universities that were--law schools that were prevalent when I was in the office.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But it was mostly local schools.

Speaker 1: So, what was one, what were some of the most significant cases that, you know, came?
Speaker 2: One, in particular--I was there when Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] fired all the air traffic controllers.  And, remember, this is a union town, and I'll remind you of something else.  My dad [Wilbert Coleman] had become a union officer by that time.  He was not happy.  This is the only time I've ever seen him animated was when he would talk about union work, and negotiating with the City of Detroit [Michigan] over wages and benefits.  I was thinking to myself, if it gets you this excited, I've never seen--you need to do something else.  But in the meantime, if you look at that case, which was a fairly divisive case within the office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan], there were assistants who would not take it, and I knew that.  And they felt that they could not, in good conscience, go after these air traffic controllers for violating the no strike provision.  So, I took it.  I said, well, I'm chief of the civil division.  I said, sometimes you do not get to pass the buck, so I took it.  And Lenny [Leonard R. Gilman], who was the U.S. attorney at the time, he had a very astute sense of how to manage this without dereliction of your duty.  He never indicted any of those air traffic controllers--not once, but what we did do is to insist that they had to be enjoined, and that's the part that I had.  But he did not take it to the next level which would have been to incarcerate them, so we got through it.  So, Lenny and I worked it together, you know, there was a lot of press around it because it was such an unpopular--and Lenny and I actually--I remember this now--we actually went to the airport to see what was happening.  We didn't wait for the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] or anybody else to tell us.  We drove together.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me because I mean, I remember, like everyone else, what was happening?  Why did the president do that?  Why did President Reagan do that?
Speaker 2: I am trying to remember.  I think it was over their wages and conditions.  And that was one of the things that we, we looked at because it's--I don't know if you've seen the stats, that they have a very high rate of suicide.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And most of these folks have been in the Vietnam War.  They've been pilots or whatnot in the Vietnam War.  There was probably something underlying--posttraumatic stress syndrome, if I had to guess, that we didn't talk about as much then.  And there was, if I'm not--I've not had anyone ask me what, what was the underlying reason for the strike?  But I do believe, and I don't want to be held to this, that it was over wanting higher wages and longer breaks.  And they wanted to hire more individuals because they didn't have enough people to cover the different shifts.  And, and I will never forget when Lenny and I went to Metropolitan Airport [Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, Detroit, Michigan], you never see the sight of the airport.  We went into the room where it looks like a video game, if you didn't know what the dots were on the board, which is all these airplanes flying around.  It is a pitch black room--pitch black.  And all you're hearing are these people giving these strange directions about where the plane should go, and it's, very much is a language of, of art.  It's not anything a normal person would understand.  And this board that each one is sitting, they know what planes they have responsibility for.  And they've got thousands of people's lives in their hands.  And so, we sat, and we walked out.  We said, my goodness, can you imagine doing that every day?  So, that strike, it took years because many of those people lost their jobs.  And they didn't have, they did not have any real supply of trained folks to replace them.  That's the irony when you look at what, what transpired.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a lot of pressure, and this is the whole thing from, from the president's, you know, presidency, you know, on the--
Speaker 2: It was very political in that way.  I think people were concerned that you serve at the pleasure of the president.  We've seen that with George, George Bush [President George Walker Bush] and the firings of certain U.S. attorneys.  So, those U.S. attorneys knew that if they could have been held as being irresponsible in their, in carrying out their duties that their jobs were at stake, period.  So, that's why I, and I, I'll never remem- forget the judge that drew the case.  It was Avern Cohn, and he had been appointed by a Democrat, very much in the New York, in the Detroit mind.  Remember, unions are very prevalent there and, and not anything unusual about it.  He was very concerned about what was going to happen if these individuals were discharged from their, from their profession.
Speaker 1: Well, there's also, I mean, also in the larger context, there was concern about unions and the breakdown of the union.  I mean, and this is in a town like Detroit, but I mean the union, unions--there had been--on the part of Corporate America--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to try to, you know, to do that.
Speaker 2: No, I, I think if you, and it's interesting when you look at where General Motors [General Motors Company] is now.  Some of this--not all--can be tied to the way in which they may have been deemed to have kowtowed or at least not stood up more firmly for some things.  They got everybody in trouble in the end.  And that's, you know, that's the interesting part when, when you look at the fact that an airport [Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Washington, D.C.] is named after Reagan.  I mean, I always found that a little bit ironic, but there was a belief that, you know, you will not dictate to the United States of America what it thinks is necessary.  And there's some merit to it, but then maybe there is some harm that came out of it because it took quite a while to rebuild the air traffic control workforce.

Speaker 1: So, back to the question of what are--what is the legal community, you know, who, so you're, you're basically sort--wait, where is your husband at this point?
Speaker 2: Who knows?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had moved to Boston [Massachusetts] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is he--for Corporate America though?
Speaker 2: He then left Corporate America and bought his own car dealership.  Oh, god (laughter).
Speaker 1: But why are you not following him?  It's too--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I'm, I'm busy on my--I decided, you know what, Jean [Jean Mayes], I moved once.  That won't happen again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I just decided it was better for me to, to somewhat make my way in the legal community that I was establishing for, for myself, and you couldn't keep pulling up roots every time--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --and just thinking you could easily plant them again.  And he agreed.  He was fine with that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, from the time he moved back to New York [New York], from New York to Detroit [Michigan], within a few months after that, they transferred him again to Boston.  And I said, (gesture) have fun, and I never lived with him again after that, so that's why I say for twenty-two years of marriage, probably about, maybe three if I added up, we lived together.
Story_ID: 605993
Speaker 1: In the legal community, who are you getting to know?  Who is, you know, who is--
Speaker 2: Influential (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The, who are--yeah, who's influential?  Who are the icons there and--
Speaker 2: I'm trying to, now--because some of the people that I would name were not icons at the time, but I'll name one person or two 'cause I worked for both of them.  Oh, this is another interesting--remember I mentioned to you that I worked for law firms when I was in undergrad [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  The first law firm I ever worked for, the two named partners, both black, one was Republican, and one was Democrat.  I got to know both.  And they both eventually became judges, so I knew them.  And then, I knew Judge Heading [Henry Heading], who was the gentleman, as I mentioned that was a friend of the family.  And so--
Speaker 1: Now Heading's first name was--
Speaker 2: Henry.
Speaker 1: Henry, okay.
Speaker 2: And he was much older than Ed Bell [Edward F. Bell] or Louis Simmons [Louis F. Simmons, Jr.]--Louis Simmons are the two partners that were running their own small firm at the time.  I saw how hard it was.  They were trying to drum up business, and it was not easy having a small black firm which was it was.  It was not one of these large--it was kind of behemoth firms that we know now.  But I knew all these people because I'd worked for them, gotten to know their kids to some degree.  So, in any event, the folks that I would also run into were really just not necessarily black folks.  I was, as a result of being an assistant U.S. attorney, I went up against what I would call the big dogs.  When you're an assistant U.S. attorney, you can be litigating against some of the most well known names in the legal community.  That's one of the advantages of being in that environment.  We're young, probably brash, and willing to do a lot of different things with not a whole lot of resources against very, very powerful people that would be litigating against the government, so I would meet many of those individuals as opponents.  But I wasn't necessarily, I wasn't part of any organized bar at the time.  Eventually, I joined the Federal Bar Association, but I wasn't even a member of the American Bar Association when I first went to the U.S. Attorney's Office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan].  I wasn't part of any black bar association.  I don't think we had one, and I wasn't part of any woman's bar association.  I don't remember that either, but I did end up, at the time shortly after I left the U.S. Attorney's Office, at the suggestion of Dennis Archer, who became the black president of the ABA many years later.  He said, "Why don't you join this group?"
Speaker 1: Now, what was Dennis Archer doing at the time that you met him?
Speaker 2: I think Dennis was in private practice.
Speaker 1: He was, okay.
Speaker 2: And he--
Speaker 1: What--do you remember the firm?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the firm.  And he was also, if I'm not mistaken, I can't put a timeframe on this.  Dennis Archer became the first black president of the Michigan bar association [Wolverine Bar Association] before he became president of the ABA.  So, Dennis was very involved with organized bar activities, and he said to me one day, "Why don't you do this?"  I did become president of the local chapter of the Federal Bar, so that was the--I was around other AUSAs [assistant United States attorneys].  That was my very small legal community, and then all of the liti- litigators that would show up to oppose the government.  And there were some well known names.
Speaker 1: Like who?
Speaker 2: Deday LaRene [N.C. Deday LaRene], and a gentleman who was a legend--Earley.  I can't, I think his name was Sam Earley [ph.].  I was petrified going into court against some of these people because their reputations preceded them.  And then, I was like, huh, they're only people.  I'm going right on in there. But you would learn from them as you watched them try cases.  They were masters.
Story_ID: 605994
Speaker 1: And you liked the whole trial process, I take it?
Speaker 2: I did.  It was stressful, but I, it was, you know, you're on stage, and you, and you know there's an end.  You know, there's no do overs, (laughter) very rarely.
Speaker 1: Do you consider that you made a mistake during that time?  Was there any mistake that you can--
Speaker 2: Oh, are you kidding (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) like a mistake of judgment--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --mistake of--
Speaker 2: Sure.  I don't know anybody who takes anything that's somewhat high risk who doesn't, and there's one that is seared into my memory.  The [U.S.] Postal Service was sued for racial discrimination.  This would have been in the '80s [1980s], I think now.  And Floyd Kirksey [ph.]--I'll never forget his name--was the plaintiff.  And he--I think had run the Postal Service in circles, and I couldn't settle the case.  It was just impossible, so I had to try it, and that's what we did.  I mean, I tried cases.  It wasn't the first time, but the irony is I was representing the government, and his lawyer was white.  He was black.  And so, the irony, if you looked at the way the deck stacked up, you couldn't miss it.  I lost that case.  That was a hard loss.  But when I stepped back, again, I don't think I could have ever settled it.  When you deal with the government, sometimes trying to get people to coalesce around a settlement, it's much, much harder than if you had a private litigant.  And it was a very enlightening experience to interview all of his coworkers--people who didn't want any part of this.  They were, they were, in fact, fearful that I was going to call them to the witness stand.  It was as if it was just a very eye opening experience when you talk about, again, race and how--and he worked in a very, very affluent postal station.  It was in Bloomfield Hills [Michigan], or I think it was Bloomfield Hills, so it was a white suburb of--but not just any white suburb--a very more affluent white suburb.  So, he was one of the few blacks in that white suburb.  And I'll never forget interviewing a woman who was living with a white man.  And she begged me, begged me not to put her on the witness stand.  I don't think she wanted people to know, you know, her private life, and she knew all of this would come out.  I didn't think I needed her in the end.  She wasn't that good a witness, but when I was interviewing her, the fearfulness that her private life would come out, or that she would be drawn into some fray that would last long after I had packed up my files and gone back to my office [at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan].  So that was a hard loss.
Story_ID: 605995
Speaker 1: Now, di- are those burnout positions, do you, did you feel, like--you were there five and a half years, I'm just wondering and you're, you know, teaching at the same time, trial advocacy.  Now, during this, are there things that are happening from a--what am I going to say--I'll say, legislation, but well, maybe legislation standpoint that affect the whole area of trial advocacy?
Speaker 2: There wasn't the same type of civil justice reform, class action reform, and some of the things, tort reform, that wasn't prevalent in my day.  So, I can't sit here right now and say that anything sticks in my mind as a more momentous event around trial advocacy, or being in the courtroom.  I would tell you the most--and, and this, I think, would be true.  Think about the woman's movement in the '70s [1970s] and now, I'm moving into very visible roles in the courtroom.  You didn't see as many women trying cases.  And I wore pants, I wore pants suits.  And that irritated some people, but I very much decided that that was not an issue that should have affected the work I was doing.  But some of the clerks of the court did, so I had a very tough case that I had to argue in the Sixth Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit].  It was a very sad case.  A gentleman had been fired who worked for the customs office and he engaged in inappropriate conduct.  First of all, he was at an event sponsored by brokers, people that he had to oversee, (cough) excuse me, and he ended up--let's just say, getting into some difficulty that led to his discharge.  He ended up challenging that decision, and what he had done was sexual in nature, so it was rather graphic.  I had to go argue that in front of an all-male bench (laughter).  And so, what I was probably more aware of was the fact that I was a woman trying these types of cases and arguing these types of cases in the courtroom.  That would have been the more momentous event.
Story_ID: 605996
Speaker 1: Now, why did you leave?  It's--was it a change of administrations--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or was it your husband [Jean Mayes]?
Speaker 2: You should have figured out that wasn't the issue--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) no.
Speaker 1: --well, what was it?
Speaker 2: When I joined the U.S. Attorney's Office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan], and I'll never forget this because it wasn't anybody I knew well.  I was really just excited about representing--it's a big thing to stand up and say, "Michele Mayes [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes] representing the United States of America," which is what you do.  And I liked the amount of power I had.  So, I'm getting on the elevator, you know, full of myself.  And one of the very, very experienced assistants--I only knew him by name and I'd seen him.  He'd been at the office maybe ten years by then.  He's staring at me, and he's getting ready to get off the elevator, and he turned.  He had barely said a word to me.  He said, and he took his finger, he said, "Don't stay too long," and he walked out of the elevator.  And I never forgot what he said.  At the time, this is no longer the case.  At the time, it was not viewed as a career profession.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You go in, you get your chops, and you go out and practice with some law firm or something else, but it was never viewed as your last--your first and your last stop.  Coincidentally, that advice was not followed by one of my colleagues who was in class with me at Michigan [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  He remembered me, but I said, "Dear, you were just another white male, and there were so many of you.  I'm sorry you didn't stand out."  We're now one--he is one of my very, very best friends.  He just retired four months ago.  He never left.  He went there almost months after law school, and stayed his entire career, and he took over as chief of the civil division when I left, and held it 'til he retired.  So, a lot of the things, advice you get, you realize, you probably need to weigh it, but I took that to heart, and thought I needed to get out around the time that I did.
Story_ID: 605997
Speaker 1: So, now, how did you decide to go into Corporate America?
Speaker 2: I didn't--it was by default.  All right, so I make this proclamation, all right, I'm leaving, time to move on.  I've done this five and a half years.  I then start interviewing with law firms (laughter), and I interviewed with probably five law firms.
Speaker 1: In Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Not one offer, not one--
Speaker 1: After all you have--
Speaker 2: --not one declamation, silence, I, I, I got nothing back.  And I, and I realized what had happened.  I'd been out of law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] seven years, seven and a half years by then, because I taught, then went to the A- to, became an AUSA [assistant United States attorney].  And I think, they didn't know what to do with me.  I didn't have a book of business, and this was about the time that partners were, were being obsessed with how much money are you bringing in?  What's your book of business?  Who are the clients that you can lure to the firm?  Well, I certainly cannot bring the United States of America with me, and that was the only client I'd ever had.  And so, I think they were very fearful that because I'd been out law school seven and a half years, I would be coming up on partner track with no proof that I could bring an income. And so, while I had done very well at the U.S. Attorney's Office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan], I beat out many people that had been there much longer to be chief.  So, it wasn't as though I was an unknown quantity, but they just said, "Well, that's nice you've been chief.  It's not good enough."  So, they never said a word to me.  So then, my husband--I'm lamenting--I said, "Jean [Jean Mayes], I'm not even getting rejection letters.  I'm just standing here treading water."  I said, "What's, what do you think I should do?"  He then said, "Why don't you go in house?"  I said, "What is that?"  I literally turned up my nose like, what he is talking about?  Of course, he had worked at--he was at Ford at the time.  He said, "They have in house lawyers."  I said, "Really?"  I don't even know if I'd ever met one--I don't think so.  I said, "They practice law?"  He said, "Let me put you in touch with a headhunter."  I said, "And what's a headhunter?" (Laughter) I mean I was uninitiated in this world.  He knew who headhunters were from being in Ford Motor Company, so he put me in touch with one of the ones that he knew.  I've, I've forgotten his last name--Curtis [ph.] is his first name.  And Curt- I interviewed one place and got a job.  How naive is that?  He said, "Okay, you've got litigation, you know, everybody doesn't have litigation, Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes]."  I said, "Well, I'm sorry, I didn't do corporate law--I did litigation."  So, they took me to Burroughs [Burroughs Corporation; Unisys Corporation], and I interviewed with the general counsel, Don Swan [ph.].  He knew he was leaving--he didn't tell me that.  So, I interviewed with him, and it wasn't a very long period of time after the interview, I was extended an offer, and that's how I went in house, and I struggled.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: (Makes sound).
Story_ID: 605998
Speaker 1: Now, tell me why.  Now, Burroughs [Burroughs Corporation; Unisys Corporation] is located where at this--
Speaker 2: Right in what you would know as the New Center area, right at the General Motors Building [Cadillac Place, Detroit, Michigan].  You can see it from I-94 [Interstate 94].  In any event, I couldn't tell what they did (laughter).  I was used to going in the courtroom, doing depositions, settling cases.  I had a docket.  And I walked in here, and I said, "You're going to meetings and you write memos, um-hm, and you do that every day, all day?"  Well, they did manage lawyers that were outside lawyers.  And one of the lawyers that I met who--the reason they hired me, I should drop back to something.  They had many, many cases that were causing them a great deal of difficulty over computers.  This is before we had personal computers.  These were called minicomputers.  And businesses that would be what you would call small businesses had purchased these computers with the belief they could lay off people and streamline their bookkeeping and become more efficient.  Instead, they had to hire eight more people to do the work because the computer kind of screwed up the data, and they didn't know how to undo it.  And so, there, there were genuine levels, decibels of frustration over how could you sell me this computer?  You know, I've, I've put all this money into this machine, and nothing's coming out that makes any sense, and my books are all screwed up.  So, they got sued for everything from breach of contract in terms of warranty--this is not what you tell me this equipment would do--to fraud.  And so, they had cases all over the country.  One of the biggest firms that they hired to, to help them navigate this unfortunate turn of events was Kirkland and Ellis [Kirkland and Ellis, LLP], Steve McCormick.  And to this day, Steve and I are still in contact.  I met him in 1982.
Speaker 1: So, you have this very stark transition into Corporate America, which is understandable, 'cause a lot of people don't necessarily make that, you know, it--people may go to law firms (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know.
Speaker 1: --but they're not going into corporate.  So, you get in and you--how long does that transition take?  And how long is Don Swan [ph.] there?
Speaker 2: Not long at all.  I think Don Swan was, he was there less than a year, far less, maybe, maybe five months after I got there, he tendered his resignation--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --and leave.
Story_ID: 605999
Speaker 1: How many people are in the corporate department [at Burroughs Corporation; Unisys Corporation], I mean in the in house (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Law department?
Speaker 1: In the law department.
Speaker 2: I want to say, less than thirty, but they had patent lawyers, they had corporate lawyers, they had people specializing in more commercial contracts.  They had litigators, but I don't think all in, we were much more than thirty.
Speaker 1: How many were black?
Speaker 2: There were two of us.  I was the second one, and then there was a third one hired after I came, and a fourth, but I guess I would have been the second one.  And that was an interesting exchange.  And I know it was well intentioned.  I show up, and they're all staring at me because even though they have all this litigation, I'm probably the only lawyer in the department that had tried a case.  Of course, I probably reminded them of that.  And I was used to getting things done fast, and that was another thing.  The pace was very different.  You know, when you're in a courtroom, there's an adrenaline rush and you know you've got a deadline.  As I said, there is an end.  Some cases that big companies get involved in seem to go on forever, either by default or by design, so the whole thing is like it came to a standstill, and I was moving in slow motion.  So, I reached out to the only other black lawyer there.  I was trying to get some sense from him--what is this in house practice?  What am I supposed to really be doing?  What value am I adding?  So, he was very kind to me and he was telling me different things that he did, and how the company worked, things that anyone now knows you need because it's all these unvisible rules that you trip over.  But I'll tell you what happened that just said, hm, we ain't on the same page, buddy.  I could type, as you remember, I didn't want to take typing, but I knew how to type very well, and I was trying to get something done one night.  Maybe it was around six p.m., and he saw me typing.  Now, remember, we didn't have, as you could think then, a computer on our desk--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --or at least if we had one, we didn't use it for typing.  So, I was at the secretary's desk, and he walks by and he is stunned.  So, the next day, he summons me into his office.  He said, "Come here."  And I said, "Okay."  He said, "You're a lawyer, right?"  I said--and I'm looking at him in a befuddled way.  I said, "Of course, I'm a lawyer."  He said, "Then, would you mind explaining to me why you're sitting at the secretary's desk last night typing?"  I said, "I had something to do.  The secretary had gone home, and I know how to type--it ain't hard."  He said, "Well, I think you need to think long and hard."  He said, "You're already a black person, you're already a woman, and you're going to sit at the secretary's desk?"  I said, "You know, I, I get your point."  I said, "Okay, you know what, I was probably not being as sensitive to the whole dynamic.  Thank you so much for that, for those words of wisdom."  So, for about two weeks, I didn't type, and then I went back to typing.  I just didn't care.  If I needed to get something done, I did it.  The other thing that I was told by someone because I was, again, trying to make this transition.  There were not that many blacks in the company.  There were enough, but not thousands, and there were not that many in the professional ranks.  I go to someone's office to meet with him.  He says, "We can't meet too often."  I said, "Why?"  "Because they'll think we're conspiring--there are two of us in here" (laughter).  And so now, come back to where I kind of netted out.  I've been able to thrive in Corporate America 'cause I found places.  Maybe it's the way you exude a certain message to people.  I haven't had to clip my wings as much as people thought.  I've never stopped typing if I needed to.  I did that my whole life and nobody ever mistook me who was in the company.  Outsiders do--they think I'm a court reporter when I show up sometimes.  That happened.  But I had, and people enlightened enough, that I didn't get pigeonholed, or have to constrain myself so that I could only do it this way.  So, I, you know, I've done okay and I, I laugh and I say, I'm kind of rebel within.  I'm not so outside the boundaries that they want to get rid of me fast, but they're willing to do things a little differently 'cause I can pull without rupturing.  And that's a hard balance sometimes to try to find, but I've been able to find, and now maybe I've compromised more than I'm willing to say, but that's just my sense of it.
Speaker 1: Now, when you, this other person that was there, how long did he, you, and his name, do you? Oh?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't--which one (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You don't like it--the one, the other black person who was in the--
Speaker 2: That told that two people couldn't get--
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, you don't want to give that.
Speaker 2: --I don't remember his name.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: No, I do not.
Speaker 1: But now, so, he, did he stay much?  Did he, 'cause you were there for--
Speaker 2: I was there--I stayed there ten years.
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: I don't remember what happened.  He wasn't a lawyer, first of all, this was a non-lawyer trying to give me advice.
Speaker 1: So, you were the only black in the legal depart- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Two--there was one who told me not to type--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --and the one who told me, we can't have more than, you know, we can't have two people in the room 'cause we're both black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those are two different people.
Story_ID: 606000
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But let's talk about that though.  That is, the, the--a lot of dynamics were happening in Corporate America though.
Speaker 2: I agree.
Speaker 1: You know, what they were telling you was--
Speaker 2: It's not untrue.
Speaker 1: --so this, this general sense about things, you know.
Speaker 2: And you know what my answer to that is?  If you let somebody define you, they will.  And I said, I'm not going to let you define me, I'm not going to let you define me as an admin 'cause I can type.  And I'm not going to let you define me as a malcontent or rabble rouser just because I meet with other black people, so you need to get over it--not me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in that group of thirty, and you said Don Swan [ph.] left and--
Speaker 2: Marne Gleason [J. Marne Gleason] came in his place.
Speaker 1: Now, where was, where was he from?
Speaker 2: He had been at another company, and I cannot remember Marne's background right now, but he did not come from the Detroit [Michigan] area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was an outsider all the way around.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, at this time, I'm wondering, maybe I, I may be wrong in my timing, but Leroy Richie [HistoryMaker Leroy C. Richie], was he at Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Chrysler.  It was around that time, but I don't know if had reached the heights to which he eventually scaled.
Speaker 1: When he was--became general counsel.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, but I, so I can't remember exactly when I heard Richie's name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, but I think he was brought into Chrysler to be--no, no, no, he, that he--
Speaker 2: It was Chrysler--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but I don't remember whether that was I had left Burroughs [Burroughs Corporation; Unisys Corporation].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--
Speaker 2: That's what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: --okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I do know that Wade McCree [Wade H. McCree]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was solicitor general, and he was on the board of Burroughs, the company that I joined.  He was one of the few blacks in, on any board in this country at the time.  And his daughter, as coincidence would have it, I had gone to school with her at the law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  She was one class ahead of me, so I knew Kathleen McCree [Kathleen McCree Lewis].  Unfortunately, she died just about a year ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there were pockets of blacks in very critical positions, but it was spotty, you know, there was not really any groundswell.  They were anomalies.  People would, oh, say, there's one, and everybody would talk about it.  Now, that to me, the big, big difference, it's not, it's not as big a deal.
Speaker 1: Right.  But it's still few, but it's growing.
Speaker 2: It is (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's growing now.
Story_ID: 606001
Speaker 1: But, now, you took to this job then as, I mean, in a way, so I'm wondering what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Why?
Speaker 1: --yeah, what about it resonated with you, once you got over the initial, you know?
Speaker 2: Being in house?
Speaker 1: What do, what do people do here?  I mean, it's an easier life, isn't it?  You always hear about people went to corporate jobs in house because they could work regular hours.
Speaker 2: I have never had a job I worked regular--now, that's my own effort.  I've never had a job where I worked regular--not at the U.S. Attorney's Office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan].  I'll never forget I got a phone call on a Sunday.  I think they wanted to--I don't know if we had voicemail, but he clearly didn't think I was going to be there.  We must have had voicemail.  And I picked up the phone, and it was one of my opponents.  He said, "I didn't think you were going to be here."  I said, "Then why did you call?"  Same thing, in house.  There was always a lot to do.  Again, if you look at the number of case- I had all cases all over the country--in the South, which was another experience going south.  I went to Mont- right outside of Montgomery, Alabama.  I'll tell you about that in a minute.  But I had cases where people were really, really angry with the company--school boards, municipalities, small businesses, cleaners.  And my goal was to get in there and really assess--can I resolve this?  Nobody wants to go to trial typically.  Someone once said, you go to trial when you have nowhere else to go.  That may not be quite the extreme position, but you better have a really good reason for going that distance because it's a public display.  And very often, there was more merit to the case than just, oh, they're suing you for a lot of money.  They may just be money grubbers, so I tried very hard, and I liked this part of it.  I learned how the business worked.
Speaker 1: You mean the business of--
Speaker 2: Of computers, software.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So I would, I did something, and everybody thought I was really strange, and I've done this my entire career.  I got there, and as I said, I was struggling with, what am I going to do now?  What do you want from me?  I said, "Well what do you guys do?"  They said, "You know, we make computers, and we do program- the software, the hardware, so we have all these engineers and software programmers."  So, then I said, "Well, how are they sold?  How do you sell them?" 'Cause that's where we were getting in trouble.  The engineers and the designers would say, "That computer never could do that."  So, I said, "Well, I want to go to the sales office."  They said, "Excuse us."  So, I said, "Well, isn't that where the rubber meets the road?"  And they had never had a lawyer do that.  I said, "Well, I'm going, so just find me some place to go."  And I went out to the field, and I sat in that sales office, and I watched them.  And I've done every place I've been.  I went on the road and walked the streets of New York [New York] when I was the general counsel at Pitney Bowes [Pitney Bowes Inc.], went on customer calls.  I haven't done it yet at Allstate [Allstate Corporation].  I've done enough with regulators, but I've not actually--that's my next goal, to sit with the, in an agency's office, and watch how they attract customers to our product.  That's where you see the real deal go down.  So, I did that, and I finally was able to talk, so come back.  As a lawyer, an in house lawyer, the role that you eventually play is putting the advice in the context of the risk appetite of the company, the personality of the leader, and the business objectives.  When you bring, you bring the whole picture together to me.  And if you're able to do that, and the businesspeople I worked with, I had a fabulous relationship with some really tough businesspeople.  You know, they were like, oh, you're going to go work for him?  And they were, frequently end up being my references.  Most of them become my references--not the lawyers.  I can use the lawyers, but most people want to know, can you put the total package together?  Don't tell me what the law is.  Tell me how I'm supposed to execute it.  So, I did very well at that and I enjoyed it 'cause it was a challenge.  The business people always hold your feet to the fire because they know how hard it is to raise money.
Speaker 1: Now who was, who was president of Burroughs [Burroughs Corporation] at the time and didn't it become (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mike Blumenthal [W. Michael Blumenthal]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the former secretary of the treasury.  He was--Mike Blumenthal was the CEO when I joined Burroughs.
Speaker 1: And then Burr- now when did Burroughs and--
Speaker 2: Sperry [Sperry Corporation]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 1: So that, so you were part of, you were there when the merger happened with Sperry and they became U- with the--
Speaker 2: I was.  They became Unisys [Unisys Corporation] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Unisys--
Speaker 2: Some people used to say that sounds like a disease, but they had a contest, and it made sense to me.  But Burroughs, and Unis- and Sperry did the merger in 1986, and then the newly, newly formed company--
Story_ID: 606002
Speaker 1: I mean at the beginning when you joined--I just want to understand because Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] was big into sort of deregulation.  This is a big sort of mergers and--M and A [mergers and acquisitions] time, you know, with a lot of mergers hap- big mergers happening.
Speaker 2: Very big.
Speaker 1: What, what do you--I, I also wanted to understand the sort of the corporate culture because it was viewed at that time, sort of big is better.  I'm trying to understand the relationship between the business and the legal department because--and then I wanted to understand also who your main outside counsel was, you know, or was really the work done internally?
Speaker 2: First of all, my focus was litigation still so I'm not doing the deal work.  So, I would not have been an integral part of the negotiation team.  Eventually, we have to understand, and now we would do it differently in today's climate, but certainly back then, I would not have been in the inner circle as that deal was being negotiated.  That would have your deal lawyers.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I think the belief, bigger was better, particularly given that the competitor that everyone chased was IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  And how big was that?  It was huge.  So, they believed that if you got economies of scale, and had a different base of clients, a more diverse base of clients, that you would have a better chance to really thrive and go beyond.  And the premise sounded very solid, but it proved to be anything but.  Shortly after the merger, I inherit a lot of things.  The, the cultures are very different between the two law, the two law departments, very different.  They called us burritos, we called them spiroids.  Neither one was supposed to be a compliment.  And it took a while for us to really meld those two companies together.  I think it's the culture that kills most mergers in many ways.  But even more fundamentally than that, the, the, the premise behind Burroughs [Burroughs Corporation; Unisys Corporation] having the financial community, and Sperry [Sperry Corporation; Unisys Corporation] having the government as its client, never really materialized.  It just didn't.
Story_ID: 606003
Speaker 1: And then, more importantly than that, I inherited--and this was a defining moment, I think, of my personal, internal career as an in house counsel.  I ended up with bet the company litigation so, obviously, public record.  The--this was a very odd time.  We had been sued by Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.] because they had purchased part of the business from us.  I think we were sued for over a billion dollars for fraud.  And it's a little unusual back then to be sued for that kind of money by another large company.
Speaker 2: Burroughs [Burroughs Corporation] was sued?
Speaker 1: Unisys [Unisys Corporation], by now.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: So, Honeywell sued us for fraud, and it was a big ticket item.  Then, because the business never really gained traction, the stock went down below two dollars.  And I laughed, I was being a bit tongue in cheek--
Speaker 2: Now, is that 1987 or '88 [1988]?
Speaker 1: This would have been around '88 [1988], '89 [1989]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --around, maybe '89 [1989].  We get sued by all these companies, the stock tanks.  The business isn't growing.  You know, we've, we have ended up bringing out all the expenses that you can, merging back offices.  We're still not seeing the wealth of business come in the door, but you've got a huge expense structure you've got to now feed.  It turns out when Mike Blumenthal [W. Michael Blumenthal]--because the stock was doing so poorly--we stopped matching the 401(k).  I think dividends were suspended.  It was serious.  He comes into the room to try to rally the troops, saying, you know, there are better times ahead.  We're not the only one experiencing a very bad time, he says.  "Look at Exxon [Exxon Corporation; Exxon Mobil Corporation] and the Valdez [Exxon Valdez]."  And we all nodded, you're right, look at--what if we've been involved in that?  That would be even worse.  So, we leave this little pep rally (laughter).  I go back to my office, and the phone rings.  And I pick up the phone and they said, "This is CT Corporation [CT Corporation System]."  When we got sued, they would call, and I was head of litigation.  "You've just been sued by Exxon for the Valdez matter."  Sperry [Sperry Corporation; Unisys Corporation] made the autopilot on the freight, on the freighter (laughter).  And this was the same day that Blumenthal had used that as a comparison.  And so, why do I mention that?  We had all these bet the company cases, including a derivative lawsuit that was filed against the directors, and many of the shareholder actions because the stock had truly tanked, tanked.  And I had all that on my plate.  And then, we had a criminal case, unfortunately, that emanated from this.  It was called L-win [ph.], and there were people who went to prison.
Speaker 2: When you say people, you're talking about employees of either (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Of either, they were Sperry from the Sperry side.  They were on defense contracts.  They had gamed the system.  And as a consequence, one person committed suicide.  Another, and I think two people went to prison.  And we were trying to keep the company from being indicted.  I was not as intimately involved in that, but I had some involvement helping to, helping to navigate the strategy.  So, it was a very critical time to keep the company alive because if anything had gone south, we didn't have a real, strong liquidity or capital base to draw on.  We just did not.
Story_ID: 606004
Speaker 1: And I finally left, not because--this is an interesting--because this is when I decided I wanted to be a general counsel.  I really thrive, unfortunately, on these high risk, high demand situations.  You can call me a crisis junkie, which is not always good.  In fact, it can be a distraction, but I, I will typically rise to the occasion--the worse it is.  I don't become distracted--I become extremely focused.  The problem is those are things that are right in front of you, and you're not necessarily looking at the long term.  And that's the balance that I think people need to very, very consciously struggle to have.  But in the meantime, I was very much in my element.  I had a hell of a staff that I kept together.  No one quit, and this is after there's no bonus, no 401(k) match, no raises, and none of my team quit.  And I had a very, very solid team.  So, when the general counsel quit (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Now, who was the general counsel at this point?  Is it the same general counsel?
Speaker 1: No, by this time--
Speaker 2: How many general counsels, you would have--
Speaker 1: I worked under--
Speaker 2: Don Swan [ph.].
Speaker 1: Don Swan, Marne Gleason [J. Marne Gleason], Curt Hessler [Curtis A. Hessler], and then my final G.C. was Andy Hendry [Andrew D. Hendry].  Andy resigned and went to Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company].  So, as he's leaving, I say, "You know what, Andy, I feel I'm at a crossroads. I need to do something--I've done litigation my whole life and I want to do something else."  He said, "Well, that's all you've done."  I said, "We've already agreed to that."  I said, "But does that mean that's all I can do?"  "Well, you don't have the right background to be a general counsel, Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes]."  "Really--you really don't think?"  "Well, you'd have to really work on it."  "All right, so I'm willing to work on it.  What do you think I need to do?"  And he starts talking about--well, you need to understand the regulations of the federal government because we're a publicly traded company.  And you need to understand how disclosures are done and annual reports.  And, see, he's going over all the things I don't have.  I said, "All right--well, can we agree that I'm willing to understand that area?  I admit that I haven't grown up in it, but I've handled the litigation."  That's all the litigation issues that came out were over disclosure issues.  So, I saw the dark side of when it goes wrong.  So, we make this pact but, yes, he nods very sympathetically.  He understands my frustration and he'll give it some thought.  P.S. before he had left, he had done something that I went, huh?  He decided he needed a number two in the department.  He had never had a number two.  It was between me and another person.  The woman who got it was really the deal lawyer.  She understand corporate law when you talk about boards of directors and how you govern companies, so she went out over me.  And I said--and he was very gingerly handling me--he said, before it was announced, he said, "Let me tell you why I picked her."  And I'll remember this 'cause we're in a car going somewhere.  He said, "She really does have what I think a company with our profile needs. You don't."  And this is before I told him I wanted to be a general counsel.  And so, I sat there and I listened, and I said--I, I was very quiet as I tell you I get when I'm under stress.  And when he finished, he said, "So, what do you think, Michele?"  I said, "Well, I think one of two things, Andy."  I said, "I'll either deal with it, or I'll leave. And I'll pick." And that was the end of that discussion.  I ended up working very well. And Nancy Sundheim [Nancy Straus Sundheim], she's since became, and still is, the general counsel of Unisys [Unisys Corporation], but I worked very well with Nancy.  And I started to try to figure out--all right, what am I, what am I really lacking here?  What's, what's missing from my inventory?
Story_ID: 606005
Speaker 1: At the same time, he--I don't know how long after he [Andrew D. Hendry] appointed her [Nancy Straus Sundheim] number two, he resigns.  And we all wish him well, and we're sitting in this abyss because the company [Unisys Corporation] is still not doing any better.  It was truly just in a very, very dire place.  Six months after he leaves, I get a phone call.  Now, again, I'm in my element because I know every step I take makes a difference in this company now.  Can you settle?  Do you have to litigate?  How much money do we have to do this 'cause we're paying all these firms?  It was a freeding frenzy [sic. feeding frenzy]--the number of law firms.  One of the law firms we hired.  And it's interesting I should mention him because I had dinner with him last night--is the former head of the SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission], Harvey Pitt [Harvey L. Pitt].  Harvey was a very critical person at Fried, Frank [Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP] at the time, and we hired Harvey Pitt, Herb Wachtell [Herbert Wachtell].  I mean, we had them all because the company was, again, fighting for its life in many ways.  I met Harvey, and worked hand in glove with Harvey and his firm over the shareholder litigation.  And this was fairly early in my career.  I'm in my late thirties around this time, late thirties when it starts.  I'm moving to forty, right?  In the meantime, when Andy leaves, and I get this phone call, it's the last phone call I ever thought I would get.  I'm not looking for his phone call.  Andy and I are extreme opposites--yin and yang, always were.  He will say this to you--we, and, and what I've learned from that is opposites, probably bring out the best in each other, but it is extremely tense because you're coming from left, and the other person is coming from right.  But in many ways, that's what diversity is all about.  This happened to be diversity of orientation.  So, when he called me, I honestly thought he was glad to get rid of me because we would have exchanges and I'd finally say, "Well, you're the general counsel, call it. Not the way I would do it, but if you call it, I'll do it."  And he would hate that, I think, because I wasn't, you know, acceding to his wishes because I agreed with him.  But I was willing to make sure he understood that, so I was not thinking he missed me.  And so, when I got the phone call, quite honestly, I thought it was peculiar.  So, I pick up the phone.  He says, "Well, let's have dinner."  I said, "For what?" (Laughter) I told you, I'm direct.  I said, "Why do you want to have dinner?"  "Well, I just thought we could get together."  And, and so, I said, "Oh, okay," like that, "well, let me know when."  I hang up the phone.  So, I go to my husband, I said, "Jean [Jean Mayes], what is Andy doing calling me?"  He said, "You are slow" (laughter).  I said, "Slow, for what?"  He said, "He probably wants to talk about your coming to Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company]."  I said, "You're lying--not in a thousand years would he ever ask me that."  He said, "I guarantee you, that's what he's doing."  Six months, another six months goes by, and I get another phone call from him.  And I'm like, okay, here we go with the dinner thing again, right?  And he finally says, "Here's--we're meeting, meet me in New York [New York]."  "Okay."  Or, he, no, he met in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  So, he comes to Philly 'cause he had moved to New York by then.  And for the first fifteen minutes of a very awkward dinner, I'm talking about all the people he's left behind who are struggling to keep this company going.  And he's telling me how wonderful Colgate is.  And I finally said, 'cause I'm, this is like the dance of the flamingos--only nobody is dancing to the same record.  I finally said, "What are you here for?  Is there something you want to tell me?"  And he gets, gets beet red, like why is this hard, like, just get to the point?  He says, "Well, might you want to consider coming to Colgate?"  I said, "Now why would I do that?  I told you, I want your job.  You're the general counsel, so why would I come to Colgate when I can't be general counsel?"  He said, "Because you're still not ready." Oh. Slap (laughter).  And I--he said, "I will get you ready if you come."  And that is what he did.  He stuck to his word to the nth degree.  So, for the eleven years I was there, they moved me from job to job, you know, each time, putting me in a place I had never been.  And that's how I think I got ready, was under his direction.
Story_ID: 606006
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.  So, you moved.  Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company] is in--
Speaker 2: It's in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: --New York, okay.
Speaker 2: That's when I moved to New York, to Manhattan (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I stayed at Colgate for, all in, almost eleven years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But now, this is a totally different industry for--
Speaker 2: My, my second, right?  It is.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's toothpaste, though--at least I used it.  I had never touched a computer (laughter), not like this.  I knew about more about toothpaste than I did computers--trust me.  So, it was very--
Speaker 1: Now, who, who--
Speaker 2: --different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) was president of--
Speaker 2: Marne Gleaso- oh, Marne--Reuben Mark, my buddy, somebody, another person I have--I'm very fond of.  Reuben Mark became CEO.  He had a very long tenure--people forget this.  In 1984, and I didn't join Colgate until 1992, so he'd been CEO for a while by the time I got there.  And I, I heard a lot about him.  So, I have to interview.  I interviewed with fifteen people to get this job.  I was ready to slit my throat because it would have felt better.  I said, if I interview with one more person, I'm not interested.  So, he was the last person I had to meet.  And this was so--it, it, it, it so captured what he's like.  I'm sitting in this big office he has, and I'm very nervous, you know, I'm trying to be all ready to go and, and there's nothing to do.  I'm just sitting there.  Finally, he swoops into the office.  He's walking fast as he always--he said, "Reuben Mark," and I stand up to shake his hand.  He says, "I heard a lot about you."  He said, "Huh. You're not too tall, and you don't have any hair either."  And he said, so, and he said, "And you're black--I get two for one" (laughter).  I started to say--if I'd been smart--I would have said, "Do you double my salary?"  But he was very engaging, curious, open minded, didn't mind breaking eggs, and the fact that he would say you're two for one.  Now, most people would have nev- never say.  Reuben has always wrote his own rules.  And I just--the chemistry with him, not unlike my current boss, Tom Wilson [Thomas J. Wilson].  The first time I met Tom Wilson, I just clicked with him.  It's that blank moment, that gut, you say, yeah, I can, I can sense, we, we got some same values here.  And that was the same way with Reuben, so he knew I wanted to be general counsel from the day I walked in the door.  And when I eventually resigned, which was a big deal that I resigned.  It was like people were staying away from because they thought I was going to implode.  They were waiting for Reuben not to be furious with me, I think, because people didn't resign at the level I was.  They were either told to leave or they retired.  They did not walk out on their own energy.  So, when I resigned, people were fearful that he would view this as some way that I was being not loyal to the company.  And, instead, when I walked in the door and I, again, I'm waiting for him to show up, he walks in and he kind of makes a, he mimics a frown.  And he says to me, "You always said you wanted to be general counsel, and you ought to go."  And so, we talked about who should succeed him instead (laughter), which I was not bating--I was not biting that bait.  But they very much knew they had gotten me ready and that I couldn't get there at Colgate.
Story_ID: 606007
Speaker 1: Now, I want to understand what did that mean--getting ready?  What, what, what--because, first of all, you're in a different industry.  And I'm not exactly sure, who was the regulatory for Unisys [Unisys Corporation], who was--
Speaker 2: They would--well, you know, computers aren't regulated--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --the same way, if you think of products.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You, you have to deal with, with consumer protection laws and--
Speaker 1: Right.  So, you had to lear- so what was your rotation?  What was, what did he--
Speaker 2: Where--at Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company]?
Speaker 1: At Colgate.
Speaker 2: And I wouldn't even say it's consumer protection.  When I think of Unisys, I think of more just the federal government.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the state law would have been more prevalent 'cause you got sued under state law more than anything.  But switch now to Colgate--I was a fish out of water.  Why?  Because it was the Food and Drug Administration.  Toothpaste is a drug.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And I said to myself, well, now I've learned that fact (laughter) because I never, you never think about toothpaste as being a drug, but it has active ingredients.  So, when I show up, not only do I show up knowing nothing, I also show up in a new job that had never existed before.  They put me as the--what did they put me as--the first lawyer dedicated to the legal direction of North America, which was the biggest sub, and I didn't work for Andy [Andrew D. Hendry].  I didn't work for the general counsel.  Col- Colgate, at the time--I think it has now changed, had a decentralized legal department.  I worked, for the first time in my life, for a businessperson.  He did my performance evaluation.  He determined my raise.  Every day I came in, he dictated what I was doing, and they were very afraid of me when I showed up.  I didn't know this.  We laughed about it later.  This is another person I'm still in touch with to this day.  He said, "Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes], when you showed up, the guys didn't know what to do."  Here we go about the (gesture) woman thing.  Black was not the issue.  It was a fact that I was a woman.  So, they show--so I show up, and the team is all white guys, older, I'm the youngest one on top of that.  And they were petrified that I was going to change the chemistry among them.  They wouldn't have fun.  They wouldn't be able to do the same thing, you know, they went to steakhouse, and I'm vegetarian.  They never did figure that one out.  But even at a steakhouse, I can find vegetables.  So, in the end, they so saw they didn't have to be rowdy or inappropriate, and they could see still have fun, and they could still include me, so they would come looking for me.  "Michele, we, you know, we had a good quarter, we're going out to celebrate tonight--can you come?"  So, it ended up being okay that I was the only woman among them.  But in the beginning, Ed Fogarty [Edward T. Fogarty], who was my boss at the time, said, "We were quite concerned how you were going to change the dynamic."  He said, "And it turned out to be our problem--not yours."  So that's where I started.  So, when you talk about what did it mean to be ready, I had to, more than I'd ever done before, do something that I hadn't done quite as well as I thought I had done when I told you how to learn the business, when you live the business.  These are the people who bring in the quarter.  They know exactly what the P and L [profit and loss] says.  You live and fall with them.  And I got to be able to talk to them, and they wouldn't even know I was a lawyer.  I had not progressed that far.
Story_ID: 606008
Speaker 1: They then took me, and made me head of HR [human resources] for North America.  Now, that was when I almost thought, this is a lab experiment in which I do not want to be the rat.  I had been at the company [Colgate Palmolive Company] maybe eighteen months.  I get summoned to Ed's [Edward T. Fogarty] office, and I'm thinking, it's a legal issue.  So, I take my paper, and we're talking for a minute about some issue.  And then, he pops up with, "What would you think about being the head of HR?"  And I had my head down, and I'll never forget this.  I turned to see if somebody else had come in the room.  And when I saw there was nobody else in the room, I then thought it was truly a question.  I said, "I'm not interested."  "Oh." And it kind of, you know, it--he should have been accustomed to me by then.  I said, "No, not interested, not on my dance card."  And I went back to what I was doing.  I later found out they'd already decided I should be head of HR, and they were trying to persuade me that I should do it.  And that was one of the things I've done, one of the best things I've done, if you talk about truly widening your vista and your peripheral vision, because I'd never thought about how to motivate people, policy.  You're at a very, very different level, being the advocate for the employee, really the advocate and, and making that work in the system.  So, I did it with a lot of trepidation because it was the first time, really the first time I took over as the head of something I knew so little about.  And so, I tell people, you can lead without knowing everything, and that was another transition for me.  I did that for three years.  We had unions--
Speaker 2: So, wait a minute.  When you became the head of HR, was that part (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) For North America.
Speaker 2: But was that part of the legal department or not?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Oh, so you went on, you went in the, as a line--
Speaker 1: HR.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: I was still in North America--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but now, I wore the HR hat.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I didn't excel at this job.  I did, I was very credible at it, but I didn't excel, not the way I'd done in my legal jobs.  Heck, half the time, I was just trying to make sure I kept my balance 'cause we had--I'd never dealt toe to toe with unions.  And all the union negotiations were handled within the structure of human resources.  And in the end, I think I did, as I say, a very credible job.  I think I got more out of it than I gave, but they very much left me on the list as a potential to take over HR for the company, if something really disastrous would happen to head of HR. So I didn't bomb, but I would not put this as a stellar example.
Story_ID: 606009
Speaker 1: But what I did absolutely gain from this is so much more insight about how to lead people.  That's the insight that I took with me.
Speaker 2: So, what insight did you learn about how to lead people--
Speaker 1: You (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) because you, remember you talked about Unisys [Unisys Corporation] that you were able to keep, you know, people motivated.  Now, I wanted to ask you about that.  So, what, what, what were you able to do at Unisys but, yet, what did you learn at, at--
Speaker 1: I don't think there's one way people lead.  And, and I say that because I believe that there is context and, and points in time and history that inform us.  And so, for, for one person to say that the way [President] Abraham Lincoln led is the way someone should lead now would be a bit absurd because there's just--time moves on.  And so, for example, how do you lead a person in the millennial generation who text message all the time?  It's not the same way I'm going to lead somebody that's a baby boomer.  They don't, they're not on the same page.  But what you do find out is number one, when people ask the question, are leaders made, or are they born?  My answer is they're probably born with certain attributes, but there's a lot you can learn in the process.  So, what are the things that I learned?  Really, understanding what motivates somebody.  Everybody's not motivated by the same thing.  Some people are motivated by money--I think that's a short lived motivation.  Some people are motivated by recognition.  Some people are motivated by autonomy.  Now, do they want a little bit of all that?  True, but some things will move you much faster than they'll move someone else.  And so, being able to be open enough, to find out what that is, and not to have a cookie cutter which is okay, I do this, this, and this, and you ought to do that.  And so, I learned how to be challenged without being threatened by being challenged.  And I think it's particularly useful when you are a diverse person.  You know, people sometimes will tiptoe around you.  Well, they don't want to be, you know, at, for example, did I only get the job [at Colgate Palmolive Company] because I'm black?  I've heard people say that about Allstate [Allstate Corporation].  And so, I could get very offended by that.  On the other hand, if you're free enough to say it, then I can have a dialogue with you about it because I probably, if you were in a straitjacket, you would never say that to me.  Now, this is another black person, by the way, not a white person, although I think the white people were thinking it.  So, I've learned how to understand that being challenged is not necessarily insubordination, that you have got to be able to draw people out, to speak their mind because sometimes they will defer to you just because you're a top dog, and you got to make decisions when it's not necessarily popular.  And people are looking for direction.  They want it clear, and they want to understand what their role is.  And they want to believe that you've got a vision.  So, those are the things.  And, and if you put, it's a lot, but if you try to put, you know, Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell] once said, "I'm not sure how to define a leader, but I do believe people follow a leader when not at- when they're not necessarily sure where that person is going."  And that's true.  If you look at the financial turmoil that we lived in, are living through, people are following people because they want to believe that they've got a sense in their head.  They're not quite sure where they're going.  They have a sense in their head that they have a plan, and that there's hope that, that plan is a wise one.  And I think people have followed Paulson [Henry Paulson] to a large degree because he exhibits those attributes.  It's not because he always knows the answer.
Story_ID: 606010
Speaker 1: So, now in some respects, the way you describe that, and I may be wrong about this, but you're--the, the one who was general counsel, in some respects, he, he did that to you.  He chal--
Speaker 2: Andy [Andrew D. Hendry]--
Speaker 1: Andy.
Speaker 2: --very much so.
Speaker 1: And, right, he did that to you.  So, and, and so, was he a good mentor for you?
Speaker 2: He was, although he always laughed and said, "I'm a much better manager," but he's also a leader.  There's a difference between a manager and a leader.  And Andy was always very clear about what he wanted done--very clear.  That's when I would say, "You call it, you're the general counsel.  I've--you--listen to my piece, and I'm all right if you call it."  And that's what I tell people, I'm willing to listen to you, and I like the way President-elect Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] said it the other evening.  He said, "I will listen to you, especially when I disagree."  And it's very hard to listen to someone you disagree with--
Speaker 1: That's true (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) because I, I once heard someone say, most people pretend to be listening when what they're really doing is rearranging their prejudices.  And I believe that.  And so, I've trained myself, particularly when I know someone is going against my grain, to turn off the voices in my head, to lock on them.  But I have to train myself to do that because what my natural instinct to do is to come up with the next argument that's going to shoot them down.  And so, those are the things that I learned from watching how Andy led.  And then from, from some of the trial and error, and some of the courses I take on leadership about how do you give direction?  How do you communicate to people?  You must over communicate as much as you think, that person understood me.  You have to over communicate as clear if you think you're being.  And those are things you can learn to do.  And you've got to understand what is it you're communicating.  A person wants to know, how does this impact me?  What do you want me to do?  How are you going to help me?  Can I succeed?  That's what they want to know.  And so, when I think of when I'm writing or speaking, the, the message, subliminal message, and maybe sometimes the direct message is trying to answer those questions, so you can take that away and say, I now know what you need me to do.
Story_ID: 606011
Speaker 1: I want to understand, so you left Unisys [Unisys Corporation], which was a sort of crisis situa- you know, it was--
Speaker 2: It was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in a, a business in crisis.
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: In the--besides just understanding the food, well--
Speaker 2: Food and drug?
Speaker 1: --food and drug business, the toothpaste, but Colgate Palmolive [Colgate Palmolive Company] does, it's soap and things like that, too.  It's not, isn't it?
Speaker 2: Well, the thing that was so, I guess, like a candy store for me, was that 75 percent of the revenue of Colgate is outside this country--75.  When I left North America, North America included Puerto Rico, Canada, and the U.S. eventually.   That's how they define Puerto Rico.
Speaker 1: So, wait, when you, so let's just say when you left, so you did HR [human resources] for three years?
Speaker 2: For those areas. Canada--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --Puerto Rico, and the U.S. I then said, all right, I've done this long enough (laughter).  I, I frequently raise my hand before people ask.  I said, "I'm ready to do something else now."  I did it three years, so I did it long enough, so if I had mistakes, they caught up with me.  If you do something a year, you can usually do a head fake.  I'd done it three years, so they knew I had survived--thrived to a degree.  So, I said, "I'm ready to do something else."  And they said, "All right, let us--," and I said, "I want to do corporate."  Remember, Andy's [Andrew D. Hendry] discussion with me was, "You don't know corporate, you don't understand SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]."  So, they said, "All right, come on up to the law department."  So, I now leave an operating subsidiary, and I moved to a shared service law department.  And I go up there to do that, but they said, "We want you to do something else as well."  I said, "And what might that be?"  "You'll be over all the international lawyers."  I said, "When do I sleep?" (Makes sound) (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's a, that's a good question though.
Story_ID: 606012
Speaker 1: It was drinking from a fire hydrant.  Most of Colgate's [Colgate Palmolive Company] issues are EX-US, very complex issues, around regulatory schemes.  They've been in India seventy years?
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Most people think it's an Indian company, so I traveled the globe.  And I laugh when, when people say, "So what were you doing?  Why was Colgate in X?"  I said, "It's quite simple.  Colgate goes any place they have teeth."  And so, I've been in Romania, Poland, Africa.  I've been to Malaysia, Philippines, India, China, you name it.  And we had lawyers typically indigenous to those countries.  Some of the law departments were very large for a decentralized law department, but they typically grew up in those countries--Brazil, all over.  Colgate owns Latin America for--always has.  If I meet someone from Latin America--I was with a cab driver here in Chicago [Illinois] recently.  And I said, "Where are you from?" 'Cause I pick up accents because of being around the world so much.  I knew he was not from here.  And I was trying to place it.  He's from Colombia.  I said, "I've been to Cali [Colombia] and Bogota [Colombia]." So we started talking.  "What were you doing in Colombia?"  I said, (pronunciation) "Colgate." That's what they call Colgate.  Just like we call tissues Kleenex, people in Latin America call toothpaste, (pronunciation) Colgate, even if they mean Crest.  So, I ended up being in a very difficult position shortly after I took the new job.  So, I send now to the deputy general counsel job.  There are two deputies-Andy [Andrew D. Hendry] created two deputies.  One was a gentleman who mostly did regulatory work with the FDA [Food and Drug Administration], food and drug, marketing law, advertising.  And then, I had corporate and international.  When I took the international job, I laughed.  I said, "We did not do full disclosure here."  We had a multimillion judgment against the company in Ecuador, so I learned a lot about Ecuador and their judicial system.  And I spent a long time in Ecuador trying to figure out how to extricate us from what was a very, very unfortunate circumstance.  Let's just say it had a happy ending.  But I got doused very, very quickly in something that I also learned, and it's similar to, I'll listen harder if I disagree.  What I found was, because I had never practiced law outside this country, much less in countries that I didn't even speak the language in because, unfortunately, I'm a typical American, or at least typical of my generation.  I don't speak any other language, but the people I was paired with, some of them spoke five languages, five.  They would not even think twice about five languages.  So, I traveled with all of them and, and they would say to me, "Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes], you are not in the U.S."  And I would say, "Okay, you're right." And I had to listen, and what I say is, since you're traveling with baggage, I had to leave a baggage behind, behind, because I had these assumptions about how the court system to work- should work, how the lawyers should work, how the other side should work, and none of them applied.  And so, I had to say, you need to listen.  And I stopped talking, and we'd just sit there in a room.  Very frequently, we'd be having long debates.  Should we call the other side?  Should we meet with the president of this country?  Oh, it was just various things.  We would be going back and forth.  And I learned a great deal about learning to appreciate people who are quite successful, but do it very, very differently than you do.  And that was a rude awakening for me because Americans think, they're always so knowledgeable about everything.  And I think we get into very deep holes from which it is hard to climb when you carry too much of your assumptions with you to different countries.  And I think very frequently, you can see that in the wars we've gotten involved in.
Story_ID: 606013
Speaker 1: So, the one situation that you had to be extricated, what did that, what was that?
Speaker 2: It was something--once again, I ended up playing in something I knew nothing--I didn't know anything about HR [human resources], except these people.  I said, I know I got hired, and the check didn't bounce (laughter).  I never knew about benefit plans, so now, when I go to Ecuador, I quickly figured out after I went there a couple of times, and I even met with the other side.  That was a very interesting experience.  It was like meeting with a Don, as in the grand person, a Don, you know, he was like a grand poobah, and he couldn't figure out what I was doing there.  Curiously enough, I ended up deciding that if we stayed in the legal system, we would never end up with any satisfactory result, that you had to get involved, or, hopefully, get the government involved, and that's what I ended up doing.  And Reuben [Reuben Mark] thought it was a very remote chance 'cause I went to talk to him.  I had to get his permission to do this.  I said, "Reuben, I need to go to Washington [D.C.]."  I said, "We are not going to have a satisfactory ending here."  I said, "If you stay in the justice system," I said, "remember what justice--what Richard Pryor used to say, 'It's just us.'" I said, "You will end up paying this judgment and it is millions of dollars."  So, he said, "Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes], we don't play in Washington."  He did not have a public policy office and that was by design.  He said, "No one knows who we are in Washington."  He said, "There, you're not going to get access to the people you need."  I said, "But do I have your permission to do it?"  He said, "Go ahead," so that's all I needed.  I bought my access, so I went to people who did have access.  It's not like you can't find them.  You could hire law firms, you hire lobbyists.  And for the next six months, I lived and slept Ecuador--that is all I did.  I met with the state department [U.S. Department of State].  I met with anybody to tell them what was transpiring, and if they wanted Ecuador to have American investment, this could not be the ending that could be tolerated.  And in the end, we worked it out.  But I had never played in Washington before--ever.  You know, I never met with the state department.  And I said, "Okay," so I went with people who had.  I said, "Okay, talk to me, teach me." So, again, turned off my little voice, and listened to how they played in Washington.  And I made my way there, and after about six months we eventually sat down and struck a settlement that both sides could live with.  And it was a lot less (laughter) than the judgment that was outstanding, but we settled it.
Story_ID: 606014
Speaker 1: What I want to understand, so you did Ecuador, but what were the other countries that you--all over (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, my goodness, all over. I was in China--
Speaker 1: How many lawyers?
Speaker 2: Eighty lawyers overseas--
Speaker 1: Eighty, okay.
Speaker 2: --more than there were in the U.S.  There were roughly, if you look at the world headquarters on Park Avenue, it's right across from the Waldorf Astoria [Waldorf Astoria New York, New York, New York], right there.  There are roughly--this was, again, I'm going, but I'm trying to reconstruct.  There were roughly sixty, not even that high, in that world headquarters building, maybe closer to forty.  Most of the lawyers were in operating subsidiaries, which is where I was in the U.S. company.  Now, just assume that the U.S. company is mirror imaged around the world.  So, they would have lawyers in Malaysia, they'd have lawyers in the Philippines, a fairly large law department in India.  You talk about a government regulatory scheme that is bureaucratic--go to India.  It is very hard to navigate as a foreign coun- company in India, so many of these lawyers have been there years on, working on behalf of Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company].  So, I would--whenever we had issues, we had issues with, could we open additional plants in India?  Could you get money out of India once you raise that much profit--very hard to get money out of India then--very.  So, you had to decide how much were you willing to invest if you couldn't get out.  We had issues in various countries--Nigeria, very serious issues in Nigeria.  Once again, being a woman, we got into trouble in Nigeria because I don't think we, once again, understood the culture totally.  As much as we were smart, and we had very smart people, because many of the people that I worked with were not indigenous to this country.  But--to America--but there was a certain belief that if this model could be tweaked, and not radically changed, you could hit the ground running in those various countries.  So, we might buy a business and then bring people in, that had been through the Colgate system.  We got into difficulty in Nigeria, and it was very ugly. In the sense that, at one point, they took the plant from us. Commandeered it, we didn't have it (laughter).  So, I said, "Well, I need to go to Nigeria."  "What do you mean, you need to go to Nigeria?"  I said, "I need to go, so I can understand what this is just--I got to see it.  You know, I don't need somebody to--I want to see it."  I said, "And right now, we're at a crossroads on this.  And we're having an annual meeting where we're not paying a dividend for the first time in that country, in that company's history in that country."  And these were poor people that worked at these plants.  The guy we had bought the plant from had established what amounted to a 401(k) plan.  It was like profit sharing in a way.  And these people counted on these dividends to send all their kids to schools in London [England], so they had very educated next generation--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but the workers were not educated, and they showed up at the annual meeting to get their dividend checks.  And this was not discretionary income.  And I said, "We're not paying a dividend, right?"  I said, "That's going to be a big deal."  So, they said, "Well, you know, it's dangerous in Nigeria."  I said, "I'm, I'm not going to have eighteen body guards.  I'll go, you know, incognito," so to speak, I never could.  So, I get to Nigeria and I meet with the chiefs.  We had chiefs on our port, real chiefs (laughter), and I, I talked to them.  And I, I had a bit of a clash with the general manager.  He was from Latin America.  And I said--the annual meeting was the next day--I said, "You know, these people are going to be very angry.  We are messing with their money.  You don't need to go to a different country to know you don't mess with someone's money."  I said, "And they're going to be told, there is no money.  And they're going to believe you stole it." Because that's what happens.  So, I said, "We have to have security."  "No, I will not have security--I don't want anyone here with guns."  "Nope, we're having security."  And so, he finally relented--very, he was very angry with me.  I said, "I really believe this is the right--I understand that there's a lot of violence in this country.  And I'm not trying to say that we, in any way, want to be involved in it, but I think this is high stakes, to have this many people show up, and send them home empty handed."  And I was glad we did it because it was a very, very ugly meeting in terms of the emotion.  "Where is my money?  Of all--for forty years, we've gotten this money.  What did you do with it?  We trusted this American company.  You've ruined our livelihoods."
Story_ID: 606015
Speaker 1: I mean, that's, that's--and I sat next to people.  In fact, I got hemmed in.  I wouldn't sit with management.  I sat with the stockholders.  That's what they were, they were stockholders.  And I sat next to them and, eventually, so many showed up, there were no aisles left.  I'll never forget this.  And I'm trying to blend in.  Of course, I was not doing a good job.  I was pretending.  So, as I sit there with no place to--I couldn't even move.  I had a very interesting exchange with one of the stockholders.  He turns to me.  He says, "You're not Nigerian."  It didn't take much observation to understand.  I said, "No, I'm not from here."  I said, "Actually, I work for Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company]."  I said, "Well, what do you do?"  He said, "Well, I used to work for this company, and I quit," but he still had interest.  He said--and I said, "What do you think people think about this company?"  "They think, you have ruined the business, you've stolen the money, and we don't understand how you could have done that.  This company has been successful all its life."  I said, "So you honestly think we stole the money?"  He said, "Yes, we do."  So, I'm sitting there still.  He said, "I'm very, very sorry."  And I'm sitting there, going, why is he tell- I should be sorry.  Why is he sorry?  And he said to me, and I just paused, and saw how he really saw me.  He said, "I am so sorry that our ancestors sold you into slavery."  And I'm thinking to myself, quite honestly, and I can't wait to get back there.  I was so out of my element, but why do I say, what I took from that?  When I saw the angst, and, again, I was always willing to go to see how it was really done.  When I saw the angst on the faces of those people when they walked out with no money, and I came back here to the states, and I met with Reuben [Reuben Mark].  He said, "So, Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes], what's going on in Nigeria?"  I said, "It's very, very simple--where is the money?"  I said, "These people live on it, Reuben."  I said, "They buy clothes, they pay school tuition."  I said, "They have every reason to be so suspicious of us."  And we finally, we, we worked out a deal.  We sold the plant.  We left without any violence which was very--and he said to me, "No violence, Michele.  It is only soap and toothpaste."  I said, "I got it."  And we extricated ourselves, sold the plant, and left, so that's the kind of stuff I did.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: And it's always been, you know, you carry those experiences with you.
Story_ID: 606016
Speaker 1: Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes], that, that's fascinating 'cause I, you know, you don't hear those stories very often.  But the one question I have for you--what, how had Colgate Palmolive [Colgate Palmolive Company], how had it built its legal network?  The, the reason I'm asking is that, you know, I know, like a firm, like Baker and McKenzie [Baker McKenzie], they use a lot of individual, you know, lawyers indigenous to the nation, untold, okay.  So my--but it sounded like the way you were saying is that you build it country by country, your own network, is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sometimes.  This is the internal, these are the lawyers that were on the Colgate payroll.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: I had in house lawyers, in house, in almost every country I'm telling you about.
Speaker 1: Were, were you--did you ever supplement with, like a Baker and McKenzie model--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --or were you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All I know is Baker and McKenzie, and Coudert Brothers [Coudert Brothers LLP]--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, but we, we had other firms that were breaking out, but we--I went to Russia.  That was another experience.  But let me explain to you what happened in Nigeria.  There were no Baker and McKenzies to turn to at the--I mean, there just weren't, even if you wanted to, it would have been useless.  So, we hired one of the biggest firms in Nigeria in Lagos, and I went to the firm and sat with them.  I said, "Okay, tell me what you think I need to do."  What-- I said, "I, I don't play in your, in your sandbox."  And once again, I had to really listen, and even though sometimes I'd hear things and say, "Really?  You think we should do that?"  And it was unfortunate because when we were in the heat of battle trying to figure out, how to persuade people that we weren't dishonest, that we didn't steal the money, we lost it because we made investments that didn't pay off immediately.  And you're sitting there talking about return on investment.  And this shareholder saying, I need new shoes, I don't need your return on--let me tell you about my shoes.  And so, when I listened to the lawyer, Chris Okeke [Christopher Okeke], he really brought it home.  And he said, "Michele, if you don't get it." He said, "For some of these people, you may need to give them a goat."  I said, "A goat," (laughter)?  "Yes, a goat.  They're, they're farmers." "A goat."  And so, you have to suspend being incredulous or doubtful and, and just say, "Okay, I hear you.  So, how do you think we can navigate this?"  And one of the things he said to me because we, we didn't have a smooth road the whole way.  One thing that happened and it was a bit unfortunate.  One of his partners had gone to the plant.  And this was around the time, I think, they had decided to just commandeer the plant.  The partner was arrested by the police, and Chris was furious.  He had every right to be and so, he called me at four a.m., and I'm convinced he waited until four a.m. (laughter) to call me, as though I would have an intelligent reaction to something I'd never experienced.  But I understood what he said.  He said, "Look, my partner is in jail right now.  You know, we're going to have to figure out to do this."  And I said, "Chris, no bribes, period, end of game.  However we have to do it, no bribes."  And so, he, we worked together and we found a way to find a buyer.  And that buyer who was--certainly had more freedom of action than an institution like Colgate does, is a public traded company with the Foreign Practices Act [Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977].  So, we found a buyer that was, was able to extricate us from what was just an untenable situation.

Speaker 1: So, you took the plant out [of Nigeria], but you still have the distribution network to sell the product?
Speaker 2: We still sell the product through other means, but we don't have that plant in that community, which is what we wanted to do.  Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company] very firmly believes, and, and I, I think it has very successful operations in many places.  Africa has been a bit tougher, just my experience, and I've been gone for six years.  South Africa was really the only country where it had a very entrenched operation that it continued operating during apartheid.  They refused to pull out and they refused to segregate the locker room.  That's how they kind of navigated.  They, the black and whites, all mingled at that plant.  But in any event, Africa has been tougher for many way- for many reasons.  None of them is necessarily a good reason, but, generally they would go in with external expatriates, but eventually what you want to do is grow your internal, your local base, so that you've got people that have got some credibility.
Story_ID: 606018
Speaker 1: Now, you did that for two years.  How did it come--how did Pitney Bowes [Pitney Bowes Inc.] come up then?
Speaker 2: Two things--I did that for two years, and then before I left, I left the international and corporate, and then I ran what, what was called--
Speaker 1: I was just think the travel, did the travel take, take a toll (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Its toll?
Speaker 1: --because--
Speaker 2: I was so--I never traveled as a kid.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: I never went, you know, I never went on vacations that were foreign countries.  And so, I was making up for lost time.  Remember, I wanted to be a flight attendant (laughter)?  I just did it in a different way--wasn't serving the drinks though, thank goodness, so I ended up doing okay on the travel.  I learned the science about, you know, don't eat when you get on the plane.  I had a whole thing going, so I could usually hit the ground running.  It was sometimes harder than others, but people were very sympathetic.  The great thing about Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company], you had all these indigenous people that just took care of you.  I landed, and that's all I had to do.  I was chauffeured around, taken to the meetings, my hotel reservations were taken care of.  And these were people that grew up in those countries, so the same was true for Nigeria.  It was true in India, the Philippines.  So, I never felt--in fact, I was in a very safe environment because I was always being shepherded by folks that were indigenous to the country.  So, I was okay with that.
Story_ID: 606019
Speaker 1: Now, what did you do?  You were starting to say what you did--
Speaker 2: When I left that job, I--the last thing I did before I left Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company] was over, what you loosely would call operations.  That is, what are all the legal functions that need to get the product on the shelf?  So, you've got the intellectual property.  Trademarks are big on consumer product companies.  We also had patent lawyers because we had formulas that had patents on them.  We had marketing, all the ad work.  That's a--we spend a ton of money on ads.  That's all you get the people to know about your product and buy it.  And then, I had, what was loosely called just, you know, general advice, just the general stuff that goes around that.  So, all those lawyers, and I've forgotten how many I had, worked for me and that, I'd never done patent law before.  That was another thing I got thrown into.  So, I, I ended up doing some pretty radical things.  It was time, but it was not easy, but we, I learned a great deal from them and vice versa 'cause the company started to need what was really, at a point, we needed to take a slightly different location.  And so, we start (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Colgate, Colgate Co--
Speaker 2: --in the patent area, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we were starting, you know, starting to do that.
Speaker 1: What do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: Well, if you looked at, we were losing some of our competitive edge in the--it may sound funny when you talk about toothbrushes.
Speaker 1: You mean about toothpaste and toothbrushes, and the changes you see in the packaging?
Speaker 2: In the competitive environment, if a competitor locks you out of a market because they have got a patent portfolio that is robust, that is a very tough pill to swallow.  And that was starting to happen in some ways, so we needed to make some changes--
Speaker 1: Okay, I see, okay.
Speaker 2: --to really catch up with competition and, hopefully, pass it.
Speaker 1: But isn't that an R and D [research and development] thing?
Speaker 2: But the lawyers also work with R and D--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --you know, in some ways, they're hand in glove.
Story_ID: 606020
Speaker 1: Did Pitney Bowes [Pitney Bowes Inc.] come calling?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a very interesting story.  I met, I had lunch with Sara Moss, who was my predecessor at Pitney Bowes, about what--when the marathon was here, for three or four weeks ago, she came to Chicago [Illinois].  And Sara Moss, I met through networking.  I think networking is critical.  I tell people to network when you don't need to.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: You know, people hate for you to network when they know all you want to do is ask them for something.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: And so, Sara and I met because I was networking with a group of lawyers, all women, most of whom were general counsel.  I was deputy general counsel at Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company]. I was not top dog. But the headhunters knew and thought I was ready to move.  As I said to somebody, if I go through one more chair at Colgate, it will be a tomb.  I, you know, how many more chairs can I go through?  I've done enough.  I've trained long enough now, I've over trained.  So, the headhunters had me on their rolodex, their Blackberry now, whatever.  And so one of the headhunters, she was very clever.  All the lawyers she was either thinking about placing, or had placed, she would get together for a day and a half.  She'd keep her hand on the pulse, "So how's it going, what are you doing?"  And I met Sara, or really--I'd met her once before.  I got to know Sara through that networking, and we just had good chemistry.  We never worked together.  We would just chitchat at these informal gatherings.  I get a phone call--I'll never forget this--I get a phone call, a voicemail message in January of '02 [2002]--no. Right? January of '02 [2002].  It's Sara.  "Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes], it's Sara, give me a call."  Okay, I give her a call, I get her voicemail.  This went on until March.  I finally say, "Sara, if you want me to be on a panel, just tell me.  I'm tired of playing telephone tag." 'Cause I can never get her on her phone.  Finally, in March, I answer my phone and she's on the other end.  She said, "Well, I'll be darn, you do exist."  I said, "All you had to do was leave a voicemail message telling me what you wanted, Sara."  I said, "This has been going on for weeks!"  She then says to me, "I have a great job.  It is with one of the best jobs I have ever had."  I said, "Sara, I'm not much interested." (Laughter) Here goes my big mouth.  She said, "Well, I intend to leave it."  And then my light goes off.  I'm not as slow this time--or maybe I am.  She says, "Would you like to be considered?"  And that was the beginning of the discussion.  And I don't think--Mike Critelli [Michael J. Critelli], the CEOs that I've worked with, have always been very open minded, and I've been really, really lucky.  That's Reuben [Reuben Mark], Mike [W. Michael Blumenthal], and now Tom [Thomas J. Wilson] because I don't think I appeal to a certain person or I might--I'm not as radical as I sometimes look.  People think I'm radical, and I don't think I am.  I'm a little bit outside the box, but I don't consider that being radical, but some people would be somewhere put off by me.  So, when Sara mentioned that she was putting the slate together with no outside search firm, she said, "I'm resigning this job."  9/11 [September 11, 2001] had happened.  Sara has four kids, they were all at home, except for one.  And she was commuting from New York [New York] to Stamford, Connecticut, and it was a real drain on her.  And so, she was really reassessing what she needed to do personally.  She wanted to find a job in the city, which she subsequently did.  She's general counsel for Estee Lauder [The Estee lauder Companies Inc.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but she quit with no job.  So, when she called me and told me that, she said, "I think you are ready, and I'm putting you at the top of the list.  I told Mike, why doesn't he save the fees of an outside search firm?  If he doesn't like the candidates that I've put in front of him, then hire the search firm, but why doesn't he see what candidates I can bring in on my own?"  And then, she coached me through the entire process.  We talk on the phone.  We would meet.  She'd tell me how he was as a CEO, what the company's issues were.  She coached me.
Story_ID: 606021
Speaker 1: So, you were her heir apparent?
Speaker 2: In her mind.  And that's how, and after he met me, he interviewed me for four hours on a Saturday.  He was very accommodating 'cause I didn't want Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company] to know I was interviewing.  You rarely want your current employer to know that.  And so, he did it on a Saturday, and the only reason we stopped is that he had to go take his son to some event.  And after I left, I didn't click with him right away.  I went, (makes sound), so I called Sara [Sara Moss].  She said, "So how did it go?" (Laughter) I had to report in.  I said, "Well, it was okay."  I said, "It was four hours however."  I said, "I was about brain dead when I left."  She said, "Went well in his book.  He sa- he says, you're a bit unusual."  I said, "Well, I wasn't going to dress myself up for the interview."  I said, "I don't want to do bait and switch."  So, I didn't hear anything for six months 'cause I was the first one out of the gate.  Sometimes when that happens, you lose advantage because people forget what you've been like--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --when it's six- but it went many months later.  They had several people they were interviewing.  I finally get a phone call for the second interview--that's three hours, so I spent seven hours with him.  And this time, it was the kind of person he was.  He was so unassuming.  He met me in New York [New York].  He said, "I'm bringing my kid back from camp--," or, "--taking my kid to camp.  I can come through New York, and we'll meet in the city."  And that was on a Sunday, and we met for three hours on that Sunday.  And then, he told Sara, "Okay, I'm interested."  And the things Sara said, she said, "You can never repeat this," and here I am committing it permanently.  They were talking about me and he said, "Well, I like the way she thinks, but you know, she's really different, Sara."  He said, and, and diversity has always resonated with Mike [Michael J. Critelli].  He said--she said, "Well, Mike, diversity is more than an Armani suit with breasts."  And that's--must have appealed to him in some way.  I, I'm still thinking about that image.  And so, the rest is history.  And that's how I ended up in my third industry that I knew nothing about.  I never even knew what the Pitney Bowes machine did.  Of course, I had one in my prior life when I was a secretary.
Story_ID: 606022
Speaker 1: So what, what opportunity did he present to you--
Speaker 2: Well, first of all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) because it's not like it was his choice.  She [Sara Moss] was leaving [as general counsel of Pitney Bowes Inc.].
Speaker 2: But he--anyone who understands, it's a Fortune 500 company.  It's in a very desirable community.  It's right near Greenwich [Connecticut], commutable to, to New York [New York].  So, trust me, he would have had no shortage of people vying for that job.  And I'm not saying that to toot my own horn.  I just understand how these jobs come about.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, as a consequence, it was his call to recommend to the board because it, ultimately, the board is, is, in this environment.  Anyone that's paying attention to corporate governance would make sure the board is comfortable when I was going to be one of the top five officers in the company.  I was in the proxy.  Even if I'm not in the proxy, even with Allstate [Allstate Corporation], I had to interview with certain key board members.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, I interviewed with all his management team and, I guess, passed that test.  And then, I met with the board of directors, and then he extended an offer.  And what I liked about it, number one, as I've said more than once, I liked Mike's [Michael J. Critelli] values.  I liked the fact, for example, he said to me, "I got to go pick up my child, my--," and he would tell me, "No, he's playing hockey, or he's doing this."  He was very open about family.  He didn't whisper, say, "You know, I have a very important meeting, I have to stop at four [o'clock]."  Instead, he said, "You know what, I'd love to keep talking to you, but I'm supposed to pick up Michael [Michael A. Critelli], my oldest son, now," and that's the way he ought- and that just signals that he wasn't trying to appear so self-important that family doesn't matter.  The only thing I liked about him, he is so un-CEO-ish-like.  It wasn't as though you felt you had to kiss his ring, you know, kowtow to him.  And I work better with people like that because I, I, said to you, from the time you asked, why was I so quiet?  Because if I say something, I'm going to tell you what I'm thinking.  And if you think I'm going to do it in a certain way, I'm not, I'm not rude, I don't think, or unaware of the importance of people.  But if I think you need to hear something, I will dress it down, so you will understand it in plain English because I do not want you to misunderstand me, and dress something up where you miss the point.  And some people don't like that about me--I already know that.  He, he was very open to that, and I could just tell that from the way I talked to him because I frequently, when I'm meeting with strangers, and they ask you, what are your weaknesses, what are your strengths, what have you failed at, what are you particularly proud of that you've succeeded doing?  The, the stories I pick try to explain who I am because you can go through an interview which is a little bit artificial, and he was not put off by that.
Story_ID: 606023
Speaker 1: So now, what size was the legal department?
Speaker 2: Relatively small, not nearly as large as Col-
Speaker 1: Right, that's right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company]. The entire department only had about twenty-eight lawyers.  It was not a large department, not as international, but we did do business in Japan and Europe, so we definitely had a presence in Europe.  But Latin America--those, the, the diversity of geography that Colgate had--Pitney Bowes [Pitney Bowes Inc.] is very heavily regulated by governments because stamps are money.  Indicia are money.  So, you got to get a government permit or license to do business in those various countries, so it's a much more constrictive environment.  And so, they had tried to go into different markets and had not been as successful.  But in any event, the vision of, of Mike [Michael J. Critelli] was, you know, taking, mailing beyond the core business that they had grown up with.  It's a very hard thing to do that transformation, and he talked about that.  And I could--what I've always liked about the people I've met, when you have a business that's been around eighty years, Allstate's [Allstate Corporation] been now around seventy-seven years.  Colgate's been around over a hundred plus.  When you go to businesses like that, and you know they have to remain relevant, and nobody has a lock on that, if you are, or if they're asking you, come, and I say it like this, how do you take the best of what you've been to become what you need to be?  And those are the environments I like to play in, and that's what Mike was doing.
Story_ID: 606024
Speaker 1: You were entering a rarefied space, and that, that's a world of the general counsel, which to the public, is not very well known, you know, in the legal community.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's one that people, you know, aspire to, but the positions don't turn, turn up that often, and that's the whole thing.  Sometimes general counsels, you know, have been known to just sit for--I mean, for like, whole lifetimes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Whole lifetimes.
Speaker 1: But the question I have for you is, at the time that you came into being, what other minority general counsels were there?
Speaker 2: I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was, was--
Speaker 2: You mean, women?
Speaker 1: Yeah, women, and--
Speaker 2: Paula Boggs.
Speaker 1: Boggs was at Starbucks [Starbucks Corporation]?
Speaker 2: Deirdre [Deirdre Stanley]--well, Deirdre was not in the Fortune 500 because her parent company was Canadian, so Deirdre Stanley was in Stamford [Connecticut].  But it was Paula Boggs, Kellye Walker at BJ Wholesale [BJ's Wholesale Club Inc.].  Okay, now, you're going to really stretch my memory.
Speaker 1: Isn't, was--
Speaker 2: She's, she's now at Diageo [Diageo North America, Inc.], but she won't appear in the Fortune 500 because even though the North American sub is huge, Diageo is based in the U.K. [United Kingdom].
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So, you sometimes miss people because they're running big books of business, but they're not on the exchange.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what somewhat separates you.  So Paula, Kellye, myself, Gloria Santona, obviously, Hispanic.  And there are only six of us--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --there were six.  I'm missing two people right now, but there were six general counsels (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Out of, out of how many companies?
Speaker 2: Five hundred.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's not--
Speaker 2: There would have been women, about seventy-five, so we were less than what--10 percent of the total women GCs in the Fortune 500.
Speaker 1: How, how about black men?
Speaker 2: More black men around thirty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Stacey Mobley [Stacey J. Mobley] was DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company].  Ken Frazier [HistoryMaker Kenneth C. Frazier] was at Merck [Merck and Co., Inc.].  I can go on.  James Potter [HistoryMaker James G. Potter] was at Del Monte Foods [Del Monte Foods, Inc.].  Rick Palmore [Roderick A. Palmore] was at Sara- [Sara Lee Corporation]--they had a lot more black males.  Black males, interestingly enough, maybe not surprisingly, were the largest minority as a block.  Then black women, and we had five or whatever, four, if you take out Gloria, because she's Hispanic.  And then, you have Asians, you know, very, very small.
Story_ID: 606025
Speaker 1: So, what was the biggest challenge, you know, 'cause, one, you, you are in charge as general counsel, so what was the difference between the culture, you know, besides, you know, you said, he had a vision, he was trying to change.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Pitney Bowes [Pitney Bowes Inc.] was at the top, but it was facing more competitors.
Speaker 2: Exactly, especially competitors from overseas, no less, and also just relevance.  Why do I need to send anything through the U.S. mail when I could text message?  Right?  When I can do an email with an attachment, so there were very large questions about the relevancy of mail.  Now, we think there's a lot of relevancy, maybe not consumer to consumer, but business to consumer.  How do you get you to buy something is not by a text message typically.  There's marketing, a lot of marketing, but having said that, it was a question of how do you keep relevant to the marketplace as it is changing?  I think the question for us--I had a group of lawyers, the biggest group of which were the patent lawyers.  Thank goodness, I managed the patent area at Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company] because the patent area at Pitney Bowes was a big deal.  That's where we spent the most money.  That's where I had the largest number of lawyers specialized.  And we are, in essence, a high tech company, but people don't think of us as high tech because we're not making things that are in the front of mind. We're not making computers.  We're making mailing equipment, but it is extremely complex mailing equipment.  So, I had to go into a culture I didn't know. Not unlike--so I'd experienced that at Colgate.  I, I actually find it a challenge and an opportunity 'cause people don't know you.  And while you're not reinventing yourself, you're deciding how they get to know you, and that's always been fun to me.  So, I went in with, first of all, I was a very secure because Sara [Sara Moss] had given me a lot of insight.  You can't take for granted when somebody gives you a platform to operate from, and she had.  And she's--and I overlapped with her for about thirty days.  She didn't leave immediately.  And I found the company small enough.  It wasn't a large company.  The world's headquarters isn't huge, so I could hit the ground running, meeting, and touching people fairly quickly because my goal, from the very beginning, as I've now said multiple times, I had to learn the business again.  I couldn't just say I'm a lawyer, aren't you glad I'm here?  The stakes were high.  I'm in the board room.  We've got disclosure issues.  We've got big litigation.  There was litigation there, not the same, this is kind that Allstate [Allstate Corporation] or Colgate had, but still, there was litigation that had to be dealt with--a lot of it on patent law.  One of the biggest cases I tried there, and I took it to verdict, and it was multiple millions of dollars, could not settle it.  It was a Japanese company.  It's, it's amazing how quickly one forgets.  It was a Japanese company, and the case that was pending before I ever got there.  Here we go, like Ecuador was pending before I went to the law department.  And, and at Colgate upstairs, it was pending at Pitney Bowes before I ever showed up.  It had been filed a year before I arrived.  And by the time, about a year and a half before I left, I said, "We're going to try it."  And everybody's eyes get big. "You are going to try it?"  "Yep," I said, "they've made it easy."  I said, "You cannot settle this.  You're going to have to win it."  And so, people laughed.  They said, "Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes], you know your whole performance evaluation will be done on one verdict" (laughter).  But I went to the courtroom.
Story_ID: 606026
Speaker 1: I've always--what I did is I got to know my staff, their pluses, again, what motivates them, how do I get them to do things, how do I get them to grow?  One of the people that was there, he became really my right hand.  He said, "I want to be a general counsel."  I said, this is a familiar discussion, only, only, I'm on the other end of it this time.  I said, "Nobody knows you want to be general counsel.  They barely know you're breathing."  And I said, "Are you honest?"  I said, "Well, I'll tell you what somebody else told me," because I'd seen enough of him to know he could do it.  I said, "I'll get you ready--if not here, someplace else."  So, he worked very, very closely with me.  And I moved people around, people that didn't volunteer to be moved around.  I was trying to get people in the right jobs.  I had some people that needed to lead.  I tell folks, sometimes you need to cut your losses.  So, these were things I knew I couldn't waste time on because I kind of had to hit the ground running in many ways.  But you don't want to be rash to the point you're making serious mistakes although sometimes you never know.  In the end, I got a department that I thought was truly clicking, people that I saw grow tremendously.  That's really my legacy in the end now.  At this stage of my career, it's how can I grow people so that when I am long gone, that you see a legacy that they're fulfilling their human capital, their purpose?  The person I told you that I was getting ready, he was a very serious contender for my job when I left [Pitney Bowes Inc.].  He was definitely one of either him--it was either going to be him or a person from the outside.  They did go with a person from the outside, but he's a general counsel someplace else now.  So, I, I found the environment freeing enough again that we could try thing- to do things differently, and I, and I think we did in how the company needed legal services.
Story_ID: 606027
Speaker 1: Let me ask, (cough) ask you this.  In each of the places that you've been, what was the view of outside counsel versus in- in house counsel, and how that was just sort of be handled, or what, you know, I mean--
Speaker 2: I don't know if I understand the question (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I mean, 'cause sometimes things, a lot of things were given out, you know, I, I'm not--
Speaker 2: I mean, the balance of work?
Speaker 1: The balance, I'm sorry, the balance of work--
Speaker 2: I got it.
Speaker 1: --because sometimes I've seen it where, you know, everything is given out.  Then, it's like we're spending too much money.  We can manage this better internally, you know, we'll do it.
Speaker 2: That is a surgical question.  You've got to look at the footprint of every company.  The first thing you need to see is, okay, where is most of the work being generated?  Is it litigation, is it contract work, is it patent applications?  In our instance, we grew the patent department because we wrote a lot of the applications in house.  We decided we did not want to farm it out.  First of all, it's a very esoteric area.  There're not thousands of people that play in the mailing space.  That's one of the issues of the company [Pitney Bowes Inc.].  It's a niche business, so the decision was to grow the patent department, which is why I told you it was the largest side of the business.  On the other hand, the other transformational thing that happened where we did not beef up the internal department was M and A [mergers and acquisitions].  We decided that, as a management team, we needed to acquire a software companies, two big software acquisitions while we were there.  And at the end of the day, we decided it was a smarter use of our resources--because it ebbed and flowed--was to have a core group of people who worked the deals. But that when it really got to be close, more than just doing an analysis of was it something we wanted to do, we had, we had to go, and pair and partner with an outside law firm.  That could change, I guess, if you do enough deals, you'll build your muscle in house.  We just could not justify it 'cause those are very expensive lawyers if you look at the market rates, so we decided to have a very skeleton staff inside, and always link outside for the real muscle.  So, it depends on your company--that's my answer (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Story_ID: 606028
Speaker 1: At Allstate [Allstate Corporation], we do litigation.  We are a litigation company.  That's what it, most insurance companies are.  It's a combination.  There are seven hundred lawyers there, five hundred, but explain where the five hundred are.  It's a captive law firm.  So, all of the various insurers that get involved in auto accidents or issues with their policy in some way, those lawyers are represented many times by lawyers that are on my staff.  But they're in all these various states throughout the United States.  They're in New York and Montana, California, so we decided that model worked for us because the cases are not necessarily big ticket cases.  They could be ten thousand dollars.  If you go to an outside law firm, most of us know you run through hourly rates pretty quickly unless you're on a fixed fee of some sort.  So, this model has worked for many, many years.  So, we have lawyers, five hundred lawyers, in what looks like a private law firm setting.  Sometimes you'll see John Smith and associates.  It doesn't even say it's Allstate.  Other licensing laws in various states say you have to disclose it on the door.  So, it will depend.  So, those are five hundred lawyers right there.  The two hundred remaining lawyers are here in Illinois for the most part.
Speaker 2: That's--I didn't know that it was.  That's huge.
Speaker 1: And then, there are another six hundred people in my department, so the department is thirteen hundred.  It's--and I came from a much smaller--that was one of the questions about me, you know, she hasn't played in the big leagues.
Story_ID: 606029
Speaker 1: So how did this opportunity come up?
Speaker 2: This came, this is the one opportunity I've gone to--cold call.  I got a phone call from a search firm in June of 2007 and, quite honestly, I had already decided to interview someplace else for a GC [general counsel] job, and I am convinced I could have gone there if I'd wanted to.  I'm not going to disclose who it is.  I don't think it's appropriate. I'd already started that process, so when I got the phone call, I said, "I'm not interested.  If it's insurance, forget it."  I said, "That's not," once again, "it's not on my dance card, so I would rather not do it."  When that happened, the headhunter [June Eichbaum] refused 'cause I knew her (laughter).  She said, "Well, I think that's a very poor attitude." "Well," I said, "what else would you tell me?"  She said, "Well, I think you ought to give it some thought."  Now, let me tell you, the, the other reason why I was not interested in interviewing.  I got on a public company board of an insurance company, Assurant [Assurant, Inc.].  And this was one of the hardest things I've ever done.  I mentioned Harvey Pitt [Harvey L. Pitt], the former head of the SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission], that I met in 1987 when Burroughs-Unisys [Unisys Corporation] got in trouble.  Enter Harvey Pitt--I was a board member.  I joined the board in 2004, and this started this SEC investigation, which is publicly disclosed, so I'm not telling you anything that you couldn't read.  It started roughly around the time I joined the board, there was some inkling that the insurance company was being investigated for accounting irregularities in 2005, not long after I joined the board.  I joined in 2004, and shortly after that, there was some inkling that AIG [American International Group, Inc.]--it was a bunch of things.
Speaker 1: Now, when, when did Sarbanes-Oxley [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002] come into--
Speaker 2: Oh, Sarbanes-Oxley passed while I was at, in 2001 [sic.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At Pi- at Pi- okay.
Speaker 2: --while I was at Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company]--
Speaker 1: Okay,
Speaker 2: --before I came to Pitney Bowes [Pitney Bowes Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It was after the Enron [Enron Corporation].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I can't, I think, I can't remember exactly, but it would have been around that time.  So, Sarbanes-Oxley was definitely not the reason for any of this.  But the, for some reason, the insurance industry was under a great deal of scrutiny.  Needless to say, the wheels kind of came off.  And in the summer of 2007, I had been asked to chair the special committee of the board because we got served with Wells notices.  They were served on the CEO, which says, come in to the SEC, and explain to us why we should not charge you with whatever the irregularity is.  This is a big deal.  So the CEO got a Wells notice, the CFO got a Wells notice, and the CFO for the largest operating business got a Wells notice.  And I went my, my--I mean, I knew, I had played in this league.  I said, this is serious.  So, the board said, "All right, we've got to put a special committee together.  Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes], will you chair it?"  I literally started working around the clock on this special committee.  I had my day job, which was Pitney Bowes.  Now, again, I had a very good staff by then, thank goodness.  This is now 2007.  I've been there almost what, four years.  At the same time, I had interviews going on for this other company where I was seriously considering it, and, and, and was pleased with how it was going.  And, finally, I have this investigation that breaks on this board, so I was burning the can- candle at both ends and another one if I had it.  So, when I got the call from this search firm, I said, you know, I'm, I'm really under a great deal of stress right now.  What we did, as a result of the Wells notice, we put all three of those gentleman on administrative leave.  We pulled them out.  And Harvey Pitt--Harvey and I had become kindred spirits.  He was instrumental because those were very, very tough decisions to make.  This, this is a publicly traded company, $8 billion company, and I'm talking about removing the CEO overnight.  And, and I did a lot of soul searching on this.  It--I know there are people who think we made the wrong decision, but at some point, you got to make a decision, you got to move.  So, I mention this because I really didn't feel I had the capacity to invest in any other activity, even if it was only interviewing.
Story_ID: 606030
Speaker 1: And she kept bugging me.  And I finally said, "Where is the stupid company," (laughter)?  I didn't know which company--she said insurance--I think, you know, I had prejudices, especially since I'm dealing with an insurance company [Assurant, Inc.] in this investigation.  She said, "Well, it's, it's right outside of Chicago [Illinois]."  I said, "Can I get there in, in a day--back, in and back?"  That was my test.  She said, "Yeah, you can do that."  So, then, I thought it was an omen.  I said, "Okay, if I can get there and back, I'll do it.  Send me the information, June [June Eichbaum]."  So, I read all this stuff.  I'm like, multitasking, I go to the airport at seven o'clock the night before to leave.  This is after being on a special committee interviewing witnesses all day.  I leave those interviews, run to the airport.  Every flight to Chicago is cancelled.  I then think to myself, this is a sign.  I should not be going to Chicago.  Every flight to Chicago is can- I mean, there was not an airline moving.  So, I go back home, and I'm almost at a point where I need to just call it quits.  I say, "June, there's no flight to Chicago in a night, I cannot get there."  She can tell I'm resigned to--I'm not doing this, right.  She said, "Well, wait a minute.  We can get you there in the morning."  "You think so, huh?"  "Sure, we can."  She goes on, we get on the Internet.  It turns out--she--I fly to Boston [Massachusetts] to get to Chicago (laughter).  And then, the interview took--I was late getting to the interview.  Mentally, I was exhausted.  I thought I was babbling 'cause I had very little sleep under high stress 'cause this is now in August.  So, all these people have been removed, and we're trying to decide what the SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] wants us to do, what do we need to do, so I'm spending more time on my board activities than I am at work.  So, I get to the interview and I think, this is a conservative industry.  They're not going to want me, and I'm not changing--not this late.  And, curiously enough, here you go having all these biases, right?  I tell people, you know, remain open to the possibilities.  And it was a very comfortable environment.  The, the general counsel, Mick McCabe [Michael McCabe], and I clicked immediately.  Don't ask why--we just did.  The same thing was true for Tom [Thomas J. Wilson], but, frankly speaking, I was so glad the interview was over because I was, I was exhausted mentally.  I fly home Friday night, and I get home and collapse.  I'm not expecting to hear from them.  I want this headhunter to stop calling me now.  Okay, I did the interview.  Now, they're going to reject me, so we can leave, leave that chapter closed.  I get an email.  I'm sitting in a meeting.  My Blackberry goes off.  She said, "Tom's coming to New York [New York].  He needs to meet with you."  I go, oh, my god, this has legs.  I never dreamt this.  So, Tom, not unlike the CEOs that I had met at--with Reuben [Reuben Mark] and Mike [Michael J. Critelli]--he's coming to New York to be with his son.  His son is in film school in Brooklyn [New York].  He's coming to spend the weekend with him.  Did I have some time?  Okay, I don't even have to get on a plane, so I said, "Sure, I have time," and the devil made me do it.  I said, "Well, where should I meet him?"  We schlepped all the way down to Battery Park [New York, New York] for this interview.  I'm thinking he's staying down at the Battery Park somewhere.  He wasn't.  So, I get there for the interview and I had some very tough questions.  I said, "You know, your team is not diverse.  There's no woman running a P and L [profit and loss].  You know, don't wish for something you may get.  Why do you think you want me?"  I said, and why do you--and I've got to answer my questions, which is why do I want to be there?  And Tom was very, very open with me.  We--he laughs now because he says, "Yes, I remember those."  I said, in fact, I was trying to remember the answer he gave me, so I could compare it now to see if I could hold him.  I couldn't remember what exactly he told me, but as we're leaving the interview, this was very telling.  I said, "So do you have a car waiting" because I found out he wasn't staying at the hotel.  He said, "Oh, no, I'm going to get- catch a cab."  Well, that was the first thing--that's not like a CEO.  Most CEOs have cars waiting.  And now, this is the devil made me do it.  I said, "Well, I'm catching the subway," 'cause I found out he was staying near me.  "Want to ride the subway?"  He said, "Yeah, but I don't have a subway card."  I said, "But I do."  And he was as comfortable riding that subway as I was.  And that's kind of when I fell over into his camp.  That's very--it may seem very elementary, pedestrian, but the fact that a CEO would get on a subway and ride, I have people in New York that have lived in New York who will not get on the subway.  And we talked the entire time we were on the subway 'cause it was a long ride back to Midtown [Midtown Manhattan, New York, New York].  So, that's how I ended up at Allstate [Allstate Corporation] is they, they were willing to take me the way I am.  And Tom is trying to do--it's not transformation, that's not the word he uses.  We used the word, reinvent.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I think it's important to have it in context.
Story_ID: 606031
Speaker 1: I mean because Tom [Thomas J. Wilson] was a new CEO, right?
Speaker 2: Two years roughly, two years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Two years, but still, for following someone, was it Liddy? Li--
Speaker 2: He followed Ed Liddy.
Speaker 1: Liddy, who had been there for--
Speaker 2: Nine years.
Speaker 1: Oh, just nine?
Speaker 2: He, he was with a different--was he in investment banking before he was--they were with Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], both he and Ed Liddy were with Sears.
Speaker 1: That's right, okay.
Speaker 2: When Sears was made a publicly traded company, then they moved over.  So, when you talk about their tenure, it includes both--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --Tom has been with Sears/Allstate [Allstate Corporation], thirteen years.
Speaker 1: I see, right.  I keep thinking of Ed Liddy being longer, but it's because of the Sears, yeah.  And, really, being a very big fabric here in the, you know, in the corporate community, too.
Speaker 2: Very much so.  But I think Tom is also doing that because now, he's really on his own platform.  But Ed was a very noticeable contributor to the larger Chicago [Illinois] community.
Speaker 1: It's not--so, what did he present to you though?  What was he, what was he saying he wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Same thing that, that I heard and it was no different.  When I looked at what, a longstanding company, seventy-seven years old that, once again, the market share is not growing.  What do you need to do to remain relevant?  And I tell people that coming from Motown where, if you had said to me, that General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] would be running on fumes, I would have said, no way.  What's good for the country is good, you know, what's good for General Motors is good for the country.  General Motors was a big dog, and the auto industry in many ways certainly ran Detroit [Michigan] and a lot of the economy in this country.  And when I look at how irrelevant those big four, they're not--or not big four are to the consumer, you say success has no guarantee and nor should it.  That's true for individuals and that's true for companies.  You can either go out of business.  You can be put out of business.  You can be bought.  And if you're a publicly traded company, any one of those is a top, potential outcome.  And so, when Tom says, as good as we are, that's no, you know, this hubris of we've been successful, so why won't we continue to be successful when I stand up in front of the folks at, at Allstate, and they say, you know, she doesn't know insurance yet.  I may not know insurance, but I understand business success.  And so, what I say to them, I said, "You know what?  There is no reason for you not to be proud.  You've got seventy-seven years of success."  I said, "But the real question is, how will you sustain it?"  And when I think of the companies, if we all go back, and the business studies, either by Harvard Business Review--they never take time to look at the businesses that are in the graveyards.  And there are a lot of them.  And they were well known at one time.  So, I think Tom is forward thinking enough, and he's very intellectually curious.  He reads, he reads constantly.  He is intellectually curious, and when I saw that in him, I said--not unlike Mike Critelli [Michael J. Critelli], he and Mike are very much cut from the same cloth.  They don't, they are not wedded to the paths in the sense that they become mental slaves.  They are not.  And that's always the kind of person that I thrive being around.  It's hard to keep up with them.  Once again, you're going to, you know, you come in left, and they come in right, and you're like, hello, are we ever going to get to a point where we can move and not have, you know, people that are not aligned?  But I learned something. The more diverse a team is, the more tension there is within it.  And if you harness the tension and the--what could be considered dysfunctionality, the more creative the outcome.  And that resonates with me as a diverse person, both physically, obviously, my external appearances, how I've grown up, how I think.
Story_ID: 606032
Speaker 1: My name is Julieanna Richardson.  I'm the interviewer and Scott Stearns is the videographer.  And I'd like to start off, we're going to slate just the interview again.  I want you to state your name and spell it for us, and give us today's date.
Speaker 2: Michele, M-I-C-H-E-L-E, Coleman, C-O-L-E-M-A-N, Mayes, M-A-Y-E-S [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes].  And today's date is December 19, 2008.
Speaker 1: And our, and our location?
Speaker 2: Chicago, Illinois.
Story_ID: 606033
Speaker 1: I'd like to go back to your meeting of Tom Miller which (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wilson [Thomas J. Wilson]--
Speaker 1: Wilson, why am I calling him--
Speaker 2: --it's all right, I know who you mean (laughter).
Speaker 1: I know, okay, because (unclear), okay to Tom.  Now, where does Miller come from?  Okay, to Tom Wilson.  And you had said that what impressed you, was you told the whole story about the, you know, taking the train, you know--
Speaker 2: The subway.
Speaker 1: --the subway, and how that impressed you, that he would do it because most CEOs, you know, would, would have a car wait- waiting for them.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So, my question about that is why did you test him that way?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And what, and what did his, in doing that, what did that mean to you even?  What did it say about him, and what did it mean to you?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure why I tested him.  I guess sometimes I think people become infected, affected by the positions that they hold, and so they, they lose touch with somewhat everyday people.  And when you ride the subway, it's everyday people.  And so, that meant to me that he wasn't so involved or self-absorbed that he wasn't willing to get there the fastest way there was to get where we needed to be.  And so, that meant that he was more down to earth, I suppose, you know, not someone that was operating in the ivory tower, as what I would call it.  So, that just came to me.  I wasn't even thinking about it at the time.  It was one of those spontaneous ideas where I said, I wonder if he'd ride the subway with me.  And so, that's what it conveyed to me, and he was very comfortable as I said to you on the survey--on the past interview.  The other thing--I don't know if I mentioned this to you as well.  When I was in his office, did I mention the photographs that are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 2: Oh, this is, this was the very, very first time that I'd met him.  This goes back to July of 2007 and I'd flown in.  My plane was late, and so the interviews were somewhat reorganized and it was hurried.  But in any event, toward the end of the day was my interview with Tom.
Speaker 1: This is after your meeting with him in New York [New York] the first--
Speaker 2: No, this was, this is now the first meeting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I probably had a slight bias about this interview, is just going to be a one shot deal.  There is not going to be a chemistry between the company [Allstate Corporation] and myself.  So, in any event, I go to this office toward the end of the day and I'm a bit tired.  And I'm sitting at his conference table with--he has his back to the door, and there's a collage of photographs, very, very old photographs.  They looked to be collectors' items, and the images were just mesmerizing to me.  And I could barely talk to him because every time I looked at him, I would see these photographs behind him.  And there was one photograph in particular that was somewhat the centerpiece of these different--there were about eight of them.  And it was, it was a group of maybe eight black boys, maybe taken in the '40s [1940s], and they were all huddled around one bike.  And they had T-shirts on and old pants.  So, as I get up to end the interview, I stopped him and I said, "Well, I can't leave--," 'cause I'm thinking I won't be back (laughter).  I said, "I can't leave without you telling me something about these photographs."  And, you know, what I, honest- and that's how I said it.  I'm standing right near the photographs as you walk out the door.  And some people would have proceeded to tell me, the photographer, and how old they were, and how long it took to collect them.  He didn't do any of that.  He stopped by this photograph that I was most intrigued by and said, he said, "This is a very interesting photograph," and what he then did was to tell me what he thought was on the minds of each of those black kids.  That's all he told me about those photographs.  And so, I found that a very interesting approach, very human, very intellectually curious, somewhat creative 'cause how could anybody know? These kids were probably all dead by now.  Maybe they're not even alive because they would be rather old.  So, I was taken aback by the way he approached my question.  And that was the beginning of my being somewhat enticed by him as a leader.
Story_ID: 606034
Speaker 1: So, I want to go back to this 'cause you didn't tell me about the Allstate [Allstate Corporation] interview.  In fact, I, I was then, you know, I--you told me about meeting him in New York [New York].  You told me about the call from the headhunter--
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: --saying that, you know, you know, here, there's this position, you know, and you're like, unh-uh, you know.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, not for me.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Not for me, right.  So, but I want, so, so the first meeting was at Allstate.  So, can you tell me, you said things were sort of changed around and rushed.  And so, I just want to understand, you know, what happened, you know, that time and you're saying that this--I--now, did you just say the second meeting, the second meeting was--
Speaker 2: In New York.
Speaker 1: --New York where he was going to visit his son.
Speaker 2: His son was in film school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Film school, right.
Speaker 2: The headhunter had set up this meeting, and I had a lot going on.  At the time, I was chair of a special committee for a public company [Assurant, Inc.] on which I served as a board member.  And there was an unfortunate mishap that had occurred, so that was a lot of time being spent by me trying to sort this as the chair of the special committee and it was, it was very high stakes.  So, I was--needless to say, a bit distracted.  That was one of the reasons I was reluctant to even take time to go to Chicago [Illinois].  But in any event, Julie Eichbaum [sic.] convinces me--June Eichbaum convinces me to do this.  I get to the airport the night before.  Every flight to Chicago was cancelled.  Now, in my silly way, I go, I wonder what this means (laughter).  Every flight is cancelled.  The weather, there were thunderstorms.  It took me an effort to get to the airport because the steam pipe had burst in the city, so parts of it were closed down.  I had to commandeer a cab to get there.  Then I got there, and all the flights were cancelled.  And all of this is starting to weigh heavily on me, like this is too hard.  I call June and say, "June, I cannot get to Chicago tomorrow."  I said, "There is not a flight available."  She says, "Well, wait a minute, there's got to be a plan B."  So, I fly to Boston [Massachusetts] at six A.M. the next morning, and then fly to Chicago.  So, by doing that slight detour, I was considerably later than I would have otherwise been.  So, the interviews had to be juggled to accommodate me, so I was tired (laughter), a bit distracted, and I got there late.  When I met the different people, some of them were, as I had imagined, but others were not.  And, and the two people--one, obviously, was Tom [Thomas J. Wilson], and that was key because in order to be a general counsel, you got to have a good relationship with the CEO, or I think you're dead in the water.  But the other individual that I had a very good rapport with was my predecessor, Mick McCabe [Michael McCabe].  And Mick is a eloquent kind of Irish guy with a gift of gab, but we clicked in a very, very funny way.  And I wasn't again anticipating that, quite frankly, but we did.  So, the two people that caused me to reassess my frame of mind, which is I can get through this interview--yeah, if it works, it works.  If it doesn't, it doesn't.  I stopped because of those two gentlemen and said, hm, maybe there's more to this than meets the eye.  So, both of those occurred that day in June.  It was June 20th, I remember, it's my dad's [Wilbert Coleman] birthday, June 20, 2007.  And then from there, I later saw Tom in Chicag- in New York where we had our adventure on the subway.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, there, so how many meetings did you have that day, do you remember?
Speaker 2: I want to say that there were about five interviews.  One had gotten cancelled because of the scheduling difficulty, but I think it was, it might have been close to five interviews.  It was a fair number.
Story_ID: 606035
Speaker 1: How does the physical facility strike you, and how does Allstate [Allstate Corporation]--I mean, the company strike you 'cause--
Speaker 2: I will tell you it's more in the way in which some headquarters would have been built back in the '50s [1950s].  The executive floor is very separate from the other floors where people work, so the, the wing I'm in is a tower.  It's the tallest building in the complex, and the top three floors are where most of your executives--not all--but several of them are located.  So, isolated, I guess, is the first thing that came to mind, very quiet, very, therefore, removed.  That's how it struck me.  And that was something where I'm a very hands on--people like to sit--I like to walk around, just pop into your office unexpectedly, unannounced, much harder to do in this environment.
Story_ID: 606036
Speaker 1: Now, McCabe [Michael McCabe], what did he say was--I mean because how long he--had he been general counsel?
Speaker 2: Mick had been general counsel for nine years, but at Allstate [Allstate Corporation] for thirty-six--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --most of his career.
Speaker 1: So, what did he tell you about what--you know, what, what was there, what was there for you, and what the opportunity present, and how could you even trust, trust someone who had been there, you know, a lifer in some respects?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't say I didn't have a healthy dose of skepticism (laughter).  But one, you have moments when you trust your instincts, and it's very hard to dissect that.  And sometimes you need to trust those, you know, if you step back and say, well, wait a minute that was a just a knee jerk reaction, and you can't go with your gut, but I will tell you that, that there are times when your gut will tell you there's something wrong or peculiar, and there's something that maybe more right than you're giving a credit to be.  So, I can't exactly remember everything Mick said to me, but I remember the atmosphere which was very informal.  He was very, very relaxed.  And I, in particular, I asked him this question, I said, I said, "This is a very different industry for me and it's a tough industry."  I said, "Insurance is not the type of industry that people put up on a poster for how they want to be.  We're easy targets in this industry and we are frequent ones."  And Mick said, "You know, what, but it's exciting."  He said, "I don't come in here a day when I can predict what I'm going to be doing."  And of course, I'm a crisis junkie just a little bit, so that already appealed to me.  But I remember that message where he said it was intellectually challenging that you could not just get on one road and travel it in the same direction.  The other thing he said, when I raised the fact that I hadn't grown up in this industry, and that many of the people in the company had very, very long tenure.  How would I be received?  And he said, "Oh, they'll get over it." (Laughter) So he wasn't a bit put off because my real question to him was if you have seven hundred lawyers, why must you go outside for one?  And he was very honest about that, you know, that maybe they could have done--not maybe--they should have done a better job on succession planning, but that the job was too critical not to have the right person.
Speaker 1: I see.  So, you were asking him, why go outside to find like his, his successor?
Speaker 2: I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't as though it was hard to predict that he was going to retire after thirty-six years.  And Mick would have been what, sixty-two, I think, at the time.  So it was screaming for succession planning and yet, here they stood with no one that they were willing to put in the--they had one person who withdrew his name, and that was it from an internal candidacy, and then they went outside.
Speaker 1: Do you know why he withdrew his name?
Speaker 2: I do 'cause I'm all--I always want to know who is competition is if, especially if they stay behind.  And I was, because sometimes it's very hard for people who are not selected internally to, to work with whomever is selected.  And when, when I talked to him--first of all, I asked the people that knew, or at least should have known, and then I had a very direct conversation with him and the two aligned.  He has, he's still there, and we have a very good rapport, very honest and transparent.  He decided he was not willing to commit to the number of years they wanted if he took the position, which was a minimum of five years, and he was not willing to do that.  He wants to retire before then.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, he's a very straight shooter, and he could have accepted the position, and then said, oh, by the way, two years is quite enough for me.  And, instead, he said, "No, I wasn't going to do that to the company.  I've spent too many years here, many good years, and I thought I had to be honest with them about my plans to retire," and so that's why he withdrew his name.
Story_ID: 606037
Speaker 1: Now, Mick [Michael McCabe], what did he describe as the challenges awaiting you? Or do you think he--you know, 'cause he'd been there a long time.  Sometimes when people are there a long time, they don't necessarily see it in a future sense.
Speaker 2: I see his world differently, but the core of what he described isn't different.  Maybe my approach is different--I think is the answer to that question.  The regulatory environment is tough.  When you have fifty states, all of whom can require you to act in a certain way in order to do business in that state, whatever the state is, that's a very complex--it can be mercurial, and it can be very expensive.  And, yet, that's a hurdle Allstate [Allstate Corporation] had to clear for seventy-seven years.  And it's, it's not a very modern system.  It hasn't really been tackled in about 150 years.  And so, we're laboring in an environment that, in my mind, hasn't necessarily kept up with the times.
Speaker 1: So, what, so the challenge appealed to you--the fact that there was challenge in, you know, when he described that every day was a, you know, would be a new day--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, or, or challenging and you're not, not predictable 'cause you're right.  You said that you, you did in your other interview, said that you were a crisis junkie--
Speaker 2: I am.
Speaker 1: --which you said.  The other is what about the structure though?  What, what--I mean, obviously, you're reporting up to Tom Wilson [Thomas J. Wilson], but what is the structure, you know, of what you sort of inherited?  And how did that differ from the structure that Pitney Bowes [Pitney Bowes Inc.] or Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company]--I mean, you know, I'm just trying to--
Speaker 2: Well, you--I think I comment on this early- earlier.  It's a very U.S. centric, it's the most U.S. centric company that I've ever worked for.  And so, in some ways, it's more predictable because you're at least you're dealing with U.S. law.  You're not having different cultures, different languages, time zones--you name it.  And so, that was a switch for me because even Pitney Bowes, even though it's substantially smaller, had international business, a significant international.  About 26 percent of its business was international.  So, when I looked at the structure, in some ways, it's what you would expect a general counsel to be responsible for, whether it's corporate governance, meaning corporate secretary, litigation, contracts, just the day to day things you need to do to get business done.  What the overlay on that, though, is what I commented on a few minutes ago which is the regulatory climate.  This is the most heavily regulated company that I've ever had to work for.  Even though toothpaste is a drug, it's a federal regulator, the Food and Drug Administration.  And while there were countries all around the world, excuse me, regulating that drug, it still was a little more manageable than when you're talking about fifty states in the same continent.  Here, you've got to be very, very nimble because one of the things that you confront is that even when you want to do a new product, and you think it's a good idea, it will largely depend on that regulator saying, change this, or I don't like this feature of it.  So, you've got to be malleable, even though you'd like to row it across all fifty states the same, not necessarily durable.  So, you've got to have an open mind to say, well, how can I work with this regulator to get from point A to point B?  And I will say this, that, you know, regulators are there for a reason.  I don't want to make this sound as though it's anti-regulation.  The question is smart regulation, and sometimes I think the regulation is burdensome.  But on the other hand, they're there to protect the consumer.  That's their role, so they will look at something we want to do and challenge it, either saying it's too expensive, or they don't like the way the consumer might can- might construe it, whether it's misleading.  So, they are very dogged about playing that role of oversight and that makes it hard to do business.  So, the group of lawyers that I've got are--a large part of their time is spent looking at the various idiosyncrasies that the states--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --require us to address.  A lot of litigation, there is a tremendous amount of litigation.  I think I might have mentioned last time.  There are five hundred lawyers--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --throughout this country that represent all the insurers, so I haven't changed the structure a lot.  I'm about to change some things, but not--I don't think it's radical change.  I'm collapsing some jobs.  I'm creating some other ones.  I'm putting people in different roles.  And it's a bit of a struggle because when you have a group of seniors that people sometimes feels there's a ceiling.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And that's very, that's not an issue that's unusual for in house counsel to contend with.
Speaker 1: That's right.  A lot of times it feels like there's no movement up.
Speaker 2: Flat (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's what, flat, that's right.
Speaker 2: --just flat.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 606038
Speaker 1: I want to go back to that day though, so you met with Mick [Michael McCabe] first, and Tom [Thomas J. Wilson] second, or who, how was the--
Speaker 2: With whom did I meet first?  I think my first interview might have been with the head of human resources who has since retired.  A lot of people were in the queue to retire, so I met with Joan Crockett, Jim Hohmann [James E. Hohmann] who was president of Allstate Financial [Allstate Financial Services, LLC], Ric Simonson [Eric A. Simonson] who was president of the investment area, Mick McCabe, who was the former general counsel, George Ruebenson who was head of the property and--protection and casualty.  That's auto and home.  And then Tom Wilson, so that, I guess, was the sixth?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was somewhere in that vicinity, but those are the people I spent time with (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 606039
Speaker 1: And then Tom [Thomas J. Wilson]--I--the--that was an interesting thing about his description of the boys, but do you remember what he described, what, what--
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: You do--
Speaker 2: I remember some of them.  He walked over to the photograph and there was--he said, "That's the tough guy here, that's the leader."  He said, "And this guy is clueless, he's just happy to be there" (laughter).  "And this guy wants to be a leader."  That's how he described it.  He said, "But they're all kind of proud."  So, I, as I said, I was mesmerized by--I, to this day, I don't know who shot that photograph.  I have no idea.  But it's, again, he was more interested in what he thought they were thinking than the fact that what year it was done--nothing else. That's how he described those kids.
Story_ID: 606040
Speaker 1: So you came away thinking what?  And when you called the headhunter, her name is again?
Speaker 2: June Eichbaum.
Speaker 1: June, June Eichbaum.  When you called her, what did you say?  What did she ask you, and what did you say?
Speaker 2: First of all, you never know.  I've done enough of these--being on the other side of the table.  So it isn't unusual to go through that process and never hear anything.  You're not told no because they want to keep a live wire (laughter), in case their preferred options don't pan out.  So, it's not uncommon to hear platitudes of, "Oh, it went fine, let's see how it goes, we'll get back in touch with you."  And, frankly, I keep stepping.  I don't lose any sleep over it.  I just repress it and go on to what is in front of me.  So, I got similar feedback.  "Oh, the interview seemed to go really well, Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes]."  I said, "Nice." "Are you interested?"  "It may have legs."  I was pretty reserved still at this point.  And I will never forget--I want on, as I say, with my day to day because I had a lot on my plate.  And I'm in Wisconsin, conducting a town hall meeting with a group of about four hundred employees for Pitney Bowes [Pitney Bowes Inc.], and we did the town hall meetings.  The executives would go around the country and talk about the state of the business.  And so, we took these meetings very seriously.  You really had to get into the mindset of the people you were talking to, and these would be call center people, just everyday folk.  So, I'm sitting there waiting to go on stage.  And my Blackberry goes off (laughter).  And it's something about, "Can you meet Tom [Thomas J. Wilson] in New York [New York]?"  Hm. And I say something--I won't repeat what I said exactly--and it was a little bit of a surprise, so I wrote back, "Well, I'm in Wisconsin, I guess so." (Laughter) So, I ended up being a bit surprised 'cause it went very rapidly.  My first interview was June--July 20th.  I had a job offer from them by Labor Day.  I'd never moved that fast in my life.  I have a feeling now, not probed this very much, that I was at the tail end of that interviewing cycle, that they had several people they had interviewed [to become general counsel for the Allstate Corporation].  So, in any event, I came away from that, that process, thinking, well, you know what, they were more interesting, maybe not as conservative, as I had thought they were.  It's interesting when you have a certain mindset how you filter everything and try to fit into that mindset.  I--there's a favorite quote I like where it says, most people pretend they're listening when what they're really doing is rearranging their prejudices.
Speaker 1: That's great.
Speaker 2: And that's what I was doing, to some extent, and I couldn't make it all fit (laughter).  And that's when I think I paused and said, well, maybe this has some legs.
Story_ID: 606041
Speaker 1: So, what did you, what was--so your interests went to sort of excitement, but you were, you were, you wanted to see what he was saying, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And then, then did that seal the deal after you--the, the New York [New York]--
Speaker 2: It, you know, the headhunter [June Eichbaum] got very pushy as they do.  They don't, they don't want to--as they say, people don't like rejection, so they wanted me to say yes before he [Thomas J. Wilson] said yes (laughter).  And I said, "I'm still thinking about it," and I wasn't playing hard to get.  This is going to sound pompous.  I had another job offer in the hand.
Speaker 1: No, we never talked about (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, and I'm not going to talk about it a great deal, but I had another job offer from someone that I knew relatively well, and I would have stayed in New York.  But it was a, it was a safer job in my mind.  It was more linear.  This was non-linear to go to insurance company, to move to Chicago [Illinois], to go to a Fortune 100 company that had this type of marquee.  And I decided that I didn't want to walk a straight path.  And so, as I said about someone else, I made a left turn with no signal, and that's how I viewed this decision.  It was--people still are trying to figure out if I really left New York (laughter).  I saw some people, "Are you still here?"  "No, I'm not still here--I have left."  It's not like, Elvis [Elvis Presley] is in the building.  So, I will say to you that toward the end of this, I was wavering, and I knew I had to fish or cut bait.  And so, before I got the job offer from Allstate [Allstate Corporation], you know, it gets to be a negotiation over what the package is.  And most people don't do a good job educating themselves about how to negotiate, but because I headed up HR [human resources], I understood compensation fairly well.  I had a sense of how I was going to position myself.  And so, at one point, I had some idea of what the package might be, but I didn't have an offer.  I had an offer that I was sitting on, and I had to make a decision whether to turn that offer down before I got the other one in the hand, and that's what I did.  You can call that folly on my part, but I decided it was unfair because I could stay where I was, you know, so if you think about it, nobody knew I was interviewing where I was.  So, I was already a general counsel, and I decided that it was more important for me to treat these people fairly because, mentally, I had turned the corner and decided I didn't want to go.  So, I called and declined the offer.  And I, and I told them because they were stunned that I was considering another offer, but I did not have it yet.  But I thought it was best to let them go on and plan for another candidate because it was not clearly not going to be yours truly. So.  And then, I went to the business of negotiating with Allstate which is always not quite what you want it to be when--it's like, oh, is this what I'm getting (laughter)--not quite what I wanted.  And so, there was some back and forth on the package and, finally, all things came together in September.
Speaker 1: So, September of 2007 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seven [2007], seven.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 606042
Speaker 1: Can you describe--that's what I want you--to describe the structure sort of that you have and even what your vision is for, you know, moving forward with your, with--
Speaker 2: I, I think every general counsel is constantly looking at delivering high quality, efficiently, and cost effectively.  That's what you have to do.  And what I told people when I joined, and this may sound trite, but there's a, there's a key, there are key messages embedded in it.  I said you need to be at the table, at the right time, with the right advice.  When I sat here at the table, it means people think of you as an integral part of that team.  You're not an afterthought, you're not seen as an oddity, you're not seen as a silent partner.  You can have views on a range of issues, whether they're legal, non-legal, business, non-business.  It doesn't matter.  You're a player.  When I say at the right time, you want lawyers that are proactive.  I can always sit back and tell you what was wrong after the fact when it's already wrong.  It is a much riskier game to be their crafting strategy in the moment.  And that advice has got to be right meaning sometimes you've got to stop and listen and say, you know what, I thought you wanted to go here, and now I realize you want to got in a different direction.  Let's see how we can get there.  What's the risk appetite?  There is no free lunch.  You can rarely craft a strategy that is free of risk that matters (laughter).  And so, when I tell people that real simple message at the table, at the right time with the right advice, it means a lot of things.  So, what does that require us to do?  Our businesses are changing.  I gave an example of how software could be a much heavier player in the insurance sector and what, what's one of my visions if the lawyers were looking at licensing or having people create it.  And these things exist already--telemat- telematics.  If you're driving your car down the road, and your GPS [global positioning system] is already--most cars will have them at some point.  If it comes on and says, you're approaching a very dangerous intersection--be cautious.  I'd like to know that, or if you park your car someplace, and before you turn off the ignition, they say, ten cars were stolen in this neighborhood in the last month, I might not park my car there.  So, those are the types of things where the relationship with a customer would change a great deal.  I think the insurance sector and Allstate [Allstate Corporation], and we recognize this, we've sometimes taken the customer for granted because it's a mandatory product.  Where we make most of our money, you cannot drive your car off a lot if you've got a lien or some type of loan (laughter) because you've got it insured.  You can't have a mortgage if you don't have homeowners insurance.  And some people think, well, you're taking advantage of me because I have no choice.  And yet, if you look at the range of companies in this space, you've got a choice.  Is it State Farm?  Is it Nationwide [Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company]?  Is it GEICO [Government Employees Insurance Company]?  So, my goal is for the lawyers to understand what I fundamentally believe. And maybe it's because I grew up a large part of my career in consumer products.  Even with the mandatory product, I've got to earn your business and then work to keep it.  And that's a very different mindset in some ways if you look at where we've been historically.  So, getting the lawyers to understand something as easy as this. You can write an ironclad contract, but does the customer understand it?  Did they know what they're insured for?  And so, that's when I've said to them, everything you do, you should be asking yourself, have I facilitated this company doing business with people who want to do business with us?  And that's a very high bar.  I'm not saying, we'll clear it all the way ever, but you can't even begin to get there if you don't have that mindset.  And so, getting the lawyers to look at the business that way is different.  I look at it very, very differently.
Story_ID: 606043
Speaker 1: I'll give you another example of something that surprised me.  (Clears throat) Sometimes I have a big mouth.  I said, "How many of our employees have our insurance?"  And there was a, you know, clearing of the throat.  I said, "What does that mean?"  "Well, they're not sure they want--well, some of them--well, we don't," and I said, "Are you saying not that many?" (Laughter) Like give me the answer.  And it turns out that there is a high percentage, higher than you would think, that do not have Allstate [Allstate Corporation] insurance.  And we've taken it on as a challenge now.  That's not acceptable and let me tell you the reasons why. Because they're not hokey.  Part of it is price, but that's a small part.  That's not 100 percent of the reason.  The other reasons are things like well, you have access to my private information.  Who sees it?  Secondly, if I have an accident and I don't like the way you manage the claim, am I willing to sue you as my employer?  So, what's at the core of those concerns is trust, trust that you're going to treat my information appropriately, trust that you will treat me appropriately if I'm in an accident, and I disagree with you about how something is managed.  But I say to people, I want most employees to think twice before they don't have your insurance, if you're going to work for that company.  And so, that's the kind of thing where we're going to take that on.  That's a different mindset.
Story_ID: 606044
Speaker 1: What strikes me about what you described is that it's just very, it's very business oriented.  I mean, it's, in the classic way, lawyers were there to sit back and advise, not to be proactive about the business.  Do you think that has really changed in Corporate America?
Speaker 2: I think so.  It--there are people that want lawyers in a very narrow band which is, if I need legal advice, I'll come to you.  You'll give me the answer, but that model in many ways, is very out of date.  If you're going to invest this type of money in hiring in house lawyers because we tend to be at the higher end of the salary range as a group, not the most expensive, but still, we skew toward the higher end.  Then why aren't you getting the most out of them?  And if you all want is the answer to a legal question, then go to the outside firm.  If I sit here and know your idiosyncrasies, and know what your appetite is for risks, know what the competition is like, then why can't I have a more holistic discussion with you about, well, can't we do it this way, and can't we get there at the same point going a different road?  And I think more enlightened people prefer that because you've got skin in the game and that's what they want.  They want to feel that everybody is growing in that same direction.  If I just say, oh, you know, the law requires you to do this, good luck.  It's almost as though I am on the sidelines watching the play instead of saying, what position do you want me in?  And I think that's a far healthier, it's far more interesting, it's also, and I want to talk about this in a minute.  There are risks where, does the lawyer still muddle the road they're supposed to play, that they're no longer the adv- the legal advice.  I think that's a very important line to understand where it is, but I don't think that prohibits you from playing in a wider band.  But, yes, my fundamental purpose is to understand the law, understand the risks, but that doesn't mean I have to only talk about the law.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, then, does that mean that there needs to be a different type of training for the lawyer, for your, you know, once you join the organization? So you understand the business a little more bit more, or--I mean, 'cause I'm just saying the classic model is that the, the legal departments over there, no one wants to talk to them because they're always sort of crashing the deal or saying, you know, what's the problems?  You're, you're really articulating them much different, you know, type of concept.
Speaker 2: And I, and I think this concept has been around for a while now.  I don't think it's new news.  I think it's continuing to evolve.  We've had many general counsel in the last few years that have been indicted, that have been forced to resign for stock option backdating.  There have been many, many stories.  Notice not the outside law firm, but instead, it's been typically the general counsel that's caught in the eye of the storm.  So, there is a role to play, which is do you understand that your client is the shareholder, not the CEO?  And yet, that's the CEO who's typically hired you, who does your performance evaluation, who determines your raise, but your fiduciary obligation is to the company, to the shareholder.  And that's why I think you've got--not forget what your anchor is, but that anchor is not meant to weigh you down, such that you cannot be a creative thinker and an out of box thinker.
Story_ID: 606045
Speaker 1: Now, what do you want to accomplish there with the--
Speaker 2: In my tenure?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And, and would the tenure be as--and I want to say this, as short as five years because it--
Speaker 2: It's about five years.  That's about right.  It's, it's no more than five, it's roughly five years with no max.  Right, that's my tenure.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I knew that going in, one, because they have mandatory retirement so.
Speaker 1: Because of what your age is--I see, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, what do you want to accomplish?  Remember this is the person who decided they wanted to be general counsel.
Speaker 2: I want a department that has got a group of lawyers that are engaged, that they feel they're fairly compensated.  I mean, that's a struggle trying to work through that, that they're being challenged, and that they are challenging, that they understand they've got the right appetite for risks. Because I firmly believe this, in order to have a claim to the future, you have to create it, and if you live on your laurels--which is easy to do.  It's so easy to say, but I was or I am, and not what you will be.  And I think many companies, if you look at the, the graveyard of companies that are no longer out there, there are so, so many.  And so, I would want Allstate [Allstate Corporation] not to become a member of that graveyard.  And in order to do that, you've got to look at the changing appetite of the consumer.  You know, consumers have a lot more power in terms of their laws that protect them, in terms of walking with their feet, just not buying your product.  And so, I want to be relevant.  That's--and to do that, I've got to understand where the future needs to be for Allstate.  And we've got some challenges, particularly in this economic environment because margins get challenged, and people don't buy as much insurance, you know, they start skimping, making some tough judgment calls where they will spend their money, and they should.  But at the end of the day, I want a company that does the right thing, that has customers who want to be your customers, and that we're willing, always willing to be innovative, and either look for the change or cause it, and I want lawyers to be partners in that.
Story_ID: 606046
Speaker 1: And what do you think you need to do to make that happen?  I mean, that--you, you're talking about a legal department that you found.  And my question also is of the--because you said Mick [Michael McCabe] had been there [Allstate Corporation] thirty-six years and that nine years is, you know, GC [general counsel].  How long, on average, you know, has your, your, you know, the average lawyer in your shop been there?
Speaker 2: It's starting--if you talk about average because there are, there are a fair number of new hires.  We hire lawyers right out of law school.  This is the first department I've worked for that actually recruits people right out of law school.  So, if you average it, it's going to clearly not show--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the disparity.  But the most senior lawyer on my staff will have thirty-six years.  All of my officers have no less than twenty.  So, one of the things that we started talking about is, if you're doing something, you should be able to articulate very quickly what's the value?  You don't want activities with no results.  And sometimes we get caught up in activity, a lot of movement, a lot of process, and then you say, who cares?  And if you step back and have that tough discussion, sometimes that puts jobs in jeopardy, or it puts a different focus on something, and people have their pets.  Why, I thought this was important.  Why--because you've always done it?  And so, those are the questions that you are trying to always ask yourself and it's hard.  The longer you've been someplace, the more likely you are to get comfortable, as I say and potentially go on autopilot.  And I think everybody has to resist that.  I don't care who you are.  So, right now, we are, we are trying to find in, in this ton of economic crises, there will be winners.  Make no mistake about it.  And it will not be the people who are paralyzed from fear.  So, the lawyers that have been there thirty-six years, and the lawyers that have been there all of three months, it's taking, as I say, the best of what you've been to become what you need to be.  You don't throw away all that history.  There's, there's a lot of pride, a lot of success, but there is arrogance to thinking because, as I say, because you have been in the past something that you have a claim or a guarantee to that future.  I believe that is very, very dangerous mindset.
Story_ID: 606047
Speaker 1: You know, the other question I want to ask because--and I think you mentioned this--was that the, there has been a lack of diversity, I think, in the, the upper--I'm not sure what, you know, Allstate's [Allstate Corporation] numbers are or anything, but there have been a lack of diversity.  Have you found that any, any pushback on that, you know, 'cause a lot of times people say, the whole issue of diversity falls down by the wayside, especially when it's during economic times?  Have you found that to be the case?
Speaker 2: I--the lack of diversity is apparent if you look at the senior management team.  It's yours truly (laughter).  If, but if you include women--I think I mentioned this to you earlier--there are four of us on the team, and one of those women does have a business.  She's in charge of the investment portfolio, which is a very large--it's, you know, over a $100 billion, but it is a struggle.  And I will--this is my belief--and I wanted to be there a while.  Sometimes you go in with a preconceived idea and you can be rejected very quickly.  And so, I wanted to earn some stripes, if you will, by doing some things that they would not have predicted I'd have a hot button on, which would be diversity.  I mean, that is very predictable, right, although not everybody who's a minority or a woman is necessarily focused on that, and people should understand that as well (laughter).  But if you look at my track record, it isn't hard to figure that out for me.  That was one of the discussions, I think, I said I had with Tom [Thomas J. Wilson], which is do you understand who I am?  I said, "I'm not changing my stripes."  And so, we, we talked about it.  We're starting to focus more on it, but what I have said, and I think I have my management team, meaning the lawyers, the lawyers who report to me--I think we are committed.  I said, "You cannot say that you have good intentions unless you do deliver," I said, "and we have to deliver."  I said, there's a healthy degree of skepticism over whether these are just nice words, and I think we are coming to grips with that.  Those are much tougher conversations to have, particularly when people don't know you, and they were skeptical of me to begin with, and rightfully so because I was a stranger.  They don't know me.  They don't know competent I am.  Tom had a very interesting--this is what I mean about his being different, about how he looks at things.  I don't know if most people would have told me this.  When he was briefing me on some of his impressions about the department, he went in to introduce the idea that I was coming.  This is before I'd ever shown up.  And he didn't say who asked him the question, but someone asked him, "Well was she your first choice?" (Laughter) And he said, "Unequivocally." So there were surprises. So, I've got diversity on my list, very high on the list.  I've been there thirteen months now.  I think I have more credibility and a better sense of the company, and how I would like to make more concrete progress.  That's one of my goals.  And I think it's Allstate's goals if you look at what we have in our shared vision, which is an internal document.  It's inclusive diversity, but as I say to people, if you only say those words, and I can't look and see anybody like me, then I'm just going to tell you that talk is cheap.

Speaker 1: So what do you think the challenges of the insurance industry are?  You had talked about technology, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And regulatory.
Speaker 1: And regulatory, tech- technology, regulatory, but regulatory, you can't control so much.
Speaker 2: Well, no, that's not true because one of the debates that was largely brought about, it's been simmering right beneath the surface.  It's called optional federal charter.  That is, would we, like banks, be able to pick between being regulated by the state or a large federal single regulator?  There's no such animal right now.  But there is a very large group of people, somewhat brought about by the AIG's [American International Group, Inc.] failure, who are starting to look at, can any one state, and that's especially true if the company's international, truly understand the complexity and the breadth of a company, even if they are domiciled in that state?  Is it even fair to the consumer to think that they can grasp all of this?  So, there is a movement of thought to say, what would a modernized system look like?  Is it a hybrid?  States have something, such as consumer protection maybe, or is it one federal regulator?  And that debate, I think, is going to gain momentum, particularly when the current administration takes office, and we want to be at the table.
Speaker 1: And you think that, that will, that will give more consistency all across the board?
Speaker 2: I think you're looking at less complexity--
Speaker 1: Less (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) more predictability, possibly more freedom of action, speed, efficiency, so lots of things.  There is no rose garden in anything you do.  I mean, I have worked for a company that's been regulated by a single regulator which is Pitney Bows [Pitney Bowes Inc.] and the [U.S.] Postal Service.  So, there are always areas of tension, and there should be because you're coming at it from different angles.  I think you have to find a way to go forward, but you do not necessarily start out on the same page.  I think it's going to be a huge debate around what is the right regulatory scheme for the insurance industry?  The state system has been in existence 150 years.  There are a lot of stakeholders in that, and there are believers in it, that it is best done at the state level, that, that is what benefits the consumer most readily.  And I think there are strong believers in that, so this is not going, going to be a cake walk.
Story_ID: 606049
Speaker 1: What has been surprising that you've learned in your thirteen months about the industry?  Is there anything else, you know, that--
Speaker 2: That surprised me, you mean?
Speaker 1: --surprised you, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Maybe I--pleasantly surprised, because, once again, my mindset was when I saw the tenure, and here comes the newbie (laughter), not in terms of how long I've been a lawyer because I've been a lawyer thirty-four years.  But if you look at whether I thought they would project my ideas out of hand--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because some of them were a little harebrained.  Sometimes by design, I would say, why not do this?  And I would sometimes get a puzzled look, but there has been a much higher degree of receptivity than I had anticipated.  It doesn't make it easy because one of the things that has surprised me, but not surprised me, because I sensed it.  But I just took a deep sigh is getting consumers to want to do business with you, rather than doing it begrudgingly, and that is so hard.  For seventy-seven years, people think, oh, you just take our money.  And the moment of truth is when I have a claim, and then you're telling me, well, you're not paying me what I think I'm due.  And so, we're now finding people who are willing to talk very, very openly--not just the CEO [Thomas J. Wilson] because he, he's already there and has been there, but he is one person.  It's a little bit like President-elect Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].  He is one person.  And so, getting the type of momentum, as I say, you don't need everybody doing the right thing.  You just need the right people doing the right thing, and that's what's starting to gain momentum in the company [Allstate Corporation].  So, I'd love to be able to have part of my legacy being how the lawyers--which is why I came back to you and talked about it--if you make a contract ironclad, and nobody understands it and sues you 'til the cows come home.  I'd like to be there when somebody says, you know what, I trust doing business with you, and I know you're going to be there.  That's what I want to hear from a much higher percentage of customers because at the bottom line, you've only got so much human capital to expend.  I'd rather be at a company that's a winner in a lot of people's eyes.
Story_ID: 606050
Speaker 1: And insurance is not, it could never be an international business, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it can be (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It can?
Speaker 2: Sure.  AIG [American International Group, Inc.] is very international.
Speaker 1: So, do you think there would be ever be growth, you know--
Speaker 2: Growth?
Speaker 1: --growth in that, 'cause I was just, you know, as I was listening to you, you're talking about a very consumer focused approach, you know, to something that has always been viewed as, you know, something someone had to do, so that's a whole different mindset.  That's one way of growing, you know, and during--and I was just wondering if there were any other thoughts about, you know, growth, growth schemes.
Speaker 2: Sure.  I, I think that there is an appetite to grow internationally.  Now, I think it's tempered a bit, just because of the crisis we're going, people are trying to figure out whose balance sheet has what on it (laughter).  But there is no doubt, I think that--well, Allstate [Allstate Corporation] was international about ten years ago, and it did not go well.  They were in about three or four countries in Europe.  And, eventually, they withdrew from those markets.  They sold the businesses and became more focused on the U.S. again.  I do believe, and that's one of the things I asked when I got there.  "So, why doesn't the strategy have international in it?"  And it was a pregnant pause, and then Tom [Thomas J. Wilson] said, "You're right, it needs to."  And so, we've been willing to look more broadly, but, again, you've got to be cautious, especially now. But at some point, I believe we will have a more international focus.
Story_ID: 606051
Speaker 1: So let me, the other question I have, so Allstate [Allstate Corporation] has mandatory retirement in, in the five years--
Speaker 2: In the upper ranks.
Speaker 1: In the upper ranks.
Speaker 2: Not the entire company.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm talking about in the senior management team.
Speaker 1: So, is that sixty-two?
Speaker 2: Sixty-five.
Speaker 1: Sixty-five, okay.  Now, let--the other thing I want to ask you is what, what are you going to do after those five years?  I mean, what, what--you, you're still serving on some corporate boards or are--
Speaker 2: Not-for-profit though.
Speaker 1: Not, so you can't do--
Speaker 2: I can do for-profit.  I got off the one for-profit board because it was a conflict--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or the appearance of a conflict.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I'm ready to get back on a board if the right one comes along, but you've got to be, as we well know, very cautious about what you do because it has huge ramifications--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --both personally and for the company you're working for.  So, I would like to be on at least one public board.  I enjoy sitting in a boardroom.  The stakes are very high.  But it's a very, very different role when you're a board member than when you're sitting as part of senior management handling day to day.  It's a very different mindset.
Speaker 1: Can you articulate that?
Speaker 2: I don't--you do not run the business.  You are there to look out for the shareholder, and to really see that the company is, is executing the right strategy.  And that's at a very, relatively high level.  But you ask tough questions and you want to see, are you aware?  Did I get a good answer?  Have you focused on this?  Have I missed something?  And if I've missed something, then what don't, what don't I understand, as a board member, that I need to understand?  Do I understand how you make money?  So, when you look at the things that most boards do, being there as a fiduciary for the shareholder, first and foremost, but to do that, the shareholder is saying, I want a return on my investment.  And so, that's why you're asking some of the tough que- and you're challenging management.  They are there to be challenged.  At the end of the day, you hope you bring something to that party that's different than what management has, and what your colleagues on the board have, that you've got some ingredient that's critical to the recipe, and I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Now, okay.
Speaker 2: So, you're asking me what I would do.
Speaker 1: No, I hadn't--right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: The, the only thing I will say, I, I do participate on a fair number of not-for-profit boards, and some of those, I would remain on, whether I were with Allstate or not.  So, I don't think I'll have trouble filling out my days.
Story_ID: 606052
Speaker 1: And that's what I believe.  There's life in phases.  It's life (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I, and I believe that this phase will end, and another phase begins.  In fact, if you live to the age I am, which is just short of sixty, you end up, most likely live until you're eighty something, eighty-four.  He said, "So what are you going to do with twenty more years or whatever? That's a long time to sit and read a book."
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So, his, his more logical way is to say you learn, work, (gesture) learn again, work.  So, it's these (gesture) valleys where you kind of regenerate, you know, regenerating your energy, renovate, you know, re- reinvigorating, and then you replicate.  He said, "And maybe that's a new career," but he said, "That's a more logical way to think about it."  So, for example, a kid who says, "I don't want to go to college right now."  People would say, "Oh, my god, you're not going to college right after high school?"  Now, you might say, "You know what, get it out of your system.  You're going to live a long time.  Go play with the band, go travel in Europe, and then come back because you're not going to stop living at sixty anyway."  And that's a very, very different way that I would have ever thought of, if you'd said, "Well, don't you have to go to college after high school?"  Absolutely!  Don't waste any time.  Well, you're not wasting time.  You're just using it in a different way.  We look at this issue, by the way, because we do retirement products.  They're called annuities, life insurance, and the question that's there is, how much money do you need?
Story_ID: 606053
Speaker 1: I want to ask, though, what do you want to do?  What haven't you done that you would like to do?  You got to where you aspired, but what haven't you done?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think there are lots of things.  It, it's funny you should ask, ask that question because I was reading an email before I came in here from one of my friends, and she was talking about her young children.  They're playing the violin, they're taking Spanish.  And I wrote back, kudos to you.  I never learned to play an instrument, and I certainly don't know another language (laughter).  And so, one of the things is, why won't I learn Spanish?  So, there's just a myriad of tasks that I think I could get myself involved.  I love to travel. I would do more of it.  I did a lot of traveling when I was with Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company].  I would go back to traveling.  But I tell you the thing that I believe most people learn who pause to think about it.  You get a large, a larger reward by how much you give.  And so, I want to do something where I'm giving back because I think that's probably going to be more psychologically enticing to me at this point.  What that will be, I'm not sure.  I spend a lot of time mentoring.  I could go into coaching.  I could go into something else like that, you know, in a not-for-profit world.  But I think there are, there are multiple ways to give back to people if you choose to do it.  So, I don't think that's a problem, and there's always a hand that's being extended saying, can you help?
Story_ID: 606054
Speaker 1: Now, with someone--if--how would you, since you like mentoring, if someone were coming along, and they were a young Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes], what would you tell them about what career to enter, or let's say, they were interested in the legal field, what would you tell them in terms of what they should do?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't think I could give a textbook answer that, you know, follow these steps and you, too, will be where you want to be at the end of it.  But I do believe it's something you asked me about, about what advice I would give, and I said, be yourself.  Whatever you do, it takes a lot of your energy, and that means a lot of your life's energy, so do something you like doing--most days (laughter).  There's no one who does something they want, like every single day, 'cause there are ups and downs.  That's just part of life.  But I think it's more curious for you to say, as an individual, which everyone is wired differently.  What gets my juices flowing in the morning? What causes me to want to do better?  And I, I don't know what that is because every individual has to answer that question for him or herself, but be willing to ask it, and be willing to look at yourself in the mirror when the answer is not as you think it should be.
Story_ID: 606055
Speaker 1: When you look at the black community, and I want to, you know, go back to your, you know, your childhood in some respects, and the growth that you have seen personally, but, you know, your background.  And, and even you, you know, remember how you were saying, you have a very close friend, you know, that you still have--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --as a friend, who doesn't have your education, you know, the level of education and friendship (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: But I want to ask you, what hopes and concerns do you have about the black community?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a very complex question and, and I don't think that it's any new question.  It's very, very, something, something that many people have tackled, I think--the president elect [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] has, Bill Cosby, [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory.  So many people have looked at that--Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  I answer the question this way, and it may seem really, really trite, but everybody has a different potential--everybody.  You, you cannot say, if you give everyone the equal opportunity, they will end up in the same place.  They will not, but what I do believe is this--you ought to be able to reach your full potential, whatever that may be.  Now, there are very practical issues that get in the way like money, support, but there is one thing to me that is more powerful than, than any of those, which is your mindset.  And so, when I look around, and I see people that are saying, for example, now that we have a black president, the race issue is over, which is naive because it reminds me of Nelson Mandela in South Africa.  But what I do think it does is to change the mindset.  When I look at these young black kids that, all of a sudden, had no excuse to say, well, you know, I can't get there.  What's that--what I call is a defeatist in your head, I say, the enemy is within.  So, my real goal would be to have people think of themselves differently, and reach for opportunities that they might have viewed as out of reach, but only because they did.
Story_ID: 606056
Speaker 1: So, that's your hope.  What is your concern?
Speaker 2: My concern is that the practical things don't--you have to have a good education.  People should never stop learning.  And education costs money and we have fallen woefully behind in this country.  I went to public schools.  I never went to a private school, not one school I went to, whether you're talking about my early years or the state institution [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] that I went for undergrad and law school.  That's because free education is affordable (laughter).  And now, if you go to a public institution, people are going to say, well, you'll be ill prepared.  And that puts a huge impediment on us.  I don't know if I said this to you, but I--did I tell you the story about the gentleman who said they look at kids failing the third grade?  I was at the Aspen Institute [Washington, D.C.] a couple of years ago.  And there were two Bureau of Prison guards [Federal Bureau of Prisons]--wardens in the class with us, and that was by design.  They wanted people that had different, very, very different experiences.  There was, there was a judge from South Africa, a judge from Australia.  It was a very eclectic group of people.  And all of a sudden, we were talking about the criminal justice system, and how it can be viewed as unfair and discriminatory.  And I, I don't know, if I asked the question 'cause I don't remember, I don't think I did.  Someone said to one of the prison wardens, "How do you decide how many prisons to build," which is a very interesting question?  The answer was just depressing.  "We look to see how many kids are failing the third grade."
Speaker 1: In this country or in other--
Speaker 2: In this country.  These prison, prison wardens were both from institutions in this country.  We look to see who is failing the third grade.  And so, I say, who have we written off?  It could be the next Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].  And that's why I'm saying, give people a chance to reach their full potential.  It may mean they're going to be the best plumber in the world or the best electrician, and so be it, but don't create artificial barriers like, well, now, you know, you're going to fail because you don't know how to read.  And a lot of people graduate from school with very poor reading comprehension, so that's my concern.  That core foundation is cracked.  I'm not even sure I would call it a crack.  I think there is a huge void, and it takes years, years to get there.  And there's an impatience and an unreal expectation because you've got to put the money behind it to get good education.  You've got to challenge maybe the structure to some extent, and you've got to be able to do things very, very differently.  So, in my lifetime, I don't see this as necessarily being fixed immediately, but I think there has to be very, very, very clear progress.  The other thing that I think I'm most concerned about is healthcare.  There are too many uninsured, far too many, so does that mean a kid doesn't get glasses, and that's why they don't learn to read because the parent can't afford to have the eyes examined?  I, you know what, I saw--I've never told the story, and, and I'm talking about the assumptions people make about you.  And, and I use the eye example where a kid is embarrassed because they can't afford glasses, so they don't learn to read.  They're the class clown.  I was on an escalator in New York [New York], and people walk up the escalator, like they're also in a hurry in New York, even we're not going anywhere.  And for some reason, the woman was blocking the left side of the escalator when, in fact, you stand to your right.  And I stood and watched her and got an attitude--my assumption being she's just being difficult.  Why doesn't she move over?  And people were like bumping her and mumbling as they went by her--I'm sure not saying pleasant things.  And I stood there and watched her for some reason and I, I didn't try to walk around her.  I was just curious.  When she got off the escalator--she had an artificial leg.  She probably stood to the left because that's how she balanced herself.  And, to me, that's very similar.  I made assumptions about her--oh, she's just being difficult.  She's in a bad mood.  Well, what about the fact that she had an artificial leg?  And then she swung her leg 'cause she had a very hard time navigating the escalator.  She said, "I don't know why people are in such a hurry." And she had a bit of truth to that.  So, I come back and I say, people make assumptions all the time about you, you're not smart, you don't work hard.  And those assumptions can be extremely false if people don't take the time to get to know what's underneath that.  Is it another artificial leg, in which case you've got a reason for standing on the left.
Story_ID: 606057
Speaker 1: Now, what do you want, what do you think the legacy of African Americans is, and what do you hope it to be?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) We're just all part of humanity. That's all.  You know, it just--we're all people trying to get through life.  And life throws curves balls, curve balls, at anyone who really lives.  Right?  It, it just does.  And so, at the end of the day, while I think this country has a very complex history around race, when people really look beyond that, you're talking about, okay, you're just, you're just trying to make your way. Trying to reach your full potential, trying to raise a family, trying to anticipate what you need to do to be viewed as somebody who matters.  Nobody wants to be considered as irrelevant.  And so, I don't see that as a race issue, except to the extent that it is complicated by the history of this company.  There's a quote and I can't remember the author, but one--and it was written many, many years ago, I think in the '50s [1950s]--that you cannot look at the question of our progress, and simply be mesmerized or blinded by the issue of race because that is but one factor.
Story_ID: 606058
Speaker 1: So what do you want your legacy to be, Michele [HistoryMaker Michele Coleman Mayes] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I don't know.  I will tell you it's--one of my bosses said something to me once, and I went, that's really smart, yeah, you're right.  If you try a case, one way to try it is to write your closing argument first because then, you'll know what your evidence is that has to go in.  If you really want to know what your legacy is, you write it before you start.  Now, I didn't do that totally, but my legacy would be that folks are willing to challenge convention without destroying the structure.  That's my goal.  I think if you stifle descent, if you'd stifle differences and you become homogenous, you lose something, but I don't want that descent to be so poisonous that everything dies, so that's my legacy.  I've been able to work inside of most structures and challenge them without destroying them.  That will be my legacy.
