Story_ID: 37239
Speaker 1: Let's begin by talking about your family tree, and I'd like to start on your mother's side.  Tell me your mother's name, where she was born and when she was born, if you know?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's name is Carrie Lena Cotten.  And her married name is Williams.  She was born in Madison County, Madison, Mississippi and--on February 10, 1925.
Speaker 1: And did your mother share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Quite a few.  Not only did she share it, but I would hear her talking with her sisters about their growing up.  They grew up in Madison in the rural area of Madison County on the farm.  And, of course, they had to work the farm a lot.  She was a little sickly, and the youngest daughter.  So I don't hear much about her going to the fields as I heard about the other ones, but, of course, she did have to go.  And I hear a lot about her school days because she did have to walk to school like everybody else at that time, and the fact that she loved school.  She was very sharp in her books, and their school only went to eighth grade.  And I know that she was able to go on to high school by living with a cousin who lived near Tougaloo Preparatory School [Jackson, Mississippi] at that time.  It ended up as Tougaloo College where she also went.  So I hear a lot about the school, early school days and working on the farm with her siblings.
Speaker 1: What else did she tell you about her school days?
Speaker 2: The fact that it was a, not a one-room schoolhouse that she attended.  She attended, I think, a four-room schoolhouse because she was in the town of Madison.  But there was a one-room schoolhouse in the area of the church that they attended, which was Ridley Hill [ph.] Baptist Church.  So she probably did attend that one-room schoolhouse in the early years because it was closer and not as far for her to walk.  But later on, they did go to Madison Rosenwald, which was in town, so to speak.
Speaker 1: And how many siblings did she have?
Speaker 2: Wow, that's a good question because I--there were two sets of children so to speak.  You know how you talk about two sets.  So her older siblings, I think there were five of them from her mom's [Geraldine Foster Cotton] first marriage.  And then when her mom remarried her father [Edward David Cotton], there were five or six born.  But then there were also children who came to live with them.  So I do remember a total of fifteen all together in the house at one time.  But all her mom's natural born or so to speak, adopted children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 37240
Speaker 1: Tell me about your [maternal] grandmother.  Did you know your grandmother?
Speaker 2: I did not know her.  She passed away six months after I was born, but her name was Geraldine Foster Bully Cotten because she was married twice.  Her maiden name was Foster. Her first marriage was to a Bully, George Bully, and then her second marriage was to my grandfather, Ed Cotten.  And I know that she was a seamstress as well as a homemaker because she sewed a slip for me between the time that I was born and six months when she passed away.  But the slip was made out of a cotton sack--no a flour sack, and I still have that, that slip.  And I'm sure she made it for my other cousins, but they don't have theirs.  And they were like, where's mine, you know.  But I was always cognizant of history.  Growing up, my mom [Carrie Lena Cotton] just taught that to me, and she just instilled it in me to love antiques and to talk to my elderly family members and to just be aware of how we came, from where we came and how we are and the things around our house that had been passed on to us.  So I was always aware that I needed to keep things like that.
Speaker 1: And what about your grandfather, your mother's father?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Edward David Cotten, and he was named after his father.  His father also was named Edward Cotten.
Speaker 1: And what did he do?
Speaker 2: He was a farmer, landowner, businessman, very, very astute businessman.
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandfather?
Speaker 2: I did know him.  Yes, I think I may have been thirteen [years old] when he passed away, but he was ninety-three years old when he passed away.
Story_ID: 37241
Speaker 1: So tell me more about him [Evans' maternal grandfather, Edward David Cotton, Jr.], and your great grandfather, about the land--you said they were farmers.  Did they own their own land?
Speaker 2: Yes.  As a matter of fact, I have found deeds that my grandfather--of his purchases in the late 1960s [sic - 1860s?] and in the early 1970s [sic - 1870s?] is was my great, great grandfather who purchased land at that time.  My grandfather who was born in 1875 began purchasing land also in his early years, very, very early.  At one time, he and his younger brother owned as many as 100 acres in Madison, Mississippi.  So he was a very, very clever businessman.
Speaker 1: Your great grandfather, I guess, Ed, Sr.--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --what other types of business--was he only a farmer or did he have other businesses which helped him to buy the land because you were telling me about a deed that took a number of people to buy the land?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  I don't know what other business he had other than farming, my great grandfather, that is, but I do know that when he started purchasing land in the 19--late 1860s and early 1870s, he went in with a group of people.  They--I don't see deeds or did not see deeds in the courthouse where they purchased the loan until maybe 1888.  And there was a deed where he did go in on his own.  And I'm pretty sure that the person from whom he purchased the land was either a relative or either the owner himself, previous slave owner.  But the conditions under which they had to buy during those years was--were brutal, just almost inhumane.  The conditions like giving so many crops, so many bushels of their produce, so many bales of cotton bag, all of the produce that was, berries or anything that grew wild on the land.  So the conditions were just unheard of.  I don't really know how they were able to maintain or actually retain the land, and I don't know if they did.  That's something I would like to find out, exactly what happened to the land because with all of those people going in to purchase it, how did it end up being divided if it was divided or did they end up losing it?
Story_ID: 37242
Speaker 1: Your [maternal] grandfather [Edward David Cotton], you said you did know him for, you know, a little while he was alive.  Did you have a relationship with him?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your relationship with your grandfather?
Speaker 2: We visited him a lot, although we didn't live on the same property, same land because my father's [R.L. Williams] father [Perry Williams] also owned land.  So when my mom [Carrie Lena Cotton] married my father, they built on his land.  But we visited my mom's land and her people all the time, sometimes every day when my grandfather became very ill.  We'd go and visit him.  And so we were able to talk to him because in his later life, he could not see.  He lost his sight.  So he was pretty stationery, and he wanted us to come and visit and talk to him.  So we did.  We were able to share a lot with him.
Speaker 1: Any stories that you remember him telling you?
Speaker 2: Stories, not off the cuff.  I can't remember particular stories.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 37243
Speaker 1: Was there any stories about slavery?
Speaker 2: I do remember hearing about my grandmother's [Geraldine Foster Cotton] father, Geraldine, my mom's mother's father was enslaved.  His name was Joe Foster.  And I've heard stories that he shared with his grandchildren who were my aunts.  It's confusing, but I have an uncle who was named after him, so to speak.  His name was also Joe.  And Joe knew that I loved stories about history, so he shared with me about his namesake, his grandfather, Joe Foster.  And I know that Joe Foster was sold when he was about twelve years [old], he and siblings, he and some of his siblings were loaded onto a wagon.  They were at that point in Byram, Mississippi, which is a little further South than Madison [Mississippi].  And they were brought into the northern parts, well, into Madison, north of Byram and sold separately, and that this was a couple of years before the [American] Civil War, before Emancipation, so that upon Emancipation, he returned to Byram, because he had remembered his name.  He remembered where he came from.  And he did find two of his siblings still living in Byram.  And he turned his name back to Foster because when he had been sold in Madison, the owners changed it.  I'm not too sure to what.  But he did turn his name--regain his name of Foster.  He returned to Madison, and actually to the place where he had been enslaved and lived there probably as a sharecropper.  And he married a first wife whose name was Martha, and they had two or three children.  But Martha and the children died in a fire.  And then he married Celestine who was my great-grandmother and the mother of Geraldine, my grandmother.  And he and Geraldine [Celestine] had about six children.  Geraldine, my grandmother, was the oldest of his children.  And so he had a pretty close relationship with Geraldine's children, who then are my uncles and aunts.  And he told stories to them.  By that time, I'm sure he was pretty up in age himself, but he did tell them about his life during the period of enslavement and the fact that during that time, he didn't have any clothes to wear, didn't have shoes.  He talked about how he wore something like an apron around his waist, and that was the extent of his clothing for many years.  And that when he first came to Madison, where he was sold, around the age of twelve, he worked as a water boy, and then he worked as a field hand, chopping and hoeing in the fields.  And that when there was time for meals, the food was put in a trough, pretty much like a pig trough, and they ate from that.  So those are the kind of stories that he passed on to his grandchildren, and then they told me.  And I've heard that from more than one of the, of his grandchildren.
Story_ID: 37244
Speaker 1: Now, let's move on to your father and his family.  Tell me your father's name and where and when he was born?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Rio Leonard.  And he never used that name.  He just used R. L. Williams.  He was born in Madison [Mississippi].  He parents are Fannie Patterson Sanders Williams.  My grandmother was married twice.  And his father was Perry Williams.
Speaker 1: And did your father share stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Don't hear a lot, didn't hear a lot about his growing up.  Just that he had to leave home early and work to help support the family.  Many times, they--the men especially, had to take outside jobs to help pay for the property because my grandfather purchased land in 1909, my paternal grandfather.  And he died rather early, died when--I don't know if my father was even twenty [years old] or grown at that time.  So my father had to go and help support his mom and the property.
Speaker 1: What about his schooling?
Speaker 2: They went to--well, "they," his siblings and he went to Madison County School, the same school that my mom's [Carrie Lena Cotton] family went to.  They were coming from different directions in the city, but they did go to Madison Rosenwald for elementary years.  And that school went to eighth grade.  And if any of the children, students wanted to go on, they had to go away to school and live with relatives if they had them.  And the closest preparatory school was Tougaloo Preparatory, which became Tougaloo College [Jackson, Mississippi].  My father did not go to high school.  He went into the [U.S.] Army.  When he returned from the Army, he went to a Bible institute and from that, he went to the Mississippi Baptist Seminary, where he earned a theology degree.  He was a Baptist minister.  And after that he went to Belhaven College [Jackson] for continuing studies, continuing education.
Story_ID: 37245
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about, more about his [Evans' father, R.L. Williams] mother [Fannie Patterson Williams Sanders] and father [Perry Williams], your grandparents, Fannie and Perry?
Speaker 2: Fannie and Perry.  Well--
Speaker 1: Well, we know that Perry passed away.
Speaker 2: Passed away.  And then Fannie married Phil Sanders, and he came to the property and lived with us--lived with us, lived with the family.  When I say to the property, there were three houses on the property, my grandmother's house, Fannie, my dad's house, and my uncle's house.  So it was like, it was almost like an African village.  And when I went to Africa and realized that, oh, I grew up in the same type setting, you know, where it was very, very inclusive, sheltered, private property.  And so Phil really kept us.  He took care of us.  My grandmother ended up going into town to day work, into Jackson [Mississippi], as a day worker.  But my grandfather stayed on the land every day, had the most beautiful garden.  And he kept us until we went to school.  So he taught us how to count and spell (laughter), you know.  We learned to count by counting the boxcars on the train as it passed by.  And then he would give us words to spell, and we'd spell them?
Speaker 1: Was he an educated man himself?
Speaker 2: Well, when you say educated, he was very educated, but he--I don't know where he got his schooling because he taught Sunday School.  And he would say, you know, most of the men in my class can't even read.  But he read the Bible every day.  He read the newspaper every day.  When he passed at 105 years old, he had read the paper that day.  He passed right after he ate, I mean just sitting in his chair.  So he was educated, but properly as what we call going to school, I don't know exactly how he became educated.
Speaker 1: Any other information about family members?
Speaker 2: Well my grandmother, Fannie, like I said, was a day worker.  But she was also a very strong community activist.  She was president of almost everything she was a member of, you know, the Mission Society.  She was a leader in the Eastern Star, the [unclear], everything there was, she was in it.  At one time my uncle, from my mom's side of the family, said she was probably the most political person she knew in the county, political woman, in the country.  She was president of the PTO [Parent Teacher Organization] when we were in school.  So as, as grandchildren, we saw my grandmother conduct the PTO meetings, or, you know, be a leader in the community that way.  And you would think that, you know, parents, if you have parents in your family, they would be the PTO members and all.  But it was really a community organization.  It was not just for the parents of the children, but everybody in the community was active, you know, for the children's sake.  So she was, she was very, very active, and impressive.
Speaker 1: And what--did we talk about, did she go to school?
Speaker 2: Again, I'm, I don't know exactly to what extent.  I remember seeing a certificate from Jackson State [University] when we were growing.  But again, her house burned down, so we don't have that.  So she took some kind of classes at Jackson State, and exactly to what degree or what kind of classes those were, I don't know.
Story_ID: 37246
Speaker 1: Tell me about your siblings?
Speaker 2: I have two brothers, one older.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me their names and--
Speaker 2: Their names--
Speaker 1: --and how they were born and where you fit in?
Speaker 2: Yes, okay.  So my oldest brother is Ray Williams.  And he was born two years before me, so in 1955.  And then I was born in '57 [1957], and my younger brother, Shadric Onesimus Williams was born in '59 [1959].  Is that like two years later?  Yeah, okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Can you spell his name for me?
Speaker 2: So Raphael Shadric.  Shadric is S-H-A-D-R-I-C, O-N-E-S-I-M-U-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Raphael is R-A-P-H-E-A-L.  We say "Raphael," but it Raphael.  And Leonard.  He has my father's name, L-E-O-N-A-R-D.  And I have a brother who was before my parents' marriage.  His name is also Leonard.  I call him--well, actually, it's Robert.  We call him Leonard Perry.  And we didn't grow up around him, and again, he's older and from a different reunion--from a different union.
Speaker 1: On your mother's [Carrie Lena Cotton] side or your father's [R.L. Williams] side?
Speaker 2: My father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 37247
Speaker 1: Now, let's talk a little bit about your primary years, say through elementary school.  Let's first talk about the house that you lived in, where it was and just give me a tour of where you lived?
Speaker 2: Well, I've lived in the same house all my life.  The house--remember, there're only three houses on that property, until my father [R.L. Williams] built a fourth house for a neighbor who needed a house to live in.  But basically, there were three houses.  And so it was--you want to know the layout of the house?  Is that what you're asking me?  So there was a living room, dining room, bedrooms, and, you know, what's interesting as I think about it, the house was continually added onto.  So, at different stages of my life, you know, the house had different rooms.  And my room was in a different location, at different times because my father was sort of like a jack-of-all-trades.  So he felt that he could just add on, well, I think I'll add a room on, you know.  And sometimes, he would have other people come and help, and sometimes he would do it himself.  So really interesting. (laughter)
Speaker 1: Was there plumbing and all of that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yeah, we always had indoor plumping.  We always had an indoor bathroom.  And that was one of the things he did add was another bathroom when he added another bedroom for he and my mom [Carrie Lena Cotten].  And we ended up actually having three bathrooms in the end and an upstairs back component in the end of the house.
Story_ID: 37248
Speaker 1: So the houses besides your family homes, who else lived in the area?
Speaker 2: On my dad's [R.L. Williams] property, it was my grandmother's [Fannie Patterson Williams Sanders] house--
Speaker 1: No, it was--after your property--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who was your neighbor--
Speaker 2: Ah, yes.
Speaker 1: --who were your neighbors, sorry?
Speaker 2: Well, the closest neighbors were white people who lived across the way.  And they lived, so imagine our land, and there was a, an empty land like pasture almost, but not a lot of cows and maybe horses.  And then their house.  So their house faced ours.  So their property, they were the closest to us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, not so close to us but in the area, approximate area, was cousins, there were cousins who lived there.  And these were cousins of my grandfather, the man purchased the property at the same time that my grandfather purchased his property in 1909.  So these two cousins went in together and purchased adjacent properties.  So they lived--it wasn't easy to get to the house because we could walk there easier than we could drive because to drive, we had to go around the highway, the road to get there.  So they were the Grosses, Gross, G-R-O-S-S was their last name.  And they, I don't know exactly if they were first or second cousins to my grandfather.
Speaker 1: And on the land--they farmed the land?
Speaker 2: We were not big farmers.  I think the most we had was a garden that my grandfather, Phil Sanders, grew.  But we had gardens, not farms.  We didn't farm.  But we did have horses--not horses, we had cows.  My father had cows and my uncle had pigs.  So they did have livestock, so to speak.
Story_ID: 37249
Speaker 1: So now, talk to me about your elementary school years.
Speaker 2: Elementary school was spent at Rosa Scott Elementary School [Madison, Mississippi], which was the carry-on of Madison, Madison Rosenwald, I should say.  Madison Rosenwald, which was the school that my parents [Carrie Lena Cotten and R.L. Williams] went to, in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], the '40s [1940s] became Rosa Scott.  And Rosa Scott is the name of--she may have been the first principal, but really one of the forward, one of the teachers, early, early teachers of that school.  And it was a first grade through twelfth grade school.  And, of course, it was segregated for all of the African American children in Madison.  And my mom taught there.  So we rode to school with her every day, and rode back home with her every day, typical school, segregated school in the South.
Speaker 1: Was there one class for each grade?
Speaker 2: There may have been two.  I remember them being two for each grade.
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of your teachers there, besides your mom?
Speaker 2: Okay, my first teacher was Ms. Willie Bell Davis, loved her (laughter).  She and my mom collaborated to allow me to come to school early.  They changed my birth date, and I can say it now (laughter) because they're not here.  But my birthday, which is in February would have, would have made me come to school a year later.  But, of course, I was ready (laughter).  And so they moved my birthday up two months.  So my new birthday became December 13th and, which was the birthday of one of my aunts.  And so we always shared birthday parties and like I had two birthdays for a long, long time, you know.  And so that was my first-grade teacher, Willie Bell Davis.  And everybody in the school knew everybody, of course, you know.  They all knew my mom, and my parents, not just my mom.  Everybody knows everybody.  But I remember her, and then one of her close friends and teacher friends, coworkers, was Hattie Williams who had our same last name.  And our families were close, but we were not related and people felt that--thought that we were close because our parents were so close, you know, friendship wise.
Story_ID: 37250
Speaker 1: What type of child were you at that time [during elementary school in Madison, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Well, I played piano and stayed inside.  And I guess, you know, just well mannered, played piano a lot.  I ended up majoring in piano when I went to Tougaloo [College, Jackson, Mississippi].  Before I went there, I took piano lessons at Tougaloo for maybe four or five years and played on recital there probably since I was thirteen [years old], because I went to Tougaloo at sixteen.  So I started playing on recital maybe two or three years before that.  And then prior to taking lessons at Tougaloo from a professor at Tougaloo, I took in Jackson [Mississippi].  And that means two to three times a week, my parents would take me to Jackson for piano lessons.  And there was a--the piano teacher was named Mr. Galloway and had probably a hundred piano students.  I don't know how many, but by the time you get to the piano, you know the song by memory, right, 'cause (laughter) you heard people play it.  There were so many people taking that--so many children, there were two rooms.  You know, so we would go in here and move up as our time got closer.  So that was a huge sacrifice for my mom to make.  Not only did I take piano from him, I ended up taking organ lessons from him.  And my parents [carrie Lena Cotten and R.L. Williams] purchased me an organ and a piano in the home, and then close to recital time, he developed he dance troupe.  So I was also in his dance program, recitals.  So that was sometimes three days a week, going to Jackson for piano lessons.
Story_ID: 37251
Speaker 1: Tell me more about your elementary school [at Rosa Scott Elementary School, Madison, Mississippi] years.  We kind of jumped ahead to the high school, junior high school years.  But in your elementary school years--well, let me ask you this question which will take you back a little bit.  If you were to think of a sound, a sight or a smell that would take you back to that time, what would you think about?
Speaker 2: I think that the smell would be the cleaning formula.  There was a formula that they used for the floors.  In elementary school, we had concrete floors.  And they cleaned 'em with, I can't remember what you call it.  But when you cut wood, you have the chips that fall out, what do you call it?  And they put some kind of oil or something on it, some kind of solution.  And then they would take these long mops and push along the concrete, made it shine, made it beautiful, but it also left this fragrance (laughter) that I, you know, sort of remember, don't remember exactly.  But that's what I remember.  And we were there when they cleaned the schools everyday because we were still waiting for mom [Carrie Lena Cotten] to finish her work and leave.  So we would see them, the maintenance people coming through cleaning, and we, you know, this smell was always there.  They were pushing the mop down the hallway or through the classroom, cleaning the floors with this kind of oil solution.
Speaker 1: So that's the smell.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What about a sight?
Speaker 2: A sight?  A sight would probably be the cafeteria.
Speaker 1: It could be outside of the school.  I'm just trying to take you back to that time in your life.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, probably the cafeteria.  And it could also be the graveyard because remember I said that the school was named for Rosa Scott.  Well, her body was entombed in the, like a courtyard, and you pass by.  You could see this grave in there.  So, you know, that comes to my mind.
Speaker 1: What sounds come to your mind?
Speaker 2: Sounds, probably talking, children, teachers, you know, no particular sound.
Story_ID: 37252
Speaker 1: Was there a particular teacher [at Rosa Scott Elementary School, Madison, Mississippi] that might have encouraged you or someone that was inspirational?
Speaker 2: My--Miss Williams, Hattie Williams, I told you.  I remember her because she had Sunday School lesson on Friday.  You know, we had to bring our Sunday School (laughter) books sometimes, yeah, that was allowed.  Maybe it wasn't allowed.  But she did it.  So I remember that, and I also remember really falling in love with math when I was in school.  This was before integration, before I went to the, I think it was before integration, before I went to the, you know, integrated school.  And the teacher's name, I can't remember, Connie, something.  But she was absolutely sharp and just, she just turned me on to math.  And because I was, I guess so accomplished in math, I remember recently, one of the friends who I knew during that time said, I'm surprised you're not a math major, you did not major in math because you were so good in math, you know.  So other people must have known too how much I loved it, and how much I, you know, I guess achieved in it at that time.  But she stands out to me as one of my favorite teachers that I can really tap into.
Story_ID: 37253
Speaker 1: And as you moved on, you stayed at that school [Rosa Scott Elementary School, Madison, Mississippi] until you graduated?
Speaker 2: No, I stayed there until integration, until full integration because--
Speaker 1: But what year was that because 'Brown vs. The Board of Education'--
Speaker 2: I know, right.
Speaker 1: --was a long time [1954].  This is, we're already--if you're in first grade, 1961--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So, I mean integration should have happened, which it didn't, so--
Speaker 2: It didn't.
Speaker 1: --what year are you speaking of?
Speaker 2: Let me see, maybe around '70 [1970].  I'm not really sure exactly.  I went to Tougaloo [College, Jackson, Mississippi] in '73 [1973], and I was there two years.  So maybe '71 [1971] or--
Speaker 1: You were in--
Speaker 2: --'70 [1970] or '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: What grade?
Speaker 2: You know, I didn't go to twelfth grade, so I think it must have been tenth grade or something like that, tenth grade because I was there two years in the integrated school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went to Rosa Scott until the tenth grade?
Speaker 2: Probably to the ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Ninth grade, okay.
Speaker 2: And I went there for tenth and eleventh grade, yeah.  And that was what we call full integration, of course, because then we could go to the school.  Before that, we had "Freedom of Choice," and you could select.  So some of the black children opted to go to the school, to the white, predominantly white school.  But then after the Freedom of Choice opportunity passed, then it was like, okay, we have one high school.  And so that high school became the white, predominantly white high school.  And Rosa Scott ended up being maybe an elementary school or something.  Right now, it's a middle school in Madison.  But that was the norm, is that, if there's only going to be one high school, it would be the school that was the white high school.  And things were very, very different because at Rosa Scott, we had band, we had choir, we had all of the sports.  We had library.  It was just, had a rich, rich extracurricular, extra curriculum activities, opportunities for students.  But when we went to the school that became the high school, the white high school, all of those activities were stopped.  They didn't allow band nor choir.  Sports continued, you know, there was still a basketball team, still a football team, but nothing that the students could interact, you know, with, or during or any kind of extracurricular activities for students.
Story_ID: 37254
Speaker 1: Did you participate at Rosa Scott [Elementary School, Madison, Mississippi] in any other extracurricular activities?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was very active.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about that?
Speaker 2: It was band.
Speaker 1: You were in a band?  What did you play?
Speaker 2: Played saxophone, was in the marching band, concert band.  Again, here's the music coming in, you know and the influence.  And my brother was in the band as well.  I can't remember other things like boys--Girl Scouts, but can't remember any other activities.  But most--I was very active.  Whatever there was, I was in it.
Speaker 1: Were you a part of student government?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had the Student Council.
Speaker 1: All right, and that, only that one teacher stands out in your mind?
Speaker 2: She stood, well, Ms. [Hattie] Williams, and then I can't remember the lady's  name.  Actually, she was a white teacher who had come to our school, to Rosa Scott.
Speaker 1: What year did white teachers come to Rosa Scott.
Speaker 2: They must have come before the '70s [1970s] or before--they did come before we moved to Madison, what is it called, Madison Ridgeland High School.  So, yeah, she just stands out to me.  Sure, I remember her.
Story_ID: 37255
Speaker 1: So the white high school was--the name of it was Madison Ridgeland [School, Madison, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Yes, Madison Ridgeland High.
Speaker 1: So now, this is the first time [in the early 1970s] that you're going to school with white students, is that right?
Speaker 2: I believe so.
Speaker 1: So, I mean tell me about the experience of going to this new school?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it was disappointing in that we didn't have these extracurricular activities.  I mean it was just like, okay, in and out.  And it was, it was different.  I'm not sure how we were grouped, how we were--what do you call it, put into levels or classes.  But I don't remember having classes with a lot of African American children.  And I think it was because we selected things.  Like I took Latin, so I guess nobody wants to take Latin, and I took typing (laughter).  And, of course, you took your math and your science.  But it was not any more challenging or less challenging than that, than Rosa Scott [Elementary School] because we were really challenged and it was just such a nurturing environment at Rosa Scott.  So I think integration was a disappointment more than anything else because it was just so blah.  It's nothing that really stands out.  But there are things that stood out at Rosa, at Rosa Scott, you know, in my mind.  So there was no prom, no dances, nothing.  And I do remember that my brother [Ray Williams] was called "Stokely."  They called him Stokely.  And I don't remember exactly what precipitated this, but he was of the first, he was in the first graduating class, two years ahead of me.  So I went in maybe tenth grade, so he was in twelfth grade.  And he was the leader of the so-called walk out when they were supposed to be marching to Tougaloo College [Jackson, Mississippi].  So needless to say, my mom [Carrie Lena Cotten] was very concerned about him graduating, that along with other things that happened.  And his whole attitude, again, gave him or made him receive the name Stokely Carmichael, you know.  He was like the militant one.  And I do remember my mom's sigh of relief and just feeling of relief when she actually did see him in graduation line, when he graduated.  She did not think they were gonna let him graduate.
Story_ID: 37256
Speaker 1: So somehow the principal [at Madison Ridgeland High School, Madison, Mississippi] found out that I played piano, and his wife was a pianist.  And they said, "Oh, we heard you play piano."  The show was, I don't know if they auditioned me or whatever, but I got a chance to play piano on my brother's [Ray Williams] graduation program, yeah.  So the night of his graduation, I played some, some classical piece.  I can't remember what it was.  And then they looked at my records, and they said, oh, well, you don't need but one more class to graduate next year.  Well, they didn't know I wasn't coming back there anyway because Tougaloo [College, Jackson, Mississippi] has a, had an early admittance program.  And because I scored something on the SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] where if you had--you can score to come in.  And my relationship with them already as a music student, and I knew I was gonna major in piano.  So I'd already planned to go on to Tougaloo [College].  But because I could only, I only needed one more credit to graduate, took a correspondence course.  And I was able to get my degree--my high school diploma, I should say, the next year.  And I think I ended up being sal [salutatorian] because that year we had two sals and two vals [valedictorian], you know, it was still, having to honor the system, the segregated school and then the integrated schools.  So I was in the top four, you know, that year, but I did go on and get my diploma.  And I don't know if I played piano on that program as well, but I know I did speak at that commencement, at that graduation ceremony.
Story_ID: 37257
Speaker 1: And you talked about the school [Madison Ridgeland High School, Madison, Mississippi] being a disappointment, but you were still able to maintain your grades and, you know, stay on top because you already had the foundation.  What about the teachers?  Did you feel that you were being treated fairly by them?
Speaker 2: Not--some of them, but not all of them.
Speaker 1: Was there a specific incident that might have happened?
Speaker 2: There was, I remember--I don't remember any particular incidents.  I'm sure my brother [Ray Williams] could tell you a lot of them (laughter) because he was the one who instigated this walking out, right.  I don't know.  I guess I was at a different mindset, but I do remember that I had only one 'B', and that was in typing.  And my friends were saying, come on.  Your fingers, you play piano.  You should, why are you not--a 'B' in typing.  You should have an 'A' in typing if any, you know, of all the subjects.  And I remember the teacher found out something about my--well, of course, teachers talk in lounges.  And she came back one day, and she says, I found out something about you, that you have As in your other classes.  Why don't you have an 'A' in typing?  You know, I was like, yeah, I do have an 'A' in typing (laughter), you know.  But, you know, not on paper.  So it was no big deal though, to me.  I mean I didn't take it to heart.  I knew what was going on, but it wasn't like it was an issue that I would go and cause--.
Story_ID: 37258
Speaker 1: So, now, you talked about your brother [Ray Williams], you know, being the radical one.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And Civil Rights [Movement] was going on as you were coming up through, into high school, you know, with Martin Luther King and the whole Civil Rights Movement.  Were your parents [Carrie Lena Cotten and R.L. Williams] political or involved in the Civil Rights Movement in any way?
Speaker 2: Not as much my parents as my uncle.  So my parents were.  I mean they went to meetings, and they voted and all that, but they were not as active as my uncle, who was on my mom's side, Joe.  So he had us out on Saturday, on Sundays after church, doing voter regis--not voter, voter drives, voter registration, going door-to-door, knocking.  I never will forget that.  So we went out with my cousins and in different parts of Madison [Mississippi].  And we talked to people about voting and registering to vote.  And it was instilled in me so that--I think I must have been a sophomore at college, on my eighteenth birthday, I went to the courthouse and registered on my birthday.  So, although my parents were not the forerunners or actually out there, it was in my family.  And it was instilled in me.
Story_ID: 37259
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about, during this time before we go on to college, about church and your involvement in the church.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  Well, my father [R.L. Williams] was a minister, so I was there (laughter), every Sunday.  And we joined his church, the church that he pastored.  But he still held his membership in his home church.  And then my mom [Carrie Lena Cotten] still held her membership in her home church.  So it was like we really had three churches growing up.  And it was like, my dad's church, my mom's church and "the" church, our church.  So we went quite often, sang in choir.  I played, I did not play for church.  I played for Sunday School because my background was more classical.  And I, I don't regret having the classical background, but I regret not having the gospel to go along with it or the improvisation to go along with that.  So he pastored a church in Madison [Mississippi], two Sundays a month.  And then one Sunday, we traveled to the Southern part of the state, Mount Olive, where he pastored a church.  And we would have to go there and stay on Saturday--go on Saturday and stay Saturday night for that.  And that was once a month.  So we still have those friends, very dear to us, you know.  We still hear from them, see them periodically, not often, but it was like an extension of us.
Speaker 1: And what other activities did you participate in besides, you know, playing for Sunday School on a Sunday School church.  Was there any other activities at the church that you belonged to?
Speaker 2: No, not a lot because in rural churches, you know, you really don't go during the week a lot, you know.  People have to travel such a distance.  Most of the members were from Jackson or live in Jackson.  So we didn't come out during the week a lot, at all actually, only maybe on, during revival, the week of revival.  Every church had a week during the summer, the end of the summer where they came every night for revival.  And this is where people actually joined church because they didn't join that much during the year.  So if you were of age and ready to seek salvation, so to speak, you would sit on what's called the "mourner's bench."  And that was true in all of the churches in the area.  I mean that was just the norm, the tradition, the standard.  And so you would sit there and listen to the minister.  And if you felt that you, God had heard your prayers, and you had been saved, then you would join church.  You would get up and, you know, acknowledge it.  Now, my experience with that was quite different from most people in my community growing up, and most people my age because my dad was seminary trained.  He just felt that it was all a belief.  If you believe, then you, that was all you needed.  You didn't have to go out in the night and see a sign.  You didn't have to pray and tarry and do all of those things.  But in the church where he still held his membership, that was the norm, that you really have to pray, stay out late at night, have a prayer ground at night.  You have to see a sign, something, some story you had to tell about how God brought you through or how he saved you.  And if your story was not good enough, sometimes, you know, people sent you back, your parents and relatives and whoever, but I have seen people get sent back to the mourner's bench, yeah.  It's not good enough, you know.  And it was quite intense when they did go up, I mean crying and shouting and all of that.  So, like I say, my experience was quite different because of my father's background in theology, his seminary training.
Speaker 1: What was your experience?
Speaker 2: My experience was that you came to the mourner's bench, and when you felt that you were ready to go up, you believed, you just went up, and you, you know, sat in the chair that was in front.  And you just said your name and what you believe.  You know, I believe that Jesus saved my soul or whatever.  But for many of the other people, it had to be really dramatic, okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you did say this was the Baptist church?
Speaker 2: Yes, Baptist.
Speaker 1: All right, tell me the name--you told me the name of the church that your father pastored, but your mother's church was?
Speaker 2: Okay, my father pastored Rocky Hill Baptist Church.  My mother's church was Ridley Hill Baptist Church.  And then my father's church was Mount Pleasant Baptist Church.
Story_ID: 37260
Speaker 1: You were leaving--you didn't have to go to the twelfth grade--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --at this [Madison Ridgeland High School, Madison, Mississippi] school because, okay.  So let's start from there.  How did you prepare to move on?  You had already had this in your mind when they told you that you didn't have to go, you know, you only had one more grade.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, and start by telling about this correspondence course.
Speaker 2: The corres--oh, they told me exactly where I could go.  I mean I wonder sometimes now if they were doing it so maybe I wouldn't be there, but it didn't matter to me because I wasn't gonna be there anyway.  But the principal told me that I could take this correspondence course through Southern University at--this was in Mississippi, Mississippi, Southern University in Mississippi--Mississippi Southern University, but it's in Hattiesburg.  So wrote them, and I think it was a history or social studies.  I didn't do the course.  My boyfriend did the course for me (laughter).  I made sure he did all the work (laughter).  So he was, who ended up being my husband, my ex-husband now, but so it was a matter of answering the questions like a booklet, you know, answer the questions.  And I can't remember how the exam went.  But apparently, I took it.  I must have taken the exam and got the verification that I had passed it, satisfied them.  And I received a diploma.
Speaker 1: So you never marched in the graduation?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I was able to march because I had that last credit.  So I marched with the class above me which was really strange.
Speaker 1: So what year was this that you graduated?
Speaker 2: It must have been '73 [1973] because I entered Tougaloo [College, Jackson, Mississippi] in '73, in 1973.
Story_ID: 37261
Speaker 1: So, now, before we go into college [Tougaloo College, Jackson, Mississippi], talk to me a little bit about--you said you did not have a prom.  Tell me about some of the things that you and your friends were doing.  You said you had a boyfriend.  So what were some of the things, what were the music--what was the music that you were listening to?  Were you allowed to listen to music?  Were you allowed to dance, you know, that type of thing.  What were you doing as a teenager?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a boyfriend, but he lived in Jackson.  So (laughter) right away it was a problem.  So we talked on the phone a lot, a lot of talking on the phone.  And we didn't really do a lot of getting together with people, you know with--there was no way for me to walk to somebody's house 'cause I'm living in this, you know, private area.  So sharing was a minimum--sharing as far as physical sharing.  I had a car.  I could drive, but there was--what did we do during the summer?  Every summer, I was in some kind of program.  So one summer, I went to Jackson State [University] for a program, but it was like you go there, and you participate in the--it was a band program, a music programs or whatever.  And then you, when your time is done, you come on back home.  So it was quite structured that way, you know.  And you would see friends then and there, but as far as like hanging out, sleeping over at somebody's house, that was not done.
Speaker 1: Did you go to the movies?
Speaker 2: No, not really.
Speaker 1: Was there bowling, anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, not in Madison [Mississippi], no.
Speaker 1: Not at all?
Speaker 2: No, none of that, not in Madison.  It's quite different now, but not then (laughter).
Speaker 1: So in the summertime, when you went to these different programs, you said they were music, how did you enjoy those programs?
Speaker 2: They were, they were interesting.  They were really good because I met people who had liked--same interests, and I learned a lot that I could bring back to my school setting.  And that particular program at Jackson State [University] was a band camp, so to speak.  I can't remember how long it was.  But we played with college students, and that was when I played my saxophone.  I was, you know, playing in the band, but I think I also did piano lessons that summer, played piano out there too with them.  And we traveled a lot in the summers with my family.  My father [R.L. Williams] was a minister, and he was active in the National Baptist Conventions.  So we went every summer to the youth rally, and for many years, we were the only children from Mississippi because they would take like, tallies, you know, how many from this state.  You know, you'd stand up or whatever.  And this was from very young, all the way up.  Every summer that would be our vacation.  So we, we would count like how many states we had been in, and have been in, like over half, maybe like two thirds.  The West Coast, we didn't go to as much.  But we did travel a lot, and I can't remember where--summers, there were other summer programs too that we participated in.  They were mostly school based, you know, some kind of school program.  My mom [Carrie Lena Cotten] would find for us to do.  And then during the summers, we also spent a lot of time with my relatives in Jackson because my mom was in graduate school at Jackson State, so we would go down with her and stay with my cousins until she finished school, and then ride back.  So everything was centered around family or school or travel with family.
Story_ID: 37262
Speaker 1: Do you have a story about any of your travels, going to the [National] Baptist Convention, since you went to so many different states?
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: Because now we're still talking about before you graduate, you know, before that it was still integration.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, segregation.
Speaker 2: Segregation, yeah.  And I was about to say that I do remember the lunches that we had to pack because we did not stop and eat at restaurants.  And so it was just understood that you were to pack your lunch.  And my grandmother, you know, was really helpful with that.  She enjoyed packing our lunches, and, you know, sometimes chicken or cake or whatever.  And when we went to these places, many times we stayed in folks' homes, you know.  There would be a list, and, you know, how many this person could accommodate.  So we would, my father [R.L. Williams] would find a place that accommodated a family or whatever.  And there would be certain eating places that we had to go to.  It wasn't, it wasn't that, to me, thinking back, I think it was difficult, (laughter) but it wasn't because that's what we knew.  I remember the first time we did stay in a hotel, I think this is when we went to North Carolina, and I can't remember the year.  But I remember my cousin traveling with us, who was a female, and we stayed in a room, you know, we stayed together, my cousin, my aunt, and I, we all stayed in the same room.
Speaker 1: One other thing I wanted to ask you about before we move on is that you said that your mother [Carrie Lena Cotten] and father bought a piano and then an organ?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And that had to be very expensive.  Do you know how they were able to acquire that?
Speaker 2: Well, my father worked and my mom, my mom was a teacher.  And then my father was a construction worker, and a minister, and he had his own business.  He had a tombstone business because he was a cement person.  He ended up making tombstones and selling them.  As a matter of fact, my brother said he went to a funeral recently, and he saw my daddy's tombstones in the graveyard, you know, and I--'cause he would recognize them, of course.  So he had a lot of different little things going.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, a tombstone maker.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, and they were needed because there are so many unmarked graves in rural areas, and without them, without a head or stone, you know, we wouldn't know where the people have been laid to rest.  So it was a needed business, so to speak.
Story_ID: 37263
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, tell me about your first year going to college [Tougaloo College, Jackson, Mississippi]?  And you're a little younger than everybody else--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I know.
Speaker 1: So tell me about that.  I mean how was that transition for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I stayed at home, which was, I guess, an easy transition.
Speaker 1: So you drove back and forth each day?
Speaker 2: Drove back and from because Tougaloo [College] was only like six miles from my house, from my home.  It's right in, well, it's on the border, on the street of Hines County and Madison County [Mississippi].  And I live in Madison County, so it was right there.  And then my mom [Carrie Lena Cotten] went to Tougaloo, so she knew a lot of people, and by me going there for two or three years before, or three or four years before I actually became a student, I knew a lot of people too.  So it was basically going to the music building and taking classes other places, but coming back to the music building and practices.  But the first year was really smooth.  I was able to even test out of some classes, math--so I ended up taking calculus right away.  And I tested out of primary English or the first English, whatever.  So it went well.  I remember my, I think it was like my sophomore year.  So I tried to change my major, and my department chair, advisor, you know, I said, okay, I--you know, he was like you're gonna do what, you know.  But they couldn't stop, right.  He knew that I wouldn't last.  So I changed it I think to accounting or something.  If it had been math, I probably would have stayed.  But it was accounting, and ended up changing it back, and they said, yeah, I knew, I knew you weren't gonna stay there, you know, I wasn't gonna last.  So I had a double major, music and psychology.  And I ended up teaching students, I think maybe my senior year or junior year.  So I had students to come from the outside, children, on campus for lessons.  So I really enjoyed that and gave a recital for them in the chapel, a very beautiful, historic chapel at Tougaloo College.
Speaker 1: Why was psychology your minor?
Speaker 2: My second major, a second major.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I had a full major.  It was because I was thinking what do I want to do with music, and the only thing that sort of appealed to me was music therapy.  So I had anticipated going into a master's [degree] music therapy program.  And I did go and receive a master's degree in music therapy from Hahnemann University in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 37264
Speaker 1: Okay, you were talking about--
Speaker 2: Dr. [Ben] Bailey.
Speaker 1: Dr. Bailey.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. Bailey was our department chair.  Tougaloo [College; Jackson, Mississippi] itself, was very nurturing, very, of course, so small.  Everybody knows everybody.  But the opportunities were just enormous for us.  Well, I mentioned Dr. Bailey and that I knew him, of course, before I went to Tougaloo, so he was sort of like my godfather or uncle or something, you know, overseeing my program.  He was the one who said he knew that I would not last in a different department or with a different major.  But he, he was very nurturing.  Whatever opportunity became available or became available or that he thought was out there, he would find it and help you pursue it.  And that was not only true of him, but of all of the teachers.  My mom [Carrie Lena Cotten], I mentioned, went to Tougaloo.  My daughter also went to Tougaloo, so we are three generations there.  And if I knew where my grandfather received his education, I think it would have something to do with Tougaloo, I really do because there must have been some kind of traveling or extension of the program available to people in the neighboring area.  But while I was at Tougaloo, I also received the opportunity to travel to Ghana, West Africa.  So that was my first experience, and that was the year, the summer between my junior and senior year.  And at Tougaloo at that time, everybody had to do a senior paper, research paper, at least everybody in my department.  (Laughter) And I think that was true all over.  So I proposed to research the traditional music of Ghana, West Africa.  And it was just a life-changing experience because I went with two other students from Tougaloo, and we were there for two months, eight weeks.  It was called sort of like the study travel, exchange program because there were students also who came to Tougaloo from different parts of Africa, maybe Ghana.  I'm not really sure exactly if they came from the University of Ghana because--of Accra [Ghana] where I was because there are different universities in Ghana.  But just fell in love with the culture, and when I was there, I was thinking, wait did I see him yesterday or last week?  Did I see him yesterday here in Ghana or last week in Mississippi because similarities, speech, body, gestures, so similar to the people that I knew in, the people who I knew in Mississippi.  And we had a professor from Tougaloo who traveled with us.  She was not with us all the time.  But she took the flight over with us and then ended up leaving going someplace else.  And when I shared this with her, she said, well, you know, they're your uncles.  Those are your aunts, you know, your cousins.  So I ended up going back to Ghana thirty years later exactly, 2006, and continued my research on African music because my book that's coming out in October is on Congo Square here in New Orleans [Louisiana].  So the experience that I had through Tougaloo really set me up so to speak, for what I have, what has become my passion and I believe, connected to my purpose in life.  And so I have researched the Congo Square here in New Orleans for, probably twelve years or so, off and on because I work full time and had kids, reared a family and all of that.  But this will be the first book on Congo Square, totally dedicated to the history of Congo Square.
Story_ID: 37265
Speaker 1: What was it about that experience, I mean what did you see that really made you say, "Wow, this is something."  Tell me, you were researching the music.  What did you find there?
Speaker 2: I found the carryovers that we experience, that we have in Mississippi and in New Orleans [Louisiana], in the United States.  I saw them there because I went looking for something else, and I found Mississippi.  You know, I found--I came back, and was like, oh, we saw that there.  There were just, and it's so prevalent in the church, the music that we have in our church, the clapping, the calling and response, the talking back, the interaction, you know, it's definitely African cultural practices that are carried over.  And I think because the church was so isolated and incubated, so to speak, we did not have the outside influences that we have like in the schools and other parts of our culture that we retained many of the African traits that were brought in, like the shouting.  The ring shout which was very popular on the Carolina coast and Georgia sea coast, we did not have that kind of format where we did the ring shouts in Mississippi, but we did have the shout and the individual shouting.
Speaker 1: You said the ring shouts.  What do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: Ring shout.  It's a form of a dance, but it was a--spiritual dance, a religious dance that was carried on in the hush harbors that I talk about and the secret praying grounds, but in North Carolina, it was carried on also in--I mean South Carolina, and probably North too, in their prayer houses.  And so it sort of lingered there, and is associated more with that area, long term, than in other areas.  But it did happen in other places.  So it's actually the shouting, but it's a group shouting, where you become almost entranced.  And you're dancing in a circle, and you don't cross your feet, you know.  You shuffle or slide to the side, so to speak, but you're clapping and singing at the same time.  But it's religious.  And so in Congo Square, there were similar cultural practices in that the Africans dance in circles.  And when they moved in circles, they moved counter clockwise, you know, same characteristics that you see in so many places, so many states.  And we know about these through the slave narratives.  We know about these through reports that travelers have given travelers' reports.  And so when we put them together, we see that, that the Africans really perpetuated their cultures wherever they went, you know, their cultural practices.  They continued them.

Speaker 1: When you came back from Ghana, you went--what year were you in?
Speaker 2: I went in '76 [1976], the summer was 1976.
Speaker 1: And what level were you at in school?
Speaker 2: In college [Tougaloo College; Jackson, Mississippi], it was between my junior and senior year, right before my senior year.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your senior year?
Speaker 2: Well, senior year, then I wrote the paper [research paper on the traditional music of Ghana, West Africa] (laughter), and that was a really, what I would say, divided, so to speak, experience because I also had to perform an hour of classical music because I was a piano major.  But my paper was on traditional African music.  And you know which one I ended up preferring, traditional African music.  And so after my senior recital, I did not play the piano for a long, long time.  I went into music therapy, but for music therapy, I didn't really have to perform.  It's not a performance-based profession.  So it was about getting other people to play and using the music to help, help the client, so to speak.  So performance was out, and when I moved to New Orleans [Louisiana], I really became involved in the culture here, and Congo Square was here so that helped me get back into my research.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that was years later, not right after you graduated from Tougaloo?
Speaker 2: Well, not that many years later, maybe three years later, three or four years later.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well--
Speaker 2: --but (unclear) later.
Speaker 1: --when you graduated, this was in seventy--
Speaker 2: Seven [1977].
Speaker 1: --seven [1977]?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 37267
Speaker 1: So what happened after you graduated [from Tougaloo College; Jackson, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: I went to college, went to graduate school in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Hahnemann [University].
Speaker 1: What school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Hahnemann University and Hospital.  It's really a medical school with a graduate school for health allied professions, and so one of the graduate programs was creative arts therapy.  And in that program, you could specialize in visual arts, music or dance, movement.  And my specialty was music.  So you don't take any applied music or dance or visual arts lessons there.  You bring your skills with you and you learn the psychology, and how to apply the two.  So my program was very analytically based, and we took seminars with other health professionals like graduate students in mental health or psychology.  We even took a seminar with medical students because it, like I say, it's a hospital.  It doesn't have a campus.  So, and then we applied that to our artistic form, to the music.  We worked in hospitals, we worked in mental health settings, worked in children's homes, and we had to do rotations in all of those.  And then the last year--it was a two-year program, uninterrupted.  It had to be two, full-time years, two years full time.  The last year you worked in the setting that you would write your thesis, conduct your research for your thesis.
Speaker 1: And when you say "working," tell me what it was for you to go to work, and how did you apply this to your clients or patients?
Speaker 2: Um-hum--
Speaker 1: I wanna understand.
Speaker 2: Understand music therapy?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So one example would be if I were to have a keyboard or a piano, and I have the client play with me on the piano, then I would structure it so that that client did not have to know the notes or any kind of theory to play.  So it was called, sort of like improvisation/.  And from that improvisation, I could tell the resistance, I could tell whether, you know, the relationship was becoming more cordial or they were still resisting or relaxing or playing.  You know, the play back and forth was their call and response, was their interaction.  Was I always the leader?  Did he take leadership sometime?  You know, or when I say changed the dynamics, did he change as well?  Did he respond to me or did he, was it sort of like a monotone response on his part?  Was he continuing, continuing in the same, same thing and not responding to me at all?  So it's almost like a nonverbal conversation that goes on.  And so, say if that's the baseline, if next week or next session, we did something very similar, did it change?  Is he becoming more sociable with me or not?  So, things like that.
Speaker 1: What type of patients are these?  I mean do they have an illness or--
Speaker 2: Sometimes, well, it depends--
Speaker 1: I mean what, is it a mental illness?
Speaker 2: Well, the students who I ended up working with, I ended up specializing with children.  And it was a children's home, so to speak.  It's called Southern Children's Home or something like that.  So these were students who were, had behavior problems, had family problems, had emotional problems.  And so that is an activity that I would do with them, the improvisation and I worked with students individually, and I worked with them in groups.  So we had some group sessions.  Something may have been similar, something may have changed.  It just depends on who's there because each session is tailored for the needs of the population, right.  So I, there were some students who I probably couldn't do an improvisation with, you know, we would have to do something else.
Speaker 1: So after two years--is it two years or three years?
Speaker 2: Two-year program.
Speaker 1: Two-year program, and your thesis was on--
Speaker 2: It was, oh, God, behavior--something about controlling behavior or changing behavior or something, the impact of this music on behavior.  So I ended up staying at Southern Home for a year to work, my work, because of my thesis and my work with that population for the whole year.  And after the year, I returned to Mississippi for marriage, and then I came here the next day to New Orleans [Louisiana].  So I've been here since then.
Story_ID: 37268
Speaker 1: Tell me about your marriage?
Speaker 2: Oh, I married Melvin Ira Evans, Jr., who I knew growing up in high school, but here again, was, it was a distant relationship because he was in Jackson, Mississippi.  So when we married, he was in the [U.S.] Navy.  He was an officer in the Navy and stationed here in New Orleans [Louisiana], actually across the river at, at the Naval base in Algiers [Louisiana].  And so we, I've lived in Algiers ever since (laughter), not on the Naval base.  We never lived on the base actually.  We always had off-base housing.
Speaker 1: So you came back and you got married, and you moved to New Orleans.  So tell me what happens next?
Speaker 2: Well, we had two children (laughter).  I have two children, and then we ended up divorcing.  But my two children, the oldest is a daughter who's now twenty-eight [years old].
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Akita, A-K-I-T-A, Carrie, she has my mom's name, as her middle name, Evans.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --what does she do?
Speaker 2: Well, she's a medical doctor.  She's finishing up her residency this month, end of this month and in family practice and family--yeah, she's in family practice.  And then she will go to Harvard [University] to receive a Masters in Public Health.  But she wants to--well, she's engaged.  And she'll marry before the year is over because she doesn't want to move back home and then, where he is, so she wants to make one more move when she leaves Boston [Massachusetts].  So we're planning her wedding right now as well as my book coming out.  So I have a lot going on.
Speaker 1: So, okay, so after you marry and this was in what year?
Speaker 2: 1980.  And I have a son.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his name is Melvin Ira Evans III.  And he is, he lives in Jackson [Mississippi] now.  He went to Jackson State [University], where his dad went and where his granddaddy taught for over thirty years.  And then he married before he finished college, to a Jacksonian as well.  She's, actually, she still is there.  She's in a Ph.D. program in clinical psych [psychology].  And they have one child, my only grandchild, who's three years old, Mikel Gracie Evans.
Story_ID: 37269
Speaker 1: So now that you have your family, what happens next in your life as far as work or school?
Speaker 2: Well, right when Melvin [Ira Evans, III; Evans' son] went off to college, my first book was released.
Speaker 1: We're in 1980.
Speaker 2: Oh, I thought you said now that you're married (laughter).
Speaker 1: You were already--yeah, you got married.  You said you got married in 1980.
Speaker 2: I thought this was after Melvin went to college and everything (laughter), no, no, okay.
Speaker 1: No, no, we're in 1980.
Speaker 2: Okay, backtrack.
Speaker 1: What happens after 1980?
Speaker 2: After 1980, the children were born, my first was born in '81 [1981], Akita [Carrie Evans], and then Melvin in '83 [1983], yes.
Speaker 1: And when do you go back to work in Jefferson Parish Public Schools?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't start in Jefferson Parish until '85 [1985].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So for four years, I worked in Juvenile Court Services, with the same type students I worked with in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], at Southern Home for Children.  I carried on my music therapy background.  My work with them was very similar.  I coordinated an after-school program so to speak.  And then after four years of that, I went into the public school system where I became an artist, integrating the academics with the art form, you know, class from artists.  That was very novel back then, but now it is "the" thing that's happening, integrated arts is a big move now.  So what we did when we went into those schools in '85 [1985] through whatever year I left the classroom, on a daily basis, was we created activities that reinforced what the teachers did in the classroom.  So if they were teaching verbs, and then I would come up with a song, create a song or create an activity that would get the kids involved.  So instead of just talking about or reading verbs or circling them on a paper, they got up and actually did the verbs, and sang about them.  It was almost like 'Sesame Street', you know, and you're on stage when you go into the classroom.  I didn't sit down, you know, the whole day because I would move from one class to the other, and you know, kids will be hyped.  But they would learn because that was a way of engaging them.  And now, it's become, like I say, a really big program in education.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then you did this for how many years, four years?
Speaker 2: I worked as an artist in the classroom for about four years, and then I became an artist facilitator, just like administrator in this school which is where I am now.
Story_ID: 37270
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me, explain to me what your position [artist facilitator] requires you to do?
Speaker 2: Now?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Now, I coordinate artists who do that type work.  And I write grants to bring them into the schools.  And that means I do, write the grants, direct the grants, get them paid, get them--get the supplies that they need and all of that.  And in writing the grants, I have to write the programs for them.  So if I want a visual artist to come in, I have to write exactly what the artist will do, what goals will be accomplished, what standards and benchmark will be met.  So I create the programs, find the funding, write the grants and carry through.  I also plan teacher workshops for the arts and arrange them.  And there's something called "Very Special Arts" which is an international concept of integrating or bring the arts to the disabled population.  So, and for me, it would be the school-age children, but Very Special Arts also involves adults.  So I coordinate Very Special Arts in our school system first of all.
Story_ID: 37271
Speaker 1: Tell me about your Fulbright Scholarships.
Speaker 2: Well, those were independent activities.  I do a lot of independent work, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell me about it?
Speaker 2: My work really begins when I end my school day (laughter).  So for those Fulbright's, I applied to go with a group of teachers to these different places.  But you have to write a proposal that you will follow through on, and the proposal usually involves showing how you will integrate what you have learned into a curriculum back in your hometown, in your home state or district for the students.  So although I worked in Jefferson Parish [Louisiana], my Fulbright's were always in connection with Orleans Parish schools.  I did a lot of work in Orleans before Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] threw what was called the African Studies and Cultural Unit, and that unit was headed by Dr. Clyde Robertson.  So I wrote curriculum for him, and I did teach-in services.  And part of that curriculum was written when we went on these trips, so to speak.
Speaker 1: And where were your trips to?
Speaker 2: Okay, the first one was to Zimbabwe, 1995.  And the second one was to South Africa in 2000.  And then I went on a Japan program that--it was called a Fulbright as well, but it wasn't the same type set up because it, this was sponsored through the Japanese Embassy but for American teachers.  And I went there--I can't remember the year.  But it was after 2000, maybe like 2004 or something like that.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your experience going to Zimbabwe first as the first trip and just tell me about the experience?
Speaker 2: Really awesome.  We were to--our hope for us was to just see what progress had been made since Apartheid--well, was it?  No, Apartheid was--since independence.  It was once Rhodesia, and so we studied the--we had lectures about different aspects of life in Zimbabwe.  So someone came to lecture about the life of women.  Someone came to lecture about the politics.  And we ended up meeting [Robert] Mugabe who was, who still is, the president, the first president after independence, and he remains the first president of Zimbabwe.  And someone came to talk about, you know, school, education, different aspects of the culture.  So it was very intense in that we had lectures almost every day, and we traveled to different parts of the country.  But we also had to do work.  We had to actually set aside time to work on our individual projects or tasks that had been, that we had--our proposals that we had presented and had been accepted.  So, it was a full four and a half weeks.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then South Africa?
Speaker 2: South Africa was very similar because the same person headed both of these.  Dr. Cassandra Murphy wrote both projects for this, for the teachers.  And so it was always to learn about the country, especially if you had a proposal that involved you--that you learn or go and explore or research some area that was not on the main itinerary.  You had to fulfill your needs in order to get your project done.  So it was always, though, to create some work that would be implemented once you returned to your school district.  And I know for Zimbabwe, I looked at symbols of their country, you know, what is, what the different symbols like the Zimbird (ph.), the bird.  It's very, very popular in Zimbabwe.  So I concentrated my activities around their symbols of the country.  Like we have symbols in the United States, symbols of freedom.  And then what were their symbols that somebody would see and recognize immediately associate and recognize with Zimbabwe, their flag, you know.  And then for South Africa, we looked closely at Apartheid, and I looked at the songs and the literature of Apartheid and compared it with our freedom songs and our freedom poetry, songs about segregation in the South.  So I looked at, say we, for segregation, what poems were there that students would read, Langston Hughes and Margaret Walker Alexander, and what were our freedom songs.  And then for them, I looked at their literature and songs that came out of their Apartheid struggle for freedom, strong for the end of Apartheid.
Speaker 1: And Japan?
Speaker 2: Japan, I looked at visual arts, so when I came back from Japan, I had a workshop of teachers.  And we had different stations where teachers would explore the culture through visual arts, like Ghataku (ph.) and we had print making--different kinds of printing making.  That was one, looked at artifacts that I brought back and the clothing that I brought back.  So it was like a workshop that explored different aspects of the culture.
Story_ID: 37272
Speaker 1: When did you decide to write your first book?
Speaker 2: Oh, I decided to write my first, I first started off with poetry, and I know the first manuscript that I attempted to write was based on my aunt who--was that the first one?  I think that was the first one, who was like my grandmother [Geraldine Foster Cotten].  She kept my grandfather's [Edward David Cotten] home, the Cotten home, house.  Do you remember me talking about the land?  And as, when I grew up, I thought that she was my grandmother because she lived there with my grandfather.  And, you know, we just--she just had the presence of a grandmother, you know, always accepting, and always had food for you, teacakes and milk.  It was clabbered milk, but it was, you know, what we knew.
Speaker 1: It was what kind of milk?
Speaker 2: Clabbered milk.  Now, I don't know--well, she milked cows, right?  So for clabbered milk, you don't put it in the refrigerator.  And it develops clabber, I guess, is what it's called.  But, you know, I ate it all my life, and then when I went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and I started eating yogurt, I said, you know, this is clabbered milk.  So it's basically yogurt.  But she always had cake or either teacakes for us to eat along with it.  So, she was the grandmother figure to me.  And when I found out that she had cancer, and I wanted to write about her.  I wanted to write something.  And so I started writing something about her teacakes.  And she did read my draft, one or two drafts, but, you know, that book has not developed yet.  And I believe it will, you know, but I did write poems about her.  As a matter of fact, one was published in her funeral program, maybe two.  Yeah, one was published in her funeral program, and I did a separate tribute to her on her, at her funeral.  And then at my uncle's funeral, who's my oldest uncle on that side, I heard about the bus because, see, in rural Mississippi, when there's a funeral, there is a program.  But there's also a section on the program where people whose names are not on program can get up and say something (laughter).  So, during that time period, when anybody could get up and talk and make a tribute, someone said, well, I would like to thank Mr. Cotten for bringing the first school bus to the colored children.  And so I started asking on the way to the graveyard, what about this school bus, you know?  Tell me about the bus, riding in the car with my brother [Ray Williams], who is totally different from me.  You can already know because he was Stokely [Carmichael], right?  And so he knows and socializes and talks to everybody, quite different from me.  And he goes, you don't know nothing.  That bus stayed in the pasture for years, you know.  We just cut it up for scrap metal a couple of years ago.  So, okay, the bus stayed there until I became interested in it, right?  And then I started interviewing my relatives about this bus, you know.  Who, why, how, you know, how did he get it, when, and all of that.  And so I developed the storyline, and it was called "The Bus for Us."
Story_ID: 37273
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell us about the bus?
Speaker 2: The bus, the story about the bus.  So I continued to ask my relatives, interviewed them and sometimes they'd say, you're still working on that, you know?  Yes.  And I will continue working on this because it was a story about not only my uncle who purchased the bus, but it was about the family, about community, about church.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me the story.
Speaker 2: Tell you the story.  So in real life, my cousin, Mabel Jean, had to walk miles and miles to the school in Madison [Mississippi], Madison Rosenwald or she could walk to the one-room schoolhouse at the church.  But her mom, of course, wanted her to have the better education because at Madison Rosenwald there were four rooms, four teachers.  And so you got more applied lesson or appropriate lessons for your age group.  But she was very young, and it was too far for her to walk.  So she approached my uncle whose name was Clifton Cotten.  We called him Uncle Smith, right?  She approached him because he was very business minded, just like his father, my grandfather, Ed [David] Cotten.  So Smith owned lots of land, and actually, at his funeral, someone else made a tribute that he was their bank because in the days when they could not go downtown or in town to borrow money from the bank, they could come to him and sit under his tree and cut a deal with him.  So he was that type person.  He owned land.  He was very savvy.  So she went to him to ask him about getting a bus for the children.  And I'm sure he didn't answer her right away.  His term was "I'll figure on it, and I'll be figuring on it."  So we're thinking, he's thinking about it?  No, he's probably thinking money, you know, figuring (laughter) actually, money because he was that type person.  So she, in the end, he said, well, I will, I will buy the bus, but parents will have to support me.  They'll have to pay for the children to ride.  Now, of course, they were already paying taxes, but this was segregation.  They did not have a bus to ride.  And so this was in 1949.  He purchased an old bus that was once used by the white school.  But it broke down right away.  It was no good.  So then he purchased the chasse of a truck.  Now, the chasse is the frame underneath that has a motor.  So he took the cab of the bus, the yellow part off.  And he put the cab onto the new chasse of a truck, but then there was no floor.  And so people from the community came together.  He was not a carpenter.  He was a farmer.  And so carpenters and other people came together, built the floor, and then there were no seats in the bus anymore.  So they made benches, one on each side down the row.  And later on, after the book was published, my uncle said, oh, you know what else?  We had a tree stump right here in the middle.  Well, you didn't tell me that.  So that's not in the book.  But he said there was a tree stump, and so kids could sit around the tree stump in the middle.  It added more seating to the bus.  Well, this was in '49 [1949], and then the school board, white people saw that he was doing something for himself, and--for the people, for the community.  And, of course, people had to pay.  They had to pay .05 cents.  And how did they get the money?  They stayed longer in the cotton field, you know.  Some people agreed to iron more clothes, you know, take another wash load, another wash family--wash for another family or something for their kids to ride the bus.  So then when the school system stepped in the next year, they said, well, we'll pay you to run your bus, to pick up the students.  And if you have another bus, we'll pay you for two buses.  So my uncle, who lived the longest, Joe, who was named after his grandfather, Joe Foster, purchased a bus as well.  And they were paid--I forgot how much money they were paid by the school system.  But, you know, with anything, there comes stipulations, right?  And the stipulation was that they could not pick up the elementary-aged students.  They could only carry the high school students, well, high, sixth, seventh and eighth graders who were going in town to that four-room schoolhouse.  See, the one-room school houses that were at the churches were for like first through sixth or something like that, first through fifth.  And they were close enough for people to walk, right?  So when you go into town, that school was first through eighth grade, but those sixth, seventh and eighth graders, grades were not offered at those other schools.  And so they were paid to take those older kids into town, meaning that they had to pass up these little kids if they wanted to go into town or if they were walking to town or those little kids had to go to the one-room schoolhouse, which was less desirable.  So what do you do? You know, and I've, you know, questioned, you know, why did they take this offer?  Why did they do this?
Story_ID: 37274
Speaker 1: And in my mind--I couldn't ask my oldest uncle, and I don't know if I had this question for my--yeah, I did pose this to my, my youngest uncle.  And he was saying that they just felt that this would give those other kids more opportunity too, to get the eighth education, you know.  But then there were some people who were interviewed who said that their mom would not let them ride, sixth, seventh and eighth graders, ride because if my little one can't ride, then the older ones are not gonna ride.  And they're gonna all walk together (laughter).  So, you see the Catch 22 that they were in, you know, being presented this, what some would think of as an upward opportunity, but really, was it really, you know.  So then this happened for two years, and the third year after that--well, it would be the fourth year.  The first year, they had their own bus.  For two years, those buses were supplemented, so to speak.  And then the next year, the school system provided buses for the African American students.  Now, when I went to the school system to look at the records, they said that the county offered my uncles contracts to drive the buses, the school systems' buses.  My uncles said they did not offer them the contracts.  But their buses were no longer in use, of course, because the school system at that point provided buses for them.  So when I, you know, heard this story, I had to write it because, you know, when my uncle said, in 1949, when he purchased that first bus, that the parents would have to support him, the church became involved because her--Mabel Jean's mom, went to the church.  That was where everybody met.  And that's where she got the support that she needed to give him the go-ahead to pursue this, this endeavor.  And so the church was involved.  The community, families, all of these people, to help, you know, their children get a better education.  Now, when I wrote the story as a children's book, I had to have a child as the heroine.  And so Mabel Jean becomes the heroine.  She goes around asking, and she ends up asking Uncle--in that case, it was her cousin, Smith, my Uncle Smith, for the bus.  And then other things fall in.  So it's historical fiction.  It's based on facts.  But some things have been turned to make it child friendly, and to make it a children's story.
Speaker 2: Did the school system pay your uncle more than the .05 cents per child?
Speaker 1: Oh--well, we don't know what the .05 cents would have been, depending on how many children, right?  But he, there was a set fee.  And actually, that's in my children's, in my author's notes at the back of the book.  So I do have that information.  I just don't remember exactly the fee, yeah, right now, but they did pay him.
Speaker 2: So do you think that he accepted it because no longer would the parents have to come up with the money for their children to ride?
Speaker 1: No, that's not why, no.  No, he--
Speaker 2: Do you know why?
Speaker 1: No, I don't, I'm pretty sure that's not.  He didn't accept it because they wouldn't have to pay because those little children who were walking--Mabel Jean still couldn't ride, right, because she was younger than sixth grade, and she was going into town to the four-room schoolhouse.  So I, no, I think that they paid because they felt that it was a way to get these kids more educated, the eighth--the higher level because there were still opportunities for them to go to the one-room schoolhouse, the majority of the students.  They could still go, and then he would take the ones into town to this one school because they were coming from different areas outside that really was too far for them to walk.  So this would give them a greater chance of going to eighth grade or getting to eighth grade because not that many children went to eighth grade.  Not that many children went on.  The boys, in particularly, had to drop out and work, you know.
Story_ID: 37275
Speaker 1: And when you were raising your children [Melvin Ira Evans, III and Akita Carrie Evans], there probably were not a lot of African American story, children's books?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And as you were reading stories to your children, did you ever think at that time that you should write children's books?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  I started writing them with them (laughter).  We wrote books together.  And that was really one of the incentives, I guess, one of the things that drew me into writing children's books because it, they read profusely, every night, like three or four books.  And I kept looking for books for them to read, you know, like searching for African American characters.  And so we started developing our own, writing stories about themselves, first, putting photographs, having them sketch little scenes or whatever.  And I remember one time we, my son and I, with children, all of 'em, we were walking through this exhibit, ALA, American Library Association or IRA, International Reading Association.  Something had come to town, and we were reading through, going through all these exhibits and all these books where they had.  My son said, well, didn't you write a book (laughter).  I said, yes.  Well, where is it, you know, (unclear).  Not for this, not here, I haven't taken the next step.  Well, you need to take the next step.  So I remember him telling me that, and it just stuck in my mind that I really need to pursue this.  And then started writing.  So the first story was about my aunt.  And then I started this story about the bus, and I never knew which one would get published first.
Speaker 1: What was the story about your aunt?
Speaker 2: The teacake story.
Story_ID: 37276
Speaker 1: So it happened that my children [Melvin Ira Evans, III and Akita Carrie Evans] were getting ready, I was trying to send them to--I sent them to Africa when they were in high school, and then I also--well, middle and high school.  And then I also sent them to Europe.  So for one of those, as a fundraiser, I said, you know what?  I'm not going to Dillard's or Macy's [stores] and get a job to earn extra money to send them to this trip.  I'm gonna sell one of my books and send them.  So I created these queries, which is a process you go through when you're submitting books, you know, to publishers.  And I sent out all of these manuscripts, to all of these publishers.  And I really thought I had gotten all of the rejection letters back, you know (laughter).  You mark off, reject, rejected.  And it was a year later probably, I received a letter from Albert Whitman which is the company that published my first book, and saying, you know, we found this, this manuscript.  We thought we had contacted you.  We're interested in it.  Are you still interested in getting it published?  And I know what happened.  I think the editor was leaving and cleaning off her desk, and she probably found it in a pile because when I responded, the editor to whom I had written earlier was not there any longer.  So I had to send it to someone else, and so it's history.  That was my first book to get published.  I'm really glad because it's my family's story.
Speaker 2: Were there many changes that you had to do to the book or did they basically leave it the way it was?
Speaker 1: It's a good question.  It changed so much, I really can't tell you if they (laughter) were the ones who made the changes or I because every time I received a rejection slip, I would change the person or, you know, something about it, the character's name or something.  Pretty much I left the characters' names, but changed something.  Now, they did change the title because I had this cute title, rhymed and everything "A Bus for Us."  And I received a phone call because, you know, once you sign a contract, you think you're done.  You are not done.  And so the editor said, "Freddi, we just had our title meeting."  I mean, you have so many meetings you have names like that.  And she said, and although we think "A Bus for Us" is really in--it entails, it tells what the story is about, we think it's too "Dr. Seuss-ish," and your book is much too serious for that.  And the title that we've come up with is, "A Bus of Our Own."  Now, think about it, you know, because once you sign the contract, I guess you are not bound to make the changes that they want because they try to get you to make all the changes they have to have before you sign the contract.  But I agreed, you know, it was a much more sophisticated title, and I can always look back and see things that I wrote before it will have "A Bus for Us" somewhere in it, you know, if somebody says something, it'll--somebody who knows the story from a long time ago before it was published.  They said, oh, yeah, she wrote "A Bus for Us," you know.  But that was one of the things that they changed.  Oh, and another thing that they changed is, remember, in real life, my uncle purchased a chasse of a truck and placed the cab onto the chasse.  Well, the editor felt that that would be too difficult for students to understand.  They don't, won't know what a chasse is, and then it would also be a challenge for the illustrator.  And so they suggested that we just show two buses.  So in the, in the children's book, there are two buses that he uses.  And he takes the bus, best parts of the two buses and puts them together to make one good bus.

Speaker 1: When does your second book take form?
Speaker 2: The second book is set here in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And--
Speaker 1: What's the title?
Speaker 2: The title is 'The Battle of New Orleans: The Drummer's Story'.  The drummer for the Battle of New Orleans was a man of African descent, Jordan Noble.  And I first ran across his drum in the Cabildo, which is the [Louisiana] state museum in the heart of New Orleans [Louisiana], in the French Quarter.  And because I'm a musician, I'm drawn to instruments, I guess, but I was also taken by the fact they said, "colored veteran" of Battle of New Orleans, you know, War of 1812.  So, of course, I wanted to know more about that, but couldn't find that much; could find a lot about the Battle of New Orleans, but not a lot about the drummer, who was key.  You know, he was Andrew Jackson's right man.  He served as his, like servant, because drummers back then or musicians were like the captains or, what was he, the general's servant.  He had to stay right next to him to give all of his commands to his soldiers.  And he was still enslaved at that time.  I didn't find that out until years later though because that's not readily available that he was enslaved.  So anyway, I did work on that.  And the book then is in Jordan's voice, so to speak.  You know, he's telling about what he did during the Battle of New Orleans.  So the facts are there, but I created a fictional character, the little boy to whom he's telling the story.  So Jordan Noble, after the Battle of New Orleans, the War of 1812, went on to serve in three more American wars.  So he was a veteran of four.  That's amazing.  You know, he was very patriotic, considering the fact that he was still enslaved when he served in some of them, at least one of them.  So, after or between wars or his engagements, he had what's called a "Drum and Fife Corps," a band.  And, you know, in New Orleans, we have a lot of parades.  So he paraded a lot in the streets.  But he was not invited to participate in the parade that celebrated the victory of the Battle of New Orleans until like thirty-five years later because it was segregated.  He was an African descendant.  Even if he had gained his freedom by then, he still was not able to because there were free people of color who fought, who were not able to participate.  So in 1851, he was allowed to participate and became, of course, the hit of the parade.  And after that he marched every year with his other veterans of color, so to speak.  And so my story takes place during one of those parades.  And this little boy sees him and hears his drums, intrigued by it, and he wants to beat it, and he pretends he's beating it.  And when he finally sees Jordan sit to rest, he goes up and say, "May I beat your drum?"  He says, well, yeah, this is a special drum.  And he takes him through the history of why it's special.  And he says, this is a drum that I played in the battle.  So when reading the book, the students get a chance to hear about the Battle of New Orleans, from his standpoint, from the drummer.  And, of course, the boy plays in the end (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what year was that published?
Speaker 2: That was published in 2005, the year of Katrina [Hurricane Katrina].
Story_ID: 37278
Speaker 1: Now, that's a devastating time.  Let's put a pin in the publishing of your books and talk about--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --Katrina.
Speaker 2: Well, I evacuated to Madison [Mississippi] and took four people with me.
Speaker 1: Tell me from the beginning, you were watching it on TV.  When did you decide to really--
Speaker 2: I believe when--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --evacuate?  Did you think that you would be coming back and finding everything okay?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, 'cause we have always done that, you know (laughter).  We always come back--
Speaker 1: Okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --but what I did take was my computer and my disks because Kulumba Asalam (ph.) who is my mentor--actually, when I started with Kulumba, going to his group called 'Normal Literacy Society' [ph.], I was not a writer.  He was the first person that actually called me a writer.  And I was like, okay, let me see if I can make this true, make this happen.  But, of course, he checked on people.  And he called around, and he said, take this because actually, my book on Congo Square was slated to come out in 2005, through his press.  He has a press "Runagate" [ph.].  And so we were planning on publishing this book and done a lot of editing and everything.  And so he said, take everything with you, take this book.  Don't--if you don't take anything else, take this book.  So I took my computer, took it down, apart, all of my disk and a friend called me and said, "Freddi, I know you're leaving.  Can I go with you?"  And I say, yes.  So she, when I went to pick her up, she had her daughter, but her husband was New Orleanian.  He was not leaving.  You know, I'm waiting to see--it's gonna turn.  I'm waiting to see.  So, okay.  Are you sure you don't want to stay?  So then, the first person though who was going with me was my editor.  Can you believe, we were planning to work on this book in Madison.  This is a perfect time for, oh, yeah, we can work on it.  We were doing our index, you know, we--that had gone down to the index.  And so we had a little card system and everything.  And so there were three of--that means there were three of them with me, the editor, my friend and her daughter, heading up to Mississippi.  Because other people were coming, I dropped my computer, the hard drive, off, put it up in her attic, all right.  But I still had my disks and everything.  So I was safe.  And I carried them with me every day anyway.  I mean I really had become a writer by then.  So when we got there, her husband called and said, you know what?  I don't think it's gonna turn.  Can I come up there too?  And I said, sure, 'cause we were at my brother's house, my oldest brother, right.  And I said, go by and get Melvin [Ira Evans, Jr.], who is my ex-husband.  So, where is Melvin?  I said, okay, I'll give you his phone number because he was, he's disabled and lived in an area that was really devastated.  I mean water was up to the top of his van.  And I had called him several times saying, you know, you need to get out.  Do you wanna go with me?  No, I don't wanna--I'm gonna just stay.  I said, well, at least go to the Superdome because that's where the disabled people, the sick people are going, you know, go to the Superdome.  Get a taxi now to get there before the taxi's stop running.  Would not do it; called his mom, you know, I can't get Melvin to leave, you know.  She said, well, you did the best you can.  So anyway, I sent him to get Melvin and he did come with him.  You know, and they say, oh, you saved his life (laughter), you know, this type thing.  But, so we ended up having four additional people, meaning five, and all of us were vegetarians in rural Mississippi.  That is unheard from, of, you know, because meat is like the center of every meal.  So my sister-in-law who was a storyteller, national, you know, storyteller--actually, she does international storytelling.
Speaker 1: What is her name?
Speaker 2: Diane Williams, Diane Williams, e-mailed her friends.  I have these four vegetarians (laughter) in the house.  Can you all please help?  And for at least ten days or more, the FedEx delivery--because this is a rural area, come up delivering boxes of vegetarian stuff.  We had so much food from all over the country, vegetarian food.  And we ended up sharing it with other people because we would go to the shelters around to see who we knew, who was in town because Madison is right outside of Jackson.  And a lot of people came to, a lot of people came to Jackson, Mississippi, ran into a lot of people that we knew.  And so we would share some of the food with them.  But that was a very difficult time, sitting in front of the TV listening--you were glued.  You could not, not look, you know what I'm saying?  But every time you looked, it got worse and more depressing and bleak.
Story_ID: 37279
Speaker 1: I was in Jefferson Parish [Louisiana] as an employee, and we came back right away, like October 3rd or something like that, we were back in the schools.  But one of--the friend who went with me was a teacher in Orleans Parish, and the school system was just demolished [sic] so to speak [during Hurrican Katrina in 2005].  And then she ended up going to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] area to live with her brother and stayed there for about two years and came back like maybe a third year, and had to go into a charter school system, so lost all of her retirement, not lost it, but it stopped it.  I guess she can resume it if she goes back into the state system.  Right now, she's not in a retirement system.  So her daughter--I think one of the reasons they stayed out of town too was so that her daughter could finish school in the area where she was because she got into this really prestigious private school.  And some of the schools did that for us that, who went away.  So, yeah, it was very different.  And then the, my editor was a college professional, university professor.  She ended up not coming back.  She sold her house, and she's now in Atlanta, Dr. Paulette Perser--Dr. Paulette Richardson--I know a Paulette Perser, Dr. Paulette Richardson--Richards.  I'm sorry, Richards.
Speaker 2: So what about your home when you came back?
Speaker 1: Well, I live on the West bank which means that I did get--it doesn't mean I got damage, but I did get damage.  But it was from the wind and not the water.  So the damage that I received was because the wind blew parts of my roof, and so I had water coming in from above, and not from below.  And I think the hardest thing I lost was my piano that my parents [Carrie Lena Cotten and R.L. Williams] bought (laughter).  I told you about the piano.  I had two pianos in my house and so now I have one.  And my kitchen because part of the wall--the wall where part of the cabinets are was damaged.  So all of those cabinets had to come out.  That means that the whole kitchen has to come out because you have to have matching cabinets, and so, things like that.  I lived in a FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] trailer for a while.
Speaker 2: What was that like?
Speaker 1: Scary.  I really would rather sleep in my gutted out house.  So I basically cooked out of there, but I did sleep in there some days.  Some nights I had to.  But I tried to just eat in it and sleep in the back of my house that was not as damaged, more.  Even when it was gutted out, I still slept in the back.
Speaker 2: Anything else about that time you wanna share?
Speaker 1: Well, I just hope it never happens again because we had to come back to work in Jefferson in October, early October.  I think like the third.  And many times, I could not get to my home because if I didn't get in past curfew, you couldn't get in.  And then I had no friends out--one night I had to drive to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] to stay because I had no friends.  They were either not home or their homes were damaged.  I didn't have contact information or something.  I couldn't get to my own home.  It was horrible to have, to require us to come back and not have the necessary housing.  And so after that I just said, you know, I'll come back next week or whatever when more people are back.  So gradually people started coming back, and you were always happy to see people you knew.  You were running hugging them, hearing their stories.  Wherever you went, and you saw somebody you hadn't seen since Katrina, you had to hear their story.  You had to know, you know, just show that you understood and you were glad.  You had to reconnect.  I think it was a way of reconnecting with everybody.  That was it.  And places were not open.  Food was not available.  It was a really difficult time.
Story_ID: 37280
Speaker 1: So now, tell me about your next book?
Speaker 2: So my third children's book is 'Hush Harbor: Praying in Secret' and this book I dedicated to my parents [Carrie Lena Cotten and R.L. Williams] because it just connects with me and what they stood for.  It's about the secret praying grounds that enslaved Africans stole away to at night.  And in this, in the manuscript, I have the song "Steal Away to Jesus" as one of the theme songs that they used as a double message song.  And they used it as a coding, saying that there was going to be a meeting tonight.  And so in the story, they steal away to this meeting down in the Hush Harbor, despite the fact that if they got caught, they could get beaten, sold away, you know.  They could get caught down there.  They could get killed, but they were willing to risk that because Mama Akoo (ph.) who is the mother figure, the elder, is passing away.  And she's asking for them to pray for her safe journey.  And that's the best way they know how to pray is the way they, they pray in the Hush Harbor because all of their churches--and they have meetings on Sundays in their master's church or in their own church with the overseer or the owner there.  They can't worship the same way they do in the Hush Harbor because in the Hush Harbor, they're able to bring their African cultural practices into play, which is the shouting and the dancing because now, in protestant churches we're taught that dancing is a sin.  You cannot dance.  Now, and in the white churches, you know shouting is forbidden, and I received all the information I have from slave narratives, slave narratives from states across the South, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and what's amazing is that they're so similar.  They're so--and that's because they're the same people.  You know, they were just spread out different places.  But so it's based on slave narratives, and really shows you the determination they had, their level of spirituality and, you know, their faith, their hope.
Story_ID: 37281
Speaker 1: So tell me more about Hush Harbor?
Speaker 2: About Hush Harbor.  Well, in the story, the main character is Simi.  He's a little boy, about five or six years old.  And Simi is pegged by Uncle Sol as the, to be the look-out person, all right, which is a very, very serious role.  And he tells him that I've been watching you, and I see how fast you are and how sharp you are, you know.  You're fast as a hound, you know, hound dog.  And you're sharp.  And so Simi takes on this responsibility.  He goes and he climbs up in the tree to watch out for them, as they travel into the woods late at night because there are people who are opposed to them going.  They say, you know, there're patty rollers, was in the woods, and they could catch us and they could kill us.  They're out there all times of night looking for runaways.  And so if we go into the woods, they won't know us from any runaway.  They won't know that we're down there praying, you know.  This is, to them not a harm.  You know, we're not plotting anything.  But so Uncle Sol says, we're going because of Mama Akoo's (ph.) wish.  This is her last wish for us, her last request, and she's the only mama we know.  How can we deny her the opportunity or the privilege or the prayers that we have.  And so they go into the woods and Simi is up in the tree, and he's looking out.  And he talks about the pond, the still pond in the woods, and he talks about, you know, their gathering around.  Some are gathering around Uncle Sol to hear him prayer.  And he prays in this chant.  Mama, Lord, help Mama Akoo, uh-huh, help her, send her your prayers, uh-huh, you know, the sing-song that the ministers do.  And then there're others who go off, and they sing to themselves, and others go off and pray.  And then he sees his mama in a circle who's, you know, into the ring shout.  I may use that term there, but that's what it means.  And in the author's notes, you can see that's what it means.  And so she's dancing around the circle, and he sees her mom lift her hands up, and he says, it looks like she's flying away because actually those meetings were like a chariot that took them away.  It was their escape, you know.  And so, then he gets caught up, and he says, you know, I couldn't help but sing it too because he empathized with his mom.  And this was early on in the story as well, how he empathized.  He heard her singing and how joyous she became when she heard that there was going to be a meeting at night, a meeting that night, meeting in the Hush Harbor.  And so he starts to sing but just then he hears the hound dogs coming because patty rollers are in the woods.  And so he has to save them, he has to jump down, alert them to the danger.  And so they run and they tell 'em to hide and so because he was so quick and so sharp, so alert they get out of the woods in time.  But before they do, he sees someone else coming, and he has to judge whether to tell them to get out now or to wait because he doesn't know what this other person or animal or whatever could be.  He sees it.  It's not an overseer, it's not a, the master.  It's not a patty roller.  It's a runaway who he encounters.  And so he jumps down, is able to mediate, bring the man over to Uncle Sol.  And they tell him where to go and hide, you know, and hide, escape the patty rollers.  And then they get back safely to the cabins.  And he becomes a hero.  And, but Mama Akoo died that night at the same time.  And the mom tells Simi, well, she's free now, and he still cries.  I know she's free, but I'll miss her stories because she tell, had told them stories, like used to tell them stories about her home and about, you know, life.  And so they go back to the fields the next day, and some of her spirit goes back with them.  It gives them hope.  You know, it lifts them up, and that is the faith that they carried all the way through.  And they say, we'll keep stealing away and running away until real freedom comes, until we can get that real freedom.  So the children learn about the spirituality, about the hope, how they found hope, how they found inspiration and their faith and how it carried them through those hard times.
Story_ID: 37282
Speaker 1: Now, the book that you were talking about the 'Congo Square' piece, that's not a children's book?
Speaker 2: It's not a children's book (laughter).
Speaker 1: So tell me more about that?
Speaker 2: Well, Congo Square [New Orleans, Louisiana], first of all, was the gathering place for enslaved Africans.  It's not far from here, as a matter of fact.  It's in Treme.  It was a public gathering place, open space and back-up town.  When the first, when the city was first established, it was on the outskirts.  But it's one of the many gathering places that the enslaved Africans were allowed to go to during the period of enslavement, because in New Orleans, in Louisiana, there was something called the Black Codes, Code Noir.  And it was adopted in 1724 from the French.  This same code existed in Haiti, you know, in the French territories.  And one of the provisions was that no people in the colony were to work on Sundays.  It was their day to acknowledge, you know, the spirituality, that you go to church and to rest.  So this included the enslaved Africans.  And they began to consider this as their free day.  Of course, they weren't free, but, you know, this was their day of recreation.  So they were free to gather even, off and on.  But initially, they were free to just come together from different locations, different owners, different backgrounds and to sing and dance on Sundays, Sunday afternoons.  And this was true on different plantations.  One location that came to be associated with this early on is Congo Square.  And then this happened, initially happened in the French period, but this was also true during the Spanish period as well as during the American period.  And in the American period, 1817, the City Council passed an ordinance that enslaved Africans were to only gather one place, and that place was Congo Square.  So, of course, the crowds grew on Sunday afternoons in that location, into the hundreds.  Some people say thousands, men, women, children.  And they danced in circles.  Here we go back to the ring shout in circles.  And we know a lot about what happened in Congo Square because of the travelers, the traveler accounts, when people came down from the North.  They were just amazed.  You mean they're out here free, gathering, singing, dancing like this.  And so I was able to research, find as many slave--not narratives but as many traveler's accounts as I could to help paint a picture and give a picture.  And some of those accounts tell about the dances, and some tell about the songs.  So when I created the book--of course, it's changing and it's grown and grown and grown over the years, but I look at the songs.  I have a chapter on the people, who they were, where they came from in Africa, their ethnic backgrounds.  I have a chapter on religion.  I have a chapter on the market because that was a very important aspect of the gatherings.  On Sunday afternoons, they brought goods to sell.  So the majority of the sellers, the marketing, marketers were people of--who were enslaved.  And there were some free people of color too who came and who marketed, but many of them were enslaved.  And many of the people who bought the goods, the majority were enslaved.  Of course, you had some bystanders who bought, and another aspect again was the bystanders, the onlooker because this was like a tourist attraction.  So white people came out on Sunday afternoons to see the Africans dance.  And we know some of the dances.  I, and I have been able to look at the parallel cultural practices that took place in Cuba and in Haiti.  So this is something that shows a connection that New Orleans has those international sites, those countries.  In Haiti, after the Haitian revolution, a large number of Haitians migrated or fled to Cuba.  But then in 1809, they came here to New Orleans.  And so some of the things that were going on in Haiti, the dances, the gatherings reflected what happening here, some of the things that were going on there, the dance, the names of the dances, the instruments, right here in Congo Square.  And then because it was here, and it happened so long, out in the open with large numbers of people from different backgrounds, Africans who--enslaved Africans who were brought down from other states, Virginia, Maryland, into New Orleans, I mean the mixture was great.  It was almost like an African Diaspora right at Congo Square, right in New Orleans.  And so that has influenced our culture, and that's why we have such African flavor, so to speak, cultural practices, carryovers here in New Orleans, the music, the food, you know, the dance, right here, the rhythms.
Speaker 1: When do you hope to publish that book?
Speaker 2: It comes out this fall.  The date that I have been given is October, so I'm hoping it will come out in October.
Speaker 1: Okay, so are those the four books or is there another one?
Speaker 2: Well, those are the--yeah, that would be the fourth book.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm always working on other things, but I don't have anything that is committed yet.
Story_ID: 37283
Speaker 1: Okay, so what's next for you besides getting your next book published?
Speaker 2: My book, oh, well, I would like to do--I'm working with a filmmaker on a documentary on Congo Square [in New Orleans, Louisiana].  So I hope that that will develop--it'll take years, but I hope it will eventually develop, you know.  But that's something I would like to do because having it in the media, available that way would, I think a lot of audiences and it would share so much more because we will able to actually show dance clips, and musical clips and really show the similarity or the practices that existed other places and then here in New Orleans and show the connection as well as the role that Congo Square played in preserving African cultural practices since, in North America 'cause we go to Haiti, and you see the richness.  And you know, and you go to Cuba, and you see the carryovers.  I mean it's still going on right there.  And so people sometimes forget, you know, we had it here too.  It was right here in New Orleans in Congo Square.
Speaker 1: Besides your writings, and your work, 'cause you're still, work--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --are there organizations or civic groups that you belong to?
Speaker 2: I belong--well, my church, Christian Unity Baptist Church.  I belong to Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.  I'm active in Alpha Beta Omega Chapter.  I--
Speaker 1: When did you pledge?
Speaker 2: At Tougaloo [College, Jackson, Mississippi] in two--in 1974, sophomore year.  And then several book writers' group, Nomo before the storm, before Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], and we still have that little connection, you know, but we don't meet on a regular basis.  And Society of Children's Book Writers.  What else, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, you've gotten a couple of awards also.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You wanna talk about them.
Speaker 2: So for my first book, the 'A Bus of Our Own', I received a notable, social studies notable award--I can't remember the exact time.  And then I also received the Juvenile Book Award from the Mississippi Library Association.  That was an accomplishment (laughter), didn't even know existed.  So all of these have really been like surprises.  It's not like I sought out any of this, you know.  So I was very surprised, and then one that I really appreciated was the 'I Dream of a World Award', "I Dream--something.  I can't remember, but it was out of New York.  And that award is voted on by students.  So it has gone on for years and years, but a group of students at Country Day or the Country Day School and a New York public school.  I think it's Public School 196 or 195 collaborate, and they read so many books.  I don't know how the books are nominated to begin with.  And then--maybe the nominate them too, and then they read them, and they discuss them.  And they debate which ones should win, and then they vote.  And the winning author and illustrator gets to come to the school to meet the students.  And it was awesome.  And I spent a day there.  So the illustrator couldn't come which means I've never met her.  I've only met one of my illustrators and haven't talked to--the one that I met, I talked to, of course.  So I haven't talked to the other two either because I don't know if you know that when you sell your manuscript, the editor stays in the middle of you.  So that was a great experience though to go and meet those students.  And then what other awards?  Several other awards the book has received as well.  And then I recently heard that my third book, 'Hush Harbor' received the 'Book of the Year' or something for the international book, International Library Association, best book in the area of literature or something like that.  I can't remember.
Story_ID: 37284
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not spoken about that you would like to speak about?
Speaker 2: We talked quite a bit.  I can't, let's see, can't think.
Speaker 1: Well, you can continue to think about it.  I'd like to know when you look back over your life so far, and you have a long way to go (laughter), is there anything that you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: I may not have majored in music (laughter), classical music.  And I'm--but, you know, it has helped too in all aspects of life, although I'm not really actualizing my musical talents so to speak or my skills and my knowledge.  I use it, you know, in a different way, you know, because it really--maybe that's why I majored in music, to write this Congo Square [about Congo Square, New Orleans, Louisiana] book because although it's history based, I brought my musical background to it, and I was able to compare, look at rhythms, talk about the rhythms, talk about different aspects of the music.  I knew the instruments from my work at, on the music of West African College in Tougaloo [College; Jackson, Mississippi].  So I brought a lot of that in, and as a matter of fact, when I was in Ghana, back in '76 [1976], the work that I used most was of Dr. Nketia (ph.), J. H. [ph.] Nketia.  He was not there at that time.  He was in the United States because I think he started coming to the States in the 1950s.  The man is in his nineties, still alert.  As a matter of fact, as we speak, he's in the United States.  And I met him in California in October.  He came over to present a keynote address at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles].  He's just that sharp and active now, at ninety--I can't remember.  He's in his nineties.  But I used most of his books for my research, started connecting with him over the years.  I first saw him maybe twenty years ago, maybe twenty--yeah, maybe twenty years ago when he came to New Orleans [Louisiana] to do, conduct a workshop.  And I said to him then, oh, Dr. Nketia [ph.], I plan to write on Congo Square.  Would you write my forward?  Oh, yes, yes, yes, I will write your forward (laughter).  I mean I didn't--had I started?  My first work on Congo Square was in 1995 when I produced a children's work involving storytellers, drummers, dancers and I did it in both--in two locations, New Orleans and Jackson, Mississippi.  So I had started researching it before then.  And so he said he would, but, you know, what's the shot?  He's in Ghana, I'm here, you know.  I have a family.  That's really my priority.  So then this was right before [Hurricane] Katrina [2005].  I was just discussing this with Kulamu (ph.).  And he said, well, why not try it?  You know, you may find him.  Who knows?  You could find Doctor--he may be still alive--I didn't know if he was still alive.  So I have friends from Ghana who have friends still there in Ghana.  And they called, my friends here, and they said, oh, yes, we know Dr. Nketia.  Everybody knows him.  He's a national treasure, you know, because he is so popular over the world, not just there.  And these friends knew him too.  They said they used his books when they were in elementary school, you know, his music books.  And so she went to find him, and he said, yes, yes, he would write the forward to my book.  What a long shot?  And since then, we communicate.  I traveled over to--not just to see him, but when I went in 2006, I visited him.  I had met his daughter here, I think in 2000.  She came for a UNESCO [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cutural Organization] conference.  She's the chair of the history department at the University of Ghana at Accra.  And in the end, he did write the forward to my book.  And I am so honored.  And I did get a chance to interview him too when I went to UCLA in October.  So I have an authentic interview, an authentic forward from this master person.
Speaker 1: That's great.

Speaker 1: Because this interview is going to be something that future generations will be able to see, if you had to send a message to the future generation, what would you say, particularly, to people who are studying music or who believe they can write any kind of book?  What would your message be?
Speaker 2: My message would reflect my statement that I gave you at the beginning about purpose, but I would add that they should pray for purpose because God has given each of us a purpose.  He's put us here for a reason, and it's not always what we study or what we think we're here for, what we like to do even, or what we know to do well because I studied music all my life.  I think I started taking piano at five or something.  But I knew I didn't wanna be a classical pianist.  That just wasn't in my soul, you know, but it was what I did.  And I did it okay, well enough to, you know, go to school early and everything, but I knew that it was not my purpose.  And so I did pray for it.  And when it was revealed to me that I was to write, I was like, oh, but God, I don't know how to write, you know.  I'm not a writer.  But I think if you have a faith and you believe and you pursue it, you know, He will match, He will meet you.  He will overmatch you.  You know, it'll be like two to one or five--ten to one.  And so I think that my message would be to pray for purpose, and find out what it is that you're here for.  It's always something good, always something positive, and then I would say pursue it with a passion.

Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?  What do you want to leave behind as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I want it to be something that would be, the legacy would, something that would be useful, something that would be a contribution.  And I think that my research and my writing will fall into that category.  I'm hoping that it would not only be educational, but definitely educational because all of my books are either fiction or historical fiction, set in truth and then entertaining and enlightening because children are getting away from reading books.  I mean it's more like media entertaining, but I think that there would be nothing to substitute like a book.  And I hope that my books will be engaging enough that students will want to read it and teachers will use it in their classroom to help bridge the time that has passed because our students don't know about Jordan Noble or about the Hush Harbor or about instances of segregation in Mississippi that caused us to have to, you know, work extra hours in the cotton field to get money to ride the bus, even though we were still paying taxes, you know.  So I just hope that my books will be a contribution to help students learn and grow.

Speaker 1: I, well, I just want to acknowledge the family that I came from because, yeah, I know that what we have left from my family is really, really unique in Madison [Mississippi].  It's not unique that we had land, I mean because most families that I grew up around in Madison had land, they owned land.  But I think what's unique is that the material that we have been left, like my grandfather's books and, you know, the stories that they left us, and I just hope that we can find out more about the history, you know, pursue it a little bit more, the genealogy, and really make some kind of tribute to them because when my aunt passed away, I mean our house, the house that she left was like a museum.  We had their icebox.  We had their, their wood stove.  We had all of these things that they used growing up.  I really don't know where they are to tell you the truth.  But hopefully, somebody in the family has them, and my wish is that we could come together and create some kind of exhibit or museum or something from this rural family hist--rural farmer, Mississippi farmer.  That would be great because we have so many documentations, so many papers to support that.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, if that's all, I'd like to thank you for sharing your story.  I'm sure that it's going to be encouraging and inspirational to future generations, and people looking for information.  So thank you for taking the time--
Speaker 1: Thank you, I enjoyed it.
Speaker 2: --to share your story with us.
Speaker 1: Thank you, I enjoyed it.
