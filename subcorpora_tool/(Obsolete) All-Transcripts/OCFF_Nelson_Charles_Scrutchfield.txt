 Finchum  Nelson  Today is May 18, 2009. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library and we   re conducting an oral  history project entitled Oklahoma Centennial Farms. We   re here in  Guthrie, Oklahoma with Charles Scrutchfield Nelson of the Scrutchfield  Farm. Thank you for having us today.  You   re quite welcome. Nice to have you.  Juliana Nykolaiszyn is with us also and she may chime in with a  question. Let   s get started by having you start with how your family  came to own the land.  This particular farm? My grandfather did make the Run into Guthrie,  Oklahoma on the second train on April 22, 1889. He did not homestead  this farm, he homesteaded further northeast. He first opened a barber  shop just about two blocks from the railroad depot which lasted for a  short time until he opened his furniture business. And as you might  expect in the early 1890s a lot of bartering was done instead of payment  in cash and he was quite successful at that. He had a penchant for raising  thoroughbred horses and Shetland ponies so he was looking for the  addition of another farm that would be closer to Guthrie where he could  do that. The farms that he owned in Logan County were all a  considerable distance away from Guthrie itself and to have taken care of  horses on any of those farms would have meant riding all day and all  night just to get there and back.  So he was able to obtain this farm, originally 80 acres, five acres of  which his widow subsequently sold and he raised horses and Shetland  ponies here. This made a very easy distance for him to ride out on  horseback or by buggy to take care of the horses. He wanted two things  5  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  in a farm: clear land so that he would have room for the horses to graze  and a natural water source. Just behind this house are two forks that  commence what is called Bird Creek; it is spring fed. I can find two  springs directly behind the house, there might be a third one a little bit  north. So he always had water and that was essentially what he wanted  in order to have a place close to town to graze his horses.  When he came on the train, where did he come from?  He came from the Kansas line. He had been in Missouri and  homesteaded, as I said, a little further northeast. He was one of those  where as soon as he staked his claim, someone staked one right over it.  But he was able to prove his original claim so he staked on that farm and  then opened his businesses downtown.  Did he come by himself or with siblings or what?  As far as I know he came by himself and my grandmother, his future  wife, came on either the first or second train, I   m not sure which. She  was a Sturgeon, and the Sturgeon family also homesteaded here. And in  fact I have the original homestead exemption on that one. He met her  sometime between 1889 and 1895. Originally she had work. She was 15  years old when she made the Run. Came with two old maid spinster  aunts who had raised her. Her mother had died just shortly after her birth  and she worked originally as a waitress at the Hardy House at the  railway depot. And then at a restaurant, although I don   t know if it was  that one, she and my grandfather met and they were married in 1895.  And they did not live on this land? The lived someplace else.  Right, they lived in town.  And then how many children did they have?  They had two. My mother who was the older of the two, Ora  Scrutchfield Nelson, and then my Uncle Fay Scructhfield. Of course few  people called him Fay. Even though it was spelled with the male spelling  without the E. So he became known as Scrutch throughout his life.  And your parents then had just one son or     My mother and father had just the one son and my uncle and his wife  just had one son. So there   s just the two sons. My cousin, Fred  Scrutchfield, currently lives in Sun City West, Arizona.  So that   s how you came to be the owner of this 75.  6  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Yes, the farm I mentioned earlier west of town my cousin inherited. I  inherited this one personally and then the balance of the homes and lots  we own jointly.  Well on this particular farm, were there any structures?  Never a structure that I can recall, never a structure that I have heard  about. For a number of years on the corner where we border on Pine  Street, without any formality at all, a baseball field developed. And so  for a long time, baseball was played on the field. But there was actually  no structure even connected with the baseball area. It was just kind of     the lot was empty so we   ll use it    type thing.  So over the years, other than horses, has it produced any other crops or  products?  Sometime prior to his death, which was in 1927, he had given up the  horse business. Then it was rented for pasture. A gentleman named  Charles Hixon rented our farm for probably in excess of 30 years and  grew wheat mostly. His widow, Olive Hixon, is 98, still very active in  town, drives her car wherever she wishes to go. But many years ago  while my mother was still alive, we changed the lease arrangements and  leased to a gentleman named Hollie Chappell. He took the far east end  of the farm, the last 100 feet of it, fenced it separately, kept it mowed  very short, and that was his landing strip for his personal airplane. His  home at that time was just on the southeast corner of my property so he  could nearly taxi right up to the backdoor. And he has continued to lease  the area and grow wheat. He no longer flies. So that   s how the farm has  been used since then.  That   s interesting.  Mm-hmm. I wish I flew. I could have a very nice arrangement here   Do you have any idea how much was paid for the farm initially?  No, I do not. I would not even swear that it was in currency. It could  have been a barter arrangement. I have really no idea on that one.  So how far away from town to here then?  From Noble Street where you turned off and headed north, and that is  the main east-west thoroughfare through Guthrie, we are eight-tenths of  a mile. So it did make it close for him to be able to get out to this area to  take care of his horses and Shetland ponies.  7  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  And did you grow up in Guthrie?  I did after I turned seven. My mother and father lived in Oklahoma City  and of course my mother grew up here. My father never lived in Guthrie.  By the time they married they were in Oklahoma City. My mother and I  returned here when I was seven and I   ve been here ever since.  So you visited the Carnegie Library downtown then?  Quite a few times. Quite a few times. Many people do not know this, but  there was a conservatory in the basement of the Carnegie Library back  in the 1910s. My mother was quite a pianist and studied a great deal and  she was enrolled in that conservatory. I have newspaper articles on  recitals that were given, things of that nature, down in Carnegie Library.  And many people were not aware that that was true but I have the  newspaper articles to vouch for it.  Has the town changed much since those days?  Not the downtown area as far as physical structure, and really not even  the population. It is growing, but slowly. This area does have a new  housing area that did not exist. It   s really the outlying areas outside of  the city limits directly, in Logan County but outside the city limits that  have really mushroomed with beautiful homes. But the downtown, I   m  happy to say, has remained very much the same.  Where we are today, this is part of the original farm?  Yes.  How much of it is left like it was?  25 acres of it. Really, to be precise on that, I   d say it   s probably more in  the range of 35 or 40 acres that are left as it was. This has all changed.  We now have housing where there was none before.  When it was used to farm wheat, they would take it to Guthrie to sell,  I   m assuming?  Yes.  Most likely by horses or trailer?  Well by the time we were growing wheat, it would have been by  motorized vehicle because that came after 1927 when we were growing  wheat.  8  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  So you would have been in the area during the Depression?  Yes, sure was.  Anything of interest you want to say about that time period?  Well we got through it somehow. Guthrie really didn   t change that much  actually during the Depression. It was pretty slow then and it stayed  slow after that because the capital had left Guthrie by then.  Was there any cotton grown in the area?  I   m not really familiar with cotton crops around here to note, but I  suspect so because there was a cotton refinery here at one time. So I  imagine there was, probably on the Cottonwood River up north.  When they were raising Shetland ponies did they sell them or     Yes, sold them. And probably because of the fact that we became a state  in 1907 and I do not know what the initiative was for this, whether he  was asked to do it or volunteered to do it just as an individual  recognition, but just after Teddy Roosevelt signed us into being a state,  one of the Shetland Ponies which was named Don Pedro was sent to the  White House. Now whether it was sent by the city of Guthrie or by my  grandfather individually, I have no records to show. But it was sent as a  gift to Teddy Roosevelt. We had a picture of it (it is still somewhere in  this house) of Teddy Roosevelt   s son sitting in a saddle on the pony on  the White House grounds and Teddy Roosevelt was holding the reins to  the horse. But I don   t know what instigated him sending the pony.  Whether he wanted to do it, or the city asked him to do it, I don   t know.  Would most people buy them just for family use?  Sure. I had a Shetland pony the whole time I was growing up here.  You would come out and do your chores and take care of it?  No, they didn   t force me into that.  Did you have farm chores otherwise?  No.  More of a town person?  Yes, because the first part of my life was in Oklahoma City, so it was set  9  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  before we came here. And by that time my grandfather had died so we  no longer had the Shetland ponies. But we used to have a lot of them.  About how many at one time, do you know?  My mother has told me that he   s had as many as 100 Shetland ponies at  one time, but I don   t know that. But the two that my cousin had and I  had were not even from his farm because by the time we moved back he  didn   t have them anymore.  So they would have them scattered across the state to have that many.  Right.  And they weren   t used as work ponies?  No, and the few full size horses he had he raised as thoroughbred horses.  And I   m sure he didn   t want to give that up, but I think health  necessitated it.  So other than that as his income he had businesses in town?  Yes. He had a furniture business principally and ended up with three  buildings side by side, 100 block of East Harrison. He built the first one  in 1895. That was 106 East Harrison. He built it as a furniture store and  also made caskets (which was not unusual in that day) and then  expanded his business by buying the two-story building next to it, 108  East Harrison. And subsequently after he died, my grandmother moved  from her home, her house at 203 East Vilas, moved up to live over the  buildings on the second floor and bought the third building. So  ultimately we had 106, 108, and 110 East Harrison. Dr. Michael Bennett  has the three buildings now and has restored them and done one  magnificent job bringing them back.  So on the third building, what was it used for?  Also for furniture. All three buildings ultimately were furniture. And  then for a long while, our electric company had the one-story building  that he built. And I still have some very interesting documents hanging  on the wall in there in handwriting, of course, from 1895 by the  contractor who built the building, how he verified the honesty and  integrity of the workman, how many bricks were actually used in the  building, and the ultimate cost of those bricks which if I remember was  something like  109.  For the entire building.  10  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Yes.  And where would they have come from?  Probably here. Guthrie had a brick foundry. I have a picture of one of  the two brick foundries that were here.  I didn   t realize they had one, did you?  I think a lot of places did, like Davenport.  Well we did have, and as I say I have a picture in there. If I recall, it   s  the one nearest the rail depot.  Did they have a lumber yard too?  Oh yes, absolutely.   There were  enough trees in the area to have one?  Until recently, we still had two lumber buildings functioning. Both of  those have now closed, but all three of his buildings were built of brick.  A lot of changes and then not so much I guess, both ways.  Right. When Dr. Bennett remodeled the two two-story buildings   this  would be ten years or less   when they exposed the original eye-beam  over the front of the building separating first and second floor, we were  stunned to find you could still read quite clearly    Scrutchfield New and  Used Furniture    on that eye-beam; even though they painted over it  many times over many years the original was still available.   Did you  take photos?  Yes. Oh yes, absolutely. In fact Dr. Bennett wanted to leave it as it was,  but it just would not work right in the restoration so he had to cover it  over.  That   s interesting too. I   m glad someone   s redoing the older buildings.  Bringing them back to their original. A major one is being done right  now as we speak and it   s on Oklahoma Avenue. That has us within one  or two of all the buildings downtown being the original fronts.  That   s good. And the Carnegie Library is still standing.  11  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Nykolaiszyn  Nelson  Finchum  Absolutely. Absolutely. It   s still very beautiful.  Where was the train depot then?  Where it currently is. The first railway depot was actually on the west  side of the railroad tracks. I believe it burned down. Then they built on  the east side of the railroad tracks, first a wood structure and then the  current brick one. So it   s there right at the end of Oklahoma Street which  is the main drive through the downtown business area.  Your grandparents would have been here when the state became a state?  Oh yes, absolutely. My grandfather (according to my mother) attended  the ceremony which was at the Carnegie Library and he held her on his  shoulders so she could see. And at the Centennial in 2007 I went, of  course, to the reenactment of it and tried very hard to stand in the  original place where she had described where he was standing. I went  very early in order to do that, but the television stations were all here  filming and a friend of mine mentioned to one of the TV stations that I  was trying to stand where my grandfather had at the original so they  wanted an interview. And then the second TV station wanted an  interview. And by the time I got finished with it, my space was gone and  I didn   t get to stand exactly where I think he was but in the same general  area.  That was exciting too. Both times.  Both times, it was.  Going back to this beautiful piece of land, you started telling us about  how Shetland ponies were raised and you made mention about how it  evolved through the years. If you could just detail a little bit more about  how we   re at this point in its development.  I guess I would have to say it was rather in two distinct stages because  my grandfather   s original use for it extended until sometime into the  1920s. At that time he began leasing it for crops and that activity held  true until really just 10-12 years ago. So from the time span of  approximately 1925 or so until about 12 years ago, it   s been a farm  where wheat has been grown for the bulk of that time, and very much of  that under the lease to one man. So it really was a very quiet farm for  many, many years.  And you mentioned too there   s a creek through it. Was it dammed up at  any point?  12  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Not originally. We had dammed   I say we, I really had nothing to do  with it   but the gentleman who has a home on the east side of me  dammed the front part of that creek to make a little pond but you still  had some water flowing from underneath it on the south end. This creek  I suspect is original to the date of the property. It runs very close to  behind my house. Of course there   s quite a drop from my house down to  the creek bed. But that was one thing he insisted on having was water of  course for the horses.  And when it was farmed, did they use any conservation efforts like  terracing or anything like that?  No, there really wasn   t any terracing, and this farm was essentially a  pretty flat farm. This portion over to Pine Street has not really been  disturbed that much. We   ve done some sloping to it of course, but it was  really pretty flat. And then on the other side of the creek beds it begins  to rise to the high point of the farm overlooking I-35.  None of your property was taken for I-35 then if there was property  between you?  No, I   m happy to say it was not.  You can   t hear it too much either.  At times   in the evenings particularly   you   ll hear the semis going by.  But by the same token you can hear the railroad train which is two miles  east of us. So it isn   t that intrusive.  It   s interesting that you chose to have your house here all these years  later.  I felt like if it was going to be used for development, I wanted to be part  of it by part ownership on it and was able to do so at a time when I had  pretty free reign on what portion of it I selected to build. I liked this  particular site because I have the trees and the creek right behind me and  still have somewhat of an overview of Guthrie. Yes, just the fact it had  always been our farm, I felt like I should be on it if we were going to do  any development of it.  And the name of the street in front of the house is?  Nelson Place. Happens to be my last name, isn   t that a coincidence?  That is.  13  Nelson  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  Nelson  Nykolaiszyn  Nelson  Nykolaiszyn  Nelson  Nykolaiszyn  Nelson  Nykolaiszyn  Nelson  Yes.  Hopefully it will be here a long time.  At what point was the decision made to go from farming to residential  development?  Right at the end of the 1990s. I recall clearly it was just after Christmas,  first of the year. A lifelong friend of mine here in Guthrie and his son  contacted me to see if I had reached a point where I was interested in  developing it for housing. But he was not the first to ask me. Within a  two week period I had three developers contact me. One out of Edmond,  one out of Oklahoma City, and then the one to whom I ultimately sold.  And I felt like that was kind of a   maybe not a warning but a clue that  the time was definitely here to proceed with some development. I felt  that were I to not do it, then there are several farms, open spaces just on  the other side of the cemetery north of me or to the northeast and this  property just might be jumped over for those housing developments. My  lifelong friend here and his son made a nice offer and I knew them so I  felt like that would be a more comfortable situation for me to sell to  them. So that   s how that developed.  Well it   s great that it   s somebody you can trust and you can trust with  the land that your family   s cared for so long.  Absolutely. Absolutely. And they respected that, they did.  We noticed the street. Were you instrumental in the layout of the land or  the parceling out of spaces?  No, not actually. That was pretty much designed by the son and, of  course, with the father   s influence and input I   m sure. The only  influence I had on it was that I selected this particular area for my house,  which meant whatever road they put in had to take that into account  because the house I wanted here. And they were very cooperative about  that, too.  Now as you drive into this development, you see the Centennial Farm  sign.  Absolutely.  We think that   s just a really nice touch.  And that was very much in accord with the father and son who are  instrumental in building this. When I made them aware that the farm was  14  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  being recognized and the sign was going to be provided, they wanted it  right at   at that time the only entrance into the property. So I can thank  them for having it there.  And they named it Canyon Bluffs?  Canyon Bluff Estates, yes.  As opposed to Scrutchfield Estates.  As opposed to Scrutchfield. But Scrutchfield is sometimes a difficult  name to spell or understand. And you certainly have difficulty getting it  in to short little signature lines provided on all forms. So yes, we named  it Canyon Bluffs.  And your grandparents owned other property besides this. How much  total acreage at one time did they have?  When my grandfather died in 1927, I had the abstract information on his  holdings at that time. You can tell that he was very good at bartering in  those earlier days. In Guthrie, Langston, and two other really non-existent  townships in Logan County he owned a total of 365 lots. In  Logan County proper he owned eight farms that we can verify. My  grandmother recalls it being slightly more than that, but we can verify  eight farms, plus a section of land in Texas, a section in Colorado, and a  section in New Mexico. And I know the one in Colorado, which was a  full section was bartered; it cost him a span of horses and a carriage to  obtain it. Then he had the three buildings downtown, three houses  downtown including the one in which he and my grandmother lived.  Those were his holdings at the time that he died in 1927. So while we  did not have particularly a lot of cash, my grandmother was able to enter  the Depression pretty secure.  What became of the land in Colorado and Texas and New Mexico?  My mother, who inherited that specifically, sold that in about 1963. We  did retain the mineral rights to it. My cousin and I just recently sold the  farm in Colorado and that was a full section, again retaining the mineral  rights. And the one in New Mexico I know very little about. My  grandmother always said there was some legal contention on the part of  the United States government on the ownership of it and she never went  into really any detail about it when I was young. I have since found a  record where we did pay taxes on that farm back in the early 1920s or  early 30s, but that   s the only thing I   ve ever found on that section.  Have you visited any of them?  15  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Nykolaiszyn  Both the Texas and the Colorado ones.  Do you know if they did?  They did not. They may have seen the one in Colorado. They did take a  trip up there one time but he became quite ill while he was there. He was  nearing the end of his lifespan at that time and the doctor told him to  return immediately to lower altitude. So they might have seen that one. I  doubt it because I know my grandmother who was with him told me that  she had never seen it. And until we had a concern with a lease that we  had on the Colorado farm my mother and I had never seen it. But we did  go up and to resolve the question on the lease and got to see it. Many  years before we saw the Texas farm; it   s in the panhandle, and as you  might guess it   s very flat. It is so flat. When you can stand on one corner  and see the other three property poles on the section, you know it   s flat.  What would the people you   ve leased it to use it for?  They were growing wheat. They were growing wheat.  And the Texas one?  That was the Texas one.  In Colorado, what was the property used for?  They were grazing on that farm. That particular farm was sitting right in  the center of an area where a gentleman owned either ten or eleven  sections surrounding it, essentially.  A big ranch.  But I   m sure that   in fact I know that my grandfather bartered for that  one by using the span of horses and a buggy or a carriage.  He liked to acquire land.  Yes. And he was charmed, very successful at being able to do that.  And pick good quality pieces evidently, too.  He liked water on every farm. The one that did not have it was the  Colorado farm. But the farms here, I have seen most of them over a  period of time, did have natural water.  Just all around, he seems like a very smart business man and  16  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Nykolaiszyn  Nelson  Nykolaiszyn  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  entrepreneur for his time.  I think he was. I think he was.  And he had come from Kansas. Do you know where his people had come  from?  Back I   d say two generations before him they would have come from the  Nashville, Tennessee area. A very good friend of mine who lives in  Franklin, Tennessee   I   ve known him this year exactly 50 years   was  researching genealogy on his family in that area. We found from early  information that my grandmother had that one of his distant relatives  back in the 1600s had the same name as my grandmother   s side had on  my grandfather   s side. So we then seriously researched and found out  that we were actually distant cousins. But the Scrutchfields married into  the Henderson family in Tennessee and migrated then from Tennessee to  Missouri. A portion of the Scrutchfields took very much the same route  and settled in Illinois and more northern areas. And I come from the  strain of Scrutchfields that settled in the Kansas and Missouri areas.  That had to be a little bit adventurous to decide to come for the Land  Run.  I   m sure they were, and it   s nice to have contact with anyone who has  born the name Scrutchfield because you do not find that name easily in a  telephone book.  Growing up do you have any fond memories of not only this farm but the  other farms in the area that you can recall?  Pretty much I hung out in the city. I did accompany my grandmother on  visits to a couple of different farms in the southeastern part of Logan  County. Now this farm and the farm west of town I saw frequently. And  my uncle and cousin and my aunt of course lived on that farm for many  years so we were out there frequently. So that farm I knew best of any of  the farms that we had. This one would be next. Two or three of them I  actually would have trouble locating.  And on family holidays would you go to the farm?  On the west farm. A great deal of time  was spent  on the west farm.  Do you remember when you received electricity?  No, I don   t. I know that the house that my grandmother built on that  farm for my uncle, her son, was the third house on that particular  17  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  foundation. There had been two earlier houses on it, both of which had  been blown away by tornadoes. The third house stayed; it has lasted. But  there have been two houses on it during the time he owned it earlier.  Did they have a storm shelter then after that?  No. We   re stubborn Oklahomans. Or maybe not too smart Oklahomans.  Two tornadoes in one spot, that   s     That should give you a sign, shouldn   t it?  The third time was a charm though.  There   s still a home on that foundation.  I noticed on your form that you graduated from the University of  Oklahoma.  Yes.  Any reason why OU instead of OSU?  My class in    49 was probably a little unusual class for Guthrie in that a  more significant portion of the graduating class that planned to go to  college went to OU that year. UCO of course, or CSU as it was then, had  the majority of students from Guthrie going to school. But in my  particular class there was quite a number that went to OU. That   s  unusual.  I   m assuming you weren   t interested in agriculture so much and that   s  what OSU was primarily at that time.  Well I think my grandmother had instilled some plans for me to go to  school either to OU or UCLA. My uncle went to OU so she was partial  to OU. So it ended up that it was OU.  UCLA? That   s quite a difference too from here.  Yes it is. But she was also attracted to that. But I ended up at OU. And I  received my Master   s degree in 1954, something like 55 years ago.  You had some of your grandfather   s business sense then.  Well I hope so.  18  Finchum  Nelson  Finchum  Nelson  Anything else you want to add that we haven   t     No, I   ve appreciated this opportunity to visit with both of you. I think  the project that you are doing certainly has merit. I wish you success  with it.  Thank you. It   s been a pleasure meeting you today and recording your  story.  Thank you.  -------  -------
