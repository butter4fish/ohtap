 Milligan with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Today   s date is April 5, 2018. I   m trying to think about   . This is loosely a part of the interview project with the Friday Afternoon Tea and Glee Society oral history areas, also just interesting O-State Stories in general. I   m here with Keith McGlamery who came to OSU in 1965, was a member of the FATAG group. That   s all the introduction I   m going to give you because we   re going to let you talk the rest of it. So where I like to start is just give me a little bit of background information about yourself, tell me where you   re from, maybe a little bit about your parents, just fill in some gaps.  McGlamery Okay. My name is Keith McGlamery. I was born in Stillwater in January of 1947 on the same day that my father was taking his oral exams for his master   s degree here. Shortly after I was born and my father receives his degree, we move to Holbrook, Arizona, where my father was an industrial arts teacher.  Milligan What was his degree in then?  McGlamery Industrial arts education.  Milligan So that   s what he was getting his master   s   .  McGlamery We were there for three years, at which time we moved back to Oklahoma, to Tulsa. Both my parents were from Tulsa. My maternal grandfather had a 160-acre farm in Pawnee County where the Cimarron River flowed into the Arkansas, and it was a farm that he bought from the man that homesteaded that property in the Oklahoma land rush. Upon my grandfather   s death, I received from his estate that deed which hangs on the wall in my office. On my paternal side, my grandmother came as a child to Woodward County pre-statehood in 1905. The McGlamery side of the family had been in Oklahoma territory, as well, pre-statehood. I   m in a line of, depending on how you count it, either third- or fourth-generation Oklahomans. 5  Milligan So let me just interrupt. The Woodward side, was that, 1905, was that homesteading, as well?  McGlamery No. She actually came by covered wagon from St. Louis. I think that her father had been killed, so she was with her mother and I don   t know what other relatives. She settled with relatives in Woodward County.  Milligan I see. Go ahead. So you have long roots on both sides.  McGlamery Right. Right. Growing up, I lived in Tulsa from the time that we moved back from Arizona, from the time I was three years old until I was twelve, and I had gone through the sixth grade in Tulsa public schools. Part of that time my father taught school, and he also went to work for Douglas Aircraft and later North American Rockwell Aircraft. Most of his career was spent in the aeronautics industry. When I finished sixth grade, we moved to Collinsville. My father had grown up on a farm in the panhandle of Oklahoma, enjoyed working with cattle and livestock generally, so we bought an eighty-acre farm, which was of course not large enough to really support a family unless it was highly productive. It was sort of a hobby farm, but it was a rural life for my brother and I. We went to school in small-town schools in Collinsville, Oklahoma. Collinsville is at the northern end of Tulsa County. I wasn   t an athlete, although I ran track and participated and actually lettered in track. Had the distinction of three years in a row being the slowest person on the mile relay team. I was elected my junior year as class president, and I was elected class president again my senior year.  Our class was more adventurous than some that preceded us. We got around a prohibition on class trips because the story was that in years before that there had been an unwanted pregnancy result from an overnight class trip, so the school had reacted by banning class trips. The rule specifically prohibited overnight class trips, so we had multiple-day, actually, multiple-day class trips. We scheduled a class trip that lasted twenty-three and a half hours. We left at two thirty in the morning, took buses to Six Flags in Texas, and then took buses back and got in just inside the twenty-four-hour deadline. Oklahoma State was merely my only alternative. During high school I always had summer jobs. I had been working in summer jobs, almost all of them agricultural from the time I was eleven years old. I worked, did that and was hauling hay, working the wheat harvest, and so forth. When I came to OSU, I was a fairly conservative Baptist kid from a small town, wide-eyed about the whole experience. I was really never given a choice as to where I was going to go to school. If my father was going to pay for it, I was going to OSU.  Milligan So why is that? 6  McGlamery Because I think he generally mistrusted higher education and felt that he was not going to impose Oklahoma Baptist University on me, but he thought that OSU was probably the best overall choice. Of course, at that time when I filled out the application forms, you had to indicate your religious preference. I jokingly say that OSU at that time had more Baptists than Oklahoma Baptist University, probably a higher percentage because   . My recollection is that the statistics were that over 80 percent of the enrolled freshmen that year gave a preference of Methodist or Baptist. So that was the   there were relatively few out-of-state students. There were more out-of-state graduate students but relatively few out-of-state undergraduates, with the exception of some recruited athletes and so forth. I initially got involved with the Baptist Student Union.  As I became over time less Baptist, shall we say, I branched into other things. My freshman year, second semester, during my freshman year, I was living in Cordell Hall. There were two students who were roommates. One was the president of the OSU Young Democrats, and his roommate was president of the OSU Young Republicans. I was in their dorm room, and the president of the OSU Young Republicans invited me to go to a meeting with him. I went to the meeting. There were, I think, five or six students, including me, and I found out it was election night. I was nominated and elected Vice President for Membership. My first official act was to purchase a membership for myself, and that began my campus political career as such.  Milligan Did you consider yourself Republican?  McGlamery We   ll get to that in a minute.  Milligan Okay. (Laughs)  McGlamery Dewey Bartlett, who had been the state senator from Tulsa County, was running for governor. When I was in high school, I won a competition. Because I lived in Tulsa County, I won an essay contest that Bartlett sponsored. I received a week appointment as a senate page in Oklahoma City, so I was a senate page for then Senator Bartlett. In the Fall of 1966, I was responsible for membership. Being young and na  ve, I didn   t realize that that was a position that normally people didn   t take very seriously, but I did, and I started organizing to build up the membership. I first obtained a copy of the existing membership. We had six people at the meeting but a couple of hundred on the rolls from the past. I started combing through those, and I established an organization. Knowing that there was pressure on younger members in fraternities, pledges and members, I found members or former members from every fraternity and sorority on campus. I say 7     every.    There have been a few that I missed, but certainly all of the larger ones.  Contacted them and asked them if they would like to be part of the membership committee, and all they really had to do was recruit people in their house. Then I did a variation of that in all of the dormitories. I didn   t have   I think we had somebody who was supposed to be responsible for people who lived off campus, but that was much harder to do to ascertain who those people were. The end result of that was that in the fall of    66, once we had undertaken this program, we won the national award for the fastest growing chapter of the Young Republicans in the country. At the state convention, I found out that I was really not a very good Republican, because it was the first time I had really had to confront issues. That was a time when the Young Republicans was being taken over by Young Americans for Freedom, which was a conservative organization that we somewhat contemptuously described as    sons of Birchers,    meaning sons of parents that would have been in the John Birch Society.  Their positions were, in my mind, rather extreme and also very unforgiving of any disagreement, so after the convention, I came back and resigned my office with the Young Republicans. That spring, I was encouraged to run for student senate and did so by taking my organizational list from Young Republicans, using the same people for   connection with my campaign, and ran as the only Independent in the race for Arts and Science Student Senator.  Traditionally, it had been held by somebody from   it had been held by a Greek. There were two student senators from Arts and Science. I was the only Independent running, so I formed an agreement with Delta Chi who had one of the candidates that as I campaigned, walking door to door in the dorms, would mention the Delta Chi candidate as if basically,    Vote for me, and for your second choice I would recommend X.    Actually, the guy   s name was Ken Dahms. He was here at the reunion this past fall. I had created this organization from Young Republicans, salvaged something out of that experience.  I then served on the student senate and was in the student senate, I   ve said two years but it must have been basically a year and a half before I became president of the student senate, the vice president of the student association, was the president of the student senate. That election was a little bit interesting because there were two political parties as such. One of them was the University Party, which was a new party and was the more centrist or liberal, and then there was the other party, the name of which I   ve repressed, that was the more conservative. It was traditionally controlled by the Greeks. The dean of men, whose name I will recall shortly, was very powerful with the fraternity system. He had been in that position for many years and had a great deal of say about what happened in the fraternity houses. For whatever reason, he declined to endorse the Greek candidate 8  who was running for president of the student association. That caused that person to withdraw, leaving us running unopposed, so Doug Caves was my running mate. He was running for president of the student association, and I was running   .  I had been approached to run for the president of the student association but didn   t feel I could do it because I was still working, in addition to class, I was still working fifteen hours or more a week, and at that point, it was at the university Library. I was one of the people who sat by the door and checked people   s bags. I got my fifteen hours a week in part by the fact that I worked holiday weeks and weekends, anytime the library was open. I was flexible in that regard and willing to stay on campus to work. I knew that being the president of the student association required lots of time, and I didn   t feel like I had that time commitment. I declined but then   was asked by some friends if I would accept the vice president   s position if they had a good candidate for president. They found Doug, who was excellent. He was an economics major from Muskogee, very talented guy. Doug Caves and Keith McGlamery became the winning ticket for the SGA leadership. During the time that we served in that role, we had a diverse student senate.     We   d be wrong to call it cohesive, but it was a pretty polite group.  There were some strong disagreements, but I don   t recall ever a student senate meeting that was overly heavy with sarcasm. There was certainly no yelling and shouting at the time. Again, not necessarily congenial, but certainly overall cooperative group and respectful. Incidentally, my first job as a student senator was, I was the senate chaplain, which, since I was considerably less religious at the time than I had been when I first came here, it was sort of interesting. I started for the prayers using   I had a book. There were several sort of semi-beat type poets or others who wrote, or very liberal ministers who wrote books of prayers that were a bit out of the ordinary. I think one of them, as I recall, the title of one of them was Are You Running With Me, Jesus? I would choose one of those prayers as the prayer that I would give for the senate. I think shortly after that, people decided that maybe the role of senate chaplain had sort of passed its prime.  Milligan Was that part of what you   did you agree with that, that sentiment that the senate chaplain   s role had passed its prime?  McGlamery I think that it was largely ceremonial, and I don   t think that it   . It was not like the senate chaplain was a great moral force. I think at best it was probably harmless. I don   t know that it had any positive force. I didn   t have any personal objection to it, and it may have been revived since then. I have no idea if it exists now. I had no particular animosity toward it or objection to it. It   s just that it took up time at the beginning. There was some greater sensitivity because it had always   we started having, particularly in the graduate students, we had some people whose religion was other than 9  Christian. To have somebody who was   I think that was probably the most blatant part of that process, that we never had, so far as I know, we never had a Catholic, we never had a Jew, we never had a Hindu, Buddhist, whatever.  Milligan You mean most blatant exclusionary or   .  McGlamery I think it was simply reflective of who was being elected to the student senate, but it was not representative necessarily of   . It was certainly representative of the dominant religious group on campus, but it was, de facto, exclusionary although, I think, without malice.  Milligan Yeah. Let me ask you something else, too, that sort of digs in a little bit. You   ve alluded to this a few times, but that your religion had decreased significantly since when you came in, right? Like, there   s a point that you grew up in a conservative Baptist home. I get the sense that that was a big part of what your family root was. Reflecting, is there   can you sort of see that trajectory? Was there something on campus, or was there interactions with people? What sort of contributed to that lessening, or is it just sort of a trivial thing?  McGlamery That   s a good question. I don   t mean to make light of it when I   ve shorthanded to say it was   . Because I was raised in a fundamentalist background, I can remember being in an American history   . There was a large American history course, and then there were small sections taught by graduate students. I think Dr. Ted Agnew conducted the lectures for the sessions where you had fifteen hundred students or whatever. Then there was a graduate student that would be fifty or sixty students still. I remember that there was   this was my freshmen year. I remember that there was a question raised by the graduate student when we were talking about Darwin and evolutionary theories and so forth. He asked how many people   didn   t believe in the theory of evolution. I was the only one who raised my hand. I looked around, and I thought,    I know a lot of these other people are Baptist and Methodist. Are they afraid to raise their hands, or do they know something I don   t know?    So I started researching.  That sent me to the Library to research evolution and evolutionary theory more, and that was the beginning of a process of questioning some of the underlying dogma that I had been exposed to in an evangelical fundamentalist church. It was not antagonism or antipathy toward the religion. It was more that I found that there were questions I had that the church I grew up in didn   t have good answers to, from my perspective. The benefits of my religious background, I think, was that it helped enforce a moral code and reinforced a sense of ethics, but there was sort of an anti-intellectual aspect of it that I no longer agreed with. That   s why when I say I was becoming less Baptist, I drifted away more slowly. I was still 10  occasionally attending church. I dated a girl for quite a while who was a pretty devout Baptist. I would go with her, and I would attend things over at the Baptist Student Union, I knew people over there, but I was not a fervent believer of that particular viewpoint anymore.  Milligan Yeah, that   s what I was curious   . I ask because I think that   s also one of those things that is sort of timeless. I think a lot of students still come in and sort of wrestle with that, so I was curious.  McGlamery It   s interesting, just as an aside, that at this FATAGS reunion, it   s very interesting. I had told you off camera that the activism in the    60s on the campus, a lot of it had its roots at the Wesley Foundation, Methodist. What was interesting at this reunion of campus activists, for lack of a better term, with the facetious name of Friday Afternoon Tea and Glee Society, was that many of those people who were influenced by what was going on at the Wesley Foundation and so forth then, even though it was considered the most   it was certainly the most liberal of the Protestant campus organizations. Many, although not all, but many of the people whose activism started that have remained Methodist to this day. I   m sure that somewhere there is someone who grew up in a Baptist church of the type that I was in that left the church and came back. I don   t know any.  All of those Methodists were, most of them, I   m sure were equally intelligent or far more intelligent than me. Many of them had departed from the church, but they all came back. I thought that was an interesting fact. In fact, the way I described it to one of my friends, I said it seems that when you are a Baptist and you start to pull on that tether and move out, it   s like a older rubber band. You go out too far, and it snaps. The Methodist, the tether seemed to be able to be stretched longer, and it eventually pulled you back. I would say to parents who are worried about whether or not their children are going to remain religious throughout their lives, if you   re not already a Methodist, maybe you ought to consider it.  Milligan So talking about the Wesley Foundation, do you want to transition to that part, sort of move toward the FATAG part of your story, or do you still have more you want to talk about with your student senate? I know some of it kind of goes together, but   .  McGlamery Let me mention one thing about the student senate my senior year because this came up at the FATAGS reunion, and I know it   s been asked about in the oral history project before. Doug Caves who, as I said was the president, because Doug was a serious student and didn   t have   he had another student volunteer to be sort of his administrative assistant. I   m sure somewhere I   ve got his name, but I don   t recall it. He was full of ideas and sometimes judgment-challenged. I think Doug probably spent more time reining him in than benefitting from his organization. One of the things 11  that   there had been for years something called Religious Emphasis Week (REW) on campus. That was actually the event that triggered the first of the major protests on campus in    66. This was in 1968-   69, and we were going to have a, we decided to have a symposium, a campus symposium, week-long symposium sponsored by the student government. I wasn   t involved in the decision, but it was the committee of student senators and others came up with   it was going to be on topics related to sex.  In typical OSU fashion at the time, they invited ministers; they invited theologians. There were priests; there were Baptist ministers. There were also   Albert Ellis, who was outrageously outspoken and somewhat enjoyed being provocative, who had written books on sex and was a psychologist who counseled people, his book written in the late    50s, I think, about sex was sort of one of the few books on the topic at that time. Albert Ellis was invited. Mary Calderone was invited. Mary Calderone was the founder of SIECUS, S-I-E-C-U-S, I believe, which was an acronym for an organization  Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States  that was an advocate for sex education in schools. I   m sure there was someone else. Each evening we had different speakers, and sometimes more than one during the course of the evening. Surprise, surprise, the place was overflowing for Albert Ellis and his outrageous comments, Mary Calderone to a lesser extent, and those with the ministers and theologians were, shall we say, lightly attended. That attracted the attention of the state press.  There were editorials, I know in the Daily Oklahoman and I think also in the Tulsa World, condemning allowing this kind of waste of taxpayers    money and contributing to the immorality of people, of the students on campus. Apparently, there was some notion that if we had not had that symposium, that OSU students would have remained ignorant of sex which would have been better for the state of Oklahoma. It was treated as if this was just the most egregious breach of appropriateness, none more so than the Baptist Messenger, which was the state Baptist newsletter. They ran an editorial against this, but specifically mentioned Doug and my names. Admittedly, to back up, the name of the symposium was    Sexpo    68,    and I   ve apologized for that name many times even though I did not select it. It was, you know, intended to get people   s attention, which it did, and certainly the editorialists had a heyday with it. There was an editorial in the Baptist Messenger. It gave Doug   s address and my address at the student government, had given our Student Union address. They missed one number, so all the letters that were sent to us subsequently by Baptists in response to that were easily identifiable because they had the wrong address by one letter.  Most of the letters expressed indignation, but a surprising number accused us of bringing communists to campus. I   m not quite sure of the connection between sex and communism, but apparently there was perceived to be some. There were a variety of suggested punishments for us. Few were 12  interested in something as mundane as expulsion from the university, although that was suggested. Most involved rather graphic indications of what they thought should be done to us physically, castration being at the top of the list. We envisioned that there were these good Baptist folks who were on farms and ranches throughout the state who were very familiar with that practice, so that seemed like an appropriate   . Growing up, I   d heard that suggested as, you know, frustration and anger about somebody and what should happen to a part of their anatomy. This is one thing. I mentioned this whole thing because it   s one of the things that I most regret about my time at OSU.  That was the failed opportunity. Having the return address of most of these folks, and knowing who was inspired to write by the editorial in the Baptist Messenger, and since a high percentage of these were from people in smaller communities, I suggested that we compose a form letter and we send it back and say,    Dear, Mr. Jones, Thank you for your recent letter to us concerning Sexpo    68. We appreciate your views, and recognizing that your response was no doubt because of the editorial in the Baptist Messenger, we have taken the liberty of forwarding a copy of your letter to the pastor of the First Baptist Church of blank.    We did not do that unfortunately. We thought that that would, particularly the ones that suggested some of these interesting methods of dealing with this, we thought   we might trigger mild heart attacks or at least some crushed false teeth or something by responding in that way, so we chose not to. I regret that we didn   t. Now with half a century of hindsight, I think that that would have been an appropriate thing for us to do.  Milligan Do you know that   s not where I thought you were going with this when you said,    There   s one thing I regret.    Usually    the one thing I regret    is that    I did something impulsively.    It   s not that    I had restraint.    (Laughter)  McGlamery I really hadn   t intended that this would be something that you can put in the comedy section of the archives. (Laughter)  Milligan So, yes, this is a very interesting topic, but how did that administration deal with all this?  McGlamery That   s a good question; I   m glad you asked. Dr.  Robert  Kamm was under such pressure. He was interviewed, and he released an official statement saying that basically,    Ignore all of that.    I think this is probably a direct quote.    The university position on sex remains in the Judeo-Christian tradition,    which led to a plethora of jokes about the    university position.     Milligan They opened that door and walked straight into it. (Laughter) Oh, my gosh. So when you all were scheduling this, though, did you get any pushback?  13  McGlamery No, I don   t recall any. I guess if you   re worried about communists on campus, the fact that the student senate is actually producing some symposium or something, it didn   t   . I think that the dean of students who was then a man named, I think, Dean  Smallfield , I don   t recall that he issued any resistance. There was a vice president for student affairs named Abe Hesser who had been the director of the Student Union before being elevated to that vice presidency. I   m sure if he had caught wind of it, he would have tried to stop it, but Dean Smallfield didn   t. So all of the blowback on that, all of the controversy and the repercussions and attempted repercussions came about after the fact. As I say, it was at least certain of the programs were very well attended.  Milligan That   s provocative. That   s interesting.  McGlamery So that   s the story of Sexpo    68.  Milligan Yes, that is a very creative name. I   m especially surprised that they let you keep the name.  McGlamery I don   t know that they knew   I don   t recall. I was president of the student senate. This whole thing was pushed out through Doug   s office, his role, and the student senate endorsed it and authorized the funding of it. I   m sure there must have been some student senators involved, but as president I was not involved. I don   t know if there was pushback on that or not. I will tell you, I think it is a typically juvenile or at least quasi-juvenile provocation by undergraduates, but   I no longer apologize for it. It is what it is. (Laughs)  Milligan It would be tame today.  McGlamery Yes, absolutely.  Milligan I didn   t realize that you had all of your contact information made available to the state   s Baptists. (Laughter) That is pretty extreme. Did your parents   I mean, they were part of the Baptist   or were you communicating?  McGlamery My father withheld funding from my education after my first year because of things like this. There was a man here named James Fleming. James Fleming was the longtime director of student financial aid and basically the student work programs on campus where you could get a part-time job on campus and help. He was a friend of my parents. As my name started appearing in the O   Colly for different things, Mr. Fleming felt compelled to forward copies of all of those things to my parents because he was extremely conservative and was outraged by things that most people would not be outraged by. He forwarded a lot to my parents.     I received a little bit of funding from my parents my sophomore year. That ended when   I was new to the student senate, and there was a senator named Edward 14  Gonzalez. Edward was, I think he was a graduate student, and he was probably more radical but a delightfully persuasive guy.  He was considerably more sophisticated than the rest of us, I think. The student government had a program on the campus radio station, and I believe it was only a half hour once a week. Edward was the (it may have been, even, Eduardo; I think everyone called him Edward, Eduardo) Gonzalez was the host of the radio program. Shortly after I went on to student senate, he asked me one time, cornered me after a meeting and asked me if I would   he had to be out of town and asked me if I would substitute as the host of the radio program. The topic for the radio program was,    Should birth control pills be dispensed to unmarried coeds in the university infirmary?    The guests for the program were Dr.  Donald  Cooper, the longtime director of the University Health Services, and a graduate who was a opposed to it, and a graduate student who was in favor.  I was simply the host. A write-up of that entire program was sent to my parents, who seemed to think that by appearing on it, I was endorsing this whole thing, which they thought was outrageous, and that was sort of the final straw. One humorous aspect of that was that the O   Colly, it may have been the only student senate radio program that ever made the O   Colly   s front page. There were quotes from both the graduate student and from Dr. Cooper. Dr. Cooper had a talent for expressing something in a way that was sure to be quoted. I still remember that his quote about dispensing birth control pills is that we could put them in the bubble gum machines in the Student Union and it wouldn   t change the statistics on unwanted pregnancies on campus at all. (Laughter)  Milligan So that was the big quote that the O   Colly gave.  McGlamery Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I love that one.  Milligan So I   m just   out of curiosity, was he willing to dispense, were they willing to dispense to students   .  McGlamery They did not, no. That was a strict policy against it, and at that time, that would easily have been a bridge too far for the state of Oklahoma. The legislature would have threatened to withhold funding, but they were funding a greater percentage of the university expenses back than they do now. So no, they weren   t doing that.  Milligan I didn   t know if that had moved at any point.  McGlamery No, and I don   t think the radio program I hosted changed that policy.  15  Milligan No? Not even the O   Colly article? (Laughter) So that was the straw that broke the camel   s back with your parents.  McGlamery Yeah   during the school year before I got the job in the Library, I sold office supplies for a downtown office supply store as an outside sales person. During the summers I worked in restaurants; I sold books door to door. There was a company called the Southwestern Company. I think the company still exists, and I think they now include women. I worked for them. It was one of these things where a student sells books and was given the opportunity to recruit other students to sell with him the next year. He gets a percentage, and he helps train those people and so forth.  Milligan The Tupperware model.  McGlamery Yeah, exactly. The first year, between my freshman and sophomore year, I was sent to the Mississippi Delta. I was in the town that I have mentioned in my presentations that last few days, which was a place called Poplarville, Mississippi, which is known as the last known place in which there was a lynching during the civil rights era. I lasted a week, and I left. Went back home and worked at a service station. A slightly humorous aspect of that is that I was asked by the minister of my Baptist Church, my hometown Baptist Church, which was across the street from the service station that I worked at. The church had owned a dilapidated little building, a frame building, on the corner of the half block or so that the church owned. Somebody came up with the bright idea that they were going to make that a youth center. What it really was, was sort of a place where parents with young adolescents could drop their kids off so they could play ping-pong and shuffleboard, and then pick them up three hours later or whatever. No self-respecting thirteen-, fourteen-, fifteen-, sixteen-, let alone a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old was going to be seen anywhere near the place.  I   d go over and basically babysit for three hours a night for three nights a week or something. At the end of the summer, I had to give a report to the church about the program. I get back to campus my sophomore year, and one day I get a manila envelope. It   s from the church, from the pastor of the church, and I thought,    What is this?    I opened it up, and it is signed by the chairman of the board of deacons, that I am licensed to preach in the Baptist Church. I wasn   t ordained, (that   s a different process) but I was licensed to preach. Hmm. When I go back to Collinsville for one weekend, I talked to the pastor and say,    I   m a little confused. I didn   t ask for this. What is this all about?    He said,    Well, you worked hard last summer for us, and we appreciate all you did. We couldn   t afford to pay you, but somebody pointed out that if you wanted to transfer to Baylor or to OBU, if you were licensed to preach, you could go tuition-free. That   s why we did it.    I said,    Thank you. I don   t know that I   ll take you up on that, but thank you.    So that was 16  the motivation. I have at various times in my life had friends who   ve discovered that fact about me and were ungenerous in their comments.  Milligan That you were licensed to preach?  McGlamery Yeah.  Milligan I can   t imagine why, just hearing this much so far. (Laughter) So you basically had to find your way through college after that first year, then.  McGlamery Yeah. The second summer after the fiasco in Mississippi, I went back in part because I felt like I had quit because it was hard, and I didn   t believe in quitting. I went back to sell books the second summer.  Milligan The Mississippi, I just want to clarify, based on what your public talk was that   s on O-State TV, a lot of that was racial tension, it sounds like, just sort of uncomfortableness in the community.  McGlamery Yeah, well, it was more than uncomfortable. They had a right to be uncomfortable because they knew the twenty-three people who had murdered a man.  Milligan It sounds like a strict, strict insider/outsider divide, too.  McGlamery Yeah, very much so, but it was collective guilt that I have never witnessed or even seen anything come close before or since then.     The main income starting my junior year, I finally got a job in the Library. It paid a dollar and a half an hour. I would sometimes take the really weird hours or the less popular hours so that I could actually read or study some during that time. One of the interesting things is that a guy came through one night, and he was a graduate student. I said,    Are you Richard  Guillou ?    He said,    Yes.    I said,    You saved my life at Boy Scout camp. You were an Eagle Scout and kept me from drowning.    He didn   t remember me. I certainly remembered him, and so it was just one of those chance things. I had not really learned to swim and had gone to Boy Scout camp. We had a Scoutmaster who spent the day either eating or sleeping in his tent while the boys did whatever, so we were sort of roughly under the supervision of the senior Scouts.  We went swimming in a creek that was at high levels, spring flooding sort of thing. We stupidly got in there anyway. I didn   t have the knowledge or the swimming skills, and I started drowning. I was, I guess, twelve years old at the time. I still remember that I was drowning, and as I could sort of force myself to get to the surface, my prevailing thought was,    Don   t panic.    I   ve later thought that, you know, I   m sure it had some benefit, but when you think about it, you   re dying, but don   t panic. You   re about to go under for the last time, but don   t panic  (Laughter) Fortunately, Richard  Guillou  17  came along and pulled me out. I hadn   t swallowed enough water that they had to do artificial respiration, but it wasn   t too long before that would have been necessary. Anyway, I   m reunited with the person who saved my life at the Library at OSU. All sorts of things happen in the Library.  Milligan That   s very true. There   s all sorts of stories about people working in the Library. That   s a good one. I like that. So we   re at a point, probably, in our time that it makes sense to get into the FATAG stuff, so maybe tell me how you got involved.  McGlamery Let me ask you this. Do you want to talk about why I was here this weekend, or this last few days?  Milligan Maybe let   s talk a little bit about that, but I don   t think we have to relive the whole thing.  McGlamery Okay.  Milligan I think just the overview and some of the things   I think what is important   .  McGlamery Well, that whole presentation is on video now. It   s on O-State TV, so it   s not, you know   .  Milligan Yeah, I think we   ll be able to go back to the larger story that you all told together, but I think part of that   .  McGlamery Okay, I just wanted to know. I   m not objecting. I don   t care. I just didn   t know if you were going to try to work that in.  Milligan I don   t think that in-depth. I just don   t think we need to get that in-depth...  McGlamery Okay, that   s fine.  Milligan    but it   s reflective. What I think is awesome about that, and even pointing towards it where appropriate, is that it seems to be really reflective of who you were while you were a student here but obviously who you still are, and that experience, like you said, was this watershed moment for you. I   ve heard you say that. I think that you can point freely back and forth to the larger story, and people will be able to get at that without having to   .  McGlamery Okay, that   s fine.  Milligan You can tell me if there   s other things that we need to spend more time on, rather than jumping right into FATAG now. Are there other things that you feel like need to come first or were impactful at a different level?  18  McGlamery This is something that   s amusing, not impactful. It was the tradition for the president of the student association to crown the Homecoming Queen in the middle of the football field on Homecoming. That was Doug   s job, but Doug was engaged. The woman to whom he was engaged, and to whom he   s been married for forty-nine years, objected strenuously to him doing that, so it fell to me. The woman that was the Homecoming Queen and I did not know each other. She was disgusted that she was going to be crowned by a substitute. She probably had other words for me. There may have been other reasons that would have hurt my feelings, so I don   t know. Of course, this being the   60s, she had a beehive hairdo that had enough lacquer to redo somebody   s den, and I had had my hair cut so that I didn   t have hair in my face. I had probably an equivalent amount of hairspray on my hair, so the pictures of us   . The kiss was barely a kiss and not meaningful to either one of us in any sense. The pictures of us, you can see our clothes being blown, and our hair was absolutely still. (Laughs)  Milligan Unruffled in the Oklahoma wind. (Laughter) I didn   t realize that the crown came with a kiss.  McGlamery It did back then, and, again, I may have helped end that tradition. I don   t know. (Laughs) Okay, back to FATAGS. Tell me how you want me to approach this. You know the whole story. I assume you know the timeline with Thomas Altizer   s speech and the fact that the entire Sociology Department resigned, and all of those things. What do you want me to talk about?  Milligan I   d just like to know specifically what your position, what your role, why you joined it, you know, yeah, what your role in it. I think it   s interesting, too, because you have this very official capacity, right? So maybe what   just your personal opinion about it, right? We know the facts, right?  McGlamery Well, let   s be clear. FATAGS   my main impression of FATAGS was that (I think it started on Friday afternoon) some of the people from The Drummer and the O   Colly and so forth would meet in the Student Union and play Bridge and talk. It was not a unified force for anything, okay? It was just a loose collection of people who adopted this quirky name. It was basically those of us in official positions who were mainly behind the protests or involved in the protests, the Speakers Committee, the student senate, student government leaders, and others who were, at least initially. I think it   s fair to say that it was, although it was never intended to be that way, it ended up being de facto rather than being elitist. It was people   this was not people who were radicalized and came forward, you know, electrical engineering students who suddenly decided that they were going to protest not bringing this controversial theologian to campus. This was people who were involved in student government.  19  It was initially the Religious Emphasis Week committee, which consisted of students and faculty members, and they were the ones who felt the heat first. The reaction of the university by banning Altizer was to bring everybody else forward, the student senate and the student government forward, to protest that action. I would defer to people who were actually involved in The Drummer, but my recollection is that event, the Altizer denial, was what really spawned the birth of The Drummer. As more attention was paid to it, it   s one of these things where the situation escalated   . Point-counterpoint as the university reacted, then it drew more people from the sidelines to say   . The banner that flew over the gathering for one of the protests was    No more thought control.    FATAGS put up a version of that to the meeting.     I know for a fact that there were some very conservative kids who nonetheless were offended by the university   s approach on this. We had a lot of kids who attended who I know showed up in photographs, and the FBI probably spent a lot of time trying to identify each of them.  These were just kids who were attracted to the event. There were inevitably some people who just saw that there was something happening on the mall. There was a lot of people standing around, and so they   d go over and stand there, too, to see what was going on. Once the university took that position, the regents got involved. Once the president took that position, the regents got involved, backing up the president, and there were more and more. Then the faculty council (I think that   s the name of it) weighed in. The dean of the school of arts and sciences was a man named James Ralph Scales who had been president of OBU. Dr. Scales was supportive of the ideas of the protests. I don   t recall that he ever formally went on the record for that, but he was clearly supportive, and that did not endear him to the others in the administration of the regents. He subsequently left and became the president of Wake Forest. Interestingly, his daughter Laura was on a committee, a senate committee that I chaired. We had committee members who were students who were not in the student government.  Tragically, she died her sophomore year. She was here for the fall semester, didn   t return from Christmas break, and died of a rare form of cancer midway through the spring. I was one of the pallbearers at her funeral. There were lots of people. I   m sure there are people that would disagree, but in some ways, this became sort of a campus Rorschach Test. Whatever you saw in this controversy was whatever you wanted to see. As a faculty member, if you had other grievances with the university and were upset about things, about how the university was being run, this represented an outlet for that frustration. For students, speaking for myself, I had a very idealistic view of the value of free speech and probably still do, although it   s qualified in some respects. When I became a lawyer, the first two years I was a lawyer, even though I was in private practice, I was an adjunct professor at Marquette Law School and taught Civil Rights and Civil 20  Liberties, first amendment and fourteenth amendment. That shows you how desperate they were to have somebody teach.      For students   and I said I had perhaps an idealistic vision, which was that the whole idea was this competition of ideas. The whole point of the thing is that, okay, if you   and that   s part of why they tried to do this balancing, you know. REW, the same time they invited Altizer, they invited Baptist theologians from Southwestern Baptist Seminary in Ft. Worth. It   s like Sexpo    68. The more controversial ones draw the attention, and the others,    I   ve heard that before. it doesn   t   .    Of course, in the case of Altizer, never materialized because he wasn   t allowed to come.     People tried to figure out how to handle it, and Kamm was   . This was early in Kamm   s term. I think it was in his first year as president, which would have been my sophomore year. Oliver Willham was still president my freshman year. I   m sure that in a conservative state with very conservative regents, he felt enormous pressure to keep things contained.  I think that he, I   m sure, had people whispering in his ear all the time about all of the,    You   ve got to keep these kids under control,    and,    Look what   s happened to campuses all across the country,    and,    We   re not going to have that here,    and so forth and so on. The extreme things such as getting the FBI involved, the state having a special secret agency to deal with student activism and student protests, student radicals, I   m more sympathetic to Kamm now than I was then, except for the fact that then I didn   t know about the FBI. Fifty years later, I   m less charitably disposed toward him than I was fifty years ago when I was a student going through everything. I had some understanding   I thought I had some understanding of the pressures he was under. I think I did. What I didn   t have an understanding of is the measures that he took in response, which I vehemently, vociferously disagree with.  Milligan You mean reporting back   .  McGlamery Yeah, the involvement of both the state and federal government in what was going on on campus, treating it as if it were a crisis of some great magnitude or something. When you check that book, my impression is that the word    communist    appears a number of times. It was a way of guaranteeing that people were going to be incited. To be opposed to something is to call something communist.  Milligan The new publication had just came out on student activism in Oklahoma.  McGlamery Yeah. I attended all the rallies. I supported the issue in the student senate. I attended more than my share of meetings with the administration over that and other issues. There was actually something that started while I was in the student senate that I think was really a good idea, maybe not for the 21  reasons that it was started but it turned out to have a beneficial effect. That was student faculty administrative committees, or SFAs. Whatever issue, you know how federal governments mock, or state government   if they don   t have the wherewithal to address an issue, they   ll appoint a committee to study it, and they   ll study it and study it and study it. Well, on campus, the variation of that was the student faculty administrative committee, except that unlike the legislative efforts, there was an expectation that these groups were actually going to do something. I was on committees with faculty members and administrators, including some very conservative faculty members but very honest, straightforward people.  I remember two (I don   t recall their names immediately) from the engineering school who I thought were terrific. They were obviously very intelligent, but they were very straightforward in making their arguments. They weren   t unnecessarily judgmental. They weren   t caustic. They just would lay it out how they saw it. That whole thinking process and the negotiations that occurred and seeing how some of the administrators handled the situation very well, and others felt that they couldn   t deviate from a particular position even though there were reasonable, rational alternatives. I guess reasonable and rational is a little overdone, redundant. One of the things that that experience and the whole campus protests were the subject of several of the SFA committees I was on was that that ended up being more relevant to me later in my life than a lot of the things I had in the classroom because even today, even though my law practice is part-time, I represent a large public utility in the District of Columbia, negotiating on their behalf with other state governments and state and federal agencies, as well as development   .  A friend of mine who was at the FATAGS reunion, he and I were talking about what I was doing, and he said,    That sounds like what you did when you were president of the student senate.    Yeah, I hadn   t thought of it that way, but it   s true. I did learn a great deal from that process. You   ve probably already talked to the people who had instrumental roles in the whole speaker controversy and everything, but I was a participant but not a leader in that particular   . I ended up, through my role in part because of these SFA committees, being a two-way advocate. I would advocate student position, and as we formed a position in one of these committees, I would be an advocate back to the student senate and to other students about supporting, if I supported, the position that we were taking.  Milligan You mentioned both on and off before we started recording, and a little bit during, that the Wesley Foundation actually was maybe instrumental is the word, maybe it   s just supportive of some of the efforts of some of the FATAGers, that they found maybe some place of motivation toward   .  22  McGlamery Well, first of all, the students that were influenced were Methodist to begin with.  Milligan I guess that   s what I mean. There was a relationship with the Wesley group on campus.  McGlamery Specifically, the two leaders at the time     Milligan The two Wesley   .  McGlamery    Wesley Foundation leaders at the time, I think one was named Carl Caskey, and I don   t remember the name of the other one. They were both, one or both were at the meeting or at the FATAGS reunion. Not sure that that   s true. I haven   t thought this through and thought about it quite in this way.     College students who considered social issues seriously tended to have also come from a religious background because religion was one place that if you wanted to talk where you were taken seriously at almost an adult level when you were still too young to be treated that way anywhere else. So a lot of people in that leadership group I   m sure were leaders in their Methodist youth groups and so forth. It was the heyday of folk music, so they had folk music every Saturday night in the basement of the Wesley Foundation. It was more of an open atmosphere than most people were used to. I really don   t know what was said by those leaders   but they must have encouraged a willingness to question, to explore, and so forth. It was only in retrospect, frankly, that I realized how much   . I knew of its involvement to some extent. There was also a certain amount of involvement coming out of the Newman Center which was the Catholic student organization on campus.  There were several student senators who were Catholic who came from that. They were encouraged, but there was nothing like the number of people and depth of commitment of the leaders. Of course, one of the differences is that the Newman Center was headed by a priest who had responsibility for services at the church and so forth. The Wesley Foundation was not a church. There weren   t religious services, per se, happening, so they had more freedom to focus on other things. As I say, I don   t know that that would have been replicated on any other campus. In part, I attribute it to the fact that this was already a very religious-oriented   that a significant portion, perhaps not even a majority, likely not a majority   . There were plenty of people who just wanted to have fun and drink beer. Some wanted to have fun until they got expelled, couldn   t come back because of their grades, and some found other interests. There was a certain percentage of   students who were serious about social issues at the Wesley Foundation, and they were encouraged rather than discouraged there. They were shown a way in which their religion accommodated that if not demanded it of them, and that had a tremendous effect. 23  Milligan You mentioned earlier, it sounds like that the two Wesleyan leaders at some point were removed or were   .  McGlamery I heard this story at the FATAGS reunion. They were apparently fired by the bishop, by the Methodist bishop, specifically at the request of Dr. Kamm. Dr. Kamm was a Methodist, was apparently very offended that what he saw as a lot of the opposition to his leadership coming from the Methodist student organization on campus. In some ways, the damage was already done. The seeds had been planted. They were growing well. At the point at which the two leaders left, there was already a strong group of students coming that had benefitted from that. That   s just my perception. Again, it would be better to get the view of some other people who were   .  Milligan So I want to shift gears just a little bit. During your discussion in the last couple of days about this road trip to Atlanta and sort of being in Atlanta when Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, that sort of emotional experience and also just a sort of life changing experience to be present culturally in a different place where that was unfolding, I wanted to talk a little bit about when you came back to OSU because I heard you talk a little bit about some of the disappointment of coming back. It really is this profound thing that you were leaving and to come back home and thinking that you   re here and you   ve made it and you   re safe, to find out that there were things on campus that were happening that were in a sense celebrating his death, right?  I want to know a little bit more about your personal thoughts on sort of how those things were happening on campus and how that fit in with this other dynamic. There   s two veins I   m kind of feeling here, and this is any college campus at this time or even now. You have this freedom of speech, right? You have this huge activism that   s sort of like getting momentum and have some push behind it and attention, but then there   s this other side that feels like it   s okay to have these sort of completely counter to that, to toast to Martin Luther King   s assassination or whatever it is. How did you reconcile that as a student coming back, that you   d really sort of put forward your student senate efforts to make this campus a better place, and then had this emotional experience and then this other thing is going on. It just seems like all of this momentum.  McGlamery Because this was in April and I think at the time the school year ended the third week in May, we were near the end of the semester, and there was not any obvious avenue for that to be addressed. I will tell you that I did, during the summer, conceive of a plan to sue the university in connection with use of university facilities by discriminatory organizations. I went with it. I talked to several people about it, several of whom were adamantly opposed, thought I would just release the hounds of hell by doing that. Others were 24  mildly interested but certainly not convinced. That plan died after we couldn   t find a lawyer for it. African American student senator at the time named Jesse Mingilton from Tulsa, I talked to Jesse, and we visited with a couple of lawyers, one in particular who had been involved in some civil rights things. I think he viewed it as too trivial, not worth his time.  I think there was concern that   the benefits would not outweigh the blowback that you   d get. You need to focus your efforts on something else. I must say that in hindsight, I agree with that, but at the time it seemed like   . Here at the university   there are all of these groups on campus, some of them social organizations, some of them other types of organizations that are discriminatory, yet they allow those student groups to use the meeting rooms in the Student Union without charge. The university is subsidizing this, in effect. That was one of the things that, you know. I came back with a personal awareness, but it wasn   t something that was contagious, or I was particularly trying to   . I really wasn   t trying to evangelize people. I was trying to figure out if something seriously could be done. I probably, if it had been a better idea, I would have approached the rather small African American groups on campus and present them with the idea, although there was a   .  As I recall Jesse and my thinking, frankly it was mainly me, and I persuaded Jesse to come along. I think that I realized that it was probably important to have a white kid involved in spearheading this rather than an African American kid at the time, or an African American group. If I had actually carried through on all of that, I would have probably been absolutely the least popular student on campus, but I felt strongly that this was   . I was newly sensitive to the indignities and worse confronted by black students and was trying to figure out what to do about it. I   ve just confessed something that I   ve told very few people, but that was one thing that I considered. As I say, the idea was dropped, not because I decided on my own that it was a bad idea. It was that others were not persuaded it was a good idea, and it couldn   t go forward.  Milligan That   s a pretty powerful response for a student to devise, though. I don   t think many students would think,    Well, I   ll just sue the university,    right? I think it   s also reflective of your interactions on an administrative level with the university. You were involved, yes, but you were also involved at a higher level to negotiate and mediate some of these larger issues. So I wonder if even sort of having this role in the student government association in the senate and having those roles with the student faculty administration, were you frustrated with that lack of response from what you knew from that insider perspective?  McGlamery My biggest failure, (I   ve probably got many, the competition among my failures) a significant failure was not to get better acquainted with the   I 25  wasn   t trying to break down the door and force myself into any of the predominately African American organizations. It would have been important that I not push an agenda that they didn   t view as beneficial to them or that they viewed as being beneficial but not worth the cost. I was friends with a number of the African American students. Melvin Wade, I don   t know if you know who he is. I asked him at the reunion, I said,    Melvin, I   ve got a question. I   ve wondered for almost fifty years. You twice told me that I was a radical in a conservative   s body. What did you mean?    (Laughs) A radical in a conservative   s body. What   s a conservative   s body look like? He said,     I just meant you   re a white guy who looked like you did and yet you were friends with me and you were friends with   .    Race had a different effect on me, too.  An embryonic part of that was my departure from the Young Republicans because I perceived, even without the impact of a trip like being in Atlanta when King was assassinated, that a lot of what was being advocated by what I viewed as this extreme right wing group was racist. I didn   t think there was any question that there was a turn to an agenda that was effectively anti-black and sometimes worded in such a way that there was not much hiding that. My departure from fundamentalist religion and sort of the final break from that was in part because I viewed, despite the ideals and the verbiage, I viewed that evangelical fundamentalist Protestantism had an uncomfortable tinge of racism to it. All of those things were coalescing. I didn   t find an outlet for   I didn   t make much headway on those issues, but I had told myself that if there was one that was important enough, I was willing to be kicked out of the senate or whatever, if I found something that I thought made sense and was important. The main thing is I didn   t   I think the mistake was that I didn   t keep sufficiently in touch with the black students to know what their biggest concerns were.  It   s interesting talking to those that have come back to campus. They felt isolated. Several of them described their experiences on campus at that time as just being miserable. I doubt there were many white students asking them how they could help. I was sent as student senate president to meet with the most powerful person on campus, who was Henry Iba. My parents, when they were students at OSU, or Oklahoma A M, in the late   30s lived close to the old gymnasium, and they could hear Iba yelling. When it was hot and they had their windows open, (they were a block and a half away) they could hear Iba yelling at the players on the court. I was sent over to talk to Iba about allegations of racial prejudice against some of his black basketball players. I had never been particularly intimidated by   . I had been concerned but not intimidated by meeting with the regents, with the president of the university, with anybody else. I really had to give myself a pep talk to confront Henry Iba with that accusation. (Laughs) I figured I would be bounced out of his office. I remember his attitude as being 26  obligingly polite. He was clearly not happy. He tolerated my presence, but it was clear that it was barely. (Laughs)  Milligan What did you say to him?  McGlamery I said that there was concern, there was a particular player or players that there were stories of the way he treated them, and that there was concern that the base was race, that he wouldn   t have treated white players the same way, he did not treat white players the same way. As I recall, there   s one player in particular. He, of course, denied it, offered some explanations. I found the explanations not definitive, but there was no place to go with it. I was convinced nobody in the university was going to have any interest whatsoever in letting the student senate make accusations against this basketball god who had been revered in the university for decades. It would have been like Penn State going after Joe Paterno, you know. I think Iba at Oklahoma State was revered probably as much or more than Joe Paterno was revered at Penn State. Of course, the charge was not criminal, not anywhere near the issues at Penn State, but I mentioned him only in terms of somebody who had an extremely high status in the university. He was gracious. He, I think, coached the 1968 Olympic basketball team, and he didn   t coach that much longer. He was up in years. It was sort of ironic that my only encounter with him was, again, over race.  Milligan So you must   ve already had the sense that the university wasn   t going to take anything on, anyway, but yet you still chose to go and confront him.  McGlamery Yes, the senate asked me to. Nobody had volunteered; I was the president. I don   t know if we   d adopted a resolution or somebody had suggested that we needed to talk to him before we adopted a resolution, expressing the views of the senate about it. I either, feeling like it was my responsibility, either volunteered or everybody said,    Not me     (Laughs)  Milligan Last man standing. That   s really interesting. We   re at an hour and forty-five minutes, so I   m not going to keep you. That was a little bit longer than I said I was going to keep you, but is there anything that we missed that you want to talk about? Is there anything else that you want to cover?  McGlamery The only other thing I   d mention is an observation that for both the student senate and for the activism concerning the free speech, there were a group of faculty members who ended up being advisors to the students. Didn   t direct but were advisors. Interestingly, my recollection is that they were basically all senior faculty, and these were people that had been at the university for a couple of decades or so. Maybe because they were senior and tenured, they felt they could do so, but there were some distinguished faculty members who donated their time and would talk to students, would meet with them, and not in any plotting way but sometimes just to provide insights about the 27  way to get things done in the university and the way that the university worked and the reaction of   . I remember several people, including Richard Cummins who was an electrical engineering professor who was a great counselor for the student senate for a number of years.  There   s one other humorous story that I will tell you. Yesterday, I met the police chief for the campus, and I told him this story. As a new student senator, I was on a student faculty administrative committee, which was the traffic appeals court. It consisted of some administrator, another electrical engineering professor faculty member, the chief of University Police, and me as a student representative. Once every month, students would come in, and they would have filed to appeal traffic tickets, basically, that they got on campus. On one occasion, a student came in, and he said, (in my memory, he was this tall, sort of slow-speaking guy) he said,    I got two tickets. I   m only here to appeal one of them. I agree about the wrong turn, but I   m upset about the parking violation.       What   s the story?     He said,    Well, on night       and he gave the story about how he had made an illegal turn. The police came up for him, he pulled over, and he pulled onto a campus parking lot. The police officer wrote him a ticket for the illegal turn and wrote him up for not having a permit to park on that parking lot  (Laughs) Oh, we could barely keep from laughing while he was there. He stepped out of the room for our decision, and the chief of police put his head down, and the rest of us just totally lost it. He came back in, and we told him very seriously that after considering his case we decided that we agreed that the ticket for parking was improper. Anyway, that   s   . (Laughter)  Milligan Oh I   m so sorry, but I agree with the police chief. That   s a good one. Was that it? It   s been really interesting. I   ve learned a lot. I   m glad that you   .  McGlamery I hope I haven   t been too irreverent or anything   .  Milligan No  Not at all. Absolutely reflective of what we were talking about.  McGlamery Okay.  -------  -------
